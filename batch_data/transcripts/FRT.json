Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division Operator : Welcome to the Federal Realty Investment Trust First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Yolanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Kristina Lennox. Ms. Lennox, you may begin. Kristina Lennox : Good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dawn Becker, Jim Taylor, Jeff Berkes, Chris Weilminster, and Melissa Solis. These and other members of our management team are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information contained in our forward-looking statements, and we could give no assurance that these expectations will be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial conditions and results of operation. These documents are available on our website at www.federalrealty.com. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter 2014 results. Don? Donald C. Wood: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. The 2014 first quarter was another very strong one for the trust with reported FFO per share of $1.21, an all-time quarterly record for us and 6% higher than last year's first quarter. Those earnings are strong and were made possible because of continued strong tenant demand and disciplined execution of rent start dates despite a particularly nasty and extended winter season this year, all the way up and down the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Not only did FFO per share of $1.21 grow 6%, but same-store growth came in at 2.9% when excluding redevelopment, and 3.4% when including it, despite a quarter in which gross snow removal costs were $5.5 million higher than last year and more than $9 million in total. Those costs are reflected in rental expenses with a corresponding recoverable portion included in tenant recoveries. Roughly 80% to 85% is expected to be recovered. It was a crazy and long winter. And the net impact of that excessive show cost was more than $0.01 per share hit to FFO and about 100 basis point hit to same-store growth. I'm particularly pleased with these results given not only the weather, but the marketing and other noise that is and will be part of our numbers all year long related to the big developments coming online this year. Let's dig into the results a bit and start with leasing. Leasing demand and productivity that built on last year's efforts was evident during 2014 first quarter, where we completed 78 deals, 71 of them for 328,000 square feet of comparable space at average rents of $31.84, 18% more than the $27.01 per foot representing the last year of the former lease. Both leases with new tenants and renewals of existing tenants were profitable and grew at 16% and 19%, respectively. This was really a continuation of the strength that we saw through much of 2013, and that sentiment and production feels as though it will continue in the next few quarters. Though not necessarily in the high teens like 18%, but strong nonetheless. A few really good deals in the quarter in each of our major operating regions really drove the results, including a CVS renewal at Wildwood Shopping Center in Bethesda, a new Nordstrom Rack replacing Office Depot at Mercer Mall in New Jersey and some powerful small shop leasing at Westgate in San Jose, California. In any event, a strong leasing quarter and an optimistic leasing forecast. Now let's look at occupancy, which, on both on a percentage leased and physical occupancy basis, remained very strong in the quarter at 95.6% and 94.7%, respectively. Both of those numbers are down a tick or 2 from year end, which is not at all unusual in the first quarter, but higher than last year's first quarter, and in fact, higher than in any first quarter since 2007 and 2008. Those levels won't change very much this year, in fact, they'll probably go down a bit as we proactively re-tenant some anchor spaces for better long-term stability and profitability. Let me move on now to the development pipeline and start with the good work being done at Assembly Row in Somerville, Massachusetts. First, the planning and documentation with Partners HealthCare on the 12-acre former IKEA site is going extremely well, and we hope to have fully-executed documents completed over the summer to allow for a planned construction start by Partners this fall. In a piece of very good news, the deal now contemplates development rights for 900,000 square feet of office space, up from 700,000, making room for Partners' 4,700 plus employees moving in over several years beginning as early as 2016. We continue to work through the accompanying retail plan on that site, which we would own. That investment is expected to include a service retail destination including a drug store, a health club and additional food and service alternatives. We're estimating something in the range of a $35 million investment and about 110,000 square feet, but we'll report with more specificity on this piece and the entire Partners transaction once all the documentation is done. On the other end of the Assembly site, we're proud to report that 97% of the retail space in our Phase 1 development is committed. That's 46 out of 51 outlet, restaurant and entertainment tenants that will open beginning now with the AMC Theater and then throughout the summer in anticipation of a full lineup in the fall. Leases executed in this first quarter included J.Crew, PUMA, Orbis, Motherhood Maternity, Aveda Salon and Sugar Heaven; while real estate committee approved-deals included Kenneth Cole, Express, Carter's, Oshkosh and Francesca's. The first residential move-ins have begun in AvalonBay's apartments, and external construction on the block 2 office building is nearing completion. We're getting close on some office leasing in that building and as I noted, are virtually done with the retail lease in its base. The future looks very bright for Assembly Row and I hope that we'll be talking about another phase in the not-too-distant future. Let's come down to coast a bit to Rockville, Maryland where Pike & Rose is rapidly taking shape and where lease-up on the first residential buildings is well underway and has gotten off to a very good start. Currently, 50 of the 174 apartments in the first residential building called PerSei are leased at net effective rates -- rents, slightly ahead of our expectations at this point. This is particularly noteworthy since until recently, the weather around here has been just awful and the site is full [Audio Gap] construction and frankly, it feels very much like a construction site. Lease-up will continue throughout the year and into next with the first move-ins expected this June, and then transition into residential leasing for the second residential building. That's the high rise tower called Pallas that will begin leasing up next spring. On the retail side, Phase 1 lease-up is nearly complete at 92%, and most of the remainder of that lease-up is in the base of the 300-unit high-rise residential building, which doesn't deliver until 2015. To give you an idea of what the merchandising in that first phase will feel like, consider that the iPic theater, Tanzy restaurant and Sport & Health health clubs will be above the ground level retail, that will include tenants like Gap, Gap Kids, City Sports, Francesca's, Del Frisco's Grille, Summer House, ShopHouse and others, well, you get the idea. And in terms of 80,000 feet of office in this first phase, while I still can't report on a signed office lease at this point, I can tell you that we're well down the road on lease documentation with a great credit for more than half of the available space in the project. Given the way the first phase has been going, we're anxious to figure out the next phase, where we'll significantly lengthen the retail street and add to this vibrant and sophisticated environment that's so lacking in the Rockville area. We're well underway to designing and pricing out the next phase, which will approximate $200 million and we expect to announce it with greater specificity later this year. Out on the West Coast, internal and common area construction will be finished up at Misora in the next 60 to 90 days and leasing has been going extremely well. At present 170, or more than 80%, of the 212 apartments have been leased at rates that slightly exceed our expectations. We expect to be stabilized in terms of both leasing and occupancy by the end of the year. Similarly, in Southern California, construction on The Pointe is well underway and also on time and on budget. We'll be featuring The Pointe, as well as future phases of our entire development and redevelopment pipeline at the ICSC convention in Las Vegas in a couple of weeks. I think I'll stop there in terms of my prepared remarks and just want to express -- end by expressing my enthusiasm for both our continued strong core results quarter-after-quarter, as well as the inevitable delivery of some of the finest retail and mixed-use products available anywhere. I look forward to walking it with many of you later in the year and talking about it at NAREIT in June and elsewhere. Now, let me turn it over to Jim Taylor for his remarks before we open the lines up to your questions in a few minutes. James M. Taylor: Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. This quarter represented another record for the Trust in terms of total revenue, POI and FFO per share. Even with relatively stable occupancy, the drag of snow and increased expense associated with bringing our development projects online, our portfolio continued to deliver impressive bottom line growth, both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. And, as Don importantly highlighted, our strong leasing rollover continues to set us up well for the intermediate term. That core performance, taken with the successful integration of The Grove and Brook 35 acquisitions, the additional redevelopment activity at East Bay Bridge, Flourtown, and Hollywood and the substantial progress that Don highlighted this quarter towards the successful delivery of 2 important drivers of future growth, Pike & Rose and Assembly, continue the momentum of our balanced business plan. Now turning to the details. Rental income increased $13.6 million or approximately 9% over the prior year quarter. Most of this, or $9.7 million, was attributable to the same-center growth, including redevelopment and the successful integration of The Grove and Brook 35, as well as Darien. The balance of the increase is attributable to higher snow recoveries due to the polar vortex impact in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Other property income, which includes term fees, was essentially flat year-over-year. Looking at rental expenses and POI margin, we saw an increase of $7.6 million, approximately $5.1 million of which was snow. Adjusted for snow, our POI margin remained stable at 70%. As Don highlighted in his remarks, when you look at our same-center portfolio, which represents 96% of our overall property operating income, our same-center growth in POI would've been 100 basis points higher if you adjust for snow. I think we've said enough about snow but the bottom line is that the performance of the core portfolio and the acquisitions that we made continue to be strong, even with relatively stable occupancy. And importantly, our leasing rollover continues to demonstrate strong forward growth as those tenants will take occupancy over the next several quarters. Moving down, we also maintained strict control on G&A, which remains flat when you adjust for the transfer taxes and other costs associated with the closing of The Grove and Brook 35. Interest expense declined $4.3 million due primarily to the overall lower borrowing rate that we achieved through last year's refinancings, which reduced our weighted average rate from 5.5% to 4.8%, while substantially increasing our weighted average maturity. Bottom line, total FFO increased 10.4% to $81.8 million for the quarter and FFO per share increased 6.1% to $1.21 per share, as we continue to match fund our development activity with an appropriate balance of long-term debt and equity issued under our ATM. Again, all of this with an eye towards producing stable, consistent long-term earnings growth with maximum flexibility given volatility that can happen from time-to-time in the capital markets. Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we accessed the ATM for $50 million at a weighted average share price of $111.35. In connection with the acquisitions of The Grove and Brook 35, we issued $65 million of OP units and also assumed $68 million of secured debt. We ended the quarter with $76 million of cash and nothing drawn on our $600 million revolver, leaving us plenty of capacitive and flexibility to fund the balance of our expected development spend this year of approximately $250 million. Our debt to market cap was 24% and debt-to-EBITDA, a strong 5.4x. From an acquisition pipeline perspective, we remain very active and are negotiating a few opportunities on an off-market basis. While we cannot handicap which, if any, of these situations will occur, I would be disappointed if we did not close some of them. They are high-quality assets that would fit well with our portfolio. We are also evaluating a few marketed opportunities but have observed significant cap rate compression for those deals. Now turning to outlook. We reaffirm our guidance range of $4.86 to $4.93 a share. As discussed on our last call, we expect our occupancy to dip slightly during 2014 as we roll larger anchor spaces such as of the OfficeMax and Pacific Sales at East Bay Bridge, the Loehmann's spaces at Friendship and Crow Canyon, Kohl's at Melville, Staples at Quince Orchard, Bally's at Governor and others. Our leasing team has done a phenomenal job of re-tenanting these spaces and driving better long-term deals for the Trust. In the current year, this rollover and associated downtime as we replace these tenants will cause some drag on our same-store numbers, particularly in the second and third quarters. However, the strength of the core will continue to be the largest driver of our growth. On a same-store basis, including redevelopment, we still expect our NOI growth for the year to approach 4% even this with the rollover drag and the impact of snow this quarter. On an FFO basis, we expect our growth to be between 6% to 7% for the year, which again is truly remarkable as we will incur approximately $0.13 to $0.15 of bottom line drag in 2014, associated with the marketing demolition costs and multifamily lease-up that we have discussed in prior quarters. This year, from a timing perspective, we expect to deliver approximately $350 million of development and redevelopment. We are on time and on budget. As Don highlighted, those deliveries include our $75 million investment in Misora; buildings 11 and 12 at Pike & Rose, which represent approximately $125 million of investment, we'll open in phases this year; Phase 1 retail of Assembly Row, which represents approximately $150 million of investment with the office delivering later in 2015. As Don highlighted in his remarks, those projects are substantially leased and we'll bring us significant value both in the near term, as well as over time. We couldn't be more pleased with the execution of our operations, leasing and development teams upon our balanced business plan, which sets us up for many years of continued growth. We look forward to a productive leasing conference at ICSC in just a few weeks and further to seeing many of you in early June at NAREIT. With that, operator, I'd like to turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Schmidt. Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I wonder if you could describe the marketing efforts that you're going to pursue for the opening of Phase 1 at Assembly Row. And I know you've done some events there just to increase awareness, have you measured that awareness by the Boston consumer? Donald C. Wood: Yes, Craig, let me start and see if anybody wants to add on. The one thing that we decided last year is that we were not going to do a one big blowout party from a marketing perspective, a one big grand opening here. And that ties to the type of center this is. We're starting the 2 big entertainment anchors, the theater is already open, by the way. And Legoland is opening shortly, a couple of weeks, they'll be there. And then throughout the summer time, there is a long list of tenants that open up, with the final tenants in that first phase opening up in the fall. So our marketing kind of mirrors that. It takes us through -- it takes events all the way through. If you remember, we spent a lot of time and money bringing events to the area, including last year's show, whatever it was called... Unknown Executive : Riverfest in Cavalia. Donald C. Wood: Cavalia last year, to get people accustomed with the area. What we're finding is great receptions. I'd be -- I'm really happy that not only the local community but a broader draw is finding their way into what is now infrastructure that is built, and real streets, it's not fake. There's a reason to drive by them, these are commuter streets now. And so the Riverfest and the other marketing events that we've been throwing have been getting great acceptance from the community, which all kind of sets us up pretty well to a strong fall. Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, and then just on a really big picture basis, how much more is there to do at Santana Row? Donald C. Wood: On a really big picture basis, lots. And here's what I mean by that. It's not only the end of the street, which will be office product and will be retail product, but you know there's additional residential product on the existing site. But then, we've got tied up and I think Jeff Berkes is on the phone, we've got tied up 12 acres directly adjacent, that's a big project. And whether we're able to get that entitled and done and built or not, we'll see, but it's structured in a pretty low risk way for us, in that it's a lease and in fact, it's not even ours if we don't want it to be, if we don't get it entitled, which is just critical. But we could be talking about an incremental $400 million, $500 million to put on and around Santana, very carefully over the next 5, 7 years. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Schaffer. Andrew Schaffer : Can you talk about the percentage of restaurants in your portfolio today versus your historic average and have you seen a material shift in leasing toward restaurants? Donald C. Wood: Yes, I've talked about this before and it ties into our strategy and what we kind of believe in. And we do clearly use restaurants as an anchor in our portfolio. Today, if you broadly define restaurants to include the Starbucks of the world and anything that effectively is food-driven, x the supermarkets, our number is something like 12%. Unknown Executive : A little bit higher, about 15%. Donald C. Wood: 15%, and that's a very broad definition of restaurants. Now specifically, when you think of a restaurant as a draw or a group of restaurants on a draw, that's a much smaller number, more like 7% or 8%. But we do that purposely and frankly, I think we've gotten pretty good at identifying the right restaurants, the right operators, the right mix, if you will, of all of them. And we consider that in that restaurant business, we expect to lose 2 out of 10, if you will, before those leases are up, and we figure that into our underwriting. So that's how we think about that business. It's a very important anchor to us, and it's actually not a subsidized anchor, which is my favorite part of it, as opposed to a department store to a mall business or even a grocery store to our business. Andrew Schaffer : And then in regards to Somerville, can you break out the demand from full-price tenants versus outlet tenants? Christopher J. Weilminster: We're just doing outlet tenants so there's really not a demand... Donald C. Wood: At Assembly, specifically. Christopher J. Weilminster: At Assembly Row, yes, if that is your question. It is an outlet. The soft goods tenants that we will have in Assembly Row are outlet tenants, so they will not be full priced, we have drawn the line on that. Donald C. Wood: Was that your question? Andrew Schaffer : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Morgan. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : You mentioned for the marketed deals that you've been looking on the acquisition market that you've seen cap rate compression. I mean, cap rates, it's not exactly -- cap rates have never been really high for your types of products, I was just -- maybe see if you could provide a little bit of color there where -- how much have you seen over the past 6 months or so and what kind of numbers are you talking about? James M. Taylor: Well, Jeff, you can certainly chip in here but, Paul, where we may have seen some deals getting close to 5 or around 5, we're now seeing deals clearly in the 4s and in some instances. The low 4s for kind of core in-fill retail properties. So over the last, I'd say, 6 to 12 months, we've seen further compression. Jeffrey S. Berkes: Yes, Paul, I agree with Jim. Definitely for the better stuff on the West Coast that's fully marketed and institutional quality, piercing 5 is where things have headed and seem to be staying for a bit. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : And then just a couple things on Santana. I mean, a little bit bigger picture, I guess, as you think about the future phases, the office and then especially as you go across the street with the new site, how do you think about ownership structure for those phases? And this is from kind of from the perspective of diversification and concentration risk, is it as strategic to own everything you do across the street as it is things that are on the row there, because obviously, it will get to be a very big chunk of your overall investment? Donald C. Wood: No, it's a big consideration. Let me start there and Jeff, you can finish up. Let me actually start with the end of the street. The one thing that it's really important to remember about our developments over phases is that a lot of people keep thinking of Santana and things that we've owned for a long time as developments, but they're not, they're stable shopping centers. And when you look at Santana Row in particular, that is probably one of the most stable shopping centers in the entire portfolio. And it -- while geographically it is obviously all in one spot, it is diversified, not only in terms of the retail itself but also with the larger financial base there. So when we think about office at the end of the street, I can tell you we'll absolutely think about partnering with some money on the -- to take some of the risk off the table on the office at the end of the street. What I will also say that if we can't come to a deal where we think -- if we think we're giving away too much, we will do it ourselves at the end of the street, simply because the balance of it is a very stable shopping center already. And so that incremental decision is just that, it's an incremental decision. Having said that, your point with respect to geographic concentration is not lost, but the company really has grown a ton since we talked about each additional phase. And when you think about what has happened to the market cap of the company, it is still a much smaller part of geographic concentration than it's been historically. So that combination of 2 things, I just want you to know we do look at its height [ph], closely, but I could see us going either way. In terms of across the street, we're really early on. But Jeff, you want to talk that through a little bit? Jeffrey S. Berkes: Yes, don't know that I have a whole lot to add to what you said, Don. But one thing, Paul, we don't know exactly where we're headed across the street yet. We have a lot of work to do there with the city and the community and all that kind of thing to figure out ultimately what we're going to be able to get entitled. One of the thoughts is to obviously put a significant residential component on that site. And when you step back and kind of look at where you can invest in residential in particular, long-term, it's hard not to be real bullish on owning residential in Silicon Valley. As you know, from living here, it's just very, very difficult to get residential built and then entitled in an area where there's effectively very little remaining land and a lot of long-term upward pressure on NOI from residential properties. So yes, I think on the office, we're obviously thinking through everything Don said we are. On the residential, maybe not so much, just because of the long-term prospects. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Great, and then just lastly on Santana. It sounds like you might be losing Loring Ward, which is one of the bigger tenants in your other office property there. Remind me that came on at a pretty soft time in the market, is that upside potential? Jeffrey S. Berkes: Loring Ward has been a great tenant here for 10 years and the principals that run Loring Ward are great people, they've got a great company and we would've liked to have been able to keep them. We just couldn't accommodate them and there's a lot of demand for the office space here at Santana Row and the economics just didn't work to figure out a way to accommodate them. So yes, I think, ultimately, there's clearly upside between their contract rent and market rent, and we're not really concerned at all about backfilling the space. Donald C. Wood: But Paul, you do bring up a great point that way. We have found that the office demand at Santana, particularly over the past couple of years, 2 or 3 years, has grown disproportionately. We don't have any space there and we would have loved to have kept Loring Ward, as Jeff said, but we just couldn't, we didn't have the space to be able to keep them. And they wanted to stay badly but we didn't have the space to be able to keep them. So that goes in part into our thinking too, about how to really continue that part of this business to create the place that Santana Row is truly a common, that is the center of the valley. Jeffrey S. Berkes: Paul, again, from being out here, how important an amenitized office experience is to the people that work at the companies out here. And like Don said, over the past few years, Jan and I in particular, in talking to the people that run the businesses here at Santana Row have just seen incredible affinity for wanting to be in this type of environment. Their employees love it. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Actually, sticking with Santana Row, I'm just curious, this is for you, Jeff. On the Winchester site, it may require something of a complex answer to an easy question but do the ground lease terms that you guys signed there necessitate a certain mix or density or even timing of construction that might make the development ambitious? I don't know if there's a way you can kind of contrast your plans there versus Santana in terms of density and mix? Jeffrey S. Berkes: Well, there some timing hurdles in terms of what we need to do to entitle the site, Jeff, but beyond that, there's a lot of flexibility in what we can do. And like Don said earlier, if we can't entitle it the way we want to entitle it, we're not obligated forever over there. So I mean, without getting into a lot of specifics that really probably aren't appropriate, I can't say whole heck of a lot more than that, but I think that answers your question, right? Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Yes, it does. And I understand it's early on. And then I guess, maybe switching back to Pike & Rose and Assembly, are you guys able to talk a little more specifically about the pace and price of the shop space retail, leasing and maybe how concessions such as like TIs, kick outs or free rents have fared versus expectation? Christopher J. Weilminster: I think we're very pleased with the outcome of where it's going to go, and I think we're very bullish on these deal structures that we have in place at the Assembly to take advantage of the momentum building there. I'm very optimistic that we're going to see some good percentage around payment over the years as this center matures and as we have more density. Having Partners and 4,700-plus employees there in a couple of years really creates a great captive audience for the restaurants that we're putting in, the entertainment uses. And as it relates to Pike & Rose, I think those deal structures are more comparable to what we've seen in the DC area. They're at very strong rents and I think if the sales -- if we have the sales success that we anticipate, we're also going to see the potential for percentage rent there as well. So we're very -- from a leasing standpoint, very pleased. I don't know if Don has anything else to add. Donald C. Wood: The only thing I'd say, Jeff, is I will give you some more detail on that. I don't want to do it this quarter yet, I'd like us to get tenants moved in. I'd like to move that process along regularly, the way we're doing and -- but as we get into the fall, I will give more detail on kind of where we are on rents, where we are, where we see things overall. But the guidance in terms of the overall returns are sticking. And so, you can get a pretty good idea of our initial thoughts. But again, I'll have more on that as we get them open and into the fall. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And just one last question, can you remind me why, I guess, why you guys are making the effort at Union Square in Somerville? It's a small project and I guess, I'm wondering, is it about sort of amortizing your city relationships? Or is it something that actually has a much bigger, longer-term possibility than I guess we're thinking about? Donald C. Wood: Let me -- it's probably the latter, and I'll tell you why. There's a couple of things : first of all, I have no idea whether it's going to be us. It's down to a few people and having the productive city relationships, as you can imagine, is both a good thing and a bad thing. And so we'll know more as to whether we play a role there or not in the coming months, but we don't know that answer today. I will tell you that as a -- for being here as long as we have, our team, and seeing what Bethesda Row was, and Bethesda Row is, and how that came across and the value that was created there, there are a lot of similarities in Union Square. There's a lot of similarities. And so the ability to kind of piece meal that together and create something that just would be amazing for the constituents there and also be very rewarding in terms of our value created, it's appealing, plus we have our best team in terms of that type of product sitting right there with Briggs in charge. So when you kind of look at it all together, we looked at Union Square as something very desirable. We'd love to have the opportunity to do that and hope we get the chance to. Operator : Our next question is from Christy McElroy. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Jim, just when you thought you said enough about snow [ph], I'm going to ask you about snow [ph]. Regarding the 100-basis point impact in the quarter, Don, I think you talked about an 80% to 85% expected to be recovered. Did you book all of those recoveries in Q1? And that was, that difference was the 100 basis points? Or should we be thinking about some of those recoveries occurring in Q2 or Q3? I'm just trying to get a sense for how to think about the recovery rate for the balance of the year and sort of what caused that 15% to 20% of leakage? James M. Taylor: Well, what causes the leakage is the fact that we have assets that don't all have net leases, whether they have office uses or residential uses and in certain circumstances we have caps [ph]. We do look at our expense recoveries on an annual basis, but almost all that impact is in, from a drag perspective, is in the first quarter. We will have a higher recovery rate for the balance of the year, but unlike some points made by others, the impact of that increase in the recovery rate for the balance of the year is marginal. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then with the promotion of Chris Weilminster to EVP, Real Estate and Leasing, can you talk a little bit about any changes to the split of responsibilities at the executive level? Donald C. Wood: Yes, I can. What has become apparent over the years -- I hate to say nice things about Weilminster while he's sitting right here. I am going to look in the other direction, Christy, as I say it. But what's become apparent is that Chris is more than a real good leasing guy. He is clearly an executive in the company that gets involved with other things including a hotel deal that we're trying to do in the second phase of Pike & Rose, for example, including the office deals that we work through at Pike & Rose, including, strategically, what we do with our assets. And basically, this promotion, from my point of view, is a recognition of what he's grown-up to be effectively. And I thought it was important to have that recognized externally, as well as internally. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : So no changes to any other -- any of the other roles on the team? Donald C. Wood: The other executive team roles? No. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right, exactly. Okay. Got you. And then, just a quick follow-up on the restaurant question, how do you think about the leasing to sort of entrepreneurs versus national and regional restaurant operators? And is there any differences in how the leases are structured? Donald C. Wood: Well, let's -- let me talk to that broadly, and let's see where Chris wants to go. There are better financial deals usually, on the face, with the local entrepreneurs than there are with the big national retailers. That's all about leverage, not much different than any retail category, general comment. Secondly, it's all about the mix. And so, it's really important -- when I think of restaurants, I'm not talking about using restaurants as an anchor, as an anchor for all the national chains, that's -- that wouldn't accomplish, in our view, the goal we want. But a national chain like a Yard House or somebody like that with local entrepreneurs, as we're doing up in Assembly with a Papagayo that should open up this month for Pete\u2019s sake, who's great locally known. That mix creates the impact to the anchor for the tenancy that we want. And when it comes down to the thing of the individual structures, I just gave you a kind of an overall. But each deal is a negotiation and each deal is our risk-adjusted guess, if you will, educated, I hope, with respect to what they're going to do in sales, what they're going to do in profitability and what the appropriate share is for us. Christopher J. Weilminster: And the only thing I would add, Don, to that, is that we love the local restaurateurs because they're able to modify their menu on a daily basis to give the consumers what they want. So it adds a very good dynamic and a unique experience to our customers as we try and give them more reasons to come shop our centers versus the competition, And that's what we find in the local guys, much more so than the chains, which have to go up a whole hierarchy of decision-making before they can change one item on the menu. So the combination of both, as Don says, really gives us a powerful mix. Operator : We have a question from Jason White. Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : I just had a quick question on your resi portfolio. Do you guys keep a metric that's kind of same-store NOI metric for your -- for the resi? Donald C. Wood: I'm sure we do. I don't have it right here. As resi becomes a bigger number, it's not necessarily becoming a bigger and bigger part of the portfolio, that said we are always going to be a retail company. But it is becoming 7%, 8%, and sometimes 9% of our total base. In 3 years it will be $1 billion company. And so we're going to go through and think about our reporting on resi and see if we can maybe include in the 8-K some additional information that way on it. I don't have it right here and I don't know if any of our... James M. Taylor: Jason, we look at it asset-by-asset in our quarterly reviews and we've got different types of resi within the portfolio. We've got some older resi, some more what I call B+ resi and then we have the higher-end mixed-use. I'll tell you that across-the-board, the performance has been very strong. We haven't seen, for example, in our DC portfolio, some of the softness that I think some of the other multifamily folks have seen that have assets more downtown or in the Crystal City submarkets. I think part of that is also reflected in the good lease-ups so far that we've seen on PerSei. So as Don pointed out, we don't do it as a portfolio yet, but certainly as it becomes a more significant part, we will consider that. Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay, and then just one more question on Pike & Rose. You have quite a number of entitlements remaining on the property, and I'm just wondering what Phase 1 has kind of taught you about what Phase 2, and maybe beyond, what the demand looks like? So before you were obviously cautious about how much you were going to build out in the near term but do you have a better idea on that, now that you've started to build out and lease some of the space? Donald C. Wood: That's a great question, Jason, and yes, particularly as it relates to retail demand. There's a lot more retail demand than we're able to provide in this first phase. And so very anxious to kind of continue on that experience and create enough retail stuff there to be able to give us the experience that we're looking for. I'm very happy there. In terms of the residential, we're just, as I say, we're just kind of getting started, and so far, so good. The real key there from my perspective will be what happens in the Big Tower and that will be a 2015 -- we'll have a lot of information there. But enough so that we are real comfortable that the second phase, which will be much more heavily retail, hopefully include a hotel, and I think it will. We're real close on a deal there. And then, on the resi, we'll probably do a small condo component there because all of the resi questions are, \"Can we buy something here?\" And so we know there's some level of demand, we don't want to take a lot, obviously, condo risk is different than rental risk, but we'd like it to be some component of what we're building going forward. Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay, so you build out Pike & Rose and you have so much other redevelopment potential on the corridor there. Is it more of a daisy-chaining of deals where you do all you can at Pike & Rose and then you move on to the other adjacent properties and see about densifying those, or is there some element of mixing in some densification on the other sites while you're in the process of building future entitlements on Pike & Rose? Donald C. Wood: Well, yes. It's not -- the one thing we don't -- it is not, it's a daisy-chaining among properties. Each property's look at very individually in terms of what it is, what it is that we can do or adding pad sites today across the street at Montrose. There's still more to do, we believe, at Montrose in terms of a longer-term redevelopment there. When you come down to the properties like Federal Plaza, it's pretty built out. There's one other opportunity on the pack that we're looking at hard, as soon as we can get to that, we'll get to that. In terms of Congressional Plaza, in the next 2 or 3 or 4 months, we're going to be building another small residential component to the back of it, to complement our Crest I residential complex there. So each specific asset gets handled as a specific asset. But in terms of Pike & Rose, it's 10 years. There's 10 years\u2019 worth of stuff to do there. It's a big piece of land and even after Phase 2, there's a Phase 3 and a Phase 4. So stay tuned. We're just at the beginning part of what I think will be a very long growth development period for what we already have under control. Operator : We have a question from Haendel St. Juste. Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Quick question for you first on cap rates and capital allocation. You mentioned earlier that the cap rates for high-quality assets you're looking at your core markets were in the high 4s. Can you give us a sense of what you think the IRRs pencil out to and why perhaps you think it makes sense to pursue these deals if, well, given return, attractive return opportunities on development and redevelopment? James M. Taylor: Well, it's a very good question, and every investment decision we make, Haendel, is weighed against what our alternatives are and the relative risk of each particular opportunity. What I was alluding to on the marketed side with what we've seen on both the East and West Coast is a true compression, not just in cap rates but IRRs. Recently a center's gone under contract in Reston, Virginia with a Whole Foods. We think the IRR in that is a 5-handle IRR and was, in fact, marketed as a flat-6 IRR. So that's where it was marketed. You make your own judgments as to where that ultimately was traded. Donald C. Wood: We won't do that deal. We won't do that deal. James M. Taylor: We will not -- we will not do a deal like that. And so what we've found with marketed opportunities right now is that, it's got to have some complexity, something that we can add value to, for us to be interested. Where I am pleased with the level of activity that we're seeing on both coasts is frankly more structured deals that involve tax deferral or other things where we have a unique competitive advantage to really get to a value that makes sense and clears our hurdles long term. So we feel good about that, but from a capital allocation standpoint, you're absolutely right, we weigh it against what our alternatives are. Donald C. Wood: And let me just add to that, Haendel, because I love the question. It is a battle. Each one that we look at, we could be doing a whole lot more given our cost of capital, our own cost of capital, and what we could get done. Having said that, you have -- when you look at our last one, just talk about The Grove this time, and you look at The Grove, what we believe we can bring in terms of our retail leasing expertise, coupled with the local expertise of that team is lease rates that are significantly higher than they would otherwise be, bringing us up into 7 effectively in terms of the IRR and probably north, but that's where we're underwriting it. So it's got to show that kind of ability to get there and not just a coupon clipper. And as I think you're implying, why do that, rather than development? Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And following up, speaking of low cap rates, I was hoping you could talk a bit about New York City street retail. Even though that, too, is super low cap rate. And maybe your cost of capital is not quite at a place where the numbers can work, but is there anything out there you're looking at or that you think that makes sense to you economically? Donald C. Wood: It's in -- boy, it's on the list, we're certainly looking at it. So just like in every other market, very, very little of what we look at can we can say, ah, we can make it pencil from an IRR perspective. And so far, I don't know, Jim, what you want to add to that, but so far we've been skunked. James M. Taylor: Yes, we have looked at a few opportunities in Manhattan and, yes, the returns just don't underwrite for us. Operator : We have a question from Jim Sullivan. James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Really just to follow on the prior question here. It's interesting that when you talk about cap rate compression, I guess we can talk or debate whether the cap rate compression is more cyclical or secular. I'm curious, as you think about your own portfolio and allocating capital to development, does the reduction in cap rates that you're talking about, does it lead you to either consider selling more assets, number one, and number 2, perhaps lowering your hurdle rate on development or neither or both? I'm curious how you think about how you're going to devote capital, given what's happened with cap rates. James M. Taylor: Yes, every -- you raise a good point, and the way we think about it is, even a decision to hold an asset is effectively an investment decision. As we look across the portfolio, and we've alluded to in the past, there are a few assets that we are looking at selling. We don't feel pressure because to hold IRR is not a bleeder but certainly, thinking about timing of the market and the value that we could get for some of those assets today. We've not included any asset dispositions in our guidance, Jim, but you might see a disposition or 2 of some smaller assets that we think don't present much growth opportunity. So we do look at that and think about it all the time. In terms of the second part of your question, we take a long-term view on return hurdles. And we take a long-term view as it relates to acquisitions, what type of reversionary cap rates we should underwrite. We take a long-term view in terms of required returns on development. And while we may have a marginal cost of capital that's low today, we don't lose sight of the fact that our investors expect us to produce growth. And to deliver that, we -- and deliver it responsibly, we've got to balance the risks associated with the development activity, the returns and the visibility that we have. I would tell you, what I'm personally most excited about as we sit right now, is that we have 2 very large development opportunities where we've taken a lot of the risk out of the equation, in the first phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly, where I think an institutional investor would come in and pay us for the value that's created there. So I think we've got value delivering very shortly in terms of the initial phases, but also, as Don alluded to, as we think about future phases, we do so from a much more informed perspective, as Jason was pointing out in his question, but also with a lower-risk profile, because we're adding on to a base that's already been established, if you will. So I'm excited about it, and I think we have a lot of opportunities to exploit. And then, what you're hearing in our discussions is continuing to plant seeds for the future. For example, what Jeff has done across the street at Santana. It may or may not happen, but I think it's evidence that we're always looking out and trying to set ourselves up to find opportunities like that. James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, then second question for me. We focus on same-store NOI, or talk about same-store NOI, we tend to focus on obviously leasing spreads and occupancy rates. And I'm just curious at this point in the cycle, Don, as you think about that, with occupancy rates pretty much it seems as high as they're going to get, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, I just wonder to what extent there are other levers to push in terms of same-store NOI? And then I'm thinking about whether it's occupancy, operating cost, recovery rates or the nature and type of the bumps you're able to get at this point in the cycle, what else is there besides pushing pricing at this stage in the cycle to boost your same-store NOI growth rate? Donald C. Wood: Jim, I'll tell you, man. The -- I'm going to give you a little downer answer here. But this is -- I say this every call, and I just really need to get this out. Our business is a 3% growing business, that's what it is. Sometimes it's 2.5%, sometimes it's 3.5% and in tight periods of strength like we're in right now, it still can be 4%. I don't believe that the shopping center business, in general, is that type of business, I think it's much lower than that. I think it's a 1.5% to 2% grower. And so, when you sit back -- and I don't think that's our portfolio, as I said, I think our portfolio is 3%, 3%-plus. But that's what this business is. During any period of time, you're working real hard to get it to, say, as tight as you can on costs. I think we've done a good job there. I think we could do a little better, to tell you the truth, in terms of leasing spreads and pushing that is always a kind of a deal-by-deal, shopping center-by-shopping center, market-by-market basis. But it's always the most important component of that same-store growth. Operating not only up on expense costs, but it is always incumbent upon us to find -- to make sure, and we spend a lot of time on this, that the contractual rents -- the contractual contracts, if you will, are as strong as they can be to allow for the best recoveries that we can find. I do think we have an advantage there. I think our advantage there is simply because the real estate is better, we have more leverage in those nonquantitative, if you will, qualitative parts of a lease, which we work hard on. But when you cut through all that, this is a 3%, 3.5% growing business from Federal's point of view, and it's a 1.5% to 2% growing business in most of our competitors and I'll just go to my grave believing that. Operator : We have a question from Brandon Cheatham. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : This is actually Ki Bin. So kind of tie in your commentary about internal growth rates, obviously, Devon [ph] is a big part of your story but could you help, I mean, you just kind of put it together, I mean, you have big projects and potential in Santana, Assembly and Pike & Rose, all these things together. But when I piece it out throughout the next 3 to 4 years -- so 2 parts to that question though, how much is a realistic amount of investable dollars per year around those 3 to 4 years. And are market rents and economics currently healthy enough to justify those builds? James M. Taylor: We've got couple of hundred million dollars of spend per year for the next several years. We've done it in phases, Ki Bin, to get to the second part of your question, because certainly there are cycles. But in terms of the demand that we see today, we feel very good about it. And it's evidenced in our results. I mentioned before we had some rollover coming this year, of some pretty significant box space, as Chris and his team were all over it, we're effectively done with a lot of that. And as it relates to the leasing momentum that you see in the first phases, as we talked about, 92% lease at Pike & Rose, and I'll tell you the balance of the space is an internal debate over what kind of small salons or spas we want to put into the balance of the space. And similarly, 97% leased at Assembly, I think really underscores the strength of what we're seeing now. And, of course, we're doing it in phases because there are always cycles, but we feel real good about the momentum. Our ICSC conference is really going to be talking a lot, Ki Bin, about Phase 2 of Pike & Rose or Phase 2 of Assembly or what's left to do at The Pointe at Plaza El Segundo. So we feel good about that. In terms of investment within the core itself, what we talk about as more of the tactical redevelopment, we continue to identify opportunities there which bring higher returns admittedly, higher attractive risk-adjusted returns. But there's always so much that you can do at any one point in time for a myriad of reasons. But there you're going to see us to somewhere between $40 million to $70 million annually of spend at much higher rates of return, and I think complementary to what those centers will be post-redevelopment. I don't know if that answers your question, but that -- we see a pretty decent pipeline and feel good at least what we see currently in terms of demand. Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : So that, that -- if I understand you correctly, is that about you're projecting about $300 million per year? James M. Taylor: It's about -- yes, about somewhere between $250 million and $300 million, somewhere in there, yes. Operator : We have a question from Chris Lucas. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : Two quick questions. One is, Don, as the recovery has sort of continued to progress and there doesn't seem to be any macro pickup at all in new center construction, have you, in the areas that you guys are active, have you noticed or have you gotten a sense that there is a greater sense of urgency among the tenants that, in fact, they need to make deals now, relative to maybe where they were 6 months ago? Donald C. Wood: Yes, I have, Chris. And it -- I mean, part of it -- take The Assembly development for a second. Now it is new developments, new product, there's no question that we got a lot more interest in it because it was new product and because, physically, of where it was. And with the timing of the way it was going to open, by definition, there had to be a greater sense of urgency so that's part of this answer. But beyond that, I mean, where we were to where we came at Assembly, the same thing that happened at Pike & Rose, clearly indicates a sense of urgency to get stores open for 2015. And every tenant is a little different, most of them have certainly filled their '14 book, some of them have filled their '15 book also, but not all. And so when they haven't there is a big sense of urgency right now to get '15 deals open, and they get '16 deals going. So I would expect to see a pretty good ICSC coming up in 2 weeks. And I -- it's very hard to tell, you will all be asking, after that meeting, how -- what's the sentiment now, how is that -- what kind of convention did you have? But that is where you'll get some kind of an idea and it's a gut feel, more than it is done deals, as to where that sense of urgency is, for what periods of some time you're trying to fill space. So keep an eye on that over the next few weeks. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : And then, Jim, just a quick question, kind of going back to this issue of the cap rate compression dispositions, how do you weigh your equity capital requirements for future spend between -- using the ATM and the opportunity to do dispositions? James M. Taylor: It's a balance. We have -- we're fortunate that we have a lot of great capital opportunities ahead of us and we always want to have a balance sheet that's flexible and doesn't put us in a position, Chris, where we have to access the capital markets in any particular point in time. And I think we've demonstrated that, we don't need to really raise any external capital to fund all that we have underway and then a little bit more. But it's a balance because we're taking a long-term view. And as it relates to dispositions, this company was built one asset at a time over 50 years. So while we have some assets that we think are on that list, they're not significant from a capital perspective. So they form a part of the capital plan, sure, and the cap rates make that capital look very attractive, but it's not going to be a substantial part of our funding plan. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : I guess I was just thinking about the Clarion JV in terms of the life cycle of that particular investment and sort of how the markets progressed. James M. Taylor: Yes, and there, as with any joint venture, it's not a sole decision. So -- and that's -- you're on the nub of a very important point about joint ventures and that is that you have somebody else who has to agree that it's time to sell. And we've got a great relationship with them and you may see us sell an asset or 2 out of that, but not -- certainly not our decision solely. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Ms. Kristina Lennox. Kristina Lennox : Thank you for participating today. Our team looks forward to seeing you at the ICSC and then at NAREIT in New York. Have a good weekend. Operator : Thank you, all, for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Federal Realty Investment Trust Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kristina Lennox, you may begin. Kristina Lennox : Good morning. And I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dawn Becker, Jim Taylor, Jeff Berkes, Chris Weilminster, and Melissa Solis. These and other members of our management team are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information contained in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial conditions and results of operation. These documents are available on our website at www.federalrealty.com. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter 2014 results. Don? Donald C. Wood: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everybody. The 2014 second quarter and the few weeks that followed to today have been among the most consequential in our long history. In addition to producing FFO per share of $1.23, nearly 8% better than last year's quarter and the best quarter we've ever reported in 50-plus years, the progress that we've made in negotiating all sorts of deals that position us for years of net asset value accretion company wide was substantial. In a few minutes, Jim's going to talk about our reported results for the quarter. I'd like to talk to you today about deals and issues this quarter that in my view, set us up really well for creating incremental value in the future and got us started with a dividend increase. It's the combination of continued and consistent financial performance from the core that results in pretty significant taxable income growth, coupled with our bullish expectations for the future, given our development pipeline. That gives us the confidence to increase our quarterly dividend by $0.09 a share, more than we originally estimated and more than before. The result was a 12% increase in the annualized dividend rate from $3.12 a share to $3.48 per share, the 47th year in a row of dividend increases. Nobody in REIT land can touch that record. And we wouldn't do that without some very positive initial signals about the success of the first phases of our major development projects. Let me address that for a minute. There's little doubt that the initial phase of new retail or mixed-use destinations carry risks that's higher than subsequent phases because for varying degrees, they require proof-of-concepts. Whether it's a new location, a new merchandising mix or the pure number of new leases to be executed. Of course, not every new development is equally risky. And as we've talked about on previous calls and in other investor venues, we go to long lengths to mitigate initial phase risks by building on proven retail locations, by project phasing, by preleasing as much as possible and by executing GMP contracts. But there's still initial phases and their successful execution is the key to decades-long continuation of additional value creation. So if the first phases are successful, future phases are far less risky. They're more predictable, sometimes, they carry higher yields. There's no better example than at Santana Row where as of today, the $75 million Misora residential project is 97%, 98% leased with average rents of $3 a foot. It will generate nearly $6 million of operating income in the first 12 stabilized months of operation, and it's likely worth twice what it costs to build. Now I don't think it's a stretch to think that without the success of the initial phases of Santana Row, neither the income generated from Misora, nor with the cap rate used to value it would be nearly as robust as they are. And while it's still too early to say definitively that the first phases of Assembly Row and Pike & Rose are unmitigated successes, the early signs are good, with the following status update for each project. Let me start at Assembly. We opened the first 13 tenants in Phase 1 on Memorial Day weekend, including Anchor's LEGOLAND Discovery Center, AMC theaters, Saks Off Fifth and Nike Outlets. We've opened 11 more since and we expect to open 14 more by the end of this quarter, for a total of 38 tenants on our way to 90% retail occupancy by year-end. We're nearly fully leased. LEGOLAND Discovery Center exceeded their own projections by over 30% in the first month of operations and they're drawing patrons from well in excess of 100 miles away. AMC theaters have increased sales each month they've been open, and now exceed all but one of their 19 theaters in the Boston MSA. Saks has significantly increased their stabilized sales plan due to their strong opening. And Nike is consistently trending ahead of plan so far. Perhaps most encouraging, our adjacent power center, called Assembly Square Marketplace, has experienced double-digit increases in sales since the first tenants began opening in the mixed use center. And the office building whose construction trails the balance of Phase 1 by a couple of months, would come to terms with their first tenant who will take 25,000 of that 100,000 square foot building, expect more as the T-stop opens and the property begins to fill up. The T-stop, by the way, is on track, pardon the pun, to open this fall. On the other end of the site, Partners HealthCare is on schedule to begin construction later this month, that's right, in August. And it's planned to bring 4,700-plus workers to the site in as much as 900,000 square feet of space beginning in 2016. We envision the service retail contemplated as part of the Partners construction to be part of a broader Assembly Row second phase that we're crunching numbers on now. Retail demand and interest for our second phase appears very strong. So as it relates to Assembly and all mixed use developments for that matter, we know that it's a building and a maturation process that takes time to become a real and necessary part of the greater Boston community, but our initial ability to drive lots of people to the site with a limited tenant offering, with no operating T-stop and no Partners complex yet, in this very densely populated market, it's really encouraging. Sure seems like there's lots of value to add here. Now at Pike & Rose. Beginning this quarter, we've received our certificate of occupancy for, per se, the first of 2 residential buildings of the project and we currently have 60 families living there. That 174 unit building is already more than 50% leased on the residential side and nearly 100% leased in terms of the ground floor retail. Retail occupancy is on schedule and all of Phase 1 to begin this fall. The second residential building called Pallas is a 319-unit, 19-story highrise, which will be delivered next spring. That building, like the rest of Phase 1, remains on time and on budget. We also announced last month that we signed Bank of America Merrill Lynch to 40,000 square feet of office at our pro forma rents in this first phase, securing half of the available office product. Merrill will occupy in 2015 and demand for the balance of the space is strong. Like Assembly, our Phase 1 experience is encouraging in all facets : retail, residential and office. And accordingly, we're moving closer to a go on Phase 2 at Pike & Rose and hope to provide you cost, return and timing expectations on our next quarterly call. Our work to date on Phase 2, imagine the continuation of the spine of the project. Our main retail street called Grand Park Avenue, along with up to 3 ancillary buildings, which together, would add nearly 200,000 feet of retail. Approximately 250 rental apartments, 100 for sale condominiums, which sit above 150-room lifestyle-oriented hotel is also part of that phase. And then let's go to the West Coast. With the effective completion of Misora, we're anxious to move forward the next piece of Santana Row development during the continuing strong office environment, Silicon Valley in general, Santana Row specifically. While we call the building 11 site, it will be recognized by those of you who know Santana Row as the surface parking lot at the corner of Winchester Boulevard and Olson at the southern end of the property adjacent to the Cin\u00e9Arts Movie Theater. It's a great site. It's easily accessible at Interstates 280 and 880 with Santana Row amenities that are very highly sought after. Space needs are growing rapidly in the valley and the nature of tech makes the timeframe required to prelease before building problematic. Accordingly, we expect to be under construction this fall with a 225,000 square foot 6-story Class A office building, along with nearly 670 parking spaces and a garage below the building that will complement existing retail parking nights and weekends. Total cost is estimated $115 million with a range of expected rents that'll put the stabilized yield in the 7.5% to 8.5% range. In Southern California, construction of the $80 million Point Lifestyle Center in El Segundo moves along without drama and as anticipated, on time and on budget. Also, given the large developments that we have underway, it's sometimes easy to forget that we have an additional $100 million of taxable redevelopment underway at centers like Tower Shops and Davie, Florida, Mercer Mall in New Jersey, and Westgate Center in San Jose, California. On average, this $100 million is being deployed at incremental returns in excess of 10% and an integral part of the strategic plan that we laid out for you at Investor Day last fall. And while we don't have acquisitions to report on for this call, it is very likely that we will by year-end, as 2 separate projects are under our control as we speak with due diligence and administrative documentation underway. I think I'll stop there in terms of my prepared remarks and just want to end by expressing my enthusiasm for both our continued strong core results quarter-after-quarter, as well as with the delivery of some of the finest retail mix-used product available anywhere. Now let me turn it over to Jim for his remarks on the quarter before we open the line to your questions. James M. Taylor: Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. The FFO per share of $1.23 represented yet another quarterly record for the trust and exceeded the FFO achieved in the second quarter of last year by 8%. Impressively, our team continued to deliver these bottom line results while also achieving significant strategic milestones and future value creation. As Don just provided some great insight into how these milestones demonstrate the execution of our strategic plan, I will focus on the foundation for all of this value creation, our core portfolio. On the leasing front, we signed 128 leases for a total of 623,000 square feet of retail space. This quarterly volume represents a record for the trust. And despite a large proportion of anchor deals, we achieved an average rent of $35.83. Now go back to over several quarters as I've emphasized with many of you, and you'll see that we are achieving average rents in the low- to mid-30s over in place rents that average in the mid-20s. It's clear an indication as any of the embedded growth that remains in our in-place leases. In more detail, of the 128 leases signed this quarter, 109 were for comparable space and 19 related to newly built space primarily at Assembly, Pike & Rose and The Point. Of the 109 comparable deals, we achieved an average cash rollover growth of 16% or 30% on a straight-line basis. The average cash rollover growth for new deals was 30% and for renewals was 8%. Simply put, these results underscore the strength of our real estate and importantly, the strength of our leasing, operations, legal and tenant coordination team responsible for delivering these types of outstanding results quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. From a portfolio perspective, we ended the quarter at 95.3% leased and 94.3% occupied, both down sequential -- or both down slightly on a sequential basis due primarily to a Kohl's lease expiration on Long Island that we expect to backfill at better economics in terms for the trust. As mentioned on previous calls, we do expect additional anchor vacancy on a rollover basis in the next quarter that we backfilled with better long-term deals. Now turning to our financial results. Total revenue for the company grew at 6%. This increase was driven primarily by rollover and contractural rent growth versus occupancy gains, as well as the successful integration of acquisitions and the delivery of Misora at Santana. Our overall operating margin remained strong at 69.9% despite the investment as Don has highlighted, of marketing dollars for our new development projects. Overall, property operating income grew at 5.2%. On a same center basis, we grew 4%, excluding redevelopment and 4.2% with it. Again, none of which was due to occupancy gains. G&A remains essentially flat as we've maintained strict control on expenses and net interest expense decreased over $3.9 million due primarily to lower overall borrowing rates that we achieved through refinancing. We look forward to achieving additional interest savings benefit as we refinance expensive near-term debt. Bottom line, our FFO per share grew at 8%. All while we max funded our development activity to keep our balance sheet strong, and as discussed in previous quarters, overcame earnings drag associated with delivering all of this new value creation. Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we accessed the ATM for $52 million at a weighted average price of $119.66 per share. We also repaid $24 million of secured mortgages, including our share of JV debt. We ended the quarter with nothing drawn on our line of credit and $41 million of cash, importantly providing us plenty of capacity to fund our remaining development activity, including the newly announced building at Santana Row. Our debt to market cap improved to 22% and our debt-to-EBITDA decreased to 5.3x, while our fixed charge coverage improved to 3.8x. From a capital recycling perspective, subsequent to quarter end, we sold our Pleasant Shops asset in the Boston MSA that we owned in partnership with Clarion at a mid floor cap rate for a total sales price of $34 million. From an acquisition perspective, we do remain active as Don highlighted and have 2 assets under control that are subject to third-party consent. We are pleased that these assets would draw in our existing core markets who are sourced directly. And as Don highlighted, we'll provide more detail on the coming months. Now turning to outlook. We have increased our 2014 FFO guidance range to $4.90 to $4.94 per share, an increase of $0.025 at the midpoint from our prior guidance of $4.86 to $4.93. This guidance is typical. It does not include the impact of any acquisitions that we may complete later in the year. The increased guidance here is largely driven by the continued strength in our core portfolio, which continues to drive organic growth without occupancy gains, as well as the accelerated lease up of Misora. As discussed on our last call, we expect our occupancy to remain lower during the latter part of the year as we roll larger anchor spaces. This rollover and associated downtime as we replace these tenants will cause some drag on our same-store numbers, particularly in the third quarter. However, the strength of the quarter will continue to be our largest driver of growth this year. From a timing perspective, we began delivery of approximately $350 million of development and redevelopment this year, and expect to deliver another $200 million of investment associated with these initial phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly in 2015. We are on time and on budget. These deliveries include the following : our $75 million investment in Misora which stabilized this month to 97% leased, well ahead of schedule; buildings 11 and 12 at Pike & Rose, which represent approximately $125 million of investment, began opening in phases this quarter and we expect will stabilize in 2015; building 10, our 319-unit residential building in the Office, which collectively represent approximately $150 million of investment, will open mid-next year and stabilize in 2016; Phase 1 in retail of Assembly Row, which represents another hundred -- which represents $150 million of investment, will continue to open through the third quarter and stabilize in 2015 and '16, as tenants report a full year of sales; the Office, which represents approximately $50 million of investment, will deliver in 2015 and also stabilize in '16. As Don highlighted in his remarks, these projects are substantially leased and will bring us significant value both in the near term, as well as over time. I'd like to conclude my remarks with an observation about the fundamental goal of our business plan, which is the delivery of a steadily increasing stream of cash flow. This quarter's announced dividend increase of nearly 12% not only represented the 47th consecutive and largest absolute increase as Don highlighted, it also reflects several years of careful stewardship for underlying growth and taxable income drives the growth in current return delivered to our shareholders. By managing to our minimum payout and maintaining a conservative payout ratio, we help ensure the continuation of our industry-leading record. With that, operator, I'd like to now turn the call over to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : It looks like you might close to breaking ground on that 100-unit residential projects in Cowson [ph]. I think [indiscernible] residential what really [indiscernible] foreseeable residential only projects, I mean, and I guess could you be paid to sell the entitlements without executing on the construction? Donald C. Wood: Jeff, you cut out a little bit, but let me -- I think I got the gist of your question. The answer is, no. We do not anticipate future residential only projects where we don't have a retail bulkhead or beachhead there. In the case of Cowson, that was a piece of land that we acquired. I think -- didn't we get that with White Marsh? Dawn M. Becker: We did. Donald C. Wood: Back with the White Marsh portfolio and it was kind of a throw in, if you will, in that transaction. And heck, if there's any piece of land that's sitting with the company that has the opportunity to be able to create some value, we're all over it. So that's why that one got out. That's an outlier because in the nature of how we accumulate property, we don't normally have exit plans. So that was just a little piece that came with White Marsh. That's why we're doing that one. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Could it be economical for you guys to sell it without pursuing the developments [ph] at this point? Donald C. Wood: It's really something that, I've got to tell you, we're getting pretty good at. In terms of these small residential projects, whether they're at the back of Congressional Plaza or even up in Boston where we did one last year. So we're very comfortable in our ability to do it. That's why we would do that, with the team all ready to do it. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just, I'm curious the lease permit use and redevelopment projects, what's the leasing pace like of what I'd guess, I'd call your bread-and-butter properties? Can you guys see that change in the overall pent-up demand for space or the velocity of leasing? I guess, I'm more focused on the pace [indiscernible] Donald C. Wood: I think I got you. You really are coming in now. I think you're asking about Small Shop pace in the core portfolio. [indiscernible] a little strong, but let me turn it over to Chris Weilminster to see if he has anything to add to that. Christopher J. Weilminster: Yes, I think the tenants are still -- they're still remembering what happened in 2009 and '10. I think they've all got more sophisticated in every transaction has hair on the deal and it's much harder to accomplish. So we work much harder to keep up the trends that you're seeing. So although, Don, it is bullish, I think you see that in our numbers. We're performing well with our numbers, but it's very hard to accomplish each one of those deals. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal of ISI Group. Samir Khanal - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Sorry, if I missed this, but I know the other property income line was up at around $4.3 million. I think that may have been kind of the highest since 2012. I'm wondering if there are any kind of term fees involved in that? Donald C. Wood: There is $1 million-or-so of term fees in there, $1.5-plus million. James Taylor : About $1 million of term fees, and that's really behind most of the increase. In terms of the pace of term fees for the year, we're kind of consistent with what we expect every year. And the $3 million to $4 million, if you go back and you look at the kind of the 10-year average. Samir Khanal - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And did that have -- I mean, how much of an impact did that have on, I guess, same-store NOI growth? Probably not much, right? James M. Taylor: It was beneficial again, but offset by a few other items. Donald C. Wood: Yes. I need you to understand this. I know I probably say this each time but it's really important to me. When you look at what our business is and what we do, I know as an analyst, you like to parse out term fees or look at even growth with and without redevelopment, which we do break out, and I'm sorry I ever agreed to that back in 2005 or whenever. Our business includes redevelopment of the core and it includes writing strong contracts so that we have leverage to the extent we need to move tenants around. And that's where you get term fees. It's a key part of what it is that we do. Some quarters, it helps the same-store growth, some quarters it hurts the same-store growth numbers. It's on average, but what it is for, again, what we expected it for this year. But I know you love to break it out, but I really am going to implore again, it's part and parcel of what our business is. And that's why it's important to have in there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just wondering, if we're thinking about Assembly and Pike & Rose, what are the milestones that you're kind of looking for or waiting for before you actually announce Phase 2s? Is it the time of Phase 1, the leasing percentages of the Phase 1s? Or preleasing of Phase 2? Or something else? Donald C. Wood: It's all of those things, Mike. It's complicated. The other side that you didn't talk about was getting the numbers locked down in Phase 2. And that means not just estimating construction costs. And we take a lot of pride in basically saying on time and on budget. A lot of time and a lot of pride in that. And I'm not ready with the numbers I've seen yet to be able to confidently be able to say that we'll be on time and on budget in those Phase 2s. And so that's the biggest, single biggest thing in terms of when we're ready to announce the next phase. Frankly, with respect to the lease-up of the first phases of both of them, our leasing team, and Chris is here and can probably add a little bit more color to it, we're leasing Phase 2 now on both of them. As obviously, every retailer knows that they're not approved deals yet, but that level of demand that allows him to have more conversations about Phase 2 leasing at this point, is one of the single biggest reasons we're still bullish that there will be Phase 2 on both of those. But you know, Mike, again, until we're comfortable that we can get a real good handle on what that income statement is going to be and measure that against what it costs us to build it, I'm not going to officially announce it. So that's the real milestone. Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got it. Okay. And then you mentioned the likelihood of 2 acquisitions at some point this year. Can you give us a rough dollar amount of what that could be? Donald C. Wood: It was in the number, it was out of the number. We pull it in, we put it out, and I'll tell you exactly why. There's 2 acquisitions. One's roughly 50. The other one's roughly 200. So the acquisition choices for what we will have this year are 0, 50, 200 or 250. So that's not to be cute, but one's the big one, one's the smaller one. And at the end of the day, while we've got both of them under control, we're still going to due diligence. I want to make sure that we're getting what we've paid for, and if we're not, we ain't doing it. So that's kind of where we are. Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got it. And then last question. I think you said it was a mid 4 cap on the Pleasant Shop Sale. What type of buyer was that? James M. Taylor: It's a petitional operating company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : A few questions here. First, I mean, while we're on the topic of the acquisitions, are you expecting to fund these with this disposition proceeds, line of credit, or are you thinking about ATM or equity? James M. Taylor: Alex, I'll have to tell you, it's a little bit everything. We've got some OP units in the mix, some will be assumption of debt and there will be some cash components to it. So it's a little bit of a mix of everything. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. And then, Jim, while you're talking, if you can put on your old banker hat. You've got light maturities in 2019 and 2021. You also spoke about looking to refi some near-term expense of debt. Are you of the type who wants to fill in vacancy, low points on your maturity schedule? Or you prefer just to do push that up out as far as you can like your standard 10-year or maybe even contemplate doing longer issuance? James M. Taylor: I have to say, it depends on the environment that you're in. And if you think about where we are right now, with the 30-year, and frankly, the flatness in the curve, I think the responsible thing is to push things out as far as you can. So rather than looking to neatly fill a particular hole in the maturity profile, which we always have an eye on. I think right now, our bias is to go longer and improve our average weighted tenure. Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division : Okay. And then just finally on the Clarion JV. Is this -- is the Weymouth disposition the start of the wind down, should we expect this venture to be liquidating in the near term? Or was this just a one-off sale and we shouldn't expect any other dispositions from that JV? James M. Taylor: I think, at this point, you should think about it as a one-off. We have a great partnership with Clarion and I think we both concluded that it was time to harvest this particular asset. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Just sticking with that. I was just curious, at the mid 4 cap rate, what was the -- what was your sort of growth expectations for that asset over the next couple of years? James M. Taylor: Yes, we did see some growth in the asset below kind of where we would want for an asset in our portfolio, but nothing exceptional. Good quality assets, no doubt, but I think the most important thing from a data point perspective is that you're seeing a lot of capital chasing higher quality assets. And this was a competitive process and I think the pricing here indicative of what really sophisticated institutions are willing to pay for higher-quality real estate. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And just on the acquisition side. Just curious, I know it's not been a focus for you guys, but curious what you're thinking about the Houston market these days. Is that something that might be of more interest to you? Donald C. Wood: I wonder why you ask that, Vince? Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I have no idea. I'm just looking at holes in your portfolio. I'm thinking, well, it's a good market. If something happened to be available, what do you think of the market? That's all. Donald C. Wood: Yes, that's a very good question. I can tell you that we've talked about it around here. You probably will not see us involved in what you're referring to, okay? So let me get that off the table right now. But having said that, I like Texas. And I think Texas, frankly, we're in the middle of kind of figuring out whether kind of the historical boom bust nature of that market is something more in the past and whether it will be more of a stabilized market going in the future, particularly Houston that way. But if we did conclude that we want to get in it, we would do it in such a way that wouldn't -- it would be a great asset, or 2 or 3 or 5 that we were looking at there, and it's probably not going to be with this transaction. Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And maybe just one last one. Just in terms of the Chris Cole relationship, just curious how or what is turning up in the New York, New Jersey market for you? Donald C. Wood: Well, I'll tell you. First of all, just big picture. Everything that we expected, we're getting and more. And Chris is partnering up with a couple of key members of our existing team and they will be doing, for example, the Darien redevelopment, which is coming along pretty nicely in terms of where we are in paper and some early conversations with Stop & Shop and CVS and don't know whether we get to where we need to get. But nonetheless, you should have seen the face I got from Weilminster when that came through. But those conversations are starting to yield some possibilities. And again, that's a Chris Cole coupled with existing federal or historical federal people team to put that together, so love that. They've also looking harder to our Brick asset in Brick Township, which is a big asset for us that kind of was on the periphery in terms of how it's been running out of Philadelphia. And now with that local presence, I think we're going to see some pretty good positive stuff coming out of there over the next few years. So that relationship, the acquisition, the entire package there basically 1 year in, is looking real good. James M. Taylor: And then I would say that in terms of ancillary investment opportunities, Chris has been great there as well. So we couldn't be more pleased with that partnership. Donald C. Wood: Now he wants everything, and he's not going to get his way, but he's working hard. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of MLV & Co. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Could you just -- you've talked about the junior anchor transitions and the third quarter impact. I was just wondering if you can maybe quantify where you think occupancy might end up. Is it going to be a third quarter and into the fourth quarter and year-end impact? And the same-store NOI, is this a 50 basis point, 100 basis point? I mean, just a little bit of detail on what we should expect, given kind of what you know is going to happen in the third quarter? James M. Taylor: I don't want to provide specific guidance in the quarter as a lot of it, Paul, as you know, is driven by timing, rent commencements and other things, which sometimes move around by a week or 2 and that can have a significant impact. But I did want, and I'm glad you raised it, I did want to highlight that we do expect some drag from this anchor vacancy in the quarter and it could be 10, 20, 40, 50 basis points or more on the same-store impact, but don't want to try to put too tight a range on that at this point because we still have a good bit of a quarter ahead of us. Donald C. Wood: Paul, and Jim is right but it sounded a little too fluffy for me so I want to add something to it. Nothing's draconian. So don't -- I mean, we're 94%, 94.5%, 95% occupied portfolio, it's a damn good portfolio. And even though we'll have some boxes that we're working through to create some additional value on, it's still going to be in that range. It's not -- nothing's falling off the cliff or I don't want you to -- it's really -- what we don't want you to do is to consider big occupancy improvements over that period of time since that really still is the name of the game in a lot of our competitors, and it's still being talked about a lot that we are fully occupied, generally. So that's, to me, what you should expect from us. James M. Taylor: The other element of that, Paul, is the fact that we are aggressively getting after space, even ahead of what the ordinary maturity profile would suggest. It's something we've always done and what you're seeing happen over these quarters, clearly is with a view towards getting better long-term deals in place. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Okay. Understood. And the impact though, is pretty much concentrated in the third quarter or did you already absorb some of the move outs in the second quarter? James M. Taylor: We did in the second quarter, but it's more heavily weighted to the back-end of the year. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then at Pike & Rose Phase 2, I know you're going to provide more detail over the next couple of quarters, but just maybe a little bit of a window there. How are you thinking about whether you're going to do all of the Phase 2 yourself on the -- particularly on the resi side and whether kind of your experiences at PerSei, have had any impact on that and quantifying a little bit any... Donald C. Wood: That's very -- it's a very good question. And, yes, the experiences at PerSei have made us more bullish. What's really interesting, the bottom line is on these type of projects, it is really, really hard to get paid up top, whether it's resi or office or hotel or whatever. It's very hard to get paid for what we think the value is because we know what happens as these properties mature. And I think we're seeing it at Assembly now. I mean, as far as we can tell, the rents that Avalon is achieving are above where we forecast them at the time we were negotiating the price. And so it's very, very hard for either a residential developer or an office developer to basically pay up based on the plans that we have seen happened in places like Santana. And so it's probable, and when it's just 3 miles down from our -- on the map from our major office, that we'll do it ourselves. Now that's different when it comes to big office development, but on the resi side, we're pretty confident. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : And should we think of the yields as being a little bit better even because you've done a fair amount of the infrastructure work that's kind of burdening Phase 1 or is that... James M. Taylor: I mean, that's exactly, Paul, what we're working through right now. I can tell you they look about the same at this point. So I'm pounding a little harder on the construction numbers and that kind of stuff. That we will have a clearer picture as we lease more in PerSei, and then even start leasing up in Pallas, the bigger building there. But I'd love to say that second phase yields will be dramatically better than the first phase. I don't think we're underwriting -- not I don't think, we're not. It's going to be underwriting them as significantly better but yet, still very, very good and profitable vis-a-vis acquisition of... James M. Taylor: Not only that, great on an absolute basis. The other thing to highlight, much different from a risk profile standpoint as Don highlighted earlier, as the first phase is in and we're moving forward with greater tenant demand in a proven location as evidenced by the residents that are already beginning to move in. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Unknown Analyst : This is Katie McConnell [ph] on for Christy. Can you talk about some of the volatility in your renewal spreads over the last 4 quarters and what might be a good run rate over the next year? James M. Taylor: One thing that we've always pointed to as we've seen some of these renewal spreads in the high-teens and low 20s is that, as we look at it over a longer-term basis, both new and renewal, we expect that to kind of be in the mid teens as more of a run-rate basis with renewals or new leases higher and obviously renewals, lower. So that's kind of what we see on a longer-term basis. But when you think about the volatility quarter-over-quarter, you can have a few deals move things one way or the other. And as I alluded to in my remarks, I think the thing to really look at is to look at it over a trailing 4, 6 or 8 quarters to see where we're signing these new rents relative to where the in place income is. Donald C. Wood: And the only thing I would add to that is just let's put our size in perspective. I mean, we're not Kimco, we are not -- we do not have that volume. And so we do about 400 deals a year, about 100 deals a quarter, both new and renewal. And when you think about that type of population and 400,000 square feet roughly or so on an average quarter to do that, 2 or 3 deals, really positive or really negative, move those numbers around. So you'll absolutely have volatility with respect to the leasing spread on any particular quarter. What I think you should -- I'd love you to look at though, is how amazing it is that, that volatility on a quarterly basis does not translate into volatility of our reported earnings. It's really important when you take that metric and you get it down to overall, what happens to this earnings stream, it really shows that as Jimmy said, over the past 4, 6, 8 quarters, the stuff that really generates into the income stream in the subsequent year or 1.5 years or 2 years ahead, really smooths out pretty amazingly. So I don't know, that's all I've got to say. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason White of Green Street Advisors. Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Just a quick question on the different buckets of your portfolio. I know they don't sit in nice discreet buckets, but if you look at gross record and street retail and mixed-use and kind of your Tower Shops style power centers, where do you see the greatest demand today? And historically, where have you seen kind of the best growth from each of those asset classes? Donald C. Wood: You've got a real -- you're hitting a real, I don't want to call it a sore point for me, but, Jason, I got to tell you, I know you're going to think this is a cop out, it's not. It depends on the particular asset and how it is serving the community that it is in. I mean, when you look in the future back at power center, at East Bay Bridge, you're going to love the perspective that you see in terms of that income stream. When you look at where the growth has come at kind of a hybrid center like a Congressional Plaza, you're going to love that growth. When you look at what I believe is going to happen at Assembly and that mixed-use project, you're going to find great growth as you see at Santana. It really and truly depends, Jason. And I know our whole industry loves to put the buck -- put in the buckets, what's grocery, what's outlet, whatever. Trumping all of those categories, is location and how important it is to that community. So I can't to do what you ask me to do in terms of laying that out. You've got to get it down to the retail or to the local level and we've got good power centers, bad power centers, good gross reactor and bad gross reactor, good mixed use, tougher mixed use. It truly does come down to that location. I'm sorry that sounds like a cop out. Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : No worries. And then I guess second one for me would be as you look at your development and redevelopment buckets, currently it's about 9% of assets once you complete all those. Is there a ceiling that you feel comfortable getting to in terms of percent of your overall portfolio? Or is that just something on a case-by-case basis? Donald C. Wood: Well, yes, there is a ceiling and it's not a hard line, but it's about 10% or 10.5%, 11%, maybe tops. The bottom line is, and Jimmy said it in his comment, our thesis here, our proposition to investors is a growing stream of cash flows, a steady growing stream of cash flows that you can count on, that is less susceptible to typical risks than other portfolios. So if that's our goal, there's got to be a limit to how much in development at any one-time there is. Now as that stuff gets put into service. You think about -- people think that Santana Row is a development. Santana Row is probably the most stable ongoing property in the portfolio. So as -- it's been over 12 years. So as these things move into service, we don't consider them in the development bucket any longer and we look at the incremental piece, the incremental phases like the Misora, for example, are now like the Lot 11 deal. That's the development, but it doesn't encompass the whole thing once we're in service and comfortable. That's a long way of saying that 9%, that 10% range, that's about where we're comfortable putting capital to work in construction effectively. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas of Capital One securities. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : Don, just a follow-up sort of to that last question, which is now that the Silver Line is actually opened and some of your neighbors at Pike 7 have laid out their plans, how are you thinking about that opportunity in terms of the timeframe? Any adjustment to your thoughts now that we're actually opened? Donald C. Wood: That's a great question, Chris, really. I mean, look, one of the pieces of land that we have in this portfolio is sitting there at the new sewer line entrance effectively on Route 7 in Tyson's. That property, during all the mess that has been Tyson's over the past 5, 7 years, has performed amazingly well. And that includes blocking off entrances, constantly changing entrances, constantly we view that [ph] as they went but did their thing and people just found their way into that shopping center and our rent has continued to go up in that shopping center and demand is as strong as ever. Now where we are with that open and we've got basically 5 or 6 years left, if you will, on the existing leases in terms of when effectively we can get out, because we locked them up about 4 years ago, so that we've got through this period. We're having constant conversations about what makes some sense. Do we partner with our neighbors and look at a bigger project there, which we've had some conversations about. Nothing's gone to any significant level now. I'm still struggling, to tell you the truth, with what it needs to be. And when you look at the other development that's happening in Tyson's, what makes sense there, I'm still glad that we have 5 years left to kind of watch what's going on and what we'll wind up doing there will be, it will -- I promise you, it will not be a me too. It will fill in a need that we see that's not being addressed somewhere else in itself. That's where we are. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then can you give us a little more additional color just on the Davie, Florida project in terms of what your thoughts are. Is that small shop space you're trying to add? Is that a single anchor box? Is that several juniors? What's the addition there going to look like? Donald C. Wood: I'm looking and smiling at Weilminster over there because he's got a great -- we got a great potential tenant. And I'm going to leave it to him, whether he's comfortable talking about that possibility yet for that expansion... Christopher J. Weilminster: I'm not comfortable naming who the tenant is, but I can tell you, it is a grocery category tenant that is smaller in size and they will occupy a part of that 50,000 square foot development we're doing. I think they'll be a great anchor to that development and we've got a tremendous amount of interest in the remaining space that's available, about 30,000-plus square feet and I think our investors are going to be very happy with that being added to our portfolio. Donald C. Wood: I'll tell you what, Chris, it's been a -- when we bought Tower, we bought Tower really because we thought there was a lot that we can do with the existing shopping center and given that location where it is in Davie, we knew that if we were never able to develop 1 more square foot on the piece of land, that it was going to be a really good investment. But the bottom line is, the whole thing encompasses almost 60 acres. And the idea of the probability that we couldn't underwrite at the time of actually doing something additional was not underwriteable. We've worked with lots of tenants who good [ph] In the center who have had to have very important things in their leases that could block that development. And we're basically through almost all of them allowing us to say we've got a development there. To the extent Chris is uncomfortable talking about the particular tenant, I think most of you could figure out whom he's talking about. But that really was a -- it's just a great add to the whole what is already a dominant center in the Forth Lauderdale, Davie market. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : And then, Jim, one of the things we talked about when you were laying out guidance at the beginning of the year related to marketing spend at Assembly and at Pike & Rose, and I guess I just want to get an update in terms of how that spend has gone. Has it been within sort of the timing and the size that you expected? And is there any surprises, positive or negative, that we would should expect from that in the second half of the year? James M. Taylor: We're on budget from an overall amount with what we expect to spend to open these projects in the right way, Chris. Timing, we have had some movements between the second and third quarter in terms of some of that expense, nothing too terribly significant. The fundamental point though remains, which is we're running all of that through our income statement. We're investing, if you will, from an income perspective into our development and yet, still driving some pretty meaningful growth. These projects do require big investment to open them well. And we're already seeing the fruits of some of that success early on at Assembly, but would expect to continue to make investments as additional tenants opened as Don covered in his remarks. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : Okay and my last question relates to the same-store apartment occupancy level is down 80 basis points year-over-year. Is there anything we should be looking at in that number? Particularly, is there some regional impact? Or is that just sort of a timing issues? Or is that -- what happened there? James M. Taylor: It's really just, I think, less than 10 units that threw that occupancy number. Donald C. Wood: No, that resulting in Crest. Dawn M. Becker: There's nothing unusual. Just a couple units here and there. Operator : I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to Kristina Lennox for any closing remarks. Kristina Lennox : Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Have a great weekend and we look forward to seeing you in the conferences in the fall. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Brittany Schmelz. You may begin. Brittany Schmelz : Good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dawn Becker, Jim Taylor, Jeff Berkes, Chris Weilminster and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information contained in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that were issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our website at www.federalrealty.com. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter 2014 results. Don? Donald C. Wood: Thanks, Brittany. Good morning, everybody. Lots of things are coming together for our company these days, as evidenced by our reported results this quarter, along with a very strong opening in Assembly Row in Massachusetts, and our official decision to move forward with the next phase of Pike & Rose. More on the latter two in a minute. Let's start with the quarter where FFO per share of $1.23 matched our second quarter result and beat last year by a solid 6%, despite the inevitable drag of delivering big development projects. Our core portfolio continues to be the cash flow horse, with same-center growth of 3.3% when excluding the quarter-over-quarter effects of properties under redevelopment and 4.4% when including those properties. That all happened with strong and consistent occupancy reflected at 94.7% this year versus 94.6% last year, and that 94.7% reflects a sequential improvement over the second quarter of 40 basis points. Personally, I'd like to see those numbers rise into the 95% plus range over the next 12 months, as we've moved -- pushed to improve the small shop numbers throughout the portfolio, particularly in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic regions. Leases signed during the quarter also bode well for future earnings growth, as 108 deals were signed covering over 430,000 square feet. 90 of those deals were for comparable space, and that is existing space where there was a previous tenant, and those deals were signed at $35.69 a foot, 13% better than the $31.55 a foot the previous tenant was paying in their final year of the lease. The [indiscernible] comparable deals related primarily to Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, in addition to a few at expanded redevelopments like Tower Shops in Florida and Willow Lawn in Richmond, and were written on average at nearly $40 a foot. Sometimes, given the appropriate focus on our large-scale developments, we don't point out enough just how well our basic core expansion redevelopment business is performing. That Tower Shops reference I made a minute ago represents a Trader Joe's deal at this center in Greater Fort Lauderdale that will anchor our 50,000 square foot expansion renovation. We acquired Tower Shops a couple of years back and it's been a home run for us in terms of value creation. The same can be said about Westgate Center in California, acquired in 2004, where the re-merchandising of the center toward today's value oriented retailers like Nike, Gap, and J.Crew outlet concepts is revitalizing this extremely vibrant, well-located property. Our redevelopment effort also applies to properties that we've owned for decades, that are going through their second and their third redevelopment iterations, like Willow Lawn in Richmond and Quince Orchard in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Our bottom line is -- and I love our redevelopment business, because it represents our active effort to keep our properties relevant in a changing consumer environment, in addition to creating obvious incremental real estate value. It's really hard to do that if the real estate is extremely well-located. Okay. Let me make a few comments about our large development initiatives and start with the announcement of the second phase of Pike & Rose. We didn't want to pull the trigger on this $200 million incremental investment in the property without a good read on the market's acceptance on the first phase, and by all accounts, we're very bullish. Settle at that for a second. That first phase is fully leased with respect to the retail component with strong demand for more. It's 50% leased with respect to the office space, with strong interest in documents changing hands on the remainder. It's 75% leased on the third floor [ph] Financial building with potential tenants also expecting stronger than anticipated interest in condominium availability. And we're moving along on schedule with respect to the big 319-unit high-rise building, with lease-up expected to begin in the middle of next year. In addition, interest in all facets of future phases of this project has grown exponentially as people have been able to witness first-hand the execution of the first phase. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the announcement we made a couple of weeks ago about the hotel deal that we signed. We'll be bringing in one of Hilton's first newly conceived boutique lifestyle products. They call it Canopy. So Pike & Rose just [indiscernible] outside of Washington, D.C. because it dovetails perfectly with Hilton's vision for the future. And you've got to love that. We've entered into a joint venture agreement with local hotel company Buccini/Pollin Group, a preferred hotel developer, where we'll be contributing the land plus $5 million in exchange for participating preferred return. And so, based on all that, our board approved an incremental $200 million to continue to expand Pike & Rose with 5 more buildings that will comprise an additional 185,000 square feet of retail, bringing it to 336,000 when including Phase I; 264 additional luxury residential apartments; 177-room Canopy Hotel; and over 800 additional structured parking spaces. That investment is expected to create a stabilized yield in the 7% to 8% range. Higher construction cost and an additional land parcel on the site put some pressure on the yield, but it still works incredibly well given our cost of capital and its future growth prospects. Construction will begin in 2015 and is scheduled to deliver in 2017. Check out Federal Realty's website for a current site plan of all Pike & Rose's various spaces. In addition, we'll be building 104 for-sale residential condominiums on 7 floors above the hotel for a net gain [ph] of $50 million, given the extremely high level of interest in this market for for-sale housing. Net proceeds from the sale of those homes in excess of cost will start to reduce the basis in Phase II and improve the yield, I talked about above, by as much as 50 basis points. Now let's move to Assembly Row and Somerville, where we currently have 40 tenants open and operating, with over 50 expected by year-end and where the initial feedback and performance has been nearly universally positive and strong. As we understand it, Avalon Bay will stay the same on the residential side. In addition, we signed our first lease in our first Phase I office building to Beverly, Massachusetts-based software developer SmartBear, for their 100-plus-person corporate headquarters relocation. It's 33,000 square feet, or 1/3 of the building, which is right on the Mystic River. We expect to have the balance of this space completely leased in 2015. On the other end of the big 60-plus acre site, the [indiscernible] has opened and operating and Partners Healthcare is well under construction and driving piles as it begins to build its 900,000 square foot administrative complex over the next couple of years. The level of economic activity that is taking place on the site today was simply unfathomable a few years back. Given this progress to date at the property and our view of the future for the greater Boston economy over the next decade, we're tightening down numbers and plans now, but barring a significant hiccup in the next several months, we would anticipate an announcement of additional capital allocation for the next phase of Assembly Row next year. Heading west, we expect to begin construction in this fourth quarter with our previously announced 225,000 square foot 6-story Class A office building, along with nearly 700 parking spaces in a garage below the building that will complement existing retail parking nights and weekends. As a reminder, total cost is estimated at $110 million to $120 million with a range of expected volumes that will put the stabilized yield in the 7.5% to 8.5% range. Apple, by the way, is under construction on a brand new $1 billion campus, just a few exits north on route 280 from our site where we are today. Apple announced blockbuster results last week, to serve as a reminder to us of the continuing strength of Silicon Valley. We look forward to continue to capitalize on that dynamic economy with relevant retail and mixed-use product in and around Santana Row, Westgate Center, Old Town Los Gatos and other additions to come. In Southern California, construction of the $80 million Point lifestyle center in El Segundo moves along without drama but with strong pre-leasing and a physical presence at the corner of Rosecrans and Sepulveda, that can now really start to be felt when you drive by that intersection. The project remains on time and on budget for delivery next year. I think I'll stop there and pause my prepared remarks and ask you to reflect a bit about the stability and predictability of these results despite a very aggressive and relatively volatile part of the business plan represented by large, mixed-use development. It's such a testament to the engine that is the core portfolio as well as the development and execution. The balance inherent in this business plan is really the secret sauce to that continuing performance. Now let me turn it over to Jim for his remarks on acquisitions, dispositions, earnings guidance and capital markets before we open the lines to your questions. James M. Taylor: Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don just covered the quarter's key financial operational results, let me pause and deeply highlight again that this quarter's bottom line FFO per share at $1.23 not only matched last quarter's record, which was up -- and is up 6% year-over-year, importantly, this bottom line growth was achieved with stable occupancy while we continue to invest in future growth. A year ago at our Investor Day at Assembly, we laid out for you a pipeline of $520 million approximately of value creation activity, that we either have delivered or will be delivering over the next 12 months, importantly, on time and on budget. And again, through this period of significant investment in future growth, we continue to deliver bottom line growth that's impressive for our sector. Our margins have remained stable as well as our G&A. That disciplined growth and consistency is truly unmatched, all while we achieved the key operational and development milestones that Don just highlighted. Before turning to our outlook for the balance of this year and next, let's look at our balance sheet as well as our acquisition and disposition pipeline. During the quarter, we raised $50 million under our ATM at an average price of $124.71. We raised an additional $10 million from our sale of Pleasant Shops, our asset owned in the JV with ING Clarion, which sale we highlighted on last quarter's conference call. We ended the quarter with approximately $24 million in cash and only $11 million drawn under our $600 million revolver. From a leverage perspective, our debt EBITDA remains low at 5.3x and our fixed charge coverage strong at 3.8x. We still, importantly, have less than 1% of our debt floating and the stated interest rate on our debt maturing over the next 2 years is high at over 6.5%. Given how favorable long-term rates are today, we see this as an opportunity to repay some of this nearer-term maturity and significantly term out our debt at opportunistic rates. Stay tuned, but expect that we will capitalize on this environment in the very near term. From an acquisition perspective, we are scheduled to close, later this quarter, on the acquisition of a 375,000 square foot shopping center in Mountain View, California. This infill center, which is anchored by Kohl's, Trader Joe's and WalMart, is adjacent to Caltrain on approximately 33 acres in a very vibrant area of Silicon Valley. The average demos and density put this asset in the top quartile of our portfolio. The near-term opportunity here includes rolling right to market and repositioning and retaining some of the shop and smaller cog space, while the longer term opportunity includes adding additional density to the site, which has been owned privately since it was built. We negotiated this acquisition on an off-market basis for approximately $60 million at a current implied cap rate in the mid-5 range. The acquisition will be funded through the assumption of approximately $20 million of debt and the balance in cash and operating in partnership units. Importantly, like the Metrovation portfolio we acquired earlier this year, this Mountain View acquisition is a testament to the compelling liquidity and tax planning alternatives we provide to private owners of generational real estate. Last quarter, Don mentioned the $200 million shopping center that we have tied up. We're still working through diligence and structuring issues and at this point, the probability of closing is about 50/50. Like Mountain View, it is being negotiated on an off-market basis. Beyond that, we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities primarily located in our existing markets. As most of you have heard, pricing remains extremely robust. To that end, we have received first-round indications on the potential sale of our Houston Street asset in San Antonio, which we are in the process of evaluating. Expect more on this early next year. Now turning to outlook. We increased our 2014 guidance from a range of $4.90 to $4.94 to a range of $4.92 to $4.94. This increase is in part due to less downtime on rollover in the third quarter on some larger spaces. Importantly, we've also included approximately $0.02 of transaction costs associated with the Mountain View acquisition in this range. However, we have not factored in any debt prepayment or interest costs associated with any early repayment of debt, as the timing of that has not been determined. For 2015, we've provided an initial guidance range of $5.26 to $5.33 per share, or 7.5% growth at the midpoint. Again, stop and consider this type of growth that we're delivering or expect to deliver, as we're also investing in a significant pipeline of value creation. As usual, much of our growth will be -- will come from our same-store portfolio, which we again expect to grow in the mid-3% to 4% range, including redevelopments, on an occupancy neutral basis. We have factored the impact of the Mountain View acquisition in our guidance range, which we expect a lot of [indiscernible] . And from a G&A perspective, we expect to be slightly up to a range of $31 million to $32 million for the year. As for the sale of Houston Street and its impact, expect us to provide more of an update next quarter. Now with respect to the development pipeline that we're delivering and in order to help you better model 2015, I'd like to provide some perspective on the openings of Phase I of [indiscernible], Assembly and Pike & Rose and how it will impact us during the year. Let's start in Rockville, Maryland, at Pike & Rose where we delivered PerSei, the 174-unit residential building in the third quarter of this year. The building represents approximately $40 million as a first stage total investment, and is above 75% leased and approximately 6% occupied. We expect this building to stabilize during the first half of 2015. The 140,000 square feet of retail in the PerSei has started delivering late -- in late September of this year, with the opening of Del Frisco's Grille and the iPic movie theater which opened this week. For those of you who haven't been to iPic, please come, I'll take you to see a movie. It's great. We expect the retail to be completely open by the middle of 2015. Pallas, the 319-unit luxury high-rise with Strathmore retail will open in mid-2015 and is expected to lease up over 18 months. This building represents approximately $110 million of our Phase I investment. On the office side, the 80,000 square feet that we're delivering is currently 50% leased to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as previously announced. We feel good about the remainder of that space and expect to be fully leased by late 2015. Moving north to Assembly Row, we're over 95% leased on the retail, with 43 of the 59 retailers currently open, and expect the remaining retailers to open by early 2015. Based on these timing elements, we expect to realize a little under half of the fully stabilized POI during 2015 for the first phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly. In addition, as discussed in previous quarters, we also expect to continue to invest significant marketing dollars as we open these important projects and deliver this value. We are very excited by the important progress at both Pike & Rose and Assembly, projects that will provide significant opportunities for value creation and would set us well on our path to double our NOI in 10 years as we set forth at our Investor Day at Assembly last year. To that end, we plan to host an Investor Day at Pike & Rose in early April next year. So keep your eyes out for a save-the-date in the next few weeks. Before I conclude my remarks let me say that we're very excited that Brittany Schmelz has joined us to fill the very large shoes left behind by Kristina. We greatly appreciate all the contributions Kristina made, and wish her well in her new role at Intelsat. Brittany, who played point guard at college and has a Master's in urban planning, has gotten off to a great start. She looks like she may be a keeper. With that, we look forward to seeing many of you next week at NAREIT. And Operator, I'd like to now turn the call over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo Securities. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Jim, can you talk a little bit about the factors that are underlying your outlook for 2015? I think recently you had said that you thought NOI growth would accelerate next year. And I guess I wanted to get a little more detail. James M. Taylor: Well, I think what I said, Jeff, was that we expected to see a little bit of a downtick in this quarter as we rolled some significant space. As we look forward into 2015, we expect our NOI growth rate to be in that mid-4% -- mid-3s to 4% range, which again is on an occupancy neutral basis. Certainly if we are able to pick up some of the occupancy improvements that Don highlighted in the call we could be at the high end or above that range. But really on a run rate basis when you consider our portfolio is close to fully occupied, that's a reasonable level of expectation. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And I don't want to leave Don out, but Westgate -- out west is transitioning to maybe more of an outlet or discount orientation, it seems like, and somewhat similar to Assembly. Do you see Federal having a bigger role in the outlet business? And maybe, stepping back, is your plan to sort of morph Federal into this diversified player in retail : grocery-anchored, street retail, mixed-use, outlets? Do malls have a role at Federal? Donald C. Wood: Let me get to the last part first. Malls do not have a role at Federal. And really it's a different business, Jeff. The -- I think I've said before, we take a lot of pride in basically producing the right product for the particular environment they're in, despite whether it's grocery-anchored or outlet-based or whatever else. There is no question that having the well-located type of centers that we have -- and Westgate is a great example. Westgate was an old mall. And the notion of where that is going to service this community, the community going forward, you can't make it a good old mall. It's an old mall. So the idea of being able to take the demographics and the great location that we have and turn it into a value-based center, where we have had great success with tenants like -- these tenants, it's Gap outlet, it's J.Crew outlet. That's under construction right now. The Nike outlet concept is open, I was in it yesterday, it's blowing it away. It's about finding the right retail concepts for the locations that we're in. But the mall business is a different business and it won't be for us. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And just one last question. Out at Santana, I don't know if Jeff is on, but the rents you're achieving on Lot 8B, the new residential units out there, what do the rents you're achieving either in dollar terms or dollars per square foot tell you about the potential for the in-place residential authority there? Is there sort of an embedded upside? Do you see them sort of revealing that to you? James M. Taylor: Yes, Jeff, we have and continue to see a really strong demand across all the product here. You look at Misora, and clearly that's the top of the market, the newest, freshest stuff, which is getting rents north of $3 a foot. And if you remember, too, we still have a fair number of units were built now nearly 10 years ago. And those units are very well occupied and we've been able to drive rents in that product as well. Given the success at Levare, given the success of Misora, you'll see us next year and probably trickling into '16 look at doing some upgrades on our older product to capture that rent potential. Donald C. Wood: Jeff, let me add one more, a little bit more color to it. We're taking this call right know, the whole management team is at Santana. We're sitting in a conference room there because our board meeting was out here over the last couple of days. And I was going through Misora yesterday. I was going through it with the residential-leasing person, who has been here 10 years. She lives here. And she basically -- she blew me away. She could sell anything because she knows the place so well. She knows the 3 or 4 different residential type products that we have here. She is amazingly optimistic, based on what is happening with the Street and what's happening in the economy together, and it really does get to the point. If you haven't been to Santana in a while, take a trip. It's really compelling. And what it really does say is in these type of projects, if you do them right, if you continue to work them, the benefit, the premium to live here or to office here is -- it's real. We did just sign an office lease here with Avalon Bay. James M. Taylor: We're 100% leased in our office space. Donald C. Wood: And Avalon Bay is putting their west -- I think it's their western region headquarters here. A very strong market number to be here. It's all here because of the environment. It really works if you do it right. The upside continues. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason White with Green Street Advisors. Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Just a question, follow-up on Phase II of Pike & Rose. I was wondering how you walk through the -- I know it's a cohesive project and it's hard to strip things out, but when you look at the hotel and -- I was just trying to figure out how you underwrite those and what some of the assumptions are, and just how you get comfortable with adding those various moving pieces to this project? Donald C. Wood: Yes. Jason, it's a very good question, and I'm going to let Jimmy go through specifics with you in a minute if that's helpful. But the basic concept, we're putting together these environments, there's no question in our mind that it is the mix of uses working together that creates the upside at a premium above what normally happens with these uses separately. A vibrant hotel in the middle of one of these projects is a clear, clear positive. Now, we're not in the hotel business, so we need to figure out how to underwrite it and how to mitigate that risk. And I'm going to talk about that with the structure in a second. The same thing on for-sale housing. We're not in the for-sale housing business per se. But to the extent, we could, on a risk-adjusted basis, include those elements into the overall basic business of retail and renting apartments that we think we do pretty darn well, we really enhance the ability to get paid on the other uses. So it does come down to the structure of the uses that we don't know as well. And I'll let Jimmy take it from there. James M. Taylor: Yes. Jason, when you consider, as Don highlighted in his remarks, our investment in the hotel of approximately $5 million, that's in a venture with Buccini/Pollin, who is one of Hilton's leading developers, very well-established and successful hotel developer and operator. But what we thought was important is that we do get to participate through this investment, which is in a preferred structure, in the ultimate success of the hotel, which we think it will be very successful given the lack of truly comparable product in Montgomery County. But in terms of its relative investment in the overall project, it's smaller for the -- some of the reasons that your questions imply. But we're excited and we think it will fit well within what we're delivering. Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, one other question on your Assembly resi that Assembly -- or that Avalon is working on right now. I think they disclosed some leasing velocity in their earnings announcement. Looked like the prior period had really good velocity and then this last period had weaker-than-expected velocity. Is there anything going on there that's unique or maybe you can talk about your thoughts on Phase II, adding resi yourself based on their experience so far? Donald C. Wood: The overall experience on resi up there clearly has me envious. And when I take a look at any -- there is no trend in a month here or a quarter here, et cetera, with respect to leasing velocity. The -- it's Boston and the season is changing. And so I'm sure that's part of what's happening in that second building. Remember, they had 2 buildings there. The first one is done. And so you saw that initial lease-up in that first building that was really spectacular and, as I said, makes me a little envious. The second building that is there is really just being delivered and just getting started now. So I would expect them to have nothing to worry about as you get into next year. But it's certainly not because of a strong in one period and then weaker in the next. If you were there, and you kind of saw how it played out, you would understand our optimism. When we fit out and we think about the next phase that we're talking about right now, we do expect residential, as we've said in the past, additional residential in that second phase. We absolutely believe that market will be very deep for residential demand. And so there'll be some phase of residential. But we want that streak to be longer. We want the retail environment to be deeper than it is today. And even what it is today is outperforming what we had in terms of expectations. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with MLV. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : The Mountain View deal, I just wanted to follow that a little bit more. I'm sure we'll hear more about it in the future, but can you just give a little color -- I mean, also congratulations on that. Obviously, there's the big mixed-use project right next to it. How -- I mean, how do you see that as an investment? I mean, what's your, kind of, short-term versus longer-term plans there and the opportunity for densifying that? Donald C. Wood: Take it, Jeff. Jeffrey S. Berkes: Yes. I mean, Paul, you know the area real well and obviously you know the property next door that was developed by Ramone and Guirre [ph] that was built at a much, much higher density level than the property we're acquiring. And they've got a second phase to do there where they're going to add more residential and more office space. So that whole node is just kind of the heart of Silicon Valley right now, if you will. And short term we've got some -- a little bit of leasing to do at the property. There's a couple of vacancies. But we'll be working with the City of Mountain View to set the property up long term to match what's going on in the rest of the neighborhood. Obviously we have existing leases that we have to deal with. So the timing of all that is not clear and could be out there a ways. But as we've experienced in the rest of our portfolio, you never know when things like that will change. And if they do we'll be in a position to take advantage of it because it's just an outstanding location. It's like Jim said, close to Caltrain, not far from Google's headquarters, it's right at the corner of where Los Altos, Palo Alto and Mountain View meet. So location couldn't be better. Donald C. Wood: Paul, I have to tell you one other thing. How many times are we talking about building what it is that we do in the mixed-use basis and then having all the adjacent landlords effectively benefit as a result of that, and God, if we only knew more. Here we are in a situation where it's reversed. And I think you know Ramone and Guirre [ph] out here. These guys do a great job. And they've done a fine job in their first phase. They will, I assume, be able to continue and finish that up, as Jeff had said. And that can only be great news for the benefit to that -- north of the property that we are adjacent to. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Right. And now going to the other coast, with the metro now going to Tyson's and kind of Pike 7 is still sitting there in your long-term redevelopment pipeline, have you spent a lot of time there since the metro opening? Thoughts on what might happen over the next couple of years at Pike 7? Donald C. Wood: Yes. There's a number -- there's a lot of things we're thinking about. It is awesome to have the metro going there. We're watching numbers, by the way, month by month to see what's playing out. As I think I've said here in the past, we didn't want to be first to the game at Pike 7. What was really needed in that community was a nice big parking lot in front of a traditional shopping center. And that's worked out really well for us. As you see it grow now and as we'll be -- as we're looking at it, we do have adjacent property owners, and ironically Avalon is one of them, in the back, that if we put those 2 pieces together might be even a more compelling type of project going forward. We don't know whether there will be a deal there, but it's one of the things we're looking at. If not, simply on the existing property, because of where that metro stop stops, there will clearly be more density, but we can't tell you too much more about that yet. We've still got some years left in the leases that are there. Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly on -- a bigger picture has been a ramp-up in M&A recently in the space and you've, over the years, explored opportunities. And just wondering if -- the retail REITs have made a lot of progress, a lot of them over the past number of years, at pruning their portfolios, making them higher-quality, whether you think that as those programs get closer to fruition we might see kind of a continued stream of M&A and whether you think that it might get more appetizing for you, looking at other companies, given that they're making this progress? Donald C. Wood: Always possible, but I wouldn't count on it. When you think about capital allocation decisions, which is certainly what that is, in the biggest way, it's fantastic to be able to have controlled lands and controlled opportunities that we've got for years and years to come. So sure, if something were compelling, I know I've been looking for 15 years, I know I haven't found anything in a significant way that's compelling. So underwrite that low. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christy McElroy. Katy McConnell : This is Katy McConnell, on for Christy. Just another follow up on Pike & Rose. How are you thinking about the timing of construction and delivery of each of the different components for Phase II? James M. Taylor: As you think about Phase II, we're really looking at late 2016, early 2017 delivery. Much larger retail component in that phase, Katy. And from a staging perspective we're going to be delivering more of that concurrently so that we continue the Main Street, Grand Park Avenue there following on what we're doing in Phase I. So we -- in Phase I, of course, we'll be delivering Pallas, a high-rise residential building, middle of next year, and then obviously working towards the delivery of Building 6 and 7, some of the ancillary retail buildings on the street again for later delivery in 2016 and early 2017. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill. Ryan Peterson : Just wanted to get your thoughts on the -- where you're at in the South Florida market with cap rates continuing to compress there. Are you guys thinking about increasing your scale or is -- any thoughts changed on how you're handling that market? Donald C. Wood: No. No thought to change. In fact, I'd love to increase our scale there with the right type of products. But as you say, it's hard to make deals that make sense. We've said, I don't know if you heard in the prepared remarks that I went through, but I really did try to highlight Tower Shops just outside of Fort Lauderdale because of demand exceeding supply on the -- on that -- in that particular node, on that type of property, a large property. And we'd love to have a few more of those. There's a couple of things that we're looking at right now. But prices are high, so it's got to make some sense for us. Ryan Peterson : Okay. And then one other question on a different note. A lot of your peers over the past couple of days have talked about mall tenants and outlet tenants coming into some of their centers. Just wanted to get your general thoughts on whether you think those kind of outlet versus full-priced tenants and whether they can coexist in the same centers together? Donald C. Wood: There's no question in my mind they can. There's no question in my mind. Now, listen, every retailer has got their business plan. And certainly, when you talk about those outlet tenants, we just have experienced at Westgate. Nike will be there with Gap. Gap will be there with J.Crew. They clearly like to work together. But in that center, which also has a big Target, which has Ross, which has Old Navy, which has Burlington Coat, which has Nordstrom Rack, when you think of how they all work together -- there are also full priced small shop tenants in there. It can work together. But it depends on the particular environment and really what their choices are in the marketplace. If you've got a hole in the market, there's much more openness to be able to -- from those retailers to be able to do a deal where historically they weren't. James M. Taylor: Yes. And it's really all about location in that area, right? There's 200,000 people within 3 miles of Westgate. And Westgate is not that far from Santana Row and Valley Fair, which is the dominant full price shopping there, in this trade area. Yet we've been successful positioning Westgate to be the value alternative. And you can't do that everywhere, You can only do that where you've got this kind of population density and $100,000 a year average household income in that 3-mile radius. So it is very location-dependent. Just keep that in mind as you think through that across the country. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : Don, just maybe if you could give us a little bit of feel for how you're thinking about the new apartment project at Phase II at Pike & Rose relative to PerSei and Pallas and sort of how you're thinking about the market niche that that particular building will be looking to penetrate? Donald C. Wood: Yes. It's a great question and I did say, somewhere along the line in this call earlier, I was talking about Santana and the 3 very -- 3 or 4 very different types of products here and how they work together and aspirationally help. A resident who comes into one of our products looks to -- if they like where the environment is, they'd love to step up to something a little bit more expensive or move it along as they go. When you think about Pike & Rose, the PerSei building that we're leasing up very well now there is a -- it's a luxury product but it's not the high-rise. The high-rise is a different type of living experience and that's what the -- that's the next thing up. When you get to the second phase and we look at the product that's going there, it will be right on the street. It will be right in the center of the product. It will be directly across the street from the hotel and condos on top of that hotel with retail. So it will be in the center of the action. Some people like that; some people don't like that. The ability to create enough balance between different product types on the entire site is the key to making it all work out. So while they're similar, they're located differently, they feel a little bit differently, their height is different. But it's all going to be upper-middle product, if you will. Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, and maybe just taking a step back on the demand, and really the lease terms that you're writing for leases today versus maybe a year ago, where is the -- where are the escalators running at this point for your small shop space? Donald C. Wood: It depends. I mean, we target and we get in over half of our leases 3% bumps. 3% annual bumps is a big deal. Does everybody try to stop and negotiate, too, or something different? Of course they do. But in the small shops, in well-anchored shopping centers that we have, we're still largely able to get that. That hasn't changed very much at all. The biggest push from tenants, the biggest change over the years, and it's something that we think about and work on hard, is the capital requirements. There is no doubt that any well-capitalized tenant -- anybody who doesn't need money wants money from the landlord. And so we battle that. It's not nearly as much as the bumps, at least from my perspective, as it is the capital contribution. And we're not going to invest in anybody who we don't see a future in. So that's partly a credit decision, too. Big part. Operator : I'm not showing any further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Brittany Schmelz for any closing remarks. Brittany Schmelz : Thank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to seeing you next week at NAREIT. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and everyone have a great day.",

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end 2014 results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Brittany. Good morning, everyone. Looking forward to seeing all or - most of you in a few weeks to Citi Conference in Florida, so it\u2019s more about our company and our industry and I want to thank you for joining us on the call this morning. Well 2014 is in the books, it was the best year we\u2019ve ever had and by wide margin. I want to start by putting some context around the $4.94 per share or 7.2% year-over-year FFO growth that we just reported. As follows 7% year-over-year growth a year ago in 2013 and 7.7% two years ago in 2012 and keep us right on track double our income in 10 years, that you will remember, was the plan we laid out on our Investor Day at Assembly Row in 2013. The consistency of this performance continues for me to be one of the thing that most proud of. Seems to me that over the years, more and more investors everyday have come the value of that consistency and sustainability in the business that seems to be changing more and more every day. It\u2019s particularly noteworthy in 2014 because of the way in which it was accomplished. Research and development investments for the future usually detract from current earnings. I think drugs R&D in the pharmaceutical business or technology R&D in Amazon, but the objective is to ensure competitive advantage long into the future. In our business, that R&D is the development of marketing and the investment in top human capital that is focused on creating new state-of-the-art retail product that we believe will keep us on the forefront of our industry for decades, not just quarters. Whether that takes the form of the first of its kind large scale outlet, entertainment restaurant, mixed-use community like Assembly Row or whether it takes the form of the transformation of a pedestrian Strip Centre like Mid-Pike Plaza into a multi-phased mixed-use placed to be like Pike & Rose. Like, whether it takes the form of niche 48 unit active living residential building that we were researched, that are now building in the back of Congressional Plaza. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of our R&D if you will. Even though, the initial design, construction, lease-up and marketing did dilute earnings in 2014 and well again in 2015. In fact, our FFO per share growth would have been double-digit without them, of course, our future wouldn\u2019t be nearly as bright and our 10 year plan would be far or less short too. I hope, we always have us active in R&D pipeline as we do today. I know, we will for the next few years. I think, it sets us apart in a retail real estate business that is looking more and more generic and still going for ways to grow. Let me now go though some of the major accomplishments of the fourth quarter and the year. First, on the operating side, in addition of 7.2% FFO per share growth for the year, we grew at 8.5% for the fourth quarter when excluding the early extinguishment of debt in both quarters. Same store growth was strong in the quarter and the year 4.5% to 5% in quarter 4.1% for the year including redevelopment which by the way is what this business plan is all about. Our portfolio of that was 95.6% leased and 94.7% occupied at the end of 2014, right where it was at the end of the third quarter. Leasing was exceptionally strong, 83% deals were signed covering 340,000 square feet, 70 of those deals were for comparable space that is existing space when it was previous tenant and those deals were signed at $33.27 a foot. 20% better than the $27.76 the previous tenant was paying in their final year of lease. The 13 non-comparable deals related primarily to the lease up of the point at Plaza El Segundo in California. One of the drivers of the quarter\u2019s leasing results included the repositioning of Crow Canyon shopping Centre in San Ramon California where an underperforming lucky food store was replaced with a new Sprouts specialty grocer and a Orchard Supply Hardware store. Those deals followed on a new sports authority deal replacing a bankrupt Loehmann's earlier in the year and the buyout for an owner\u2019s ground lease to give us full control of the shopping centre. You could conservatively figure that this shopping centre is worth $35 million more net of the capital that was invested than it was before these actions. The other driver of those leasing results was the renewal of a couple of bank pads as significantly more rent than they had been paying. You know with all the talk and worry about changes in the consumer banking practices and the real estate needs. Myself included among the worriers, this part of our business has remained remarkably strong. The testament to the continuing importance to banks of attracting customer deposits in important real estate locations. Okay, some more things I would like to talk about before turning it over to Jim. The development updates on Assembly and Pike & Rose, the Point and Santana Row and some organizational shifts and new hires that give us the best chance of maximizing our potential. Jim will cover acquisitions and disposition. So on the development, let\u2019s start with a sample. The Greater Boston Community has clearly embraced the first phase of Assembly Row even if it\u2019s buried in snow at the moment. The retail is 97% leased, with 53 tenants opened and operating, most doing rather than either they or we had planned, and that includes the anchor system, comprised the LEGOLAND Discovery Centre, the AMC Theatre, Saks Fifth and the Restaurant who are all outperforming. In the office building, software developer SmartBear moved into their space a couple of weeks ago. We\u2019ve signed ROI with a digital media software company and lots of action on remaining 4.5, we\u2019ve seen dramatic improvement in the sales of the adjacent power centre that we call Assembly Square Marketplace, and we fully expect to improve its merchandising and profitability in the next 12 to 18 months, a direct result of success of the Row. We\u2019re also happy to report that the Partners HealthCare construction is on pace for occupancy that will begin in late 2016. Concrete is being poured, and T-stop is operating as expected. The impact of this first six or eight months strong opening in Assembly is a faster ramp to a 6% unlevered view and then beyond than we had anticipated just a year ago, It\u2019s very gratifying. We\u2019re just about done with design and planning for the next phase of Assembly, which will include a continuation of the retail street, residential above, a partnership with the Boutique Hotel operator and a street connection with a partner site. Cost need to be finalized a G&P contract negotiated, and other deal terms agreed to, where we hope to be able to announce the required approvals to move ahead on our next call. Last word on Assembly is to recognize the passing of our General Manager Russ Joyner last month. Truly one of the great guys in our business, the successful launch in this community was in no small part due to Russ\u2019s commitment, we will miss him. At Pike & Rose, lots and lots of onsite construction in these dates, as we broken ground on the next $250 million that we announced on this call last fall, while at the same time, we complete construction on that last building in phase 1 over the next few months, that means that two years from now, we\u2019ll have over $510 million deployed before selling a 100 condos, that is. On this site, in 9 buildings, 360,000 feet of retail space, 750 residential apartments, 100 Condos, 80,000 feet of Merrill Lynch anchored office, a 175 room Canopy Hotel and nearly 2,000 parking spaces. On stabilization, that investment should yield between a 7% and 8% unlevered return and we\u2019ll still have much, much more to do on this site. Let me bring you up to speed on where we are right now. And as I mentioned earlier, construction is few months from completion on the high-rise residential tower we call Palace. And we expect to begin leasing as planned in next quarter. Timing is great because our residential building called PerSei, is now 95% leased. A bit disappointing to us in the short-term are the average rents we filled the building up with the first time around. They are about 9% less than we had underwritten, in part due to the heavy construction during the entire lease up period on the site and also due to lots of supply coming on the market at one time. As a result, we decided to lower our underwritten rent expectations on the high-rise a bit and when combined with some additional scope on the site wide infrastructure that we now planed. We thought it prudent to reduce unlevered yield expectations on the first phase to the 7% to 8% range. The nice thing about residential leases is that they are generally 12 months long and so we\u2019ll get lots of opportunities to reprice as Pike & Rose matures and construction becomes more isolated. If Santana Row is any guide, we will more than make up for that over time. Every bit of feedback that we get on this project improves our confidence about the regions need for destination like Pike & Rose. And as particularly evident in the retail environment, we are creating. The Phase I retail is fully leased and has led by the extremely successful opening of iPic a luxury theatre experience that is soundly beating its and our expectations. No other iPic location has seen this level of success in its first 100 days of operation. Out west construction and leasing on our addition to the Plaza El Segundo shopping node with a 115,000 square-foot lifestyle centre called the Point continues on budget and on schedule, with tenants beginning to open this summer. Check it out when you are in a L.A., it\u2019s only three miles South of LAX on Sepulveda at Rosecrans. And at Santana, construction is underway on our $115 million 225,000 square-foot office building with nearly 700 parking spaces on Winchester, Boulevard at Olsen Avenue. It\u2019s being marketed as 500 Santana Row and will follow on the 125,000 square-feet of office base that already exist elsewhere at Santana Row. That office base is fully leased and has some very strong rents. The continued explosion of the Silicon Valley economy, the strong job growth and a growing reputation of Santana Row add the very desirable office address, as is very bullish about doing deals in this state-of-the art building over its 18 month construction period. All of which leads me to last topic from my prepared remarks and that\u2019s our team and organizational setup. We are clearly playing more aggressive offense these days and growing our overall real estate holdings pretty meaningfully, given this very substantial development platform. Accordingly we are consolidating our development efforts under newly promoted Executive Vice President Don Briggs. Many of you know Don is the guys primarily responsible for design and execution of Assembly. We are doing this to assure and we prioritize and allocate our formidable development talent across all opportunities of the company best on the best \u2013 best risk adjusted determination of likely value creation. Don has been with us for over 15 years and represents one of the country\u2019s most experience and most respected mixed-use developers. He will report directly to me, as well a new position that we\u2019ve just announced aimed at maximizing our residential profitability. You may have seen in our press release last month about Mike Ennes, who comes to us from Hilton worldwide and will join the team next month as Vice President of Residential Operations and Branding. We\u2019ve learned a lot and made a lot of money from the residential product that we\u2019ve been offering at Santana Row over the last decade. Bethesda Row, Congressional, Pike & Rose and soon Assembly need to benefit similarly, with simplify comfortably that higher end residential product in the successful mixed use environment requires a quarter back, one that can oversee our third-party residential managers while at the same time understanding, capitalizing on and integrating the different uses to provide a better residential service in private model, that\u2019s development, we are taking a different approach to operations, while we are consolidating and centralizing our developing group in residential oversight, we decentralizing our East Coast operating group and breaking it up a little differentially. The West Coast already operates on decentralized basis under Executive Vice President Jeff Berkes and now we\u2019ll be dividing up our East Coast portfolio between our mixed-use division and our foundational core shopping centre division. Our mixed-use division will be run by newly promoted Senior Vice President John Hendrickson who has been running our North East Region for the last seven years out of our Suburban Philadelphia office. John will relocate to Federal headquarters in Maryland in the next several months. In terms of leadership of the core shopping centre division, we feel like this is a great opportunity to add a senior level shopping centre operator to our executive team, there is a lot going on at the company these days, more than ever before, and the creation of a new position to lead and grow the core shopping centre division give us the chance to expand our senior team. Accordingly, we have instituted a search that Dawn Becker and I will be leading for a new Senior VP at the Core Shopping centre division, that division will include over 60 properties spanning from Boston to Florida and oversee nearly $300 million of property level income. We would expect to identify the executives in the next several months. These changes and the organizations below them recognized a changing real estate landscape and better align our company to take advantage of it in a most productive way. Frankly, I couldn\u2019t be more excited. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got for prepared remarks, let me now turn it over to Jim and look forward to taking your questions after that. Jim Taylor : Thanks, Don, and good morning everyone. As Don highlighted, our bottom-line results for both the quarter and the year represented yet another record of the Trust. As usual, a large driver was growth in the quarter which grew over 4% including redevelopment, while occupancy remains flat. Our results also reflected the successful integration of The Grove and Brook 35 acquisitions made earlier in the year, both of which outperformed our initial underwritings. A true testament to our partner Chris Cole and the team he has brought on Board. This year as Don also highlighted, we overcame several cents of drag from the openings of Assembly and Pike & Rose, the initial phases of which have now successfully delivered as Don has discussed in depth. Our balanced business plan continues to deliver bottom-line results while we invest in future growth. Value that, we are delivering today that will continue to deliver in the future. In addition, there\u2019s a larger multi-phase multiyear projects at Pike & Rose and Assembly, we should also highlight that we delivered over $90 million of redevelopments during the year at assets like Ellisburg, Santana Row, Barracks Road and Hollywood is very attractive returns. In addition of these projects, we continue to expand and execute upon a redevelopment pipeline of over $290 million of redevelopments like The Point at Plaza El Segundo, Westgate and even a new 48 unit apartment building that\u2019s being built as we speak right behind this conference room. In addition to successfully integrating The Grove and Brook 35 acquisitions, we also closed last month on the acquisition of San Antonio centre in Mountain View, California, which we announced on our last quarter\u2019s call. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about the potential for additional value creation at this phenomenal location, which comprises 33 acres in one of the most dense and affluent areas of Silicon Valley. This transaction, which was sourced off-market and structured on the tax preferred basis, truly to provide the type of acquisitions remains focused on executing. While asset pricing remains very high, against the backdrop of record low interest rates, we continue to actively pursue a few opportunities like San Antonio centre, where importantly, we believe that there is value to be added over time. We hope that further updates on our next call, but you can expect us to remain disciplined and focused on unearthing the right opportunities that fit our business plan. Turning to the balance sheet, we successfully raised $250 million of 4.5% 30 year notes in November and used about $200 million of those proceeds to pay off our 565 senior notes in our $61 million mortgage on East Bay Bridge. In so doing, we brought down the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt and importantly, increased our weighted average maturity by little over three years. We ended the year with $47 million of cash and nothing drawn under our $600 million revolver. This provides us with more than adequate capacity to fund our remaining development activity without having the access to capital market. Of course, with rates recently testing all time lows, we remain well-positioned opportunistically access this market to further term out our near-term maturities and fund our development pipeline, stay tuned. Turning to guidance, we have maintained our range, given last quarter $526 to $534. For those of you who have accused us of being sandbaggers and automatically move to the top of the range, allow me to offer some insights on why we gave the larger than usual range and the factors that will influence where we end up in that range. First the potential sale of Houston Street assets in Texas which we are close to having under contract, as I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, the sale is not included in our guidance, but will be approximately $0.33 [ph] diluted depending on the timing of the closing and how quickly we can redeploy the proceeds from the sale of this slower growing asset. We will update you at that situation progresses. Second, given a timing of the San Antonio Centre closing occurring this past January versus December, we incurred an additional $1.5 transaction cost this year. While we typically have cushion for such cost in any given year, we do hope to incur additional transaction costs in other opportunities that we are pursuing, some of which may be incurred prior to closing anything. Third, we\u2019ve made a strategic decision to continue to invest in R&D, as Don put in, investing in our people and our platform, so that we can responsibly scale into this massive pipeline of value creation that we have underway. As you would expect from us, we will not sacrifice the long-term for a few pennies in the short-term. I believe that we have most of this investment covered in our numbers, the transactional costs and other one-time expenses could also impact our numbers by $2 or $2. Finally on the investment side, we will always aggressively pursue near-term rollover and the related temporary decline in occupancy to create long-term value. It is always been a core tenant of our business plan and always well needs [ph], it\u2019s not a new initiative for us. However with recent announcements like to potential Staples Office Depot merger in the recent chapter 11 filing of RadioShack, in addition to opportunities at Assembly's tower centre that have become more real in light of Assembly\u2019s amazing opening performance. We may get the chance to generate some real long-term re-tenanting opportunities. Too early to tell what the extent the impact will be in 2015, but again we will keep you posted. Turning again to the larger timing assumptions factored into our guidance, we expect to deliver approximately $375 million in development and redevelopment this year. Some of the more significant deliveries includes approximately $80 million of offset space to Pike & Rose and Assembly which is been delivered in the first and second quarter of this year. We've conservatively underwritten 2016 rent starts and hope to beat those with the final lease-up. Approximately 77% of the retail Pike & Rose\u2019s delivered has occupied which includes the iPic Theater, Del Frisco\u2019s, Summer House, City Sports and Sport & Health among others. Now to the retail space which is 95% lease, we\u2019ll continue to open as planned through the middle of this year. Pallas, the 319-unit luxury high-rise of Pike & Rose which represents approximately $110 million of investment is slated to open this summer and is expected to lease up over the following 18 months. Finally, we expect The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo, which represents approximately $80 of investment is slated to open this mid-summer and stabilize in early 2016. Given this timing we expect our quarterly FFO to start lower in the first quarter and ramp significantly during the course of the year versus being flat. From a capital standpoint again, we expect to find approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment expenditures through long-term debt our ATM and our line of credit. As mentioned earlier, we remain opportunistic as it relates to rates and we\u2019ll always look to ways in this environment to term out maturities and reduce our weighted average debt cost. In closing, we have a lot of great opportunities delivering now for the longer term and could be more excited about how we continue to execute upon that business plan. That we laid out for you in 2013. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Wells Fargo and Citi conferences in the coming weeks. And with that operator we\u2019d like to turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Christy McElroy : Hi, good morning, guys. Just wanted to follow up on Pike & Rose Phase 1, if I look at the midpoint of the new total cost and projected return assumptions, I get to about an annualized NOI of roughly $20 million as stabilization, or about $5 million on a quarterly basis. Just thinking about sort of the retail and apartments that are currently online, I think you\u2019ve mentioned per se is 95% leased, and the retail is 77% leased. How much of that in NOI flowed through Q4 results? Don Wood : On a Q4 basis not a significant amount and remember the reason is that we continue to invest a lot in marketing plus we were leasing that apartment building up and experience related operating drag associated with that. We expect Christy, that to continue through 2015 because importantly we\u2019ll be delivering $110 million of the first phase is represented by building 10 which will open in the summer. We continue to spend a significant amount of marketing dollars if this project opens and we expect building 10 then to stabilize over the following 18 months. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just regarding your \u2013 the decentralization of operations on the East Coast, maybe you could talk a little bit about the impact on leasing functions between the mixed-use and core shopping centre portfolios \u2013 how the leasing process will change, if at all, with this new structure? And then Jim, to your point on guidance, is there any incremental G&A associated with the change? Jim Taylor : Yes, Christy thanks a lot of asking me about that. What we\u2019ve been doing for the last five years, really since the recession hit is really doing some very, very good blocking and tackling. And we divided the portfolio of between Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. The problem with that as you get into a more aggressive offensive posture is that what we\u2019re delivering on the mixed-use stuff takes a lot of time it\u2019s hard and the skill set on the leasing side is a different skill set that it is on the core shopping centre side. So being able to align that lease with specific management for those properties, we see is a real positive on both mixed-use and what it should do to the core. Because there is a lot more \u2013 it doesn\u2019t allow distractions between properties that do take more time \u2013 that do \u2013 have different skill set associated with them and the core, which is the horse and the thing that allow them to keep going. So, this is an alignment of leasing with the management of each of those divisions that \u2013 I doubt it will have a significant impact in 2015, but we are resetting this up for the long-term where we are going over the next 10 years. So, better alignment is what it\u2019s all about, it will not change the leasing process, it will focus the leasing personnel more with their operating count of point. Don Wood : And Christy, to answer your question about guidance, I think we are covered with in the range for the additional cost that we expect. But again, there could be some transitional cost or other things that we don\u2019t yet have forecast as we bring in the new COO for the core. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then, Jim, you also mentioned ATM issuance to fund redevelopment spend, is there anything embedded in your guidance for ATM issuance in 2015? Jim Taylor : There is, we expect as we have in the past to continue - to responsibly fund our development long-term. And that includes the balance ATM issuance and long-term debt and as you see we just did last quarter. We are encouraged by were rates are generally and look to push things out responsibly from a term perspective. Christy McElroy : So how should we think about total proceeds for 2015 from ATM? Don Wood : Yes, it tends a bit on after sales, but that expected to be in the $100 million range. Christy McElroy : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning guys. Don, maybe to build on Christy's question about just changing around management, what are your thoughts on planning for succession at a trend level -- maybe the industry's ability to generate good leaders? Because several of your peers have faced the prospect of finding a new CEO, and I think investors out there have been surprised at sometimes, I guess let's say, how shallow the pool is that people can choose from. I was curious what your thoughts were? Don Wood : Well. Jeff, let me make a couple of comments, first of all, I think it\u2019s an awesome question because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a small wheel, there\u2019s $10 billion in equity in this company and certainly investors in this company ought to have an understanding of what happens to, if I\u2019m not in this border or whatever else. And I can tell you, we treat this really seriously, so that every year, there is an in-depth part of our Board meeting there\u2019s a discussion about this. We have put in an interim plan, in case anything happens quickly with me in terms of how the Board would \u2013 what people would take over things et cetera which is really important to have as an interim plan. What\u2019s more importantly, in terms of a long range plan, I can tell you that I personally take it as my responsibility and the Board holds me accountable to this to develop people within this company that do have the ability to take over at some point. And I can tell you we do have people, and I know that I am working with to try to make sure there is more than one or two that have the ability at some point in the future. Outside of that, listen \u2013 it\u2019s a big world and there would certainly be a vigorous external process to the extent that was when the time came, because you never want to only rely on one spot. But whether there are great people out there or not I don\u2019t know, I certainly would expect there to be. But I wouldn\u2019t rely on solely that is for sure. Jeff Donnelly : Thanks. And maybe if I could just switch gears onto Pike & Rose. We had talked in the past about the threat of what's going on in multifamily in the DC area and how long it would take on this project. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you are thinking about that impact now for Pike & Rose. Specifically, what are your assumptions today where your lease-up is on multifamily versus the competitors? And what was it in the past? I'm just curious how much you have narrowed the premium, if at all, that you are expecting to get at Pike & Rose? Don Wood : No, I don\u2019t want you to make too much of this and let me make the point. I told you that as we\u2019re leasing this up, we\u2019ve missed our leased up per square foot numbers by 9% in that first building 9%. Now that I think is pretty indicative of not only supply coming on in the market, but if I were asking you to move into that apartment and used all the cranes and the concrete is being poured and the construction site that it is, I suspect you would be in a better negotiating position too in terms of being able to lease it that way. For me that I \u2013 we are trying to anticipate that into the Palace building also in about the same amount, the same thought. But I don\u2019t want to say this, I don\u2019t want to sell Cavalier, but big deals, because the nice thing about this 12 month lease process, as you go forward and we\u2019ve seen it at Santana; in fact just before the meeting I asked on. We pull together do you think what are our growth rate has been over 10 years at Santana and various different products and we don\u2019t haven\u2019t here, but we will and time for city, I think you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m saying by being able to create this kind of mixed-use environment, which other people do not have to head up to this level, we can see the people are coming in, the ability to push rams going forward is clearly better than in other type of more generics products through and through. So always trying be upfront with what your expectations are \u2013 we didn\u2019t feel comfortable keeping it at 8 to 9 giving what is happen with the first building being 9% off, and so just to appropriately lay out where we think we will be upon that first \u2013 is the first complete phase including Talas leased up. We bought it to 7 and 8, but I want to think about that as a max on this project long-term, because I do believe this like a family like Santana has a great growth profile associated with it. Jeff Donnelly : Just a last question, then for Jim. And maybe this is going back a bit in time, Jim, but at the analyst day in late 2013, I think you kind of laid out a plan for Federal that have a sort of a base-rate same-store NOI growth of, call it, 3% to 3.5%, with literally that\u2019s forms a redevelopment and acquisitions potentially taking that same-store NOI growth potential as high as 5% to 7%. I know a lot of time hasn't elapsed, but I think you guys have been kind of running around 3.75% to 4% same-store NOI since then, give or take. So how do you think you are doing versus that original plan? Because you have been acquiring; you have been renovating. Were you did expecting to be slightly better than this at this point? Or is it just because of the timing -- I'm just curious when you -- what your sense is. Don Wood : Yeah, I think we\u2019re right on top of where we expected and where we laid out. I think that that aggregate NOI growth also included acquisitions which you know what I would tell you is we remain disciplined and what \u2013 what you can take from acquisitions like San Antonio Center is that we are still able to find in the low cap rate environment opportunities that we think will be accretive to our growth in the long-term. And that\u2019s the discipline that we\u2019ve retained. We certainly could go out and drive a bunch of near term accretion, but diminish our long-term growth, and we are just not going to do that. But in terms of how the core is performing in what we laid out, I think we are right on track. I think \u2013 as I\u2019ve said before our rollover growth right now at this point of recovery is very strong. The other thing I\u2019d point out here is that we have been producing this really on an occupancy neutral basis which is important to highlight, because I think that on a comparative basis, it can look less robust, but when you are able to generate this type of growth on a portfolio that was 95.6% leased beginning year, 95.6% leased at the end of year. I think it speaks volumes to the job that our leasing team is doing led by Chris and the assets themselves. Jeff Donnelly : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler ONeill. AlexanderGoldfarb: Good morning. And, Jim, appreciate the guidance comments. We will watch the progress throughout the year. Just a few questions here. First of all, on the Pike & Rose, and just thinking about some of your other apartment development sites, if you guys knew that \u2013 I mean, obviously, supply doesn't suddenly come up; it's pretty apparent that people are building supply. So if you can just talk a little bit about how your underwriting may have been off, or what lessons you learned given that rents came in almost 10% below where you expected on the project? Jim Taylor : Yeah. No, first of all, you\u2019re dead on. Alex, there is \u2013 new supply is not a surprise; it\u2019s takes on the bills in hand, and it\u2019s was clear is to what was going to be there. What is never clear in a particular environment or at a particular leasing meeting your strategy or when you have a person on the other side of you, what it's that those competitors are doing with their rents was \u2013 that they are doing with their concessions and you do business in a marketplace. So, it\u2019s not about lessons learned in this case at all, frankly, in terms of the product that was coming on. I think we\u2019re right on. But to the extent, we are going to have competitors drop prices significantly or significantly increased their concessions we\u2019re going to follow soon because we want to buy the building. I do think where we did underestimate it was the impact of the construction on the site, and it\u2019s not like as a single building. It is a building within the middle of lots of stuff happening on it and I don\u2019t remember the last time that you\u2019re at the site specifically. But you know, when we do these phased projects we are going to lay if we\u2019re confident with what we are seeing in terms of demand in the first phase and we are, despite the fact that it\u2019s 9% lower on the actual rent by the way, they\u2019re in still a big number. It's not like we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s not like this is a 9% off \u2013 it\u2019s not a $1,500 month apartments. This is expensive stuff. So, it\u2019s still a big number, we are going to try to start the next phase as long as we\u2019re comfortable on top of the first phase to be able to create the critical math. So, if you are going to ask \u2013 it\u2019s really to say what it is that? We\u2019ve learned that it would be that first set of lease-up. We got to fill the building and the construction impact of that per se in a mixed-use project where you got lots of other construction directly adjacent to where you are asking somebody led it\u2019s going to be more than that we got. AlexanderGoldfarb: Okay. And then, it\u2019s \u2013 I think continuing the apartments you guys announced a new hire to head up sort of the branding of your residential platform. This is \u2013 should we think that you guys are going to take in-house and start doing apartment property management yourself or you are always going to outsource that or you are debating depending on how big your apartment platform becomes potentially taking that in-house. Jim Taylor : That's great question, Alex. Thanks for asking. There was no intention whatsoever to bring that business in-house not. The management companies, the residential management companies have spend lots of money on their infrastructure, lots of money on their systems, lots of money on fund, there were expertise are being able to do that, I would like to leverage that and pay a small couple of percent to be able to get that. That\u2019s not the same though as the overall senior leadership of how that's being done across a platform and that\u2019s the point of hiring mike. The point clearly is if you are going to build the type of stuff that we are building which is complicated we need to get a premium for that residential rent vis-\u00e0-vis what most residential companies get in terms of the rent. We are already getting that premium, and want it to be more and so putting a senior executive in there, that can effectively go over the top by the hallow if you will to \u2013 all the properties and make sure there this not \u2013 that\u2019s really uniformity but the creation of distinction that gives us a better chance of getting that premium and increasing that premium then I think you will pay from south 10 times over. AlexanderGoldfarb: Okay. And then just final question, you guys have announced a lot like people changes new positions you just basically announced a headhunter search for CEO type position. What\u2019s driving all this, was it where there certain instances where you suddenly realize that people were too stretched out or you weren\u2019t getting the organizational response that you wanted or is it simply as the company has grown bigger all companies have certain size they go through Grove and Brook and at certain sizes they just need more people or different organizational structures. Don Wood : Its far more later, it\u2019s exactly I mean, look at what this company has, look at what\u2019s happening at this company in terms of its breadth, in terms of its scope and what\u2019s most important about that, is taking the senior executives at this company and making sure that they are spending their time on the things that had the most value. So when I sit here and I look at Chris Weilminster across the table who won\u2019t have the direct reporting of the guy that\u2019s going to report up through mixed-use any longer. Chris could look at there, oh my god, that\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s not at all terrible those that \u2013 that those decisions need to made closer to the real estate so the Chris is effectively the senior most person spending his time on the big things that are really creating the extra expertise necessary on the big stock the same with Don over on the operating side. So this is a bigger company that simply does have people that have been stretched and stretched and stretched. And when you\u2019re entering the type of next five years that were entering into and what we are delivering, you want to make sure; you have your best people on the most important things. And building below that. A team that going to effectively succeed them. AlexanderGoldfarb: Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason White with Green Street Advisors. Jason White : Hey there, just a quick question. Then, when you look at your stock price for a trade, what do you think that trades related to NAV. Don Wood : Jason, isn\u2019t that your job? Jason White : Yes, but I\u2019m saying\u2026 Don Wood : I\u2019m going to turn this over to Jim. I truly don\u2019t have a good answer for you on this. The idea what we are trying to do is we are trying as best we can to put allocate capital to projects and to opportunities that creates substantial EBIT a long away. What is there? What\u2019s trading in the marketplace anybody can talk about where cap rates are? And you can do the math; you\u2019ve got all the income numbers there. So I\u2019m going to leave that to you. I really don\u2019t know how to give you a better answer than that, Jimmy I don\u2019t know Jason is going to be all [indiscernible] I didn\u2019t give him a specific number. You\u2019re welcome take it from here. Jim Taylor : Jason, when you look at where cap rates are today. And that \u2013 just from a spot basis and where interest rates have gone, obviously the correlation between REIT, pricing, and interest rates is parallel than the private market, in terms of where cap rates are? And those underlying interest rates. We continue to be really surprised by where we see assets trading. And importantly, you\u2019ll not talk about the soft line. But I think it\u2019s a point for broader discussion. These are often talks cap rates in the fore range. And assets that just aren\u2019t growing, and when you look at our company as an investment proposition and when you look at the amount of pipeline that we have underway are what we successfully delivered and derisked if you will. And the pipeline that extends beyond that. There is huge value in that that I know that if we were looking at it in an asset environment certainly would be factored into the pricing. So hard to pin an exact number because again we\u2019re in an all time low record interest rate environment. But I would think that we\u2019re not fully valued relative to that stock price. Jason White : Okay. The reason I asked -- I'm wondering if you use that relationship to basically fuel your decision-making on the acquisition development -- really, the capital allocation side. And if you either loosen up underwriting, or you get more aggressive? And then if your stock price trades relatively cheap or expensive, if your decision-making changes? Jim Taylor : It is absolutely, statically doest not. We\u2019ve really look at what we know and when we look at the assets and what we know is both the income is in place and what we think we have is good as you as anybody, is where that income is going to go, both in terms of in place leases, relative to market, but importantly what we see the redevelopment opportunities today and I would stake our development, the redevelopment team against any platform in the market in terms of understanding and underwriting that type of opportunity and, so when we look at acquisition, it\u2019s not with the spot view or an eye on our stock price, it\u2019s with the view towards, what will that investment do to our independent growth profile over time. So, and that\u2019s discipline will remain. Jason White : Okay. Just as kind of a final follow-up on that, let's say, for example, your stock traded off 15% or 20% over the next couple of weeks. Would you still be as aggressive in looking at acquisitions as you are today? Or does that change somewhat? Jim Taylor : Yes, I mean again. You know we look at it from a long-term perspective and we evaluate again what we think that assets going to contribute to our long-term growth, I mean\u2026 Don Wood : It takes me crazy Jason, to be doing it that way based on market fluctuations in the short-term. Jim Taylor : And I would Don Wood : Certainly just to make the point, I mean certainly we acknowledge what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and look at the \u2013 when you take a look at that our return thresholds and what we need to have to create value today versus five years ago or ten years ago that\u2019s obviously changed. But it\u2019s going to be in periods like that, it\u2019s not going to be in changes in the next several weeks. That\u2019s I think that\u2019s the full variant. Jason White : Okay. And then just one last discussion point on Amazon expressing interest to enter brick-and-mortar in a larger way. I'm not quite sure if that's going to happen yet, but how big is that opportunity for you as a brick-and-mortar landlord, to have potentially thousands of Amazon smaller stores floating around? Don Wood : Well, let me say couple of things. When you \u2013 I don\u2019t know Chris where do you want to answer this or not, you know for last 17 years whatever there was a new concept that was being talked about or whether \u2013 whenever there was somebody that was going bankrupt that going out, because oh my god, what they are going to do and one of the things l love about this business, I mean, I am sitting here in front of me with seven as our 20 radio check stores that will be given back, I am sitting here and looking at 13 staples and office depot stores that who knows what\u2019s our future. This is the opportunity and whether it\u2019s Amazon, you would certainly think that new retailers whoever they might be, who want to be in brick and mortar would look hard at the locations that we have. It\u2019s just hard to immersive if they wouldn\u2019t and so \u2013 I do that as a extreme positives, in terms of \u2013 brick and mortar retailing. I look at radio shack going away at the positive in terms of brick and mortar retailing and so from my perspective at least, this is what we do and the ability to be able to negotiate and create value has to happen with opportunities like this for any supply and demand. That\u2019s why the locations are so important. Jason White : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Smith with Bank of America. Craig Smith : Hi good morning. I'm going back to the new VP of residential branding. Is this job more to enhance the existing performance of the residential properties at Federal, or is he also helping to facilitate unit growth at Federal? Don Wood : Yes. And the only thing I would say \u2013 unit growth is much of the unit growth is baked in into the plans for the build out of Assembly, for the build out of Pike & Rose, for the build out of Santana Row, for the build out of the projects that we already have respectively under our portfolio, and so add those things are being planned and rolled out I want expertise there. Secondly, there is no question that with respect to the existing product. I mean the way I like to put it \u2013 Craig and you remember that \u2013 because you\u2019ve been around a long time, like I have here and what we\u2019ve done at San Antonio Row with respect to the growth of that project, with respect to the benefit of the residential has happened over 12 years now. 10 year or 12 years and we learned upon, I don\u2019t want it to take that long for Pike & Rose and for Assembly and for those \u2013 the other projects that we have. So having a senior level executive over the top, that make sure lessons learned on existing \u2013 from a prior experience can be applied to our existing platform, it\u2019s also important. So this is a senior guy, this is the ability to do both of the things that you laid out. Craig Smith : And is there any potential of going beyond the Rows and Pike & Rose in terms of adding multifamily? Don Wood : Well I think you know, any piece of land that we have, whether it\u2019s, if you are in our headquarters today Congressional you would see a building going up on the back of our parking lot, that\u2019s the second phase of building that we did 10 years ago on the back of our parking lot. So - in anyway possible within the retail but also residential in sometimes but small times less case in office is what we did to effectively take advantage of the real estate and take advantage of the retail environment that we created. So it won\u2019t just be the rows, I hope you will see it like we added up in Chelsea, Maryland \u2013 Chelsea, Massachusetts rather like you\u2019re seeing here at congressional we\u2019re looking at it at least we\u2019re looking at in a number plates throughout the portfolio. But you will not see us going out, and simply becoming a residential company. We\u2019re a company that tries to take the real estate that we have, the product that we\u2019re building and create the best uses with our mixed-use real estate. Craig Smith : Great, thanks. Thanks for that. Jim Taylor : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with MLV. Paul Morgan : Hi, good morning. Jim, just to get a little clarity, you talked about the ramp in FFO over the course of the year; and you attributed it, I thought, to things like Pike & Rose. But then you also said not to expect too much NOI contribution due to \u2013 a ramp in that due to all the marketing spend associated with the multifamily. Can you just help me reconcile : where is the brand coming from \u2013which projects over the course of the year from an FFO line? Jim Taylor : Yes. My comment on the Christy\u2019s question earlier was we still have drag in the year associated with marketing. But certainly as the year progresses we\u2019re seeing some ramp in NOI, both with the development Paul, and importantly with the redevelopment as well as that successfully delivers. And as you think about where it is in the year I think we could see a fourth quarter 10% plus higher than the first quarter. Paul Morgan : Okay. And then just sticking with the first quarter for a second, do you think there is going to be a big kind of weather-related number we should watch for on the expense side? Jim Taylor : Early to tell you. Certainly, what we are seeing in the Northeast in the snow in Boston in particular is significant Don Wood : So we\u2019ve had an easy Mid- Atlantic so far. So, no, I wouldn't suggest that you'd expect anything crazy at this point. But it\u2019s February 10. Paul Morgan : Okay. Then just going back to Pike & Rose again, I guess maybe a little bit bigger picture : how do you think about balancing the need to build -- you know, you mentioned noncritical mass there, with a big mixed-use project like that, where you are trying to get momentum; versus what has kind of been really a gap between demand, which has kind of been driven by sluggish job growth, and supply, which has been pretty aggressive. How do you think about the one thing where you really want to get momentum versus maybe if it were an isolated project, you wouldn't move forward? Don Wood : Yes, I don't think we are there, Paul. It's an excellent question; and, frankly, I love that you used the word balance in there, because it is a balance \u2013 the entire thing all the way through. It is the \u2013 the notion that there is not demand for the residential product is just wrong. The residential product, I mean, this \u2013 that first building is done. it's leased up and it\u2019s leased up in exactly the timeframe that we expect. So when you are sitting and talking about rents that are at $2.40 a foot versus $2.58 a foot or something like that, that on the balance equation is certainly not going to lead you to we are not building. In fact, in answer to that Alex\u2019s question earlier if we had thought harder about the construction impact and had laid out 7% to 8% at the onset here, I think you would have said Wow! That is fantastic that you are getting those kind of numbers, that's how I feel. And so you\u2019re right that there is that balanced question on these projects Assembly frankly have made it extremely easy for us, because on the retail side in particular is just it really has been accepted by the community, more much more than we had even hoped it to say. And as far as I understand, I\u2019m not talking for AvalonBay, because they don\u2019t know their numbers, inside that I have a feeling you will see us same from that. So going to the next phase of assembly again assuming we can get the numbers where you needed, and I hope you will, expect that we will, that one is easy. On Pike & Rose when you talk about it the way I just laid it out there is doubt we should be moving forward in my mind at least with the second phase to create the critical mass, but also because there is sufficient demand for the residential product, there\u2019re definitely demand for the hotel product, we think the condo product it's going to fly off, who knows it will be \u2013 what it will be, but we are very cautious to the balance that you talked about. And in both of those situation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s close with respect to non going forward. Paul Morgan : That's helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : Hi, Most of the smaller redevelopments look like they are stabilizing in 2015. Can you give us a sense as to what projects you have on page 17 of the supp are likely to become active in 2015/2016? Don Wood : Mike, I can speak to what we have currently on the pipeline, which is on the proceeding phase on page 16 and what we are always continuing to do with the list of projects on 17 is try to put them in the pipeline. So I expect as you go through the year, you will see that project or two as we\u2019ve consistently done over the last several years, but I don\u2019t at this point want to speak to specific lines on 17. Michael Mueller : Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Most of my questions have been answered here. But just going back to the management structural changes here, once all the pieces are in place, do you expect to get the full productivity of that changed structure by the start of 2016? On the development side of things, at least, is there an expectation that there could be some upward pressure on those yields as folks are a little bit more focused? Or was it not so quantitative as that? And then second question is : there was a shopping center acquisition that was being discussed last quarter. Just curious if that's now off the table? I know it was sort of 50%/50% at the time. Don Wood : Yeah, let me give you some thoughts on that. First of all, I do hope that 2016 would be the beneficiary effectively of the structural changes, 2016, 2017 and 2018 frankly as it heads up. On the development side there, I know it\u2019s not going to be about, I don\u2019t think upward pressure on the returns as much as it is, I hope, to getting to the things that have the best chance of actually happening done and going, it\u2019s about that prioritization where if you take a look at guys, I mean we\u2019ve got some great guys between Don Briggs, John Tschiderer, Evan Goldman, great construction and some other folks and I don\u2019t want anybody [indiscernible] off because I didn\u2019t say their name. What I am trying to say is when they go together and aren\u2019t in silos if you will on certain type of projects, I expect better productivity so that should mean more projects, so that should mean more projects sooner and that\u2019s the primary emphasis there. And I don\u2019t remember the last acquisition\u2026 Jim Taylor : As it relates to the acquisition at this point then I would rate it as a little probability. We do have other opportunities in the pipeline that we hope to be talking about very soon. Vincent Chao : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St Juste with Morgan Stanley. Haendel St Juste : Hey, I guess, it\u2019s good afternoon now. Don, I don't want to make too much of this, but just one more question on Pike & Rose, if you will. Hindsight is 20/20. Just thinking or wanted to get your perspective on if you think you might have been better off partnering with, perhaps, an apartment specialist, like you did with Avalon at Assembly Row? And I'm curious if the experience might change how you approach the multifamily phases of your mixed-use projects going forward? Don Wood : No Haendel, it doesn\u2019t. There is \u2013 I love the notion of building apartments in markets with mixed-use with our retail street in markets that we know inside now. And I don\u2019t want to sound apologetic I mean the idea of $2.40 a foot in the first building here under a \u2013 in this situation with the construction going. This is good stuff and I with love in fact, we are going to have an Investor Day, I am going to announce it right here. We are going to have an Investor Day. We are going an investor day at Pike & Rose this year. Because I really do want to show everybody what we are talking about. Now I got to tell you, I think we are fairly good, really good, apartment developers in the mixed-use context. And, so I don\u2019t know very many people who are putting this kind of capital to work between 7 and 8 with this kind of mix of product. So, now I wouldn\u2019t change any of that, but I will get you down here in get it through we see. Jim Taylor : And Haendel importantly on those returns relative to where these types of assets are trading the value creation is still very significant. Haendel St Juste : I appreciate and understand that. A question on a small shop here. You guys are up at 91.8%. Getting close to a level where some of your peers have talked about their high-level, high-water mark \u2013 92%, 93%. I'm curious on your thoughts on where you think your small-shop occupancy could get to? And then just on pricing power as you now get to 92% -- how much more, perhaps, you could push right here? Jim Taylor : I have got two funny comments together. The first is, I do agree that 92% and 93% is - I think we have one point we are in the mid 93% on small shop. At the height of 2006, 2007 we certainly hope to get back there and have a very stout effort at trying to do it. The funny comment is whenever you talk pricing pressure, and I look across the table, and I see the head of leasing, Chris Weilminster \u2013 he puts his head down and start smiling, because I appreciate you are doing that, for putting pressure on him with respect to that, I am going to answer for him on that : it depends. That is a one-off negotiation-by-negotiation dynamic, we do the best we can. Do I think that by being a more leased rather than less leased that is overall a good thing for us, yes I did there is no question about it. In terms of that, can I quantify it, for you no I don\u2019t. Most of the space that\u2019s left and not leased is not obviously the best space in the portfolio. So where I would rather go is there actually not emphasize the lease rollovers as much and push hard on that other 6% or 7% that is not leased up there to be able to get it done at any rates. And then often we hold I\u2019ve not hold off but effectively work hard to get full rent and some of that stuff you can\u2019t. So you may actually see lease rollovers come down a little bit as the occupancy goes little bit further again that\u2019s the balance, that\u2019s the overall mix between rate and volume. But you should see I hope you will see some increases to that to the small shop number overall. Haendel St Juste : And just to follow up on that, given, as you mentioned, it is perhaps not some of your best space, and it might take a bit more effort, how should we think about, perhaps, the incremental capital you might need to invest to lease-up that space? Jim Taylor : We won\u2019t do deals that don\u2019t make sense. So you should think about it as I mean, just think about what you just said, if you\u2019re talking about the lease attractive space in a shopping center to the extend we can do as it deals to the extend we do a small amount of capital will make it make sense we will do that. To the extend in the spaces that we\u2019re generally talking about here putting a lot of capital and just to get occupancy we won\u2019t do that because makes more sense on a capital allocation basis. Haendel St Juste : Okay. And then a quick comment, if you will, perhaps, on the 13 Office Depot/Staples that you mentioned \u2013 I'm curious on sort of what conversation you are having today; what type of opportunities you are seeing about filling the spaces; and just a point-in-time snapshot, perhaps, of today \u2013 where those rents are versus perhaps what the market for rent? Jim Taylor : As I said we\u2019ve got nine Staples we\u2019ve got four Office Depot spaces throughout the portfolio in almost uniformly when we look down we should be able to at least meet rents and frankly probably meet rent in almost all locations. There are some conversations about downsizing state of locations which we would love to do to the extend, we\u2019ve got demand that exceed supply in the three cases we\u2019re talking about it we do. Its like everything with us we like to see when they plays out but this kind of changeover whether its Staples and Depot whether its RadioShack I mean generally this is good news for us, this is not bad news and we expect that to continue. A \u2013 Don Wood : The one thing I would add it is very early in the announcement of this conversation between the two. So there is really no conversation yet about what stores they would or wouldn\u2019t be, if that were to happen and when we looking at our portfolio, there is only a few markets where the stores really truly overlap. So I think Federal even though there is upside in those numbers which we believe, I am not sure that we are going to have a chance to get to them. \u2013 through as many of them as we would like. Haendel St Juste : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nathan Isbee with Stifel. Nathan Isbee : Hi good morning, good afternoon. Don, you mentioned the long time it took for Santana to evolve. And clearly, there were some challenges early in the process there. I'm just curious, as you look at all the different pieces that have come together there, what is Federal currently yielding on that total project? Don Wood : Guys I don\u2019t have that here, but I suspected seven plus. Nathan Isbee : Right around 7%. Okay. Thanks. And then just focusing on White Marsh for a second : what are your thoughts about the pending new development there? You clearly have less skin in the game than others, but you still have some skin in the game. Don Wood : Well, I can tell you, Nate, the last thing we do is put our head in the sand. So we\u2019re - we\u2019re talking with that developer who trying to assess, what that developers plans are. What\u2019s actually going to happen versus what\u2019s planned, Is there something we can do to protect our assets, our shareholders and so nothing decided effectively that way yet, but we are absolutely in conversations with Paragon to make sure we build the relationship and find out what\u2019s the \u2013 if there is place where we can the skin cat so it works for everybody. Nathan Isbee : Okay, thanks. Operator : And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brittany for closing remarks. Brittany Schmelz : Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to seeing you at the Wells Fargo and Citi conferences in the next few weeks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Brittany Schmelz. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Brittany Schmelz : Good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty's first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood; Jim Taylor; Dawn Becker; Jeff Berkes; Chris Weilminster; and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Certain matters discussed in this call may deem to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although, Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions. Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K, and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our website at www.federalrealty.com. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter 2015 results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Brittany, and good morning, everyone. Well, we have got a lot to talk about on this call, this quarter with some acquisitions, dispositions and personal appointments, in addition a very robust development and operational updates. Jim will cover acquisitions, dispositions, balance sheet, some operations and earnings points, and I will try to cover the rest before opening up to questions. I don\u2019t think I have ever been as grateful for the arrival of spring -- a spring of this year. Snow removal expenses topped $10 million in the quarter, doubled what we forecast. And while the strength of our leases allows us to past-through over 85% of that costs, residential, office and some retail leases, along with vacancy, build from that recovery and accordingly our first quarter FFO per share were $1.26 was negatively impacted by over $0.02 a share, good year for Boston in particular. Other than the weather, the company continues to perform well and in line with our expectations and early anecdotal evidence suggest that cooked up Northern Eastern shoppers are more anxious than in most years to get out and shop and eat as spring has arrived. We are certainly seeing that at Assembly Row, okay, enough about snow. Rental income growth in the first quarter was strong at 9%, as the same-center growth of 3.6%, despite only $500,000 in lease termination fees this quarter versus $1.5 billion last year. Those fees are such an integral part of managing our business and we always include them in our same-store numbers, as we do with all financial impact to running the shopping centers. Sometime they benefit the comparisons, sometime they hurt it, we live with a new way. In terms of leasing it was a good quarter. We completed 86 deals, 75 of them for a quarter million square feet of comparable space at average rents of $37.50, 11% more than the $33.70 per foot, representing the last year in the former lease. Both leases with new tenants and renewals of existing tenants were profitable, and grew at 16% and 8%, respectively. The capital include in those new deals was consistent and in fact, a bit lower than last year\u2019s first quarter, diverting much in line with the past couple of years, which I view very positively. California in general and Silicon Valley in particular continues to lead the market we do business in. In terms of leasing demand, exceeding supply and the product that we offer with Boston and New York Metro following closely behind, really strong. The other market we do business in, particularly, Washington DC are good, but are not exhibiting the same leasing power and strength that we are experiencing at west at this point in time. A few years back was just the opposite, reminding us how important the geographically diversified portfolio is, the business plan that provides us consistency and stability. Occupancy remains strong in the quarter with portfolio of 95.4% leased, just slightly up the 95.6% leased percentage at the end of the year and last year\u2019s first quarter. On a same-center basis, we were 96% leased, up slightly from the end of the last year. All-in-all, these are very healthy times in our business. Let me move on now and report some development news. The early success of Assembly Row made a really clear to us that commercial and residential demand in and around the site wasn\u2019t satisfied with the first phase. Earlier this week, our investment community and then Board approved the next phase of Assembly Row. This newest phase will include an expansion of the retail street in the connection with the ground in the second floor retail in the Partners HealthCare building. All-in-all, the additional 167,000 feet of retail for the project, 447 row apartments, the Federal will build to manage 155 rooms with Tico tells to be owned in the partnership with New England based XSS Group, the deal is not done, but its awfully closed, and 117 for sale condominium sitting eight floors above the hotel. Excluding the condos, we have committed and appropriated up to $285 million for this phase and expect to yield an unlevered return of about 7% in the first full year of stabilization. Appropriated capital for the condos approximate $65 million, while we expect in lease-hold at net proceeds significantly above that cost, we are assuming breakeven in Phase II disclosed returns. Assembly Row continues to perform extremely well, but the only material portion of the first phase remaining to be leased is about half of 100,000 square foot office building. Assembly Row and the adjacent Assembly Square marketplace have really begun to solidify themselves as an important new shopping and entertainment district in the market, feels great. And when the second phase is completed in late 2017, early 2018, we will still have much more to exploit on this site. At Pike & Rose in North Bethesda, Maryland, you will see a fully leased and occupied residential building hold for sale. We only leased first phase retail components of the project, with openings continued through the -- continuing through the summer and an office component with Merrill Lynch and Bank of America moving in as we speak and otherwise being negotiated on the balance of the space. We\u2019ll begin leasing the second residential building called Palace next month and the Phase II parking garage is well under construction and will alleviate limited parking pressures by September this year. Around that same time, construction begins on the next two building that will extend the main shopping street. We should have some pretty interesting retail leasing announcements over the next few quarters based on the interest that we\u2019re seeing. Lots and lots happening at Pike & Rose. By 2017, we\u2019ll have over $510 million deployed on that site in nine buildings before selling 104 condos, that is, 340,000 feet of retail, 757 residential apartments, 104 condos, 80,000 feet of Merrill Lynch anchored office, a 177 room Canopy branded hotel and nearly 2,000 parking spaces. And like a family, we\u2019ll still have much more notably on the site. The point in El Segundo, California, will open up in late summer with additional tenant openings continuing through FFO and beyond. This intersection Sepulveda at Rosecrans with the addition of the point and considering the adjacent Plaza El Segundo shopping center that we control and operate has really become incredibly dominant and important to the beach communities. We expect it to become more so with the new centers open. At Santana, construction of the office building addressed as 500 Santana Row at the San Jose site continues on schedule and on budget. The continued strength of the Silicon Valley economy, the strong job growth and the growing reputation of Santana Row is very desirable office as it is very bullish about doing deals in the state-of-the-art building over its remaining construction period. In terms of our important search for a Senior Vice President of our core shopping center portfolio between Boston and Washington DC, we\u2019re down with two final round candidates and expect to make a decision announcement within a couple of weeks, maybe sooner. Fortunately, I have been really impressed with the quality of the candidates we have seen, feel really good that the enhanced focus on the shopping center site of our business will be fruitful over the next few years. On the mixed-used side, you may have read that our very own home growing choice to lead the operational side of that side business, John Hendrickson, was wooed away by Ramco Gershenson to service their CLO. Until that process begin before, John was promoted to his latest role at Federal. I think the world of John. I wish much continued success. But this is the Federal Realty earnings call and as such I\u2019m thrilled to announce that Dawn Becker will assume the role of Executive Vice President Mixed-Use Operations in addition to her General Counsel responsibility. As I said on last quarter\u2019s call, our company has grown significantly over the past several years in the bifurcation of core and mixed use necessary service each. Dawn\u2019s skills and background, her relationship with the senior team partners and respect throughout this organization to make her perfectly suited to this role. It\u2019s a great ask. We\u2019ve got more to talk about in terms of our most recent Florida acquisition, future acquisition prospects and are egged from San Antonio, Texas along with balance sheet and earnings considerations. For those and other items, I\u2019ll turn it over now to Jim Taylor before opening up the line for your questions. Jim? Jim Taylor : Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. As Don covered in his remarks, this quarter has been an extremely productive one and a continued successful execution of our business plan. I will briefly touch upon some financial highlights, our balance sheet activity, acquisition, disposition transaction in our outlook for the balance of the year. Overall, property operating income grew at 6.9% year-over-year even with higher snow cost. As usual, same-store growth excluding redevelopment was the largest single driver of that growth at 3.7%. That same-store growth was driven primarily by rental rate increases both contractual and embedded ramp-ups and rollover versus occupancy. Redevelopment contributions from successfully delivered projects such as Hollywood, Misora, Santana Row and Westgate were largely offset by the down time as we redeveloped the asset such as East Bay Bridge, Quince Orchard in Maryland as well as with our lease term fees this year. Developments at Assembly and Pike & Rose contributed approximately 250 basis points of growth or approximately $2.5 million of POI. Finally, the benefit of the San Antonio Centre acquisition in California drove the balance of the growth. In sum, each of the elements of our long-term growth plan that we articulated over a year ago continued to deliver. G&A increased approximately $1.1 million year-over-year due primarily to transaction cost associated with the closing of San Antonio at the beginning of the quarter as well as slightly higher personnel cost as we build our platform for growth as Don just discussed. Even with that incremental investment on a run rate basis, we expect our G&A margin to trend below 5% as we drive topline growth and maintain strict discipline on expenses. Interest expense were a $1 million due to lower capped interests as we delivered approximately $300 million in development, offset by lower rates as we continued to bring down our weighted average costs as well. Bottom line, FFO grew about 7%, when you adjust for the impacts of higher sale and transaction costs. Again, this growth was achieved while we continue to invest in the long-term, Turning to the balance sheet. We successfully raised an additional $200 million of third year debt and an effective yield of 4.18%, a record in the REIT industry. We used the proceeds to redeem our 2017 6.2% notes, bringing our weighted average rate down to 4.4% and importantly, extending our average tenure to 10.5 years. Again, consistent with our long-term focus, we opportunistically executed upon historically low rates and a flat yield curve to capitalize our growth pans. At quarter end, we had approximately $175 million of cash with nothing drawn under our revolver, providing ample liquidity for growth. Speaking of growth. On the acquisition front, we were very pleased to announce earlier this week the closing of CocoWalk for $87.5 million. CocoWalk is a $200,000 square foot lifestyle center located in the heart of Coconut Grove, Florida. With the trade area boosting some of the best demographics in Miami-Dade County, the hit and vibrant street retailers in the center Grove District serves the most excellent year around communities of South Florida, including the Grove Coral Cables in South Miami. CocoWalk was acquired on an off-market basis from an outstate private company with no local presence. We partnered on the acquisition with local sharpshooters, Grass River Property and The Comras Company whose on-the-ground presence, operating and leasing expertise complements perfectly our national mixed-use and retail platforms. We expect to drive significant value creation of this prime location through redevelopment and remerchandising. Also, please stay tune, as we expect to capitalize another opportunities within this year around section of Miami-Dade County. On the disposition front, we successfully closed on the sale of Houston Street, following the end of the first quarter. We sold this for $46 million for a hi-fi cap rates, realizing a gain of $11 million on an asset where we saw limited feature growth. Finally, during the quarter, we successfully integrated the acquisition of San Antonio Center in Mountain View, a truly phenomenon off-market acquisition with tremendous upside in the heart of Silicon Valley. We are pleased that even in this competitive environment, we\u2019ve been able to find attractive investment opportunities in these highly desirable costal markets. Turning to guidance. We maintained our range of $5.26 to $5.34 per share excluding the debt repayments. Let me offer against some insight on the factors that will influence where we end up in that range. Each of these factors I\u2019m about to discuss reflect careful decisions we continued to invest in long-term growth. First, the sale of Houston Street. As I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, this sale will be approximately $0.025 dilutive to our original forecast. Second, Don mentioned, we incurred approximately $0.02 of snow removal costs beyond what we expected this year. Third, we expect the acquisition of CocoWalk to be neutral FFO this year given transaction costs. But we do expect it to contribute significantly following its repositioning and remerchandising. We are active on other acquisition opportunities and may incur additional transaction costs before we close anything. Fourth, we made a strategic decision to continue to invest in R&D as Don just put it, investing in people on our platforms so that we can responsibly scale into the pipeline of value creation we have underway. Again, I believe that we have most of this investment covered our numbers, the transitional costs and other one-time expenses could impact our numbers by absolute penny or two. Finally, on the investment side, we continue to aggressively pursue near-term tenant rollover and the related temporary decline in occupancy to create long-term value. This activity along with lower than usual lease term fees that we expect to realize versus the prior year will likely cost our same-store NOI to decelerate slightly in the second and third quarters. But we still expect to average 3% to 4% for the year. Turning again to larger timing assumption factored in our guidance, we expect to deliver approximately $375 million in developments and redevelopments this year. Some of the more significant deliveries include approximately $80 million of office space, Pike & Rose and Assembly, which is being delivered in the first half of this year. As I detailed last quarter, we have underwritten primarily 2016 rent starts to reflect lease-up timing as well as revised periods. The retail is fully leased in Pike & Rose as Don just mentioned, with 85% of the space now open, including iPic Theaters, Del Frisco's, Summer House, City Sport and Sport & Health. The balance of this retail space will continue to open as planned through 2015. Pallas, the 319 unit high-rise, which represents approximately $110 million of investment, is slated to open this summer, is expected to lease up over the following 18 months. Given that timing, we expect it to be a drag down violator this year and early next as it reaches the stabilization towards the end of 2016. We expect the planned redevelopment of Pallas House condo, which represents approximately $85 million of investment to open late summer and stabilize in 2016. From a capital standpoint, we expect to fund our approximately $250 million of development and redevelopment expenditures this year as well as any acquisitions through free cash flow, long-term debt, our ATM and our line of credit. As mentioned earlier, we remain opportunistic as it relates to interest rates and we always look for ways in this environment to term out our maturities and reduce our weighted average debt cost. In closing, we have a lot of great opportunities delivering now for the long term. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about how we continue to execute upon our plans, a plan that should reliably produce growth, 7% to 9% per year, growth largely driven by opportunities that we own and control today and moderated by our discipline to continue to invest in the long term. We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT next month. And with that operator, I would like to turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jason White with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open. Jason White : Good morning. Don Wood : Good morning, Jason. Jason White : I was curious when you\u2019re looking at the new T-SOP at their Boston, what your expectations were for shopper traffic and how that\u2019s kind of trending now that you are open and things are rolling? Don Wood : We are just talking about that, Jason. When you look at the orange line and I don\u2019t have numbers yet. I wish I did. We can get them in terms of who is coming off and who is coming on. When you think about it, while Phase I is open and the residential is open upstairs, traffic continues to build. Now within less than two years we are going to have 4700 employees, who are going to work everyday for foreigner healthcare and you will have the second phase opening. So I think you will see going from zero upper rents, that\u2019s pretty steady between now and the next few years. I mean, obviously, it\u2019s a critical park to making that land a whole lot more valuable than it was before. Jason White : Okay. And then on staying on Assembly, is Phase II retail going to include outlet type tenants as well, or is it going to have a different mix? Don Wood : It is. It\u2019s going to be a continuation of what it is, that\u2019s working so well in the first phase. Jason White : Okay. And then Pike and Assembly of some for sale condos, what are those bringing to property and why those that have just more apartments, I mean what\u2019s the analysis on why you put for sale in there versus the rent? Don Wood : Well, first of all, they make money. I don\u2019t want it to be viewed as a subsidy if you will, it\u2019s not subsidy at all. We evaluate the markets and we believe we are going to make money on them. Even though we are very conservative in the way we are disclosing them in the 8-K, but I will tell you when you look at the communities that we are building, they are on critical part. These are living communities. They are not Disneyland. They are not pretty picture on the front of the annual report. So it\u2019s a half product in within the apartment product. It\u2019s not like we build the same buildings with the same consumer in mind or renter in mind, they are different products and this kind of row has showed us that in the best -- has the best example. Similarly, having some level of for sale, now we are public REIT and we are certainly all about a long-term interest rate. So we are not going to do a lot for sale units, but they have some of that product just like growing levels of apartment product is critical to making the whole community work as one. Jason White : Great. Thanks, Don. Don Wood : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning. A question about the condos at Assembly Row. There is not a lot of comps in that immediate area and I was just curious if you had any I guess what call the numbers best way, you can thought about underwriting the sales prices there eight per unit or per square foot? Don Wood : Yes. We do. We have. We have done a lot on and thinking about it. And I can tell you that conversations that we\u2019ve had not only with Avalon and the renters and how many of those folks are asking for sale unit plus also with respect to partners and then coming in there and the kind of dearth of that type of product available outside of Boston. I mean, what we are building will be a far more of an urban condo product and when you look at the comps up there and I know they aren\u2019t a lot of that math exactly. It sure feels like demand will significantly increase supply to 100 units or so. As specific conversation with Don Briggs, while you are up there Jeff, can give you a whole lot more. And we\u2019ll be talking a whole lot more as we get on the way. But the market research says, this is absolutely the right thing to do. Jeff Donnelly : And I\u2019m just curious in broad strokes -- how do you think what the rents at Phase II both multifamily and retail or how will they compare the rents in Phase I, once you\u2019re sort of stabilizing through any kind of initial presence? Don Wood : Well, listen, we will see right. We\u2019re going to push hard and let\u2019s talk about the retail, first. The single biggest and that we\u2019ll be pushing for harder in the second phase versus the first phase is more fixed rent less percentage. And that should be attainable based on the success of the first Phase. But overall, we would expect higher numbers, combined fixed plus percentage in the second phase then first phase and that\u2019s simply less risk because of the first phase they open. On the residential side, you can talk Avalon in their call stuff but boy, they\u2019re really strong. The rents they\u2019re getting are really strong. And the product that we were building is differentiated. Remember, they built two types of product, they\u2019ve got the AVA and the Avalon product in two separate buildings in Phase I. And so just like we\u2019ve seen at Santana Row, and kind of what I\u2019ve just seeing adjacent, there has to be a balance of product type there and one of the buildings we\u2019re building there on the residential side is high rise. So those views that will be a different product, those rents will be a bit higher, although we\u2019re not underwriting them to be a bunch higher at all, with whatever Avalon is achieving today. So we feel like we\u2019re underwriting it very reasonably. We feel like the product will be significantly bit differentiated. Do I expect there to be stabilization when you put a bunch of new product on the market. Do I expect there to see some rent pressure on the lease up, particularly with the Avalon side versus this, I\u2019d sure I do but your questions are right one. Upon stabilization, I think you\u2019re going to see clearly underserved residential market here with the street that is just killer. So I\u2019m going to say that. Jeff Donnelly : If I could switch gears, I guess, first I want to congratulate Mr. Hendrickson on his decision to seek a warmer climate in Detroit. I\u2019m just curious on, I mean, last quarter you talked about creating a mixed use in core property roll. It seems like the impetus there was just sort of focused personnel on those specific area and so, no disrespect to Dawn but I guess, why double up her responsibility, she already had a lot on her plate with her existing role [indiscernible]. Jim Taylor : That\u2019s so funny because you remember, she had the whole thing. It was clearly too much, right. She had mixed-use and the core, clearly too much particularly, when we\u2019re bringing things like Assembly and Pike & Rose to fruition. So from her perspective, I don\u2019t think, of course. She is welcome to speak for her. This is far more manageable for her. And on the core side, I mean if you just think about it, Jeff, really as this stuff comes together, it clearly is hard to give each business the attention that each business needs when you\u2019re delivering large project like this. So having her work closely with Bridge, with Weilminster, with two deals that the team effectively, that is bringing mixed-use out, makes all the sense in the world to us and I think, you\u2019ll see it when you see the core team that we\u2019re putting together too. Jeff Donnelly : And just last question, there have been a few assets or few markets, I should say, like San Antonio and maybe Chicago that have been. I think always on kind of the wholesale trends over the year, you\u2019re exiting San Antonio. I mean, now that you\u2019ve got a more active acquisition pipeline, is that mean, you might be more after increase your dispositions? Don Wood : Well, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s increasing dispositions. Listen, we look at this stuff very, very holistically with respect to the company. Now to the extent there is an asset or two or three and they are not a lot of them in this portfolio that underperformed. But to the extent there are, yeah, we are going to match them up with an acquisition. But, I think, if you took from those comments and went out and underwrote a bunch more dispositions, I think, I\u2019d be wrong. I don\u2019t think you should. I think again it\u2019s a one-off as occasions change. We\u2019ve talked about Chicago forever performing pretty now well for us. Jeff Donnelly : Okay. Thanks. Don Wood : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I wonder what the current occupancy of CocoWalk is? And how long do you think it\u2019s going to take before your impact on leasing is going to be felt on the project? Don Wood : Thanks for the question, Craig. As it relates to occupancy, we are approaching 80% there and the asset clearly has lagged behind, the great resurgent that is happening there in the Grove District, centre district of the Grove with rent on the streets significantly exceeding what\u2019s there in the property. My point of view is that with Chris Weilminster and Michael Comras, our local partner that we are going to be getting after in the next 12 to 18 months, pretty meaningful changes in that tendency, which has lagged and reflects a little bit more of a mix that might serve tourism than really the local community. So we think there is a tremendous opportunity there for us to get after soon. Jim Taylor : Craig, look for a two, three, four years, that\u2019s what for me. Craig Schmidt : And then what do you think your yield will be on the project after that stabilization? Don Wood : We expect that yields were coming in the low to mid 5s and we expect that yield to be somewhere between 250 higher than that when we stabilize. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Hello. Good morning. And Don congrats on the new position. Hopefully we\u2019ll see an increase in comp in the coming year for you? Don Wood : Let\u2019s hope, Alex, thank you very much. Jim Taylor : Yeah. Thanks, Al. Alexander Goldfarb : Jim, you as well, listen, Don does a lot and she\u2019s obviously an integral part, so just like to see good people rewarded. Don Wood : Did you have a question Alex today? Alexander Goldfarb : Just a few questions here, one, I don\u2019t know if you commented on Assembly 2 with the condos? Are you planning on selling those yourself or are you going to build them and then sell them in both to a condo seller? Don Wood : No. We will sell them ourselves with and when I say ourselves, we have a condo seller with us. But we will not effectively pre-sale them to the condo seller. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Okay. And then as far as, Jim on the -- you mentioned a number of items transaction expense. Obviously, there\u2019s a prepay and then you reiterated guidance with the -- ex the prepaid charge. So just curious, are you guys planning to switch to a core FFO number or you will report a reported FFO number on a go-forward basis? Jim Taylor : We are following NAREIT\u2019s definition of FFO. Our guidance really is intended to exclude the debt repayments, really Jeff -- or excuse me, Alex, to avoid confusion. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then finally, Don, as you guys are more active on the acquisition side, are you finding it harder or easier to source privately on deals meaning that -- are the private owners looking at these cap rates and going wow, this is great? Or they increasingly looking at values going where else can I replicate my income streams, so I am sort of more likely to not sell product today just because I can't find anywhere to reinvest? Don Wood : I\u2019ll -- let me say one thing, Alex and then Jeff is on the phone as is Jimmy, so they can add to it. We have never been able to kind of give you broad comments like that and say, this is what private owners are thinking and this is what public owners are thinking, et cetera. If you look at of CocoWalk and hopefully, over the next couple of few months you\u2019ll see additional stuff that we are talking about here. You will kind of see and certainly, when you look back and you see San Antonio Centre, these are one-off decisions made by investors both private and public who have all sorts of different reasons for doing what they are doing. I don\u2019t -- when you look, we\u2019ve done a $1 billion worth of acquisitions in the last few years. It\u2019s not like we haven't done a lot, we do bigger ones. And in every case, there is a different set of situations. So, I don't see that changing. I don't feel like that's changing right now. Jim or Jeff, anything on that? Jeff Berkes : Don. I think you hit the nail on the head. I mean, Alex, maybe a broad comment like that works for more commodity product. But given where we want to be and the type of the property we want to buy really is an individual decision, particularly with the private owners on every deal. And the reasons are many and what\u2019s happened here respective of what\u2019s going on in the capital markets. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Jeff. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Hi. Good morning, guys. Just for Jim, a couple modeling questions on the transactions thus far. You had, I think a couple of $100,000 of acquisition-costs related to CocoWalk in Q1. What are you expecting acquisition costs to be in Q2 and then what was the cap rate on Houston Street? Jim Taylor : The expected total acquisitions cost Q1 and Q2 for CocoWalk will be about a penny. And the cap rate on Houston Street was in the high 5s. Christy McElroy : And then do you have any additional acquisition or dispositions under contract or close at this point that you are working on negotiations? Jim Taylor : We do, so stay tuned. Christy McElroy : Okay. Got it. So just on refinancings and with regards to the early redemption of the 2017 notes, how do you sort of think about sort of the cost of redeeming and will you take the charge for next quarter or this quarter versus sort of the opportunity cost in weighting and would you consider bringing anything else forward? Jim Taylor : Well. We\u2019ve significantly turned down our existing maturities. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our weighted average churn now is over 10 years. And really the way we look at it is on an NAV or NTB basis in terms of how far would rate past the move for us to break even for paying it today. And as we looked at the decision to refi given where rates where we saw about a 30 to 40 basis point moved paying for it on a breakeven basis. And since we\u2019ve done it, we\u2019re already effectively in the money. So that\u2019s how we think about that. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then with regards to the mortgage is coming during November, can you remind us your plan? Jim Taylor : Well, we have the opportunity to prepay those a few months early which we will do. And then as always, we will opportunistically look to the market the best way to turn that out, most likely with the longer-term debt offering but stay tune there. Christy McElroy : And at what point are those paid down, what month? Jim Taylor : We have the opportunity to prepay those in August. Christy McElroy : All right. Okay. Just one last question on Assembly Row Phase II. Can you remind me on the construction of the office portion if partners is doing not themselves? Is there any -- are there any fees associated with that construction? Jim Taylor : Partners is doing it themselves, they\u2019ve effectively bought the land from us, that\u2019s how we get paid. In addition, we are buying back the ground floor to draw our own development plan. Don Wood : But Christy, we are not receiving any development fees as part of that. Christy McElroy : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Your line is now open. Jim Sullivan : Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on CocoWalk. And I wonder whether you can share with us Jim at this point regarding the remerchandising strategy there for levels 2 and 3. I think that\u2019s for the vacancy, I think it\u2019s been concentrated. And. Can you also confirm whether you expect to maintain the fourth level as offices? Jim Taylor : Jim, I don\u2019t want to talk yet a bit specifically about plans by floor. But let me give you a little bit of perspective. It sounds like the assets well. And in fact you\u2019re right, the upper levels have struggled as does second, third floor retail in many instances. We do have Cinepolis now as the theater operator who will be bringing in more of an upscale movie experience there on the third floor, anchoring it and they\u2019re going to putting significant capital and what they have there from theater and experience perspective. We also will be bringing into those levels more destination type tenants think Health Plus business, things like that. For the balance, we believe that the office market there is pretty robust and provide some opportunity and we think there is an opportunity for other more destination type tenants. And again overall, we think the merchandising in performance to that asset significantly lag what\u2019s happening in the streets around it. That\u2019s really the asset has been in the last 10 years by an out of state owner operator and it\u2019s the need of some remerchandising and repositioning which we\u2019re excited to get after. Jim Sullivan : And in terms of your partners there, the local sharp shooters as you\u2019ve labeled them. Can you kind of outline how the management of the property will operate and what the fee structure will be? Jim Taylor : We\u2019re paying market-based fees for the ongoing operation of the asset. We have in our local partner, Gras River Property, a group with operating expertise, which is actually located on the next block away from the property. Obviously, our team will be working with them to make sure the properties are operated well. And from a leasing perspective, we\u2019ll be working with Michael Comras and of course, our own team to make sure we\u2019re getting the right tenancy and merchandising mix in there. Jim Sullivan : And then finally on this property, Don mentioned, I think, in the prepared comments that we should, kind of, stay tuned for more activity in Dade County. And I just wonder whether if you do more acquisitions in that county, whether you use the same partnership or whether that will be done totally differently? Don Wood : We would look at opportunities with this partnership. What we believe strongly is that local on the ground presence is critical to success. And particularly, Jim, in a market like this, we\u2019re pleased with the type of opportunities that is the partnership, we\u2019ve been looking at together and I think we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on that. Jim Sullivan : Okay. And then finally, one quick one on Assembly Row Phase II. The cost estimate there is indicated as net of projected land sale proceeds. Are these proceeds on the land parcels already sold or will they be incremental land sales? Don Wood : That is the land sale proceeds from the partner side, Jim. Jim Sullivan : Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions on CocoWalk, does this acquisition often mainly in planning phase include maybe from other nearby acquisition. It seems like there is other, not the same but a similar looking strip centers or lifestyle centers nearby that look challenging as well. Just curious if your overall master planning include maybe assembling other products nearby? Don Wood : Hey Ki. That\u2019s a -- I mean, it\u2019s a great question. And the answer is of course. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean, basically we view CocoWalk as getting into a community for that growth in particular. That truly is not solely towards mix in Miami. This is -- we look at little bit like the [indiscernible] if you will, of Miami. And accordingly, to the extent, we can do what we hopefully can do at CocoWalk to the extent that we can pick up other properties, we\u2019ll like to be able to do that in around the area to the extent that numbers don\u2019t make sense, we won\u2019t. So there is a -- I don\u2019t want to necessarily think of a particular strip center or particular power center or whatever else but think generally retail and how it is that we can capitalize on the business that we\u2019ll do a couple of help. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. For the two, in your own -- have you already start engaging some other owners buy or is it let\u2019s get this part done first and then start that dialog later? Don Wood : Let\u2019s leave this commerce. That\u2019s another conversation. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Don Wood : Let us do a negotiation. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. So you don\u2019t want to do on the conference call. And just last question, when you roll out places like Santana Row Assembly or Pike & Rose. I\u2019m sure you guys have done ton of studies but the dollars that the market share you end up grabbing in whatever radius you pick, how would you describe the shoppers that end up coming to your center. Is it -- or the dollars coming to your center, is that really coming from dollars that would have been spent at mall nearby or shopping centers. How would you describe that market share grab? Don Wood : This is going to be anecdotal, much more than scientific gear but the real answer to that, it\u2019s just a combination. Certainly, we want to expand the marketplace. Certainly, we do. I mean, when you take a look at Santana over a dozen years now. We absolutely have expanded the marketplace. Have in certain instances, we\u2019ve taken from other centers and other retailers absolutely too. So, it\u2019s a combination. It\u2019s not one versus the other. The products in really all of those cases that we are trying to build, is a community that works for the particular market that we are in. So as you know, Assembly is very different than Santana and both are very different than Pike & Rose and we could go on and on and talk about the others. Each is different but they are aiming for a 25 mile radius around the particular center and producing a product that is just not available there. So it\u2019s a combination of expanding that market and also some privacy. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s it for me. Don Wood : Yeah. Thanks, Steven. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Yeah. Hi. Real quick on Houston Street, just curios, what was the specific catalyst triggered to sale now? Don Wood : Mike, it\u2019s a great question. We look at all of our portfolio and really evaluate on a going forward basis what the growth prospects look like, what our hold-IRR is. And as we look at that asset and a brilliant effort by Jeff and the team, decided that this was the right time to sell it. We thought valuations would be strong. Actually, we were pleasantly surprised by where we ended up from a valuation standpoint. And we are pleased that we made the decision to move forward with that. Jim Taylor : Mike, it\u2019s a right time as Jimmy said and also we wanted the assets to be in the best shape it could be prepared for sale. So when you look at the leasing that was done there. The West Coast team has run that and really put it in shape to be more marketable than it\u2019s been. We\u2019ve known for a very long time that we were not going to make San Antonio, Texas a hub of Federal\u2019s acquisition activities. So it really was about getting the asset in the right position. We did some developments there with a new Walgreens a couple years back and just made it more marketable, when you combined that with the current economic environment now is the time. Michael Mueller : Got it. And then I know you touched on this before during your Investor Day but when you are looking beyond Phase II of Assembly, beyond Phase II of Pike & Rose, how build out are those sites going to be after the Phase IIs? Don Wood : Basically -- I mean, I was just thinking about this for Pike & Rose. About half of Pike & Rose, about half of that and a bit more than half at Assembly wants to go and then think about Santana there. Think about -- when you see -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen yet really what the mixed use portfolio looks like. But the mixed use portfolio also includes big pieces of land that we have shopping centers on, whether it\u2019s Grant Park, Atlanta, whether it\u2019s Pike 7, whether it\u2019s Montrose Crossing. And similarly in the core, when you look at some of the assets in that core, there is a lot to do. So, yeah, I know all of our focus is always on and talk about with respect to Pike & Rose and Assembly. But truly get up a notion higher and you will look and you will see acres and acres of really well located big shopping centers that should be intensified. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good morning. Just a couple ones for me here. Curios on what you are seeing or hearing from brokers on the pipeline for the back half of this year, for the type of products you\u2019d be interested in buying and how that compares to six months ago and hoping to get a sense of, if you are seeing perhaps a sense from sellers that they might be more willing to come to the table now, maybe you are reflecting a sense of anxiety over rates or -- and the impact of asset pricing? Don Wood : Haendel, as Jeff alluded to earlier, each situations, that we look at is itself unique. It does feel like we are seeing some slight building in terms of opportunities, particularly those that are being brokered but in terms of what our targeted list of assets is it just really depends. Too early to tell whether or not this recent volatility is really changing investor decisions as to what to do with these assets that we targeted, but we will see. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And you guys have stuck to the plan of spending $200 million to $300 million per year free desk for sometime now demonstrating some discipline on capital allocation. I am curious if the highly competitive acquisition environment along with the success of your recent projects like Assembly Row and like supply in the community center space may make you perhaps consider picking up your redevs or expansion investment pace a bit here over the next year or so? Don Wood : The bottomline is and I know you get tired me saying this, but this is all about the balanced business plan. And so when you think about that pace as it includes redevelopment of existing shopping centers all day long, I mean we have pushed -- we push as hard as we can. And frankly, I am hopeful that this breaking out of core and shopping centers in McHugh will actually help that over the next few years, certainly not immediate but over the next year. So again, I am hopeful there. In terms of the big stuff that we do, I mean we are not a -- I never want us to be 25% of this company being developed. So it is that balanced. But by and large, this is a core shopping center company that truly takes advantage of the places that we\u2019re in, which have gotten better and better over the last couple of decades to intensify them. That will continue and I hope it actually go up a little bit in terms of the core portfolio. Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate it, guys. Don Wood : Thanks, Haendel. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Vineet Khanna : Hi. Good morning. Taking a look at sort of the DC market, it\u2019s been for a couple of quarters being concerned over multifamily for rent supply, but can you sort of talk about the for sale product in the DC area and what the status of the supply is there? Don Wood : I can\u2019t. No, as we think about what\u2019s happening in this particular market, North Bethesda what led us to go with the condo product has actually been a lot of unsolicited demand. So we feel pretty confident based on the basis that we are coming in and where we see the current sales prices for condos in this particular region that we have significant upside. And certainly based on early indications, we will have significant demand. Jim Taylor : But Vineet, that wasn\u2019t your question, I mean we couldn\u2019t be more optimistic about 104 units, the condo units at Pike & Rose. With respect to the entire Metro DC market, as you\u2019re asking about in terms of for sale product, now there is really not much more we are going to add to that. Vineet Khanna : Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess taking the DC silver line has been opened for sometime and the road work in that area is complete. Can you sort of talk about the sales trends at Pike 7 and how they compare to preconstruction environment in that area? Don Wood : Yes. Pike 7 blows me away. When you\u2019re sitting, you think about a kind of a community center with a parking lot in front of it. One story of REIT -- story of retail, you would never think that -- you would think about stuff to coming up at least. Well, it\u2019s the opposite. With that\u2019s happening inside them, with all of that congestion titles with the silver line with all of that done, that center has done remarkably well. Sales were off a few percent and that center during all that construction, they are well back above where they were before. It\u2019s stronger than ever. And when you think about it, it\u2019s one of the few shopping centers that produce such an easy to park in front and walk in a market that is totally under construction right now. So silver line is definitely a positive thing for that piece of land, certainly it may be intensify as we go forward, as the leases come up over the next five years or something like that. But in the meantime, we are doing really well there. Vineet Khanna : Okay. And then just lastly, I think a couple of quarters ago you spoke about how the retail tenants sales are coming in relative to the budgets at Assembly Row, can you sort of walk through the same for Pike & Rose if it\u2019s not too soon? Don Wood : I can\u2019t. Pike & Rose remember what we did, it\u2019s different than Assembly. Assembly what we did primarily is built out the street and not only primarily almost totally built out the street, put in our big boxes and Avalon does the residential, but the street was key. At Pike & Rose that was a different strategy, because there was an existing shopping center on the site, [made by Plaza] [ph], which was doing extremely well even up till the time we knock it down. That project was basically a residential project in the first phase. So there isn\u2019t critical mass of the retail, which is why we did in that first phase, feels like eye-tech, which is killing it, as you know. Sport & Health, which is a local -- regional health club operator that is really well know and strong. That\u2019s why we do restaurants like a Del Frisco's Grille, like a Summer House, doing very well. And with respect to the retail, that\u2019s why we went with National like GAP and City Sports there to kind of round it out. Those guys are doing fine, not nearly as good as they will do with the second phase opened up, which is why we are working so hard to construct that second phase. Now then that will have created the street that feels very much like Assembly. Vineet Khanna : Okay. Well, thanks for taking my questions. Don Wood : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Brittany Schmelz for any closing remarks. Brittany Schmelz : Thank you everyone for joining us. We will start to seeing you every week in New York in the coming weeks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

These documents are available on our website at www.federalrealty.com. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter 2015 results. Don? Don Wood : Well, thank you, Brittany Schmelz, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be able to report you today we\u2019ve had a very strong quarter for Federal all the way around our business. Strong FFO growth, strong same-store growth, strong lease rollover, strong occupancy, strong development deliveries and more acquisitions in Greater Miami. Also mentioned an 8% dividend raised may $0.07 a quarter to 94, the 48th consecutive year of increased dividends, great quarter. Now let\u2019s start with earnings. FFO per share were $1.33 excluding of course prepayment premium this year and the retirement of $200 million of senior notes, was 8% higher than the $1.23 earned in last year\u2019s quarter as the first phase of the development project begin to contribute and the core continues to power along. I single out higher and anticipated percentage rent at Assembly Row, a nice residential rent growth San Antonio Row especially encouraging. It\u2019s really good news, because that\u2019s we\u2019ve discussed previously we are very consciously investing in our team with higher long-term incentives in people bench strength to be sure or assure as we can that we are well prepared to execute and deliver on a business plan and doubling NOI in the next decade, hence part of the reason for the G&A increase in the quarter. It\u2019s a very balanced approach toward growing our business and it\u2019s not a quarter-by-quarter business plan. On the leasing side, nearly 300,000 feet, our comparable deals were executed in the quarter, at average rent of $30.41, 15% above the 26, 36, the prior tenant was paying. Leasing strength was broad with both new deals and renewals registering double-digit growth within all three operating platforms of our company West Coast the core and the mixed use portfolios. As an example, we are thrilled to do our first deal with Macy's in the form of their first Macy's Backstage retail stores. Their value based concept opening this month at our Melville shopping center [indiscernible]. In addition we saw strong renewals at newly acquired San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California and that\u2019s a Village of Shirlington in Arlington, Virginia in the health club and theater categories. Both come with significant upgrades to their facilities a clear trend that we're seeing in the theater business in particular as compensation from newer more service oriented companies gain traction. Same-store growth in the quarter was strong at 3% that out the impact of redevelopments and 4.8% with lease termination fees are comparable in both periods. The redevelopment impact really benefited from a great job in Mercer Mall in New Jersey [indiscernible] all opened and this more to come. For an asset pictures in Mercer Mall really reflect the quarterly development competency. It\u2019s a transformed asset. We\u2019ll on enrichment and similarly on its way to transformation to a for more relevant retail side. Occupancy jumps in the quarter to 94.9%, well, the percentage lease claims of 95.7%. Both up a bit compared with last year and the first quarter on a strong leasing momentum. As you can see, this was a really strong operating quarter. Now let\u2019s move on report some development news. First in Somerville, Assembly Row continues to mature beautifully with most restaurants and retailers meeting or exceeding their first year projections. We\u2019ve clearly struck the chord in the community and are providing a need that wasn\u2019t being met. Percentage rent is above our expectations and the office building is basically fully spoken for with virtually all available space occupied or undersigned leased or LOI. The partners\u2019 construction is right on or maybe ahead of schedule and occupancy by partners employees expected to begin next summer. That building is huge and really does wonders adding scale and perspective to the entire site, check it out on any trip to Boston, it\u2019s impressive. Our own construction on Phase II is just now getting underway and will start to deliver in 2017. Future of the Assembly Row section of Somerville is extremely bright and there will be incremental investment opportunities here for at least the next six or seven years as we fully build out. 400 miles south is Pike & Rose in North Bethesda, Maryland and there too lots of construction, lots of progress to report. Let\u2019s start with the residential lease commencement at the Pallas high-rise build. 36 leases signed, 11% of the building in the first couple of months at rents at or above our pro forma with the first step that\u2019s moving underway. I think I just start. The new parking garage will open next month as scheduled and provide an additional 550 plus surely needed spaces. Virtually all available office space in the first space is now either occupied or undersigned leased or LOI more pronounce. At the second phase gets underway, we have signed leases or LOIs with some great anchors early in the process that should give you a feel for the direction we\u2019re going. Pinstripes the 30,000-square-foot bowling and entertainment concept will anchor the industry. REI we relocate from a mile way to anchor Rockville Pike and newly formed Rose Avenue in 38,000 square feet. And we\u2019re closed to a deal with H&M to take 25,000 feet onto levels at one of the best corners in the project. Playing more leasing and have worked with some terrific names we begin construction on the second phase that is so necessary to create the critical-mass at this site needs. Deliveries and store openings in this phase begin in 2017. Frankly, I can\u2019t wait to show the project off a bit at our plan Investor Day there on September 30. I hope most of you are planning to attend. Well there will still be plenty of construction on the interior upper floors of Pallas along with some exterior trim to finish up, aforementioned the second phase which will be well underway at that point. It won\u2019t be hard to see why we\u2019re so bullish about the very significant value being created here now and well into the future. Meanwhile, on the West Coast, the first dozen or so tenants open last week at the point, to capacity perhaps. The point being our 150,000 square foot addition to the Plaza El Segundo shopping complex in El Segundo, California. Thank you by the way the West Coast folks on the phone who e-mailed over the weekend with kind words after visiting the point, it really means a lot. 80% of that space is leased, are fully executed \u2013 are in the fully executed NOI. And we will be opening tenants throughout the rest of the summer and fall and what we know will be a favorite gathering at shopping destination for the areas underserved communities like Manhattan, Hermosa and Redondo Beach. Tenants like True Food Kitchen, Lucky Jeans, Madewell, Athleta, Mendocino Farms, and SoulCycle, all around a really large and attractive park like public space to give you the feel of what we were creating here. Significant value creations day one that will get better and better for years to come. And perhaps the newest thing to talk about in this call is our well study commitment to South Miami. We reported on the CocoWalk acquisition with our local partner Gras River, on last quarter\u2019s call, and since that time we have closed on several Coconut Grove\u2019s street retail building and closed proximity to CocoWalk in order to make our presence more intact. In addition, we\u2019ve locked up a larger retail in mixed-use projects just a few miles away also with local partners Grass River with due diligence largely complete and a closing data expected in the new few weeks. Jim will talk more about that to the extent we can in his remarks. My point of talking about is this. We have gone from a non-player in South Miami a few months ago to a very significant landlord controlling hundreds of thousands of square feet in six months time. Roughly $200 million of initial acquisition capital had a tight reasonable yield at first, 5% plus. While we worked hard to figure out a significant repositioning and redevelopment plan that could hopefully allow us to deploy as much as an additional $150 million to $250 million in those assets over the next five years in effect a yielding land time. I am hopeful, confident that our work and our experience on the life of Bethesda Row, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, Santana Row, and the point so many smaller examples over the past 20 years put us in an unique position to be able to do just that. What if not \u2013 we still have great real estate and a very protected downtime. As you can see, there is a lot going on [indiscernible] of our business plan. We remain on track, double our income in the next decade as we have talked about many times in the past couple of years, so far so good. Let me now turn it over to Jim Taylor for additional guidance and explanation and then we\u2019ll open up the lines to your question. Jim Taylor : Thank you, Don and good morning everyone. As Don highlighted in his remarks, our results this quarter not only set a new record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, they further demonstrate the continued successful execution of our long-term plan. A plan that drove the 48th consecutive annual increase in our dividend of 8%. I will provide some additional color on our quarterly results, our balance sheet activity, acquisition and our outlook for the balance of the year. Overall property operating income grew at 9.2% year-over-year. As usual the largest single driver of that growth is our operating portfolio which grew at 4.8% on a same-store basis including re-development and 3% excluding. Cash really expressed this quarter at 15% on deals will take occupancy in the future, we believe that we remain on track to continue to deliver sustainable growth. Importantly as highlighted in our supplement, continue to successfully deliver on our re-development pipeline. As Don noted most notably this quarter stabilizing re-development in Melville and Mercer Mall. In addition, our initial phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly contributed approximately $3.5 million of DOI during the quarter. Finally, this quarter we benefited from the successful integration of our acquisition San Antonio Center in Mountain View, California as well as CocoWalk and Coconut Grove, Florida. As previously discussed, these assets are not only accretive in the near-term, it present compelling redevelopment opportunities given their infill location. Our G&A increased approximately $1.2 million year-over-year due primarily to transaction costs associated with the closing of CocoWalk as well as higher personnel cost, Don mentioned as we continue to invest in our platform for growth. As discussed last quarter even with this incremental investment in our platform, we expect our G&A to remain at about 5% of revenue. Interest expense grew slightly during the quarter due to lower cap interests as we deliver parts of the first phases of Assembly and Pike & Rose, which was offset by lower rates as we continue to bring down our weighted average interest rate, which today stands at about 4.3%. Bottom line FFO per share grew at 8.1% in line with our long-term plan at 7% to 9% even as we continue to invest in the future. As many of you have heard us to say at the conferences and one on one meeting, we could generate higher absolute for us, where we would scale back on that investment and perhaps lever up and then, but that is a cyclical plan only. A track record that is older than many of us on this call, guides our relentless focus on predicable sustainable growth. Turning to the balance sheet early in the quarter, we\u2019ve redeemed $200 million of our 2017 6.2% notes with the proceeds of a third year debt issuance of 4.18%. Importantly, we extended our weighted average tenure to 10 year, which as we look forward provides us with maximum flexibility to access most opportunistic part of the yield curve. Longer sure and still retain the longest weighted average tenure in the shopping centers fact. At quarter end, we had approximately $100 million drawn under our revolver, leading us to more than enough liquidity to fund the growth we have underway. On the acquisition front, we successfully integrated the CocoWalk asset during the quarter have identified near term upside while we execute on our longer-term plan to the asset. In addition, we closed on the acquisition of interest in seven retail assets running the primary shopping streets within the growth, providing us additional opportunity capitalize on the positive runner rate trends within the research in Grove District. Finally, as Don mentioned, we placed another approximately $110 million assets, under contract within the broader trade area, which like CocoWalk benefits from a phenomenal infill location and also presents an opportunity to create significant value through developments to serve the Avalon and that\u2019s population that surrounded. More to come on that asset soon. With our strategic focus on this Miami-Dade market and our partnership with local sharpshooter, Grass River, Comras, we \u2013 as Don mentioned we have built the substantial market presence within a short period of time. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about this market and how we\u2019ll benefit our overall portfolios through inevitable cycles. Now turning to guidance for 2015, we have tightened an increase the mid-point of our previously provided range to 529 to 533 or 7.5% growth year-over-year at the mid-point. This updated guidance generally reflects the strength of our opening at Assembly Row, whereas Don mentioned, many of our tenants are now paying additional percentage rent, as well importantly is continue to strengthen our core our team has been doing and an excellent job managing rollover and leasing additional space. We expect to continue to see robust capital over growth for the balance of the year, well above historical average. While we will also see some lag in the same-store NOI the second half of 2015 due to tenant rollover and higher term fees that we realized last year. Even with these timing issues, we expect same-store NOI to average 3.5% to 4% including redevelopment for the entire year. Some of the larger timing assumption that have been factored into our guidance and that will impact the balance for this year as well as 2016 approximately $80 million of office space, Pike & Rose and Assembly, that is being delivered this year. We now have leases in NOI and over 95% of that space. Based on the deals and the place, we expect these tenants take occupancy through mid-2016 and based on free rent period to be fully paying rent in 2017. The retail and Assembly Row at 97% lease to 95% occupied as of the end of the second quarter, with the last few tenants taking occupancy in the later part of this year. The retail is fully leased to Pike & Rose is over 90% of the space now open, including iPic, Del Frisco's, Summer House, City Sport and Sport & Health. The balance of this retail space will continue to open over the next six months. Pallas, the 319 unit high-rise, which represents approximately $110 million of investment as open, it is expected to lease up over the next 18 months. Given that timing, we expect it to be a drag down NOI this year and early next as it reaches the stabilization at the end of 2016. And finally from a timing perspective, the point redevelopment of Pallas House condo, which represents approximately $85 million of investment open last week, extremely well and it project stabilized through mid-2016. Again, as we look forward, we remain confident our plan to continue to generate 79% growth, even as we invest for the long-term on both sides of our balance sheet. While we have not provided guidance for 2016, which we\u2019ll do next quarter, we would nonetheless expect to remain in that range. Finally, we all look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day on September 3. We expect to show up our first days Pike & Rose, which will now be a \u2013 and also just two are the best row and show the opportunities for additional investment and one of our first mix these properties. We also provide both to the opportunity meet our broader management team responsible for the execution of our plan, as well as meet members of our Board of Directors. With that, operator I would like to turn the call over to questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy : Hey, good morning, guys. Just with regard to the point, can you discuss sort of your objective in merchandising the retail and the restaurants and release and supply also going to next store and the other retail in the area and in sort of thinking about it as an addition to the Pallas, have you figured out a way to more seamlessly join the two asset to encourage that cross hopping I know there was an issue with the train tracks between them. Don Wood : [indiscernible] questions, Christy. Hey, Jeff, you are on the line, you want to take it? Jeff Berkes : Yes, sure. Hey, Christy, how are you? Christy McElroy : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Berkes : As you know from being out there that we have a sectional pass out, again they call the collection which is about 50,000 square feet of lifestyle, it does very, very well. So thinking about the merchandizing strategy for the point we wanted to build on that success and continue to fill on unmet need for additional Lifestyle retail in that trade area, which we\u2019ve done and we\u2019re doing. We have 25,000 square feet of restaurants space at the point with you that whole market is really underserved for better dining options and also for a collection of restaurants, meeting at some place kind of like Santana Row or you can come and park the car and meet your friends and figure out where you\u2019re going to once you get there, pretty much every other restaurant opportunity in that market is what I will call point and suite in your car, you go to the restaurant, again your car and you leave. So that was a real unmet need in the trade area and I think we\u2019ve done a nice job of filling that. In terms of the connectivity, yes, the rail road tracks are never going away, but we\u2019ve got a couple ideas we are working on with the city of El Segundo right now to make the connectivity better and I think we\u2019ll achieve those find years and work through everything with the city in the next few months and the connection between the collection in particular in the point more improved. Its not super pedestrian front but right now, but really it\u2019s only a two or three minute walk from the front of the collection to the main it\u2019s a boulevard enter point at the point. So it\u2019s really not that bad but we can improve it. Don Wood : I mean having said that, Christy, one thing I want to mention is, we argue about that and one of the things we argue about is, whether its necessary. And so, with any new project, we are learning, we will be learning a lot over the next few months. And I\u2019m personally not convinced that, it\u2019s necessary to connect them at all. But we\u2019ll see other works out [indiscernible] as we do have some alternatives to do that if we need to. Christy McElroy : Okay, and then just secondly, Don you mentioned the $110 million acquisition in part of that you have under contract, maybe you could tell us a little bit more about it, in terms of any value add opportunity that\u2019s related to that with widely marketed and is that acquisition currently in your 2015 guidance range? Don Wood : It\u2019s not been guidance at all, and I\u2019m not going to specifically going into the asset, I will tell you this, we made a bet on South Miami. Basically as we thought about it Christy, the idea of, South American money, everything that\u2019s going on downtown, there is a lot of players that are trying to capture all that and then we think that will be successful. We didn\u2019t compete with that. This was an idea to say wait a minute. There is Miami is how has been clearly becoming more and more of a grown up city, more and more an important city worldwide, and its got a lot of people like, all those markets that were in, who live there, who do well living there and they need their place for those families and their lives. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and still going to grow that\u2019s what we are doing in that whole area that\u2019s why we are making the incremental investment in total. So I\u2019m looking at CocoWalk, the Street Retail, this other asset which will be able to talk about and then fully in just a few weeks, certainly on next earnings call, to get an idea of the entire bet that were making, all of each of those assets is not expected to stay what they are, because they only work and so as figuring out, what kind of redevelopment plan, how we put that together, we will take time. I\u2019m looking forward to that, and the difference with us, and I love, is that in the meantime, why we figured out, we are making accretive acquisitions. So it\u2019s more raw material in the \u2013 for the future of our business plan. Christy McElroy : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Jason White, Green Street Advisor. Your line is open. Jason White : Good morning, just a quick question on your recent acquisitions over the last two, three years. Seems like these has been minority partners and a lot of those probably just assumption of shaking the properties lease, just kind of walk through the pros and cons of having minority partners involved and those extra seats at the table make it difficult for them to achieve what you want to achieve on some of these properties? Don Wood : Yes, Jason no question about it, all the balance \u2013 let me start by this, I am sure Jim will have and Jeff will have some to say that as you know every deal that we make is not part of a formula. Every deal that we make is part of a specific real estate transaction, where we think we can create the best value. We are talking here about South Miami, which is the most reasonable we can talk through here. There was no question that having a local partner, who truly knows better than we do. The specific ins and outs from dynamics of the marketplace, the leasing person who is involved with that partnership is the best in the marketplace. So we are getting additional expertise there in that particular case, we thought was real important to the whole risk award balance. Now clearly, by doing that we\u2019ve got another seat at the table, clearly by doing that partnerships had complexity. On balance that one for us with the specific way that we want it to go and attack South Miami. As you go back a little bit, you look at Plaza El Segundo it was about shaking it out a little bit, it was about creating how we were going to get control of it. Jim Taylor : And also Jason, we will bring in minority interest throughout the union transactions, as well, as we did at the Grove and Shrewsbury, where effectively we own and control the asset. But their ownership is reflected at the asset model. Yes, the key point to that to really understand is \u2013 look, we were never going to compromise on the locations that we are trying to get on the value creative part of the equation. And so to do that with the best real estate to the extent it makes sense we are going to look at it really closely and open our minds so whatever structure is necessary to get it done. Jeff Berkes : The only thing I\u2019d add to what Don and Jim have said is when we are doing a partnership deal for tax reasons for the contributor in the case of boundary or otherwise in the case of something like Plaza El Segundo. The people are staying and really don\u2019t have day-to-day operational say and what goes on. So whether might be a little bit more reporting and little bit more communication here or there. It\u2019s not like we have to get approval to do, we need to do around the property. Jason White : Thanks and then another one on \u2013 in terms of your realignment and kind of your restructuring at your \u2013 of your team. Does this increase the capacity to do other mixed use redevelopment, it sounds like [indiscernible] going to involve some extra time. How much broader tend to be in terms of tackling to this project? Don Wood : Yes, I\u2019m hopeful it increases our capacity to do all sort of different steps. You know in the case of South Miami, those partners do have very good development expertise and local development expertise. So that\u2019s important, now, how much more capacity over weighted, what we are doing down, I don\u2019t. What we\u2019re talking about is pretty aggressive. When you sit here think about \u2013 bringing in Jeff Mooallem or when you think about effectively dividing up the portfolio the way we have. We clearly are \u2013 the notion here is to bring in high level real estate talent. That so that we can get to, more of what is a pretty strong growing company. So the answer is yes here \u2013 to your questions. It\u2019s all partly \u2013 parts are look how we\u2019re moving it forward as a period of time that everybody whether it\u2019s a partner or a federal employee needs to understand what\u2019s going on around here and how to figure out, how to create that value. But I\u2019m very cautious on bringing in that kind of raw skills level and we confident we\u2019ll get there. Jason White : Okay and then last one from me is just \u2013 as you look you\u2019re releasing spread. Is there any pockets of strength or weakness in the cost of portfolio, whether it\u2019s geographic or property type, small shop centers is there anything it\u2019s really driving or weighing on, I mean any of that releasing effort. Jim Taylor : Yes, I still think, I mean it\u2019s just in the market, a geographic market impact here. The West Coast and it\u2019s really, really strong. We\u2019re also seeing strength in Boston, DC is little softer, but \u2013 but it is the combination that kind of create that \u2013 that overall result and then cut another way timing on particular, anchors or small shop tenants that are below market that we can get it. And we always seem to find some to be able to get through and I don\u2019t expect that change. Jason White : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your question please. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. The partial interest in the Seventh Street retail buildings in the Coconut Grove District, can you say what the percent of the investment is? Jim Taylor : Craig, its ranges anywhere from 20% to 80% asset-by-asset, and I think what\u2019s important here is that, we have got a [indiscernible] position in these asset, which we believe we will accrete overtime. In each of these seven building are located or separate buildings are located on the primary shopping streets within the Grove. So in addition to the dominant position we\u2019ve established with Coco, these building will allow us to leverage the street and benefit of what we\u2019re doing in Coco around over time. So you should expect to see us make some additional investments in these particular assets overtime as well as potentially acquire other building in that submarket. Craig Schmidt : Okay, I was just \u2013 you\u2019re answered is good. It\u2019s only to help facilitate the restructuring, you\u2019re also trying to take advantage of such sort of collateral improvement to the neighborhood? Jim Taylor : Correct. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And then the $150 million to $250 million, would that include an expansion, its sound like it would require some major physical restructuring. Jim Taylor : Yes. It was \u2013 and its not just couple of other assets, that I\u2019m referring to, two and its frankly as the number out of the air at this point in time. But as we underwrite these things and figure out, what it is that we could do with them, yes, you\u2019re all right, that there would significant physical changes to the assets. Craig Schmidt : But you\u2019re still thinking about focusing on that local consumer. Jim Taylor : Very much, Sir. Craig Schmidt : Great, Okay Jim Taylor : That\u2019s really what we see is the benefit of where we are and the opportunity [indiscernible] market in terms of an unreserved population. Craig Schmidt : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Hey. Good morning. Jim Taylor : Hi, Haendel. Haendel St. Juste: So understanding your balance sheet philosophy of always having sufficient liquidities fund your business is accretively in avoid and attracted capital raises. I\u2019m curious given the strength of your balance sheet today with your lower roll leverage is very low floating rate. That is wondering, how you are thinking about incremental debt from here. It appeared about you have capacity that\u2019s [indiscernible] that and as we had into higher rate environment, that lower cost floating rate leverage could be a competitive advantage in acquisition precedes given the low yield environment. So just curious on your thought there. Jim Taylor : I appreciate the question Haendel and with the recent debt activity that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve significantly standard our tenure and its always [indiscernible] to on the call, that does give us flexibility as we go forward to layer and perhaps in floating rate that or place in different parts of the yield curve and still keep up \u2013 and a weighted average tenure that would be the longest in our sector. And I think from a long-term perspective having some footing right that is part of the balance sheet, albeit a conservative level 15% or so is a good long-term structure. But what we\u2019ve been doing opportunistically really the last couple of years, just taking advantage of our rates have been and the flatness of the yield curve to get a very healthy Wells Fargo debt maturity profile. Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate that. A question on tenure of conversation with central pillar is \u2013 understand that competition for high quality assets. It\u2019s pierced on the capital chasing a higher quality retail asset. But curious given the recent rate [indiscernible] that\u2019s changing the tenure conversations perhaps making more potential pillar willing to come to the table seeing anything notable on that front. Jim Taylor : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed at all, at this point sellers are pricing expectations and Jeff please comment as well. I do think we both at seen an additional level of activities that perhaps we didn\u2019t see in the prior 12 months, but again, it\u2019s a very expensive environment and difficult to be successful and fully marketed transaction. Jeff Berkes : Yes, Jim I [indiscernible] absolutely more people willing to talk and more people thinking about selling, but it\u2019s a pricing market. Haendel St. Juste: Got you, okay. And then last one here of some color on the [indiscernible] ramped up a bit to let see [indiscernible] square foot well above your low-single digit reset trend. Can you talk a bit about what\u2019s behind that is it quality space being leased specifically is coming to a reflection perhaps if you are having some\u2026 Jim Taylor : If not \u2013 yes, thanks Haendel. That is one particular transaction, Don mentioned the rollover of the space in Shirlington, it\u2019s the theatre renewal, where we are investing some capital into a higher end maybe experience with the reserve seating and better dining options there that we think we\u2019re really complement what\u2019s going on in Shirlington. So a bit of anomalies if you will, but great return on that incremental invested capital. Haendel St. Juste: Can you share with that return was. Jim Taylor : I not prepared to do that now just well above our typical returns. Haendel St. Juste: Fair enough, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is open. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I guess my question really is around developments and redevelopments, I mean its clear, there is a lot of opportunity within the portfolio to do a lot of that and kind of create the next Pike & Rose are create the next Assembly Row, but I guess what I'm still struggling with just how to give you full credit for that in you NAV. I'm hoping maybe you can give us maybe kind of a bit more of a roadmap of just how much kind of development, redevelopment you expect to do with the next few years? And what could likely come up next? I guess Pike 7 the next big one we should be watching or even if we can get some type of roadmap to kind of guidance to that. Jim Taylor : Well, Omotayo I really appreciate the question and something that we talk a lot about in one-on-ones and other meetings. And we do intend to address a bit more fully at our Investor Day at the end of September. But look back at our plan, and I think, one of the things you can reliably expect us to execute upon is $250 million to $300 million plus a year of development spend that will be in these existing assets that we have in control today. And when we look at that long-term pipeline, it\u2019s a pipeline that stretches well beyond ten years. So but to that more detailed question in terms of trying to get folks more granularity, we will do that at our Investor Day. Omotayo Okusanya : All right. We will stay tuned then. Don Wood : Hey, let me add one thing to that, I don\u2019t remember, I don\u2019t remember I should whether you were at assembly at our Investor Day two years ago. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes, I was. Don Wood : That the amount of thought and strategy and looking at opportunity to figure out whether we could make the comment that we could double our NOI in ten years and what it would take to do that, that wasn\u2019t just an investor presentation. There was a lot of work that went behind that and we are now two years into the ten and we are right on it and it certainly looks like at least for year three that we\u2019ll continue to that. And I don\u2019t \u2013 I would hope that you would see that all the way through. That all includes the number that Jim just talked to you about in terms of $150 million, $200 million a year it does include additional ideas about acquisitions like what we are talking about here in Miami. So if you kind of go back and look at that and I know that\u2019s online, right. We\u2019ve got that on website. Jim Taylor : Yes. Don Wood : To be able to see that\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to run the company. It\u2019s really on a secret. It\u2019s really something that we are as best we can try and to run the company on. And yes, there are more specifics as specific phases and pieces get added on, but it gives a pretty good overall idea of what everybody Weilminster, and Berkes, and Taylor, and that would allow all of us are on. And I don\u2019t know that\u2019s all I would say, just look at that, because there is a lot of good data in that. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Jim Taylor : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your question please. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Don Wood : Hi Al. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey how are you? Just a few questions here, the first is the pace that your acquisition activity in South Miami is pretty impressive. Especially you look at your other markets and it takes long time to get at individual assets. So is there something in particular going on like is there sort of a generational shift, down in that South Miami market where either people did own stuff a long time are getting towards retirement looking at selling or what sort of driving the sudden flurry of the deals that we\u2019re seeing from you guys out of that one market. Jeff Berkes : I\u2019ll tell you where I going that Alex, that is the benefit of a local partner. It is yes, all of these have effectively been sourced through that local partner. That local partner was somewhere along the way on each of those deals and back of the question from before that\u2019s \u2013 that is the one of the benefits, that offsets the more complexity and everything else so it\u2019s there with it. So I think and again, we\u2019ll be able to talk about it more when we in a few weeks when do you see the second half. But these are marketing assets that are not necessarily marketed to the full extent and there is no question that having that local knowledge allows us to look at things with a more refined eye. So that in that case is the reason for that. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then Jim Taylor question in guidance the pending acquisition is not in there. But if we look at the balance sheet of your cash flow just $22 million at quarter end, then you guys bought back $150 million, and your line of credit is $106 million. So it sounds like there is a bond offering in the back half. Is that in your guidance or that\u2019s not in your guidance? Jim Taylor : We do anticipate and I said in our guidance longer term debt issuance in the latter half of the year. But we\u2019ve got the flexibility from a timing perspective, that if the market is not there or away. So but that\u2019s in our guidance. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller of J.P. Morgan. Your question please. Michael Mueller : Thanks. Hey Jim, when you were talking about leasing spreads, I think, you mentioned something about spreads in the second half of the year something along those lines being stronger or above average. And I was wondering if you can just give us a little more color on that. Jim Taylor : It\u2019s from what we can see right now the leasing team continues to do a phenomenal job of rolling tenants and leasing space. So we expect that to be pretty strong. As I\u2019ve always said it\u2019s hard to look at a particular quarter and see a trend. You really to need to look over several quarters and in fact with this company, over a decade of experience and you can see that we traditionally average in the mid teens. Earlier in the year we had a 8%, this quarter we had 15%, right. I certainly see strong signs that will continue to be at or above that historical average. Don Wood : My teams are excited because there is a big three or four deals that are real good deals in the works that we\u2019re moving along, because it helps themselves put that in the comment. So that\u2019s usually were it comes down to us. There is \u2013 it is our efforts on how go get at under market or underperforming tendency and make it better. And there\u2019s a few of things in the works that are good. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Auerbach of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. George Auerbach : Thank and good morning. Jim I\u2019m sorry if I missed this but in the first phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly, how much NOI is being captured in the second quarter results from the $430 million or so of cost spend to date? And how much of the $430 million, has actually been delivered? Jim Taylor : We had about, as I said in the remarks, about $3.5 million of NOI. If you look at Pike & Rose at this point roughly half of it in the first stage has been delivered, for a call that we still have the office investment, delivering, as well as Building 10 which is about a $110 of investment. Just now, beginning to deliver in leased-ups subsequent to the quarter. And that Assembly, we are probably about 70% delivered when you factor in the office which is still delivered. Don Wood : Thank you. I mean it\u2019s the small number compared to what is going be. I\u2019m there is big leg between as you know, cash out even delivery and make them generations for board. George Auerbach : Yes \u2013 no just \u2013 that seems to be one of those themes of earnings season so far and retail especially is giving credit to companies have stabilized or delivered these big developments that will give you stabilized NOI in six months, nine months, twelve months so just wanted to clarify that. And Jim just 8% FFO growth on the new 2015 midpoint, get\u2019s you to kind of low 570 range. It sounds like X acquisition that\u2019s what people should expect next quarter? Don Wood : Are you talking about 2016 are talking about 2015, I\u2019m sorry. George Auerbach : Yes, for 2016. Don Wood : We\u2019re not providing guidance there, what I have that is look George and this is important, we continue to invest in the long-term, we\u2019re delivering developments like these Building 10 at Pike & Rose which initially drag NOI. So again as we look forward we feel very confident about our plan to continue to generate 7% to 9%. George Auerbach : Great. Thank you. Don Wood : Please try and now to get you out of ahead of George [indiscernible]. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz of UBS. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hello. Don Wood : Hey, Jeremy. Jeremy Metz : Hey, good morning, guys. Sorry, I had a phone issue, a moment roster here. Just couple of quick ones, and I'm not sure if I missed this early in the call, but did you say how much capital at share was for the seven street retail assets in Miami. Jim Taylor : Yes, it was just under $6 million. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Jim Taylor : All in terms of initial investment. Jeremy Metz : Okay. And then just switching to asset sales you still have a handful assets you list as other similar to you heaps and streets, I was just wondering get those additional assets here given the strength in the market, or would it really be more of a timing thing with finding additional acquisitions at this point. Dawn Becker : It\u2019s a combination of both Jeremy and I don\u2019t \u2013 nowhere where we can say is that you should expect a closing of a sale of one of those assets in the next few months, but I can tell you we\u2019re looking at hard and the idea is always to try to balance it with our earnings growth, within acquisition and make it\u2019s the most efficient transaction. So always on the list and you will see every year one or two. Jeremy Metz : Okay. And then just one quick one for Jim, just in terms of capitalizing interest, can you just remind us how you think about capitalizing interest and then when do you stop is that delivery or stabilization. Dawn Becker : We stop at delivery. So when that space is ready to be leased, we stop even if it\u2019s not leased we stop capitalization. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Your question please. Chris Lucas : Good morning, everyone. One detail question, on the, I know it was referenced earlier. I guess, you cleaned up the ownership of Pike 7 with the [indiscernible] acquisition I guess does that imply timing or is it just an opportunity to go ahead and clean that up at this point. Don Wood : Completely opportunistic in terms of when it was. And we wished we owned it all along it\u2019s a vacant building on the hard corner of an important asset for us. So it\u2019s certainly something that we should own, it was not for sale. And when that opportunity came we jump on, we don\u2019t play anymore. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then, Jim, just trying to get a hand along the same-store pool as it relates to \u2013 its relationship to the overall operating portfolio at this point given the development deliveries. Can you give us a sense \u2013 to how much the same-store pool makes up for the quarter of the overall operating platform? Jim Taylor : From an NOI perspective, it\u2019s 95%. Chris Lucas : It\u2019s still that large? Jim Taylor : Yes. Chris Lucas : Yes. And that\u2019s been pretty consistent I would assume over the last couple of quarters and assume it should stay relatively in that range over the next couple? Jim Taylor : Yes. It should and again it\u2019s an important point because when we look at, we look at our NOI, we included those assets. It\u2019s substantially all of our portfolios. Don Wood : Yes, Chris, that is such an important. When you know that is not a GAAP measure as you know and therefore there is a lot of interpretation as to what \u2013 what same-store numbers means. So I just \u2013 I\u2019m really glad you said that because it is virtually all of our analog, lot of our analog. Chris Lucas : Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you. Jim Taylor : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Schweitzer of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Greg Schweitzer : Thanks good morning, everyone. As the lease gets going on the second multi-family at Pike & Rose. So I was wondering how the progress is stacks up so far. And [indiscernible] initial expectations? Jim Taylor : I put a cover in my remarks Craig that \u2013 that building is called palace. It is the [indiscernible] that is what you\u2019re referring to, right? Greg Schweitzer : Right. Jim Taylor : Yes. We just opened it up for leasing at the end of June. We did 36 deals, at or open above or performance in those first deals, which is a really good start, it\u2019s a good product. I mean it\u2019s a really add some nice contrast to the first building that there \u2013 it\u2019s more upper end and it\u2019s obviously higher rise versus \u2013 stick bills and so that the initial start, we\u2019re underway, good start. Greg Schweitzer : You\u2019re having to do anything extra or definitely in terms of marketing or anything like that \u2013 versus the first building|? Don Wood : Not so far. Although I mean we are always looking at \u2013 innovative marketing ways. We\u2019ve got some full things that happen. But with respect to concessions, there are some that are market or less than market frankly so far. I hope that holds up, will see at the big building in an 18 process in order to get there. But the start at least has been \u2013 has been strong. Greg Schweitzer : Okay, great, thanks and then just a quick one on guidance. Is there still some level of ATM issuance embedded in that for the rest of the year? Don Wood : There is, thank you. You know we expect to another $70 million to $100 million for the balance of the year. Greg Schweitzer : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Hau of SunTrust. Your question please. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. This is Steven. Just a quick one, going back to your CocoWalk asset, you thought a $6 million of buildings is this, if you had a free met this is the first earning of your land, square footage assemblies that around that area or it is kind of halfway through it just given that it seems like the lot more things can by around that neighborhood. Don Wood : Well, Steve, but I will tell you, its not like with what we\u2019ve done so far, plus what we are planning in the next few weeks is in planning in terms of critical math and that really is that always the first thing can you get critical math that to actually impact a market, its really hard to do. We \u2013 it\u2019s not a good job of that, so this is a really good start in terms of landlord its not the first inning I mean it\u2019s the fixed inning in terms of that, what we are it is in terms of redevelopment thought the first pitch hasn\u2019t been drawn. Unidentified Analyst : Right. And I see like \u2013 elementary school waiting for the asset, is that something that yes, I would say its permanent resident or something that maybe you can do something with overtime. Don Wood : That is a permanent resident. Jim Taylor : Very permanent. Don Wood : One of the attracted things about that sub market is that it has some of the very best schools in South Florida. So we get great day time traffic in addition to the office over $1 million square feet of office and that\u2026 Jim Taylor : And it\u2019s a magnitude for the folks that we wanted to be at our place. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. I like to turn the call back over to the conference host Brittany Schmelz. Ma\u2019am? Brittany Schmelz : Thank you all for joining us. As we\u2019ve mentioned we will start to seeing [indiscernible] for additional details in the coming week. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am. That does conclude the program. Ladies and gentlemen, you may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Brittany Schmelz. Ma'am, you may begin. Brittany Schmelz : Good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining on the call are Don Wood, Jim Taylor, Dawn Becker, Jeff Berkes, Chris Weilminster and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Certain matters discussed in this call, maybe deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securitize Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operation and it's actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements. And we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our Web site at www.federalrealty.com. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter 2015 results. Don? Don Wood : Well, thank you, Britney, and good morning, everyone. So we had a big important quarter for the company here with FFO per share of $1.36, a result higher than we ever reported before with 10.6% higher than last year's third quarter. Starts on the top line with overall revenue growth of 8.4%, which flows nicely down overall property level operating income growth of 8.7%. Somewhat higher G&A from additional personnel and down below the operating line, the strength of our balance sheet paid huge dividends in the form of lower interest costs. If you sit back and you pause for a minute and really reflect on the components of that third quarter P&L, you'll start to recognize that the 5 million sources of our growth all contribute here, creating what we think is the most balanced and durable set of financial results in the business. Consider that in this third quarter, there are contributions from; Number 1, the big developments that Assembly and Pike & Rose, which added nearly $4 million more rent than last year's quarter. 2, Active redevelopments especially in Mercer Shopping Center in New Jersey, Westgate Center in San Jose, the Peterson Building in Hollywood which along with others resulted in overall same-store growth including redevelopment of 4.2%. Third, same-store growth from the core excluding redevelopment which were only 2% with the results of a purposeful and aggressive towards to get back space for redevelopment along with a tough year-over-year comp caused by lower termination and other fees this year. Four, acquisitions like CocoWalk and San Antonio Center which contributed an incremental $2.4 million in rent over last year and most importantly number 5, our balance sheet and track record that results in one of the lowest cost of debt and equity capital among REITs that really provides a level of P&L flexibility that's enviable. As an aside our entire debt portfolio with an average maturity over 10 years from now. As a weighted average interest rate of 4.07%. So excuse my baseball analogy, I know I'm going to be made fun for this, but it really fits here. If Federal were a baseball player, it would be referred to as a five tool player. Five tool players are baseball scouts lingo for a complete baseball player. One with superior arm strength, speed, defensive abilities and those who can hit for average and hit for power. Lee May's is considered one of the best five tool players of all time. And that's what we are humbly trying to mimic. Complete players. It's the completeness of the business plan. We're not dependent on anyone tool that were most proud of and that was so evident during the third quarter. Think about that. Event with 2% same-store growth FFO per share grew over 10% in the quarter and is expected to be over 7% for the year. Again, running this entity with so many arrows in our quiver, it gives us great flexibility to be able to take the longer view, a view required to maximize real estate value. I'll talk a little bit more about this because I think it's really important to any investors' decision to own Federal. When we broke the company up between core and mixed use earlier in the year and brought an additional real estate talent to lead the core, Jeff Mooallem, Michael Linson, Jarett Parker, Liz Ryan and others which caused higher level of G&A the way. We did so in order to ensure that the all-important core portfolio got the attention and aggressive asset management that it deserves to create more value and to continue to act as the strongest possible foundation to the development and acquisition pipeline. In part, that means getting control of space that has long hindered value creation in certain shopping centers. The A&P bankruptcy led a strike. We had four. One, A&P, one, Pathmark, and two, Walmarts between New Jersey and Long Island. All four leases had significant value not just to us, but to multiple parties. And if we chose to not participate in the bankruptcy process, I'm quite confident that all four leases would've been bought by someone which would have resulted in zero down time and zero lost rent in any of those spaces. And if our business plan were one-dimensional we might have let that happen. But we didn't. Nearly 185,000 feet of space and over $3 million of same-store occupancy and rent went out the door and by the way we had to pay millions of dollars to get the right to lose all that income beginning this month. We've taken an educated and calculated gamble that $6 million plus investment plus a year or more of downtime would pay back many times over not only in terms of the four walls of these grocery stores, which is how a lot of people look at the leases value, but for us a by unlocking more significant redevelopment that improve the entire shopping centers. While same-store growth and occupancy will be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and certainly for next year, the future value of Brick Plaza in [Wilde] [ph] Township, New Jersey, Troy Shopping Center in Parsippany, New Jersey and Melville Mall on Long Island will be far higher when we're done releasing and re-developing. I don't know if we could have made that decision if same-store growth and year end occupancy were the only considerations. And yet, we could because our FFO per share growth is still expected to be 7% plus in 2015 and we strive to hit FFO per share growth of 7% in 2016. Okay. Let's back up and talk about leasing for a moment. 478,000 feet of comparable deals executed in the quarter at an average rent of 2698, 19% higher than the 2269 per foot prior tenant was paying; the leasing strength was broad with both new deals and renewals registering double-digit growth as did both anchor and small shop leases. In addition, 19 non-comparable deals done largely on the new developments representing an additional 82,000 square feet of space. So over 560,000 square feet of deals in a three-month period. There is plenty of productive leasing being done these days in virtually all markets that we do business in. That's an important point to focus on at this particular time as we assess the sustainability of the strong retail leasing market. We're betting that demand for solid retail real estate remains that way due primarily to the limited amount of great real estate locations that are available. Most good stuff is pretty well leased out. You can see it of the occupancies of most high-quality portfolios. Here is why that represents a particularly good opportunity. We're going to consciously take it the other way for a while. As I mentioned earlier, we're aggressively tasking our core team to go hard after space farming retailers and part because we want to use these favorable economic conditions to release them now. We expect to have more anchor vacancies to attack in the next few quarters than we've had in years. The A&P supermarket, I discussed our only one example. LA Fitness is former Valley's location and our Grant Park Shopping Center in Arlington, Virginia, it's another example. We're getting pretty close to our redevelopment plan that makes financial sense at that center that requires us to get that and adjacent space back in order to control enough of the shopping center to be able to execute the redevelopment. Of course, it's downtime and lost rent in the meantime. The Hudson Trail closure resulting from that company's bankruptcy at Montrose Crossing that many of you remembered from the Investor Day is another that could give us just the flexibility we've been looking for at that end of the shopping center. Of course, it's downtime and lost rent in the meantime. But basically, because of our big developments beginning to contribute, our redevelopments already in process acquisitions like CocoWalk and Sunset Place and a low leverage of balance sheet with a favorable cost of capital, we believe that the inherent balance of the plan will continue to allow us to grow earnings at roughly 7% annually which is necessary for us to double earnings over 10 years of foundational goals of our company. So far so good. And when it comes to those acquisitions and of elements, man, we have a lot going on. From continued advancement of the construction and leasing at both Pike & Rose and Assembly to the opening of the Point Development in El Segundo to critical acclaim this quarter, to the largest office deal that we've ever done with data mining technology powerhouse Splunk at 500 Santana Row, which by the way will create an immediate $75 million or so of value. So that closing on October 1 of previously referenced Sunset Place in South Miami, we have got more going on to keep our five growth buckets fully productive than ever before. Let me give you a few more updates on those big projects and then I will turn it over to Jim. At Pike & Rose, we had a strong quarter in terms of residential leasing, and by the way, I want to thank many of you for joining us there for the Investor Day about a month ago. As we reported in the past per se which is this 174 unit first residential building of the project is and remains 95% leased up and you remember that leasing began on the high-rise building we call Pallas over the summer. We currently already have 100 of the 319 units in that building leased that's faster than we anticipated and rent in line with our pro formas. The update isn't is positive on the construction site as cost overruns largely on and around the fa\u00e7ade and the skin of the high-rise building both material cost and labors will overrun by approximately $10 million. Accordingly, we reflected that in the 8-K but still expect to complete Pallas lease up as scheduled throughout 2016. Construction is underway on the second phase. At Assembly, construction on the Partners Healthcare Complex is proceeding very well and we're hopeful that many of the 4000 plus employees expected at that location will begin occupying the space by midyear 2016. The balance of the second phase of Assembly Row is now underway. Turning to 500 Santana Row, in addition to the strong financial return from this Splunk deal that return brace of trust we're really excited to have the incremental daytime office traffic and the added in complementary parking that it adds surrounding out Santana Row. With Apple's new headquarters being built just 4 miles down the road and the Splunk deal signed at Santana, the rest of the build-out at the balance of Santana Row as well as the 12 acres across the street that we call Santana West will be lower risk and more valuable. Construction remains on time and on schedule for 2017 rent start in Splunk building. And finally in South Miami, the deal that we have been referring to all year, finally closed on October 1, and I trust you've all seen the detail in the acquisition press release. The demographics surrounding this 10 acres that make up Sunset Place are among the strongest in our portfolio and we're actively looking at redevelopment and re-merchandising plans and schemes. I'm going to resist talking about those redevelopment plans and schemes in those possibilities until we're confident in what it is that we can do, but in the meantime, we should yield above 6% on our nearly $100 million investment for 85% before our interest costs. That is it for my prepared remarks, I will turn it over to Jim, and I look forward to your questions afterwards. Jim Taylor : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don alluded to this quarter represented yet another record for us at $1.36 per share and just pausing on FFO for a moment, I would like at the outset to recognize the contribution of the entire Federal team from leasing, operations, development and investments many of them you got to meet at our Investor Day last month who delivered these outstanding results. Turning to the numbers overall POI grew at 8.7% over the prior year in line with our long-term plan. The largest single driver of that growth was our core portfolio, which grew at 4.2% on a same-store basis including redevelopment. Given the volume of properties that we have under redevelopment that pool represents approximately 95% of our total POI. Our same-store pool excluding redevelopment activity which is a smaller percentage grew at 2%. We realized about 70 basis points of drag from year-over-year differences in term fees and certain one-time fees. Other drag on same-store POI growth which began to show this quarter and will accelerate as Don alluded to and I will cover in guidance associated with roll over contributed another 30 basis points of drag. When you consider the roll over that we are achieving from a leasing perspective, which was 19% on a cash basis and has averaged 70% over the last four quarters this timing lag or downtime is very opportune as we release the space in a very strong market. The balance of POI growth was driven by development deliveries collectively Pike & Rose and Assembly contributed $3.5 million of POI this quarter and the successful integration of the San Antonio Center and CocoWalk acquisitions both of which are performing very well against our initial acquisition underwriting. G&A increased $1 million year-over-year largely due to higher personnel costs and placement fees as we invest in our platform for growth. Again, we will cover in guidance but we expect our G&A margin remained below 5% of revenue. Interest expense declined $1.7 million due primarily due to the reduction in our weighted average interest rate from 4.7% to 4.1% which was offset by a lower interest capitalization as we continue to deliver development. Bottom line FFO per share grew at 10.6% in the quarter followed by the long-term plan. Turning to the balance sheet we opportunistically accessed the debt markets in late September capitalizing on favorable pricing dynamics at the five-year part of the curve and issued $250 million of 2.55% senior notes and at all-time low spread for us of 110 basis points. This issuance moved our weighted average tenure beyond 10 years versus the peer average closer to five. We utilized the proceeds to term out borrowings under the line of credit which had full capacity of $600 million at quarter end providing more than enough liquidity to fund the growth that we have underway. Our debt to EBITDA remains strong at 5.25x and our fixed charge coverage improved to 4.5x. On the acquisition front as Don alluded to, we successfully closed on October 1 on the acquisition of Sunset Place for total price of $110 million. As we discussed in our Investor Day, we are pleased that within the last six months we have successfully deployed almost $200 million of capital into two in-fill assets in Coconut Grove and South Miami. These two assets not only provide an attractive current yield in a 6% range importantly that present great upside potential through redevelopment and repositioning to better serve the affluent and year around populations of South Miami-Dade. Looking at the balance of 2015, we've increased our FFO guidance range to 530 to 533. This range is based on our expectation that we will achieve same-store NOI for the full year of 3.5% which reflects the downtime Don mentioned for approximately 184,000 square feet on the three A&P locations as well as an additional 60,000 square feet of box space associated with Hudson Trail and City Sports that we're taking over this quarter. Assuming our leasing with Static which never is that would represent about 120 basis points of occupancy. As we expect our same-store NOI to be low in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to 2016, this is another big year for the company in terms of NAV creation. For somebody who has to provide guidance, it doesn't make it easy but the level of activity just blows me away. First, as Don alluded to, we expect to complete the lease up of the 319 unit Pallas high rise of Pike & Rose, initial leasing as Don alluded to is going well and we expect that building to stabilize in the fourth quarter of 2016. We well-experienced in drag through early 2016 as the building achieves breakeven occupancy. The office space at both Assembly Row and Pike & Rose which represents approximately $80 million of investment is fully committed and we will continue to see rent commencing through 2016 and early 2017 as those tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana Row, our 234,000 square foot office building which represents approximately 120 million of investment is 100% pre-leased and will deliver in 2016 and rent commenced in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo, which opened successfully this quarter with strong tenant performance will stabilize in the latter half of 2016. In addition to the Point and 500 Santana Row, this is important we have approximately $85 million of tactical redevelopments stabilizing over the next five quarters. The partner is building at Assembly Row as Don alluded to will deliver with over 4500 employees taking occupancy in the latter part of 2016. We will grand open Saks OFF 5TH in our old headquarters basement space at Congressional, in addition to stabilizing the storage residential building. We'll be well underway on the second phase as the Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment and we will begin delivering in 2017 and 2018. And finally, as we've covered in some detail, we will be re-leasing the LA Fitness and A&P and other boxes in our core portfolio that we have recaptured this year. We expect our 2016 FFO per share to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.71 per share or approximately 7% growth at the midpoint. That growth of 7% remains at the top of the estimates for our peer group none of whom have yet provided 2016 guidance. It is consistent with our long-term plan and reflects some critical investments in future value creation and consistent growth that we discussed at length at our Investor Day. Those investments include a balance sheet with weighted average debt tenor of over 10 years. Debt to market cap of 21% that importantly provides us maximum flexibility to fund our long-term value creation at the lowest positive capital. Downtime associated with the targeted recapture of the A&P and LAF in 2016 represents approximately $5 million or almost $0.07 per share or 100 basis points of same-store NOI. That targeted box recapture is on top of an additional $6 million or almost $0.08 a share of downtime associated with the roll over of larger box spaces is in our portfolio. To provide some overall context, the average downtime in our same-store portfolio associated with all roll over in the last five years has been on average about $10 million to $11 million of impact. That downtime impacted 2016 is approximately $70 million. That's importantly as Don alluded to, we are investing in NAV creation, while our near-term same-store NOI is expected to be in the 3% to 3.5% range for the year. Approximately $2.5 million of incremental marketing spend the we're investing to ensure that the critical first phases of our mixed use developments opened successfully as well as starting to market the condos that we will deliver in the second phases of the Assembly and Pike & Rose. As I discussed at our Investor Day, so these new urban neighborhood successfully stabilize, this cost center becomes a potential revenue opportunity. Over $1 million of redevelopment R&D as we continue to fill our pipeline of redevelopment -- excuse redevelopment R&D as we continue to fill our redevelopment pipeline. We expense these costs until the projects are probable. As Don mentioned, our core team is actively engaged in executing upon needs and identifying new opportunities for the future. And then finally higher G&A that we expect to be approximately $34 million to $35 million as we invest in growing the team. But we will always stay disciplined as we maintain the G&A margin among the lowest in our peer group. As always our guidance for the next year does not include any acquisitions or dispositions that is not already closed. However, we do expect to remain active on both front and will update guidance as those transactions occur. We've covered a lot but before I turn it back to the operator to open the line, let me thank all of you who attended the Investor Day last month. Your turnout was terrific. We've had great feedback and as always greatly appreciated the opportunity to connect with our earners and analysts. We look forward to seeing many of you again in a week or so at NAREIT to the extent you haven't reserved the spot on the calendar please do so soon. With that operator, I would like to turn it over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Hi. Thank you. I was wondering, if you could give a sense of the direction that maybe the new tenants that shop at Sunset Place may take versus -- Don Wood : I was expecting the question. I was hoping it wasn't the first question. Listen, I do want to talk about Sunset Place a little bit. Look, you may have heard the former owner of Sunset Place, Simon Property Group is pretty darn good at what they do. If it were an easy fix and there was an easy way to create a lot of value in 12 months or something else like that they would have done it. So I don't want to talk about that just yet. There's a lot of complexity with it. Basically when you look at the going in yield and the going in price, we basically said all right there is enough cushion based on what that location is and what you would have to pay for a perfect assets. There's enough cushion over that to give us the opportunity. Give us the time to take the chance to see if we can find a better merchandising scheme or better physical plant, see if we can make the numbers make some sense and which includes -- which will include a new entitlement process et cetera. So that will take -- it will take a couple of years. It will take some time. So I don't want to get out ahead. I don't really want to have anything in your mind. I would love to just kind of take it for what it is. And when we start talking about a way to create value that we see pay for it then give us credit for it then. But at this point, I'm really not ready to do that. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And then, maybe if you have any observations about Macy's backstage opening at Melville, I would like to hear it. Don Wood : I actually don't know how they open in terms of numbers. I should know that but Chris Weilminster, do you have any information you can add? Chris Weilminster : Craig, it's still a little bit early for us to report on that. We've not gotten much information back from Carl or his team. So unfortunately I do not have any better answer than Don provided. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Don Wood : We will be ready to talk about that next time Craig. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Thanks. Goodbye. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. It seems like you made some parts of leasing at Congressional Plaza and Pentagon Row, could you talk a little bit about that? And maybe just putting it all together your guidance or same-store NOI of 3% to 3.5% which I assume includes redevelopment. What is that look like if there wasn't someone that is kind of proactively leasing and A&P? Jim Taylor : Well, I mean 100 basis point in and of itself. A&P and LAF alone is about 100 basis points. So and again, Ki Bin when you put the context of what we're doing overall because roll over happens every year. Downtime happens every year. Over the last several years our average downtime has been about $10 million to $11 million just in our same-store portfolio this year it is going to be about $17 million. So it gives you a sense of the scale and scope of the drag on what we're getting after. Just A&P and LAF alone from an occupancy standpoint would be approximately 180 bps of occupancy. So just those are pretty meaningful. Again, nothing is static. Chris and team continue to be very active on the leasing front, but even if we get that space leased as you understand it will take some time before that rent commences. So that's what we're forecasting for 2016. Don Wood : Hey, Ki Bin, the only thing I would add to that is, you may remember from the Investor Day, we did spend a lot of time on Congressional because we really did want you to see what a dominant shopping center -- how it can still our value effectively 50 years after we bought it. And show when Saks OFF 5TH opens up there, we will also do a refresh to the front end of that shopping center which we believe will help us in our re-leasing of all the shop space that is there not to mention 50 additional units, residential units on the back of the shopping center. So this is all tied in. That is not specific to LAF or to A&P. But we are getting after those type of situations throughout the portfolio. Not just the two big ones that we mentioned. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Hey, good morning, guys. I heard you mention a couple occupancy numbers associated with the downtime, was it 120 basis points or was it 180 basis points, I think you just mentioned. Jim Taylor : No. I'm sorry, I misspoke. Thank you for clarifying that. With the A&P and LAF, it's about 120 basis points of occupancy. Christy McElroy : Okay. And so when should we expect that to be fully in the numbers as we kind of think about as we go through 2016 and what quarter would you expect to be sort of a trough in terms of the year-over-year occupancy decline? Jim Taylor : As you look into the year, we are going to be seeing the drag really not only this quarter but at least for the next three quarters into 2016. As we go into the fourth quarter of 2016 we expect to see some of that improved. Don Wood : Christy, anchor leasing, I'm sure Weilminster is smiling on -- he is not in the office with us, he is at a remote location but I'm sure he is smiling. In Anchor leasing getting those deals done and new deals done, getting that space built out, getting the tenants in and paying rent will take at least a year. And just -- that's what it takes. That is in the math of what we consider. When we consider aggressively going after in A&P or whatever it is, we are not believing that six months from now that space is up and operating in rent payment. It just doesn't work that way. So financially, we are considering a full 12 months and in some cases 15 months of downtime before its back in the numbers. Christy McElroy : Got you. And if you think about sort of all the rent that you're losing on all this space and aggregate, what do you think could be potentially the mark-to-market on that space, or some sort of a range relative to the spreads that you been generating? Don Wood : I would hope that you see something like 25%, 30% or maybe more percent. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then, just lastly, how do you think about selling assets today just for the fund growth versus accessing the ATM? Don Wood : Well, let me talk about asset sales for a second because this is something that it never -- it always kind of hangs underneath the radar for us. But when you look back there is always a level of assets sales no, not as much as our competitors. We don't need to do as much as our competitors in there. But when you see the assets on Houston Street and San Antonio, Texas sold this year, you will see by the end of the year, I suspect, we have got another one on the contract to sell -- you will see that too if that deal goes through. You'll see another one next year. There's all these going to be $50 million or so of trading up. One of the things you kind of get me a little bit earlier than I wanted to talk about it. But I'm going to be showing you maybe not for a NAREIT, but maybe we will see if we can be ready. The past couple of years of assets that have been sold versus what it is that we have bought. And you will clearly, although it is a little dilutive, it's not as dilutive as most of our competitors would necessarily be because we get good prices even on what we are selling vis-\u00e0-vis what we are buying. You will see a real improvement in the overall portfolio if you just think about San Antonio Center that we brought in Northern California in and Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas out, the difference is night and day and we're going to show you two or three or four more examples like that on a portfolio basis. But figure around 50. Christy McElroy : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Hi, it's Jim. Sticking with the occupancy. So just to clarify, are you saying in Q4 that's where we're going to start to see it's going to be down about 120 year-over-year. That's the first part. And the second part is, I think Don mentioned possibly accelerating this and recapturing being more practical recapturing some other boxes. So if we're thinking about 2016, if you got the 120 dip for those two tenants should we expect more on top of that. Jim Taylor : Yes. Thank you. In fact of the fourth quarter that dip could be as low as 150 or as high as 150 basis points of occupancy based on some of the other boxes that we're getting after. So as we look forward and as I mentioned and put it in context, we are seeing substantially more downtime and lag in the coming year associated with this targeted recapture and taking over the space. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then going to Pallas, the apartments, I think you said stabilized in the fourth quarter, you mentioned breakeven to occupancy. What exactly is a breakeven occupancy at what level and do you think you'll open there. Jim Taylor : Our breakeven occupancy there is going to be 40% to 50% range somewhere in there we begin to cover the operating cost. It depends of course on the mix of units that are in that 40% to 50%. We expect to be there towards the end of the first quarter early second quarter. So my comment is meant to point out that early in the year that building will be dragging from an NOI perspective. As Don mentioned, we are on target in terms of our pro forma rents. And as we deliver units we're seeing good appetite. But with this building we're delivering units as we go up the building. And it's the pace of construction more than anything else dictating that timing. Michael Mueller : Got it. And one last one here. For 2016 guidance what's assumed for equity raise? Jim Taylor : We expect to raise probably about $150 million for the year. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Jason White with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open. Jason White : Hey, how you are doing? Just a couple of quick questions. The first part as you look at the anchor boxes, you are taking down and remerchandising, what portion of those do expect over the next year to be once that is kind of come back to you that you didn't really seek out, and then how much that's proactive? And then, I guess, the second part of that is, why now on the proactive front is this what you feel like is kind of the peak leasing season over the cycle or is it just now it's good as time as any? Don Wood : Jason, let me take the last part first, and yes, there is no doubt, look this for 2009 or 2010 the approach would be a different approach. And it would be about maintaining that income stream the best we can. When we look at 2016, it's not only that we feel strong. I'm going to ask Weilminster to comment on this, when I'm done. But it's not only that we expected to be -- to remain strong in terms of demand exceeding supply on the particular location and in the particular boxes that we're talking about. But we have other ways to grow the company. And so on balance, I mean I'm not sure how many of the competitors are out there are going to grow at 7% next year or certainly 7% this year, 7% next year, 7% two years ago more. I mean it's probably 25% over the last three years something like that. I don't know how many competitors have that and I do think that's because of all of the tools we have. So when you take the other ways we have to grow coupled with what we believe about the particular anchor boxes that we are purposely trying to upgrade the tenancy on and upgrade the shopping centers on, this seems like the right time to do it aggressively. And by the way, we are paying more G&A for more individuals who have smaller portfolios from which to create value and so that better half more aggressive management of those particular acre boxes. It all works together at this particular time. That is our bet. Jason White : Okay. So on the first part what's the breakdown of -- as you look over the next 12 to 18 months, is it, most of these came back to you because the retailer is underperforming, or is there a larger chunk that you are proactively seeking. Could you give us a couple of examples but just in terms of magnitude? Don Wood : Yes. On the anchor stuff it's by far mostly stuff that we are proactively going after. It is the A&P. It is the LA Fitness. Some of those smaller stuff which is included in there, Hudson Trail which is a local or a regional sporting goods company going bankrupt is, we wouldn't have aggressively wanted it back. Now it opens up some good things, but we wouldn't have aggressively wanted it back. The same with City Sports, which is in both Bethesda and Pike & Rose. We wouldn't have chosen this timing. But we get it. Because we're in the right locations we still think it will be a good thing, but it's a lot on top of those anchor boxes that are primarily proactively aimed for. Jason White : Okay. Then when you look at Pike & Rose, yields have gone from 8 to 9 to 7 to 8, down to 7 and I think that's largely because of some rent from the first part, and then, some apartment rents and then some cost overruns. Is this just a pretty typical of complex mix used or would you say these are more one-off related to Pike & Rose that shouldn't be kind of extrapolated across many of your mixed-use projects going forward. DonWood: I would not. I think when you specifically look at Pike & Rose, Pike & Rose in the first phase is largely residential. When you are talking about largely residential, you are talking about 12 month leases. And we had a Board meeting down in Miami yesterday and I was talking to the Board about this. The reality is that, and I don't mean to say this in a cavalier way, I don't mean to come across that way, but so what. To the extent we missed the rent in a 12 month lease on a residential product to start because of more supply in the market because of whatever economic conditions that there are 12 months from then we'll have another chance, 12 months from then, we will have another chance since that. And they would have been no different investment decision made. It takes a seven years from beginning to end to do this. You are never going to get. Sometimes you get lucky and you are in the peak of the part of cycle where the residential rents are higher sometimes the opposite. But you wouldn't have made a different decision. In terms of the cost, I feel differently about that. I mean we've got cost overruns on that high-rise in particular that I wish we didn't have. That is value that is gone. So it is a different type of thing. I think that's a mixed-use thing? No. I don't. I think that's a screw up on that particular design and implementation and construction project. So I wouldn't take that and extrapolate that all along. When you are talking about retail deals we're dealing with much longer term leases into that office, you are certainly talking about longer-term leases. So I view them a little differently. Jason White : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Paul Morgan : Hi. What's your total dollar value invested in redevelopment next year and your funding mechanisms for that you mentioned $150 million in the ATM but how far do you think in terms of your redevelopment cost? Jim Taylor : Our total spend is going to be approximately $400 million of development and redevelopment. Of that probably $50 million to $60 million are spend during the year is going to be pure tactical redevelopment. And from a funding standpoint, we do expect to be issuing about $150 million of equity. We will potentially have some asset sales as Don alluded to and then as always free cash flow to fund that. Paul Morgan : Okay. Great. And then just a little bit more macro, I mean can you talk about, how you are seeing the supermarket business at the moment. I mean there's been a lot of news over the past quarter between the bankruptcies and whether it's Walmart on one end or Whole Foods on the other. And maybe then kind of more narrowly as you look at things like the A&P spaces, do those necessarily go in the supermarket direction or could there be other uses as you look at really the anchor space or doing something similar to redevelopment there? Don Wood : It's a good question Paul. And Chris, I'd like you to chime in on this start. Let's start on the macro question with -- what you see in the supermarket business. Chris Weilminster : Yes. We're seeing for our -- again, I think about our portfolio and then look more macro on a macro basis there is certain -- there is demand. We are seeing it certainly in our assets and I think there are some of larger companies that are out there whether it's -- looking at a small store concept to get more urban located it, whether it's Kroger trying to figure out a way to grow its [indiscernible] footprint, differentiate its brands a little bit more or Whole Foods working on the 365. There's a lot of focus on these brands and/or the company is figuring out different platforms to grow. And so when you then think about that to what it means to Federal, when you look at our high-quality of assets surrounded by the best-in-class demographics, they very much have an interest in it. So the three locations, the A&P's that we have there, there is interest from groceries and all of those locations. In addition to that there is interest with other players that are out there. We talk to at the Investor Day about the soft goods categories looking for growth whether that's Macy's, Nordstrom Rack, HBC, Saks OFF 5TH concepts. We have demand in some of the category killers that are out there, the pet categories, the shoe categories, the cosmetic categories. All of these players are looking for growth opportunities. And with the limited amount of new supply that has entered the market, opportunistically with the great piece of real estate, Federal Realty certainly takes advantage of that demand that is out there. So we're clearly -- you may see some groceries backfilling some of the portions of what those A&P boxes were, but we're looking at all opportunities unfortunately for us we've got the demand from different categories. Don, you want to take it from there? Don Wood : Yes. Paul I wanted to say something more macro to you. First of all, and that is, there is not a retail category. And certainly grocers are not exempted from this. That isn't trying to figure out who they are going to be, how they are going to service. How they're going to improve their investment pieces over the next 5 to 7 years. Every category is impacted. And grocers are no different. It's funny. It's why a long time ago, I just did not want to be seen as a grocery anchored shopping center company. The idea of being opened, when you listen to Chris Weilminster's speech, you can tell that his view of the retail world is not grocery centric. And as that business is struggling in parts of it, just like women's fashion is struggling, just like hard goods are trying to figure themselves out, just like banks are trying to figure out how to reach retail customers. Every industry the grocery business too. It does come down to having the right place where demand will exceed supply into the extent that demand can be beyond grocers go better. Having said that, it's real clear to us that particularly in at least two of the four and probably more of the A&P boxes they are great grocery locations. So we do believe there will be negotiations with better grocers for those boxes. In addition, as Chris says a wider plethora of retailers. Paul Morgan : Great. Thanks. That was helpful. Just real quick, is there anything in the acquisition pipeline that you can see closing by year end? Jim Taylor : Not by year end. No. Paul Morgan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vincent Chao : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just sticking with the A&P's, I know you gave the average in place rents on those $11.64, just curious what the order of magnitude is on the mark-to-market, do you think? Jim Taylor : I said Vince, somewhere like 25% to 30%, maybe more. Vincent Chao : Okay. Sorry, I missed that. Jim Taylor : That's okay. That's fine. I mean let me be really clear. The capital necessary to not only get those boxes but to absorb the downtime and put in the rest of the shopping centers as compared with the incremental rent not just from that box but including that box and everywhere else in that shopping center is the math we're doing to figure out what kind of IRR and value creation we're making at those shopping centers. There will be a time whenever you want to go in the next year or so I'm going to take you to Brick Township, Brick Plaza, in Brick Township, New Jersey and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about if you're only looking at those four walls you're missing the point. Vincent Chao : Right. No, that makes sense. Just on the -- to do just get outbid on that one? Don Wood : On the fourth one, we did. We thought we put up a decent number and we were blown out of the water by another grocery operator. Vincent Chao : Got it. Got it. Chris Weilminster : I'm sorry. I just wanted to make one point, I'm sorry, I'm not in the room with Don, but I think one thing is important about these A&P leases with Brick, Melville and Troy that everybody should understand and Don is touching on it. But we inherited those leases those weren't leases that we had and they were very much encumbered with restrictions on other categories and other uses that we know demand exists. So I just want to make sure that in addition everything Don is talking about that you guys understand that this does unlever our ability to go after categories that we were not able to do and when we renegotiate leases or when we find replacement tenants we will maintain that flexibility as well as hopefully future out parcel development. I think it's really important, so it was not only getting it back to control end density of the space, but it really does from a leasing standpoint unlever our ability to really add value with more relevant retail which is what we need to stay connected with our communities. Vincent Chao : Yes. That makes sense. Just maybe one last question. For Jim, just I know you've talked about sort of the difficulty in projecting out earnings given the amount of development that's going on and sort of the timing of all of that. And certainly that can shift to here and there. But I was just curious that guidance range that you provided is pretty tight. I think it's only about 1% spread at the midpoint. Just curious what gives you the confidence to have it so tight given the -- Jim Taylor : You are making me nervous. Don Wood : Vince, I'm curious too. Jim Taylor : We feel pretty good that we're going to end up in that range, but you make an important point. And I think it goes to the reputation that some of you have alluded to about our being conservative in our forecast. We have a range for a reason. And a lot of the things that in part volatility as it relates to quarterly number what we'll be seeing next year, we are very positive about all of the activity that can generate that, but it certainly can move things around in the year. But we feel comfortable with that range, albeit I'm sure that a lot of you are going to go right to the top of the range and we provide a range for a reason. And so that's what it is. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Brittany Schmelz, for any closing remarks. Brittany Schmelz : Thank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT later this month. As we mentioned, if you're not already done so please do feel free to reach out to reserve one of the remaining slots in our meeting schedule. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference, this does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great today.",

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Leah Andress. You may begin. Leah Andress : Good morning everyone. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Jim Taylor, Dawn Becker, Jeff Berkes, Chris Weilminster, and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Certain matters discussed on this call, maybe deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements. And we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of Risk Factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our website at federalrealty.com. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results. Don? Don Wood : Well, thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Again I certainly look forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks at the Citi Conference, Florida, where we can talk more about our company and our industry. I also want to thank so many of you for the recognition, good wishes that you conveyed with the announcement of our admission into the S&P 500 late last month. I think our whole team feels particularly proud and your nice words made it even sweeter. So thank you all. Now, let's talk about 2015 results and 2016 expectations. And start off by noting that FFO per share of $1.37 in the quarter and $5.32 for the year before early extinguishment at costs are both all time records for our company and represent 7% quarterly FFO per share growth and 7.7% annual FFO per share growth. Now, just to put that growth into context. We always try to walk the top when it comes to taking a long-term view on our business plan. And that includes sometimes doing things that diminished certain quarterly metrics by same-store growth and occupancy from mid and long-term value enhancements. That is why went out on a limb a few years back before Assembly Row opened to lay out plans double our income over the next decade. That was in 2013 when we subsequently finished the year with 7% earnings growth only to follow that with 7.2% growth in 2014, and now 7.7% growth in 2015. If you're aware of the Rule 72, you'll note that we're on or a bit ahead of schedule, so far, so good. And what the first phases of the big development projects coming into their own, and the second phase is now underway, along with the raw material for future growth that we acquired in Miami, and California lately, we are as optimistic today if not more so than we were back in 2013 as to our ability to double by 2023. For us, it's more important than ever to have and execute on our long-term consistent and sustainable plan that relies less on outside on controllables and more on the execution within our own portfolio. We are really proud of that. All right. So what does it mean for 2016 expectations? Well first it means that we're planning on 6% or 7% FFO growth this year, marginally lower than where we've been but strong nonetheless. Because of the conscious and aggressive effort that we spoke about on last quarter's call to actively create anchored vacancy by replacing weak tenants with stronger ones. And more importantly, unlocking redevelopment opportunities at a number of our larger core shopping centers and that was before the most recent news about Sports Authority where we have five locations generating $3.4 million in annual rent. All good news for the future and providing more growth in value long before 2023 was dilutive to same-store growth and occupancy connect. Hopefully you will remember my remarks from my last quarter's call that attempted to prepare investors for the impact that strategy would have on those metrics in the fourth quarter that we just reported and continuing through 2016. Well, I promise to spare you the five tool baseball player analogy on this call, I've heard plenty about that from you, from most of you over the last three months; I do want to update you on the plan. To recap, when we broke the company up between core and mixed-use earlier in the year, and brought in additional real estate talent to lead the core, which by the way caused a higher level of G&A. We did so in order to ensure that the all-important core portfolio got the attention and aggressive asset management that it deserves. The objective is for the core to produce even more value and continue to act as the strongest possible foundation to the development and acquisition pipeline. In part, that means getting control of space that has long hindered value creation in certain shopping centers. You'll remember that we spoke about the A&P mix which was the most obvious example and we had four : one, A&P, one, Pathmark, and two, Waldbaum's all in New Jersey and Long Island. While four leases have significant value to multiple parties certainly that we chose not to participate in that bankruptcy process, I'm very confident that with all four leases would've been bought by someone which would have resulted in zero downtime and zero lost rent in any of those spaces. And if our business plan were one-dimensional, we might have let that happen. But we didn't. Nearly 185,000 square feet of space that's nearly a full point of occupancy and over $3 million of annual same-store growth that went out the door with the bankruptcy, and by the way, we had to pay several millions of dollars to get the right to lose all of that income. Our assessment is that that several million dollar investment plus a year more downtime would pay back many times over not only in terms of the four walls of those grocery stores, which is how a lot of people look at the leases value, but by unlocking more redevelopment opportunities that improve the entire shopping centers. While same-store growth and occupancy were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter and will be in 2016, the future value of these and other centers where we employed a similar strategy will be far higher. We are deep into exploring redevelopment plans on all of our new found opportunities and I'm excited about the possibilities. Jim will summarize the impacts in his remarks in a few minutes. Now, I don't know if we could have make that decision, if we didn't have a clear long-term plan and same-store growth and year-end occupancy were the only considerations. All right, let's back up and talk about leasing for a minute and there is plenty of it happening. 99 deals done in the quarter, 88 of them comparable for over 380,000 feet at an average rent of $31.88, 23% higher than the $26 per foot the prior tenant was paying. The leasing strength was broad, with both anchor deals and small shop renewals registering double-digit growth. The tenant improvement dollars per square foot associated with those leases requires explanation, because most of it comes from two redevelopment projects. The Saks OFF 5TH deal at our headquarter site of Congressional Plaza, and the Dick, Field and Stream deal at Melville Mall on Long Island. Capital for those deals are both included and considered in the overall return thresholds of the projects, so be careful not to double count that capital as both leasing capital and redevelopment capital it's one and the same. Anyway, you look at it these are strong leasing results. In addition to the 88 comparable deals, we also executed 11 non-comparable deals largely on the new development, representing an additional 58,000 square feet of space, so 440 square feet of deals in a three-month period. There is plenty of productive leasing being done these days in virtually all markets we do business in. And we're betting that that will continue in 2016 for our product type and our locations. And it's why we're consciously trying to get back on the performing anchor space. We want to use these favorable economic conditions to release. We see a good sampling of mediocre retailers that have been holding on for years of either giving up A&P, Hudson Trail, City Sports, or who will soon. We're fine with that. As I've said, are anxious to get it to either release or redevelop. So I haven't touched on acquisitions or development yet, so let me get to the highlights, and we've a lot going on. From continued advancement of the construction and leasing at both Pike & Rose and Assembly to the continued opening of more and more tenants at the very successful point development in El Segundo, California, the continue disciplined construction of fully leased 500 Santana Row set to house data mining technology powerhouse Splunk by the end of this year, to the closing on October 1, of Sunset Place in South Miami, where we're aggressively working to develop a plan to better exploit this A-1 location, to the unwind of our 11-year joint venture with Clarion through the acquisition of their 70% interest in six shopping centers in suburban Boston, New York and DC which by the way creates more fresh powder for redevelopment. So we got more going on how to keep our five growth buckets fully productive and I can remember my 18 years here. Let me give you a few more updates on those big projects and then I'll turn it over to Jim. At Pike & Rose, residential lease up continues to progress quite well with over 40% of the building leased at The Pallas as of today at rents that are inline or even a bit better than our underwriting. The remainder of that residential leasing will require the rest of 2016 through re-stabilization, which again is consistent with our expectations. Secondly, we are well underway on the next phase. The phase II garage is done and open and we've just broken ground in the two largest buildings in phase II this month. It will take two years to get it all open with a 700 foot plus long Main Street and a sense of place long missing from Rockville Pike. In Somerville, Massachusetts, Assembly Row continues to get better and better. With one of our biggest concerns during the second phase construction being adequate parking and serving surface lots are now on construction. That's a high class problem for the initial phase of Massachusetts project, but it's because this is already a very successfully new neighborhood in the Greater Boston Area, it's about to get a whole lot better as partners, employees begin occupying the new building by midyear '16. Very exciting progress there, which is clearly spilled over to the adjacent power center where we hope to be making some important merchandizing and economic upgrades in the next few quarters. In San Jose, 500 Santana Row construction is progressing a bit better than we expected in terms of both cost and potentially schedule, which if it holds, will result in 9% cash on cost yields upon stabilization. That would make Santana, 500 Santana Row the third project in a row with Santana. Residential projects, Lavare and Misora being the first two where the initial revenues exceeded our underwriting. That is not a fluke. It speaks to the big picture point about mixed-used projects done well. While the initial phases that need to create the environment are complicated and often a little less smooth than we would like, the long-term value creations were mass duration and incremental development of these ambitious projects is extremely rewarding and incredibly enduring. Similarly, at the point in El Segundo, the successfully initial tenant openings at the end of last summer have continued and grown as more and more tenants have opened. The final couple of spaces are expected to be leased and opened in 2016 again on time, on budget. I don't have a significant update for you today on our property acquisitions in South Florida, which are performing as planned as we underwrote them. Our most senior team, including Don Briggs, Chris Weilminster, and Dawn Becker, along with our partner Grass River and Michael Comras are fully immersed in redevelopment mode, exploring the art of the possible with city officials, retailers, and others and that applies to both CocoWalk and Sunset. Stay tuned there. And finally, last month we concluded a very successful 11-year shopping center joint venture with Clarion Lion Fund by acquiring their 70% interest in Atlantic Plaza and Campus Plaza in Suburban Boston, Greenlawn Plaza on Long Island, and Free State Shopping Center, Plaza del Mercado, and Barcroft Plaza in Suburban Washington DC. And what we felt was a very fair is favorable purchase price of a $154 million. All of these assets are located in markets we know well and have seen strong growth from. We've got a number of redevelopment and releasing opportunity with these properties that our new core team is focused on, more raw material for future growth. Okay. That's enough for me now. 2015 was a very gratifying year for us full of not only measurable accomplishments, but as are more importantly the solidification of our planned and structured focused on accelerated value creation throughout the second half of this decade and beyond. Thank you all for your interest and support. And I'll now turn over to Jim and look forward to your questions afterwards. Jim Taylor : Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning everyone. As Don highlighted our team delivered yet another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, which is a $1.37, represented 7% growth over the prior year quarter or 7.7% for the full-year. For the many of you park at the top or just above our guidance that $1.37, was just below the top-end of our previously provided range. In a quarter where we continue to invest in the future by intentionally taking down additional box vacancy, adding to our team, selling non-core assets, and incurring transactional cost for favorable acquisition, we are particularly pleased with the bottom-line results driven by our operation, leasing, acquisition, and development team. Turing to the numbers. Overall property operating income grew at 5.9% over the prior year, even with the decline in occupancy reflecting higher anchor rollover, our core portfolio continue to be a significant driver of POI growth. That core grew at 2.6% or approximately 3.8% for the full-year on a same-store basis, including redevelopment. As in prior quarters, allow me to again emphasize, that our same-store pool represents approximately 94% of our total POI. In other words, it represents substantially all of our portfolio and then truly reflects underlying core performance. This quarter the downtime associated with the anchor rollover we discussed, as well as other one-time item produced about a 150 basis points of drag. We highlighted this trend last quarter. And as I will discuss further in guidance, we expect this rollover drag to begin to ameliorate in the later part of this year, resulting in 2016 same-store NOI growth, including redevelopment of approximately 3% to 3.5%. Allow me to pause for a moment. I can think of very few portfolios that show growth even while taking down occupancies. That speaks to the bumps embedded in our leases, double quarters or double-digit rent rollover growth and the successful delivery of our redevelopment. Our first phases of Assembly and Pike & Rose contributed approximately $3 million of POI in the quarter, down slightly on a sequential basis as the Pallas high-rise opening and the office space deliveries triggered full operating expenses. The office lease up is complete and tenants will continue to take occupancy through this year and early next. In addition, as Don mentioned, the lease up at Pallas is going well and we expect to hit a stabilize occupancy in the fourth quarter of this year. Finally, our acquisitions of CocoWalk and Sunset Place, which are performing well against our acquisition underwriting also contributed significantly to our overall POI growth. G&A remained stable at $8.1 million and interest expense declined $1 million, reflecting the lower average rate achieved through our refinancings during the year of 4.1%, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter, as we continue to place development into service. Again, bottom-line FFO grew 7% for the quarter or 7.7% for the year. That absolute bottom-line performance while we continue to invest in the future is something that team takes great pride in. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver that set the EBITDA 5.3 times, weighted average debt tenor of 10 years, which together provides maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all of our growth in NAV creation underway. Turning to guidance for 2016, we affirm that the previously provided range of $5.65 to $5.71 a share, range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% are slightly below our long-term plans. As we discussed last quarter, this was a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year. As Don covered in his remarks, the targeted box recapture in all of our vacancy drives a significant amount of drags in the year. The targeted anchor rollover which represents approximately 6 million of downtime in the year or approximately $8 million of annualized rents is driven by 10 of our properties. The notable spaces include the A&P leases at Troy, Melville and Brick, the former Hudson Trail space at Montrose Crossing, and the former Valley space at Grant Park. In total, the targeted anchor rollover represents approximately 465,000 square feet at some of our very best assets where the investment and downtime this year should pay significant dividends in the future. And as Don discussed in his remarks, we are very excited about the opportunity to unlock value at these centers to redevelopment, repositioning, and releasing. Overall, we expect to significantly exceed the prior in place rent of approximately 1,350 a foot on these larger spaces. In short, we believe we will drive or deliver better retailers at better rents and significantly improve these assets. In addition to this investment and future growth, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective if you look at the year. I mentioned Pallas and again we expect a stabilization of that approximately $100 million investment to occur in the fourth quarter from an occupancy perspective. The office states at Pike & Rose and Assembly which represents approximately $80 million of investments is now fully committed and we will continue to see rent commencing throughout the year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana Row, our 234,000 square foot office building that represents approximately $115 million of investment, is 100% pre-leased, and will deliver late in the fourth quarter and rent commenced in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo continues to perform exceptionally well is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. Our acquisition of our joint venture partner's 70% interest in the six core assets that Don discussed, is expected to be neutral to FFO this year, after transaction cost and factoring in the sale of Courtyard Shops which we completed in the fourth quarter. We do expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017. And finally, we are well underway on the second phases at the Pike & Rose and Assembly to represent another $600 million of investments and expect those spaces to begin delivering in the latter part of 2017 and 2018. From a capital standpoint, we expect to fund approximately $350 million of development and redevelopment with the mix of funds from operations, long-term debt, and equity under our ATM. Finally consistent with our process, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year. Before turning the call over to questions, I would like to introduce Leah Andress, our new Investor Relations Associate. Leah was formerly with Phillips Realty in DC and prior to that was an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. Unfortunately she was also a target. I look forward to having all of you to meet Leah very soon. We also look forward to seeing many of you at the Wells and Citi conference in the next few weeks. With that operator, I would like to now turn the call over to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open, please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning and Leah don't be afraid to give Jim some grief back there. So a few questions here. First, on the West Coast perhaps for Jeff, can you just give us an update of what you are seeing as you are talking to Splunk for their space as well as I think you guys are contemplating building some office across the street and just given the headlines, curious if that is still the plan or may be there has been some change? Jeff Berkes : Yes, Alex, no change to long-term development plans for Santana Row or Santana West. Obviously before we make a capital decision; we're going to make sure we're confident that there is going to be a market there when it's time to lease buildings, so no change. As it relates to Splunk, we don't have any special information about what's going on at Splunk or any of the other tech companies for that matter. But what we do see on the ground, if you will, is them being very aggressive about doing what they need to do to get into the building as soon as possible. They need the space; they need it as quickly as possible, so everything that has gone over the last couple of weeks hasn't affected that at all. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then, as far as the Clarion JV, Don, I think over the years you have been asked numerous times about buying that in and it always seemed like it was more of a steady Eddie portfolio rather than something that would be more interesting to wholly own. So can you just provide some perspective? Was this a case where a JV partner wanted to get out or perhaps given some of the recent retailer things that have come up, maybe there is some new opportunities that made it a little more exciting for you guys to buy in now? Don Wood : Yes, Alex, that's a very fair question, the single biggest thing or first you need both parties to want to do a deal. And from our perspective one of the biggest things that change was it's all about prioritization. And so, as you know, what we did do last year was setting up the core and the way that we set up the core we are kind of freeing up that achievement building on that team to be able to create value in it while taking Don and freeing up Chris and Briggs over on the mixed-use side, there is more capacity. So from our perspective I'm feeling great about being able to actually get to something we would like to get there. Secondly, a lot of it is just timing too, we've already at Plaza Del Mercado, for example, been able to do a deal that was in the works last year and has been in the works the last couple of years. With respect to LA Fitness to redevelop that site, that's great news. So it's really about management of pension afforded by the new reconfiguration of our companies. In addition, Alex too, the timing for Clarion we are ready to develop that partnership for their own reasons and us ready to take it out. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So how much more -- what should we look for as far as upside potential as far as the yield where you bought and where you think it could go over the next -- from a modeling perspective? Don Wood : Yes, see I'm not going to give you a particular answer on that, I can tell you that we are working real hard to that particularly Mooallem and that team, is looking particularly hard as that portfolio. And if Mooallem and Wendy Seher, who I don't know, if you know, she is a critical part of our company, Senior Vice President of Leasing just on the core which is so important when we're saying just on the core, it also ties into what we're doing with respect to aggressively going after space. Having that ability to focus and move on that core the timing is just right. So we will give you more and not sure whether Mooallem we're going to bring him down to city or not, but if we do or if we don't, there will be more exposure for you and folks like you to him to be able to get some of that specifics, those specifics as we get closer. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. I will have to look for Christy to fill me in on what you guys say down at the Citi conference. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Craig Schmidt : Yes, thank you. I am just wondering, are your better redevelopment expansion opportunities going to be internal with a company like Pike & Rose or may they be external like your shops at Sunset Place and CocoWalk? Jim Taylor : You know, Craig, I think that again as we laid out at our Investor Day by far the large preponderance of our investment opportunity exists in what we earn and control today and we went through that some detail. And we augment that tactically with perhaps an acquisition or two; I think this past year we found three strong ones in San Antonio Center, Sunset Place, and CocoWalk which really kind of build our pipeline. But preponderance of what we're focused on and executing on and what you see in the 8-K as we not only detail the projects that are underway but then begin providing for you on that second page what the future pipeline is, is in real estate that we own. Don Wood : Yes, Craig, and just the only thing I would add to that is the type of acquisition we make, I think it's a differentiator for us. I don't think we look at deals. It's not just about buying stable shopping centers; in fact it's not about buying stable shopping centers. It's truly is about looking at it with a more broad real estate point of view to be able to take advantage of skills that we've grown in and developed over the past decade or so in not only in Massachusetts and redevelopment and apply them to the -- to the land by which we look at those acquisitions. I mean there aren't a lot of companies that are going to go take a shot on Sunset place. But when we look at it -- and we may succeed or we may fail, we'll see. But we handicap it in such a way, we're looking at it in such a way that it provides opportunity that is consistent with the skill sets that we've learned all the way up from Bethedsa Row till today. So that's the balance Jim was talking about. Craig Schmidt : Yes, I guess from my perspective, it's like do I rather see you take on projects that have greater upside and that would be outside your portfolio I think generally or the safer bet, taking what you have really strong properties and making them better but I guess -- Don Wood : Yes. I don't know how to tell you tell you which way it will be. I can tell you it will be a balance of both. And how that moves depends on where the opportunity is. One thing we do -- and I think it's important, is we truly -- if you were in our investment committee meetings for each of those type of opportunities it's still capital. And as it's toward a capital where we risk adjust those returns and what we think we're going to do is the critical part of that balance. You're going to see both as we go forward. I just can't tell you whether it's 60/40, 70/30, 50/50, because that depends on the specific opportunity that comes up. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then just quickly, it sounds like you have more appetite for some repurposing of anchor space. Is there a point though where the economy gets too rough that you may be not want to take those gambles from a timing perspective? Don Wood : Of course, Craig. It's funny. I was thinking about one of these 10 shopping centers that -- that we are getting to. I mean these 10 shopping centers that Jim talked about in the core these are shopping centers that we haven't talked much about. We've got 90 shopping centers. And the idea of unencumbering through restrictive anchor leases, things like Willow Lawn, Brick, Troy, Montrose, Crossroads in Chicago is -- show to that we -- as we say we have that appetite. I can tell you at Crossroads in Chicago for example, there is party city. The party city, if this were 2008, we would have done everything we can to keep them there. We would have lowered the rent, we would have done whatever we needed to do to keep the occupancy and to keep the income coming in the drawer. In 2016, we view that differently. We are certainly willing to play hardball on the lease terms effectively and say yes, you got to go, you got to go, because we're much more confident with respect to where it is that that we can release and what it is that we can do in terms of unencumbering the shopping center. Is there a point that that changes? Of course. To the extent the economy, it turns around and goes the other way, it's -- and we're going to feel a whole lot different about that just like we did back then. But it's not going to be an overnight type of decision. You'll have plenty of time and quarters for us to talk through what it is that we're doing with respect to these centers and what it is that we're -- be monitoring with respect to future centers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Donnelly : May be if I can just build on that a little bit just because there is increased concern in the U.S. about a recession today or one approaching if we are not in it already. I know Jim is inclined to probably make guidance that much more conservative than usual. But what specifically has, Don, do you think you have changed in your approach to managing the business to address risks that might not be on the radar screen say six to 12 months ago? And may be have you perceived any change in the willingness of retailers to commit to space or even just certain aspects of lease terms? Don Wood : Yes, Jeff it's a good conservation. Let's start this out by Weilminster, is on the phone I think. I'd love for him to give you a prospective of the leasing world today. And then, I'm going to build on that with respect to your question, okay. Jeffrey Donnelly : Sure. Chris Weilminster : So Jeff, good morning. So my feedback on the leasing world today is that we're very -- we're cautiously optimistic with regards to the opportunities and that very much aligns with what we at Federal Realty have. And this is what we best-in-class assets, which we see located on markets that really align with the retailers desired core customer profile which is incredibly important to them. They know that it's our Realty's commitment to deliver best-in-class property level operation, execution, and maintenance, and are focused on delivering really on the best tenant mix available aligns with their ability to be successful. That puts us then in the best opportunity to take advantage of the growth that retailers are pursuing. And there clearly is growth demand from the retailers. They're just -- their outlook is just a lot more. They are a lot more focused on finding cites that do align with core customer. The deals that they are doing are taking much longer. The lease negotiations are certainly more difficult and they are a lot more selective. So we definitely see opportunity with regard to growth in retailers and we think that they are looking in the markets where we have our real estate. So I think from our perspective we are setup to take advantage of what demand exits out there, both on the box side, as well as on the smaller shop side. And as Don pointed out, I mean it's very important for us as we unlever some of the restrictions and these opportunities take advantage of putting a new relevant box retailers that also that rising tide, will allow us to really take advantage of the demand from the smaller shop tenants and selectively that will make our assets much better. Don Wood : Yes. And let me add to that Jeff. So I mean your question is a great one. And to the extent this was -- turning it to 2008, you'd have a whole different perspective here in terms of what we think and what we're doing in the approach. There is not one side that we see with our discussions, with our retailers, at our properties, in our locations of anything like that. At worse, it's a take a deep -- it's just more of a deep breath. And as Chris said, it's more deliberate. It's a tougher negotiation all that, that's fine. The reality is if you were to see or to know -- if I took you for a ride over to Grand Park Plaza which is inside the Beltway in Fairfax, we have not been able to do anything with that property for a long time, because of the leases in place. This is a particular point in time where we have a shot. If we simply released it to -- you kept the same anchor in and extended those existing leases, we would be losing the shot to create significant value for a decade or more. So we -- when you overall take a look at it -- and this is with the decision, with everything we've done, we are still 93% occupied. This is hardly, oh my God, empty out the whole place, right, but it does. Take -- it take up very measured and careful approach towards 10 shopping centers in particular that that we wouldn't -- we've been trying forever to figure out a way, because demand is there to create value, but they've been encumbered by other demand, fee lease, or an old valley lease or whatever it is that a particular shopping center that was calling it to get it back. That seems like a smart approach to me. It's not all the way over on one side or all the way over on the other. Again, it's balanced. Jeffrey Donnelly : Just may be thank you for that. May be to switch gears, just on the Clarion joint venture one or two questions. All else equal, I would have expected that purchase considering the cash funding to be slightly accretive to earnings but if there is no further dispositions in guidance, I guess what is restraining that possibility? Jim Taylor : Jeff, as I mentioned in the call, we didn't have factor previously in the guidance sale of Courtyard Shops in Wellington, Florida. So when you factor in that asset sale plus transaction cost, generally neutral for 2016 and we do expect it to be $0.02 to $0.03 accretive in 2017. Jeffrey Donnelly : Sorry, I missed the second part of that. I'm just curious, related to that portfolio occupancy in that JV has been a little bit lower than the rest of the Federal portfolio. Can you just remind us I guess how you guys think about the quality of those assets in comparison to your core and is there a future redevelopment potential there that may be isn't in your schedules today or do you see these assets as eventual sale candidates down the road? Don Wood : Yes. The demographics are dam good compared to the rest of the portfolio. And I wish I had a better answer for you as to that. What can I show you today that way I will say, oh my God, why not the other 70% in that portfolio is a clear home run? I don't have that for you today. What I do have -- and again, a lot of it -- from management perspective in a company like this, it's to say all right I know have a very focused team on it. The initial conversations that we've been having with retailers and with custodies and jurisdictions that they're in suggest that there is some good stuff to do at a couple or three of these shopping centers and Plaza Del Mercado was the first one that I've said, I mentioned to you. I expect there will be others. Jim, Mooallem, and his team a little bit of time to run through this and in the next couple of quarters we'll have a far better roadmap for you if you will as to how it relates to the rest of the products that we have. Jeffrey Donnelly : Okay, thanks and one last question. Curious why do Federal's renewal TIs run so much higher than peers? I guess I wouldn't the majority of your tenants -- it is a costless proposition to renew, there is a little incentive or disincentive for them to leave the property and yet your renewal TIs tend to be $8 to $9 a square foot versus sometimes less than $1 for a lot of your peers. I'm just curious what you think drives that? Don Wood : I'm not sure I have an answer, I'm not sure. The one thing I would pass it here is these shopping centers are better shopping centers in areas that that were effectively the economics of the deal on a net basis make a whole lot of sense. And I suspect in return for some of that higher rent there is an expectation for certain small shops tenants to want more done to the space, can we get a redone bathroom, can we effectively refresh et cetera at the space? I suspect that but I don't know for sure. Chris, do you have anything to add to that. Chris Weilminster : Yes, I only would add, I think it just vary, I think this period as Don mentioned, I mean we did a transaction up in Melville where do we have an in-place tenant where there is going to be a downsizing of GLA in one area of the store to bring another one of their brands in. So that is the Dick's deal that was mentioned. And so a lot of it has to do with our making sure of maximizing the opportunity within the space, whether that's an expansion, a shrinking and/or really is an improvement to some of the infrastructure that we see going beyond just a tenant. And so we're very proactive in analyzing every single step available to make sure that we're getting the best out of each space. You think about the amount of our portfolio of 100 plus assets we got to squeeze every bit out of juice out of each one of them, and so we do analyze them and that is how I think you will see the variation that I think we get into defining why on each deal we made those decisions, Don mentioned in our investment committee, and we do analyze them thoroughly. I hope that helps, Don. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Christy McElroy : Hi, good morning, guys and thanks for all the free advertising for our conference. Don Wood : Sure, Christy, keep Alex, informed okay. Christy McElroy : Absolutely first priority. Jim, just following up on some of your comments on delivery and stabilization of the active redevelopment projects, I think you mentioned $3 million of NOI in Q4 from Pike & Rose and Assembly. As I think about the rest of the pipeline, the $290 million of cost at 9%, that's $26 million of incremental NOI from those projects. How much of that flows through Q4 NOI and maybe you can break out the point specifically? Jim Taylor : I'm going to need to get you that number specifically in your follow-up Christy; I don\u2019t have that with me right now. Christy McElroy : Okay, right. And just secondly in regards to I think you mentioned $6 million of downtime impact from box recapture. Just wondering as you think about the occupancy trajectory in 2016 and the re-tenanting of some of those anchor boxes and it sounds like you could potentially have more that you could do on that front, where would you expect physical occupancy to end the year? What's sort of embedded in your guidance? Jim Taylor : I think you're going to see occupancy dip a little bit in the first part of the year and then begin to recover towards the end of the year. I'm not going to give specific percentages because that's a difficult thing to predict based on how particular space can move it at particular period. Don Wood : In Sports Authority too, we're going to have to figure out what happened there. Jim Taylor : Yes. Christy McElroy : Would you have any sense at this point for how many of those five Sports Authority locations you would divest? Don Wood : I don't at this point. You know we've got five Christy and an average rent of 17 box or something like 17 box and anywhere between 11 and 25, I suspect we would love to get back to the ones at 11, and probably won't and once at 25 we will want to get back and we will have to figure out what else we have there. I tell you when I look at it; I take anyone of them back, anyone of them even ones to 25 because where they are and what we could do with them. Jim Taylor : And Christy those are Assembly, Brick, Montrose Crossing, Crow Canyon, and East Bay Bride. So that are some of our very best centers. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just sorry if you mentioned this already on the Assembly phase two condos, the increase in the number and the cost there, anything that we should read into that in terms of demand at that site for multifamily housing, the increases go for the project? Don Wood : Certainly some of that but much more, this is a much more efficient building. The outside of the building that we were building is no different and accordingly being able to refine and tweak mix and efficiency of the building is what that's all about, it is some variance in terms of economics and we would not have done that blue if we not feel the market would absorb that and able to handle 17 more condos. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason White with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jason White : Good morning. Just a quick question along the lines of, with some executive positions floating around out there that are open, how do you look at your talent on the bench in terms of keeping those bodies and may be succession planning if you do happen to get somebody stolen away? Don Wood : Frankly I couldn't feel better; I mean there is we've spent a whole lot of time over the last two years working exactly what you're talking about, Jason, putting comp arrangements into place to make sure that we're doing the best we can to retain. The key with Federal as always been from our perspective you can get the best and the brightest, if you give them the autonomy and you give them the lease so they are able to run their businesses that's effectively what it is that's how we are set up. You can have a couple of cocktails with anyone of them to get their point of view that way but I feel real good about not only choices that will have for succession down the road but also the ability to execute this business plan that we've simply articulate about. Jason White : Okay. And then last question for me. If you could maybe just contrast tenant health from three or four years ago versus today. It is obviously a Darwinian business and you are always replacing weak tenants with stronger tenants. But just overall kind of state of the retailer space, do you feel better today than you did three or four years ago relative to your tenant? Or is it there a little softness that is developing with some of these bankruptcies? Don Wood : Yes Jason, I do have a very specific point of view with respect to this. I mean three or four years ago not just coming out of the recession, you're nervous. You're nervous with respect to what those tenants business plans are going to be, how they are going to work in the new world, did the cuts that they made in their staffing got their organizations with respect to be able to do all that. And what has happened and it's predictable if you kind of take a look at it, is, if you could be in every Board room of all those major retailers and smaller retailers along the way you would, some of them with respect to what they changed and where they're moving into a new economy became extremely good at it and got stronger, a lot of them kind of found mediocre and success in certain areas and not in other areas but with an improving economy, they held on, they held on, they held on, they held on. There is only so long you can hold on if your business plan is not affecting revenue. And I do think that what we see and we felt that in '15 not normal for what we're talking about for '16 was that those tenants that simply did not have business plans that resonated with consumers going forward we're not going to be able to hold on interest. We started to see that in the second half of '15, we decided then to specifically aggressively target them, it's -- we don't turn that on and off and this is a continuation of that into '16. But the better tenants, there are better tenants and those better tenants are doing very well. There is more of a bifurcation is what I'm saying between good and not so good today than there was three or four years ago. That's the distinction and that's why I guess I'm talking my own book here but it\u2019s what I believe, that's why the bifurcation between the desirable real estate and not desirable real estate is wider than it certainly was three or four years ago. Those things work in tandem and that's why we are probably bit more optimistic with respect to our leasing of this strategy in '16 and '17 and some others are. Jason White : So with your long lived leases, do you feel like there is a number of years of kind of pain to come from a retailer standpoint or are you working through the lion's share of that in the last couple of years? Don Wood : Jason I do believe that but I believe that for only the better portfolio. I don\u2019t believe that across the board, three years ago, four years ago across the board, didn't matter. Today it matters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeremy Metz : Maybe a question for Chris Weilminster here, but you mentioned the broad strength you've seen on the leasing front both from main present in line and you talked at length earlier about being still optimistic about the retail environment. So I'm just wondering if you could give us some more specifics or color on where demand is coming from on both the shop and the box side. Chris Weilminster : Sure. I will say that, the soft goods retailers, Nordstrom Rack has made announcement about their growth plans, so there is a lot of demand out from boxes in that category, Rack TJX you talk about what's going on HTC and growth expectations I think for Saks be it Saks OFF 5TH brand, I think they are rolling out or talking about some brands as it relates to Lord and Taylor. I think that clearly is a box component that is looking for opportunity. We see the grocery category looking to get more nimble and do more urban oriented stores, so smaller. I think there is a new concept out by Ahoid called BeFresh which is taking some of what they have learned over the European market about providing more deliverables on home meal replacement, more convenient environment. That clearly provides opportunity and in the QSR business as we've been talking about for long-term on smaller shop really continues to just amazed at how they are kind of cutting out the mid-tier casual dining category and providing as quite you know high quality products, more curated by the consumer in a faster environment. That's just a low hanging fruit but that energy certainly are and those types of retailers are the ones that we clearly see taking advantage of it as we release opportunities within our portfolio. Don Wood : You know Jeremy the other thing you got to keep your eye on which I think is a real positive for the open air space is there is -- there are certainly more women\u2019s apparel tenants that are considering open air versus or developing new concepts for open air versus just malls, I mean we did a couple of Lemon pop deals over the past few quarters, one in Melville Mall that I just love how it's performing, one in Ellisburg, that we did. And so those retailers open mindedness to where with respect to their business plans they can create value, I think is a real positive to the type of products that we have. Jeremy Metz : Good. Appreciate that color. And then Don, in terms of these Sports Authority, I know it is a little early here and hard to put a probability on but assuming you could get those back, do any of those have the potential to lead to some bigger redevelopments here given that they are in some of your better centers? Don Wood : Yes. It is funny; I mean Brick isn't doing right. We are working hard at Brick Plaza to redeploying that shopping center and one of the Sports Authority is the Brick Plaza is opened, it's a box, big box that opens up another set of opportunities. You know what we\u2019ve been doing with respect to remerchandising East Bay Bridge, we would love to get that back to be able to remerchandise it. And then more Assembly Square, Assembly Square and you know that power center is now adjacent to a pretty dam successful mixed-use project. So even though it pays a lot of rent, wouldn't mind that either. So there is when I look down through them, they can turn into some real causes from a value perspective but again short-term hits. Jeremy Metz : Okay. And then just one last quick one for Jim here. I was just wondering if you can talk about the free rent you are giving at the office space at Assembly and Pike & Rose and what those tenants take in occupancy here over the next few quarters. Should we really be thinking about stabilized yield for those, the office components of those projects, not hitting until kind of a mid-or late 2017? Jim Taylor : It's going to be coming in, in mid-'17 that's correct, Jeremy. When you factor in those periods and timing as we get those tenants moved in again all the spaces committed. Now it's just a question of getting the tenants in the space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. So if I think about what you guys have said during this call it seems like no real slow down and not slowing down on taking space back and releasing it. But how about for bigger items like A, I'm not sure if there's a Phase 3 for some of your larger projects? But given what's going on the road does it at all impact your decisions to embark on to larger more heavy capital projects? Don Wood : We are not at a point where we're at a go or no-go with respect to the third phase of Pike & Rose, the third phase of Assembly, I can't tell you there are a lot of things we're working on, some of which are on call. But when we are at that point the investment committee decision, the capital allocation decision will certainly -- decisions will certainly take into account where we are at that time in economy, what we believe in terms of future and what we're comfortable of doing and how much risk we would like to take to our offload, which we can do. So as of today, I'd have -- you should assume nothing different with respect to third phases or fourth phases of those products or anything else we're looking at. As the year plays out, as '17 plays out and we're getting through investment committee stage, you can bet that we'll have more to say about it. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just quick one on CocoWalk. You look at that project, we talked -- I think we talked about it before. It just seems like a bigger scope potentially with kind of empty small shops around that asset. Any progress update on what you're trying to do with that asset overall? Jim Taylor : I'm so going to jump in here before Weilminster starts telling you about all the great ideas he has got. Here is an awful lot of stuff that we are thinking about and working through. Ki Bin, I don't want to place you off gear, but I'm not going to say anything further about either CocoWalk or Sunset until we got something to say on it, because I don't want to take you up and then down and then up and then down, and that's the process that we go through with respect to a true redevelopment analysis. There are a number of ways we could go there. Some of them have a larger scope; some of them are more simplistic. The overall IRRs and the risk adjusted nature of each of those opportunities is what we're going to consider. I'm just not ready here in -- on figure of 10 to go further. Chris Weilminster : Ki Bin, I would just comment that if you're spending any time in that market you're seeing some very good things happen there. So we're pleased with momentum that we see in the market. But again, as Don said, not ready to talk about any particular plan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. George Auerbach : Thanks. For Don or Jim, on the 10 box opportunities with the 450,000 square feet plus. Just to clarify. Are all these likely redevelopments or do you expect that some or most of these would be just redevelopment with normal CapEx? And fairly [indiscernible] -- Don Wood : I love that. Well, I love that question George. Jim Taylor : You have to probably let him finish the question before you can answer. George Auerbach : It's the good part. Just -- I guess the projects that you expect to be at larger redevelopments, how significant of a capital investment could it be? Don Wood : Yes. So if you were working here and we were looking at these 10 assets and spending time within the cities, in the communities that they're in doing market studies of what's missing not only on a retail but potentially in mixed use basis in each of these places, you know that -- you would know that it takes little bit of time. And the idea of figuring out what should each of these be is where we start. We then put on the overall paths of okay, how likely is it to get it done, where is the balance in our business plans. If I work getting that and I am, I would suggest to you that half of these would be releasing, a couple of them would be minor redevelopments and a couple of them would be larger redevelopments. I can't give you a capital number, because I'm just guessing at what I'm saying. But that's the --what I\u2019m trying to do is to give you the process that we\u2019re going to go through to make sure that this I want to say once in a lifetime but once in a decade opportunity of having unencumbered sections of the real estate gets you very thoroughly and that we don\u2019t just lap it an inferior tenant in order to get out the material same-store growth back. George Auerbach : I guess it\u2019s fair to say that. I\u2019m sorry. Don Wood : No, I\u2019m sure that is not enough for you in terms of what you're trying to get but that's about what it will be, it will be some mixture between those three possibilities at all 10 centers. George Auerbach : That is helpful but I guess it is fair to say that we shouldn\u2019t expect any NOI contribution from these assets for the 10 boxes in 2016 maybe half of it comes in 2017 and the rest is beyond that. Don Wood : I think that is right and if in the case of redevelopment when you look at redevelopment as certain things that are really clear that pretty quickly that you can\u2019t create economic value because of other things in the property. In those cases I think in almost all of us here we got demand for space. So you may see a couple of quick releasing opportunities that may even provide some small level in 2016 but by and large you will see it in 2017 forward. George Auerbach : That's helpful and last one from me. Jim, any comments on where I guess can you remind us how much common equity is implied into the guidance range? And I guess just given some of the uncertainty in the world and your funding needs in the current pipeline, any thoughts on overnight vis-\u00e0-vis the ATM issuance? Don Wood : Part of the reason we have the balance sheet we do is always maximum flexibility towards never be in a position to have to raise a particular type of capital at a particular point in time. That's something that we really work hard to protect and preserve. As we look at overall equity needs for the year, probably in the neighborhood of 200 million to 250 million but again we have the flexibility to do it through our ATM, potentially an overnight that -- it\u2019s all about making sure that we have the flexibility and as we\u2019ve been working really hard that you can see to make sure that as we are working through all this value creation that we have actually been prefunding a great deal of it, and you can see that when you look at our debt-to-EBITDA metric which has remained low despite the fact that we have lot of developments to start producing EBITDA yet. So that gives us lot more flexibility if that stuff comes on and importantly puts us in a position where we can fund the growth that we have underway multiple ways. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vincent Chao : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just a few follow-up questions here. Jim, in the equity of $200 million, $250 million I think last quarter you are talking about more like $150 million is this increaser there just due to the JV acquisition or is it something else that has changed in your thinking regarding some other sources of funding? Jim Taylor : That's pretty much it, and it's a good question, Vin, because we could potentially take some of that equity through an asset sales which we don\u2019t have plan, but as we demonstrated last year, we\u2019re always looking for that as well, but the increase is largely a reflection of taking down $150 million investment in our joint venture. Vincent Chao : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And just going back to the Splunk conversation from earlier can you just remind it do you have to know how much of that space was sort of geared for future growth as opposed to just selling so much spaces they need today? Jim Taylor : Jeff? Jeff Berkes : Yes. We are 100% sure, Vin. I mean, we enjoy they're talking about of leasing couple of floors but the plans can be evolving on that, so I\u2019m not 100% sure. We do know they're pushing to get in to the space and we do know that they are hiring a ton of employees right now. So we think all that's still been in flux. Vincent Chao : Okay. Got it, and then just moving to we talked about Sports Authority quite a bit but just in terms of normal rollover, can you remind us what, if any, Nobles and Staples are rolling over in 2016 and 2017? Chris Weilminster : We don\u2019t have that rollover, Vin; we will have to follow up with you on that. Don Wood : We're ready for you on that one, Vin. Vincent Chao : This is a little disappointing guys. But that's all right. Don Wood : Yes. Chris Weilminster : Wait, I can -- let me just opine there. I can't give you the specific number. But there are one or two -- there is one more de novo that we're very actively in discussion with them, which is coming up in the next 18 months and we're already working with them and talking about downsides of space and looking at other options for the space that will be coming back. They have no options available. So it\u2019s a clear slate for us to attack. In Staples, we are very aggressively looking at our portfolio at Staples; it's a staggered rollover schedule at Staples. But we're certainly very focused on the office supply category and how you're working on backlog opportunity, should we get in these spaces back. Vincent Chao : Okay. Appreciate that. And then just on the tenant discussions I mean it sound like the discussions are little longer, little bit tougher negotiations. But the market seems to be -- it seems it's priced in a higher probably recession relatively they're sort of within the start of year here. And I'm just curious when your conversations really started to get more difficult? Chris Weilminster : Well, I would just say that it's difficult following the great recession that we referred to the retailers. I mean this is not -- Don Wood : I was listening to Chris before and then -- and I couldn't be helpful but struck by the fact that I've been here in the same thing for Chris for the past two years. And it's that I even wrote down on piece of paper here to talk to him later. But you're not -- I mean we are not seeing a significant difference from a year ago with respect to that. And again, I kind of think this comes down too, where are you trying to get to, because expansion plans remain for -- he went through the litany of retailers, it's just where? And if that's a smaller list or that's come back a bit, what are the chances that we're going to get our fair share or better than our fair share of those opportunities and we think that's pretty good. But, yes. There is still tough conversation. Vincent Chao : Oh, then that's helpful. I mean the fact that you're out leasing a shift from what's been for a while that's I think a key distinction. So thanks for that. That's all I have. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Floris Van Dijkum : Hi, guys. Thanks for all. I know everyone is probably winding down, so quick question. When you guys look at expanding into a new market or increasing your investment in new market how much of that is opportunistic versus strategic? You just expanded significantly in Miami. How much of that was opportunity based, or how much of that was strategic based? Don Wood : Floris, that's a strategic decision, clearly a strategic decision. The one thing that we got comfortable with over the years a little bit is what it is -- where were the places in this country that were logical extensions for us that we felt very, very good about the positive changes on a macro level over the next decade or two. The more we looked at not Florida or Miami in particular within Florida, the more we felt that all the investments that's happening downtown, all the investments that's happening in that marketplace was not -- was what it is, but it wasn't the same as what was happening where the full-time population lives. The more we looked into those areas which included Coral Gables and included Coconut Grove the more we got really excited about the possibilities of those being underserved places that were on a real up swing. Frankly, six months later or 12 months later from when we did it and two years later from when we started thinking about it, we're actually more optimistic in terms of what's happening. If you look, don't look hard at the press and some of the deals that have been done in or around Coconut Grove over the past year 12 or such a 15 months, and I think you'll say, oh, man, maybe these guys are on to something. So that was very much a strategic decision. Floris Van Dijkum : And if you guys look at other markets, are there any other markets that you are in, I'm thinking may be of Chicago? Is there a strategic reason not to be in that or will you at some point potentially look through to grow that market as well? Don Wood : That is on Jim Taylor's to-do-list, go-list, important list for 2016. So do me a favor and keep asking that question every three months. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris Lucas : Don, just may be to summarize the conversation about where the tenant conversations are, is it more about their feeling the pain of rents higher than it is about their caution about store openings? Is that kind of where we are with this? Don Wood : I think it\u2019s a combination. I think it\u2019s a combination, Chris. When you\u2019re sitting in your -- I always try to take it to the board rooms of any company and in those board rooms or conversations about earnings growth and longer-term plans and it's like anything else. You don't just turn things on and off unless you have crazy times like 2008 and again there is no sign that we see anything like that. So instead you start tweaking all your pieces, number of store openings, your cost structure, your product lines and store size all of that stuff. So on a combined basis there is not one thing that to level when we say retailers applying there is one thing out there, there are very many different business plans and all we try to do as a company and as a business is to be attractive towards many of them as possible and not be tied to any one retailer, any one category within those retailers or any one geography. So when you look at from that perspective and you truly get back to demand versus supply on your particular real estate that\u2019s why we are probably more optimistic than hearing a lot elsewhere. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then my last question. If we circle back to sort of the very beginning of the Q&A and talk about the acquisition of the Clarion interest, when I think historically about how you guys have talked about the portfolio I think Don, you have always talked about how proud you are of the fact that it is a few assets, very highly valuable, large assets. When I look at the six assets that are in this portfolio for the most part, they tend to be at the smaller end and several of them don't really fit what I would consider Federal markets or micro markets. So when I think about the answer to the question you talked about having more bandwidth. So the question that I would ask you is -- is that because of the reorganization, should we expect smaller core assets to necessarily be a bigger piece of this portfolio going forward because you have more bandwidth or how should we be thinking about this transaction? Don Wood : Very clear question Chris, the answer is no, we should not be thinking that. And that this is a discrete investment decision and when you sit and specifically think about this discrete investment decision know that we have a 11 years of actual experience in knowing how these particular assets act and not act. And all six of them aren't great. No question about it from the standpoint of are they does one size fit all for you, not at all. But as a portfolio with an opportunity to either sell the 30% that is that we did own or buy the 70% that we did not own in this discrete transaction we think we can make some money in that and add some value here. Don't take that and expand that to the company's overall business plan, the way you just described because that wouldn't be the case. Operator : Thank you. And that does concludes today's Q&A portion of the call. I would like to turn the call back over to Leah Andress for any closing remarks. Leah Andress : Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you all at the Wells and Citi conferences in the coming weeks. Thanks guys. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

These documents are available on our Web site at federalrealty.com. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter 2016 results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today and I look forward to speaking to all or most of you in a few weeks at the conference in New York where we can talk more about our Company and the many changes affecting our industry. As most of you are aware by now, this will the last earnings call with my good friend and colleague Jim Taylor who will be on as the CFO of Federal. The team is certainly going to miss him but I for one am genuinely proud of him and the opportunities going to get at Brixmor, their board made a great choice. I am also personally grateful for his many contributions to the Company, his wise council and most importantly his. Enough about Jim for the moment. Onward to the quarterly results and to our prospects for the future, really good quarter all the way around for us FFO per share of $1.38 highest quarterly result of all time and 9% better than last year\u2019s quarter. Same center growth of 4.2%, again validating how important our redevelopment program is to us. So we don\u2019t expect to maintain this level for the year, given the significant investment for the future initiatives that we have underway and lease termination fees that helped us this quarter by $600,000 or so, more on all that later. 85 possible deals done for nearly 400,000 feet of space and 3,353 per foot, 13% higher on a cash basis than the deals previously, that\u2019s up 23% on acres, 10% of small shops. It's up 21% on new leases, 9% on renewals. It's up on all those metrics in the core shopping center business in the Mixed-Use Division and on the West Coast. Strong consistent leasing progress throughout our operations is our trademark and we don\u2019t expect that to fall. Overall portfolio occupancy at 94.1% leased but only 92.7% occupied. Those numbers are down by 130 and 180 basis points respectively from a year ago. Much of that through the inclusion of lower occupancy acquisitions in South Florida and from the Clarion acquisition, together that\u2019s 1.5 million square feet added with a combined occupancy in the mid-80s. And of course it's also the planned AMC and other vacancies that we talked about last quarter. Yet we still had a record quarter, growing earnings with decreasing occupancy whether planned or unplanned speaks volumes about our business and our Company. Speaking of that occupancy, we made strong progress as it relates to proactively taking advantage of weak and field tenants to improve the anchor merchandising at certain of our important shopping centers. That initiative took a big step forward this quarter with the signing of TJ Maxx to take over the failed Hudson Trail Outfitters space depending on road with the signing of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods at Melville Mall which along with last quarter\u2019s Field and Stream deal and some real good stuff to come and not very talking about it yet, go a long way to returning Melville Mall on Long Island into something pretty special, and L. A. Fitness taking out a host of obsolete small shop space at Del Mar Village in Boca Raton. Three great deals all at far higher rents than they were placed actually near 30% higher in total with far better retailers for our future and just the initial part of the redevelopment of these three extremely well located shopping centers. Remember though those are just signed leases and rent contributions won\u2019t start from them for some time as each particular center to be developed. All the evidence so far suggest that this proactive approach toward creating vacancy is going to work out overall as we\u2019d hoped in creating far more relevant shopping centers even though it will put pressure on same store growth for the balance of \u201916 and \u201917. I also want to report on strong progress on the lease up and rent start for the phase I completions of our three big and active development projects. Let\u2019s talk about them individually. At Assembly Row, the first phase is basically finished now with the last group of office tenants and into our small office building and the retailers and restaurants solidifying our only success. We\u2019ve really moved on the pace to execution the first sign of which begins next month as the first partners healthcare employees begin populating and nearly complete 700,000 square foot building. Assembly has been so thoroughly accepted by the community as we place to live, work and shop and we expect long-term value creation here to exceed our expectations. At Pike & Rose we\u2019ve leased up a ton of apartments since the end of the year and now stand at a phase I residential percentage lease at 73% heading into a strong summer leasing season. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased that the rate of lease up that we\u2019re achieving. Pike & Rose is creating a lot of buzz and getting a lot of recognition in the community, and I am optimistic that we\u2019ll have the building basically full by year-end or soon thereafter as we forecast. And non-adapt domestic that will hit our rent dollar forecast given the rental rates we\u2019ve been assuming for the higher floors in the palace building. So far we\u2019ve been close to our forecasted rents at $2.40 which were at premium to the market but because of construction we basically been leasing from the bottom up. But we\u2019re skeptical at this point that we\u2019ll be able to put trends on the higher floors to the extent we had hoped given the significant supply in the market and the fact that we remain a major construction site. We\u2019ll see over the next six to eight months to put our initial yield maybe under pressure by 50 basis points or so more on that with another quarter of leasing under our belt. One thing that we\u2019re particularly confident about is the very real premium to market that we\u2019ve been getting even during this initial phase lease updates. Palace average monthly rent to-date of $2,500 a month or $2.40 a foot reflect the 20% premium over the North Bethesda Rockville submarket. And for penthouses that we\u2019ve delivered at over $6,000 a month are setting new high watermarks for this market. And as I said earlier, the pace of leasing is outpacing that competitive product. While excess supply in the market has caused us to miss our initial rent projections and that is no doubt disappointing. So also closing us to project more conservatively on phase II as you\u2019ll know in our 8-K. The premium to that market clearly attainable because of the environment we\u2019re creating at Pike & Rose and the level of service we\u2019re providing is both validating and encouraging. We\u2019re building the right products for the future. Pike & Rose is going to be around for a long time and gets more and more integral for the community shopping, living and working habits every day. We\u2019ll have many opportunities to increase some residential income stream in the years ahead on these mostly flow month leases. And as a point in Escondido, California we\u2019re down in the last few leases and last half dozen rent starts in a shopping center that was so clearly hit the bull\u2019s eye of what was missing in the markets. This property will do nothing but get better and better over the years and at 500 Santana Row affectionately around here known as the Splunk building, we have topped off the $112 million project and remain on time and on budget. So then look back at the quarter and the execution of the business plan that we\u2019re also passionate about around here, I couldn\u2019t be more encouraged that we\u2019re on the right track to double our income in the next decade but also realistic about the investment in people and real-estate necessary to do it right and protect our downside in an inevitably cyclical business. The latest curve ball lies in the uncertain future of Sports Authority. As you know, we have five locations and none of them are on the closure list in the first round. We reserved most of our prepetition bankruptcy receivables up $400,000 in the first quarter and have been fully paid for April\u2019s rent. Now the latest conjecture of liquidation is a different story of course. And depending on how it played out and the specifics of each locations, a short term hit is likely and might affect our existing guidance if leases were immediately rejected as opposed to being assumed by another retailer. Having said that we\u2019re quite confident that we would more than replace the cumulative rent which totals $3.4 million annually triple-net basis, up $17.65 foot and $4.8 million gross. The average market rent for the triple net box lease in these locations exceeds 25 hours and we\u2019re already in conversations with replacement center just in case. The other big evolving change is of course changing shopping, living, working and entertainment habits of today\u2019s consumer. As you\u2019re all well aware, we have been, are, and will continue to be invest heavily in the best people, real-estate and types of products that we believe puts us in the best position to capitalize on those changes. Downsize is that in doing so we\u2019re making investments that have and will continue to dilute current earnings, and a couple of things on that front. First, the centralization efforts that our company is in the middle of progressing quite well Jeff Mooalem settling into his role and in the process of building four quasi-independent geographic teams to grow our core shopping center business, investments in incremental talent and IT systems infrastructure is now underway and we would expect an incremental $1.5 million to $2 million annual investment to support this effort. Secondly, plans for our new Miami acquisition Sunset Place and CocoWalk are progressing well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. Decisions as to the direction and initial phases should go to investment committee later this year at which point we\u2019ll lay out what we have in mind. In the meantime, we\u2019re heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasing optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to put forth viable and value creative changes at both locations. At Sunset we\u2019ll need zoning changes that permit more height to come up with a viable plan, fingers crossed. And finally, the search for a senior business partner that carries CFO title for Federal and is in full swing. I am grateful for the very robust interest in joining our team that has followed Jim\u2019s announcement, and I\u2019ve met with a number of terrific prospects who will be awesome partners to me and our senior team. I just don\u2019t want to rush that important decision, and I am given the process the attention and serious consideration it deserves. I\u2019d hope to be prepared to make an announcement in this regard in the next 30 to 45 days. In the mean time, Melissa Solis is our principle accounting officer and as those of you who know Melissa now we remain in very good hands from an accounting and overall financial point of view. Separately I know that many on this call are friends and colleagues of James Milan, portfolio analyst at APG. We haven\u2019t put out a separate press release but James will be joining us next month in the role of Vice President and Director of Finance for the Mixed-Use division and will be relocating to our headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, we\u2019re thrilled to have him. Now let me turn it over to Jim before answering your questions. Jim Taylor : Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. As Don highlighted our team delivered again another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, which is $1.38, representing 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to invest in the future through commencing future development phases, adding to our team, taking down box vacancy, et cetera, we are particularly pleased with bottom line results driven by our operations leasing, acquisition and development team. Turning to the numbers. Overall property operating income grew 7.9% over the prior year, even with the decline of 130 basis points of occupancy, reflecting the higher anchor rollovers we\u2019ve discussed. Our core portfolio continued to be a significant driver of our POI growth. That core grew at 4.2% on a same store basis including redevelopment. This quarter the downtime associated with anchor rollover produced about 130 basis points drag. We highlighted this trend in the last two quarters, and as I will discuss further on guidance, we expect this rollover drag to continue this year. Our first phases at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose contributed approximately $4.5 million of POI in the quarter, up on a sequential basis as the Palace high rise opening approach breakeven occupancy and office spaces continue to rent in that. Finally our acquisition of Coco and Sunset Place, which are performing very well against our acquisition underwriting also contributed significantly overall to POI growth. G&A remained flat on a sequential basis, did $8 million for the quarter and down year-over-year principally to higher transaction cost in 2015 with respect to our San Antonio center acquisition. We do expect our G&A line item to grow as we continue to invest in our platform. Interest expense declined 400,000 reflecting the lower average rate achieved through our refinancing during the year, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development into service. Again bottom line FFO grew at 9.5% for the quarter, which is above our long-term plan. That absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, it\u2019s something we take great pride in. From a balance sheet perspective, we raised approximately $182 million of equity through an overnight as well as issuances under our ATM during the quarter, at a collective weighted average price of $149.18. This represents over half the equity we plan to raise this year. We ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, which we outsized after the quarter to $800 million and extended to 2020 while reducing our borrowing cost by 10 basis points. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.3 times and our weighted average tenor was almost 10 years versus the peer average closer to 5, providing us maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all the value creation that we have underway. Turning to 2016, we affirm the previously given range of FFO per share of 565 to 571, a range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year. Again, the targeted box recapture and rollover vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. That drag was offset this quarter by some positive timing items, which included marketing and expense recovery, as well as higher year-over-year term fees of $600,000 as Don mentioned. Given that, we do expect same store NOI will moderate in second and third quarters of this year. As Don discussed in his remarks, we are pleased to announce the signing of TJ Maxx at Pentagon, the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods leases, Melville and the L.A. Fitness lease at Del Mar, all of which as he stated will unlock significant value at these centers. Overall, our leasing team is making great progress under a captured box basis, which we will continue to report on over the coming quarters. In addition to this rollover, as discussed in prior quarters, there\u2019re several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective as you look in the year. First, our leasing pace at Palace continues to go well with current occupancy for that building alone at just over 60%, and expected stabilization occurring in the fourth quarter. The office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly which represents approximately $80 million of investments is fully committed and leased and we\u2019ll start seeing the rent commencing throughout this year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana Row, the Splunk building, which represents approximately $115 million of investments is of course 100% preleased and we\u2019re delivering the fourth quarter and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo continues to perform exceptionally well, and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. Our acquisition of our joint venture partner 70% interest in six core assets is expected to be neutral this year after transaction cost in the sale of Courtyard shop. We expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017. We are well underway for the second phases at Pike & Rose and Assembly that represents another $600 million of investments and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of \u201917 and early \u201918. From a capital standpoint again we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment with the mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity under our ATM, much of which we\u2019ve taken care of in the first quarter. Finally, consistent with our practice our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that can execute during the year. When you consider all that the Company has going on, you will understand why I continue to emphasize that our guidance this year is a true range. In fact factors that may drive us towards the low end of that range includes the timing of the anchor box backfill to rent commencement. The potential for additional rent concessions at Palace as we lease penthouses in the upper floor. The opportunistic capital raise that we completed in the first quarter front ended a significant part of our capital needs for the year. The ultimate resolution of the Sports Authority as Don discussed, while none of our locations have been on the initial closure list, we believe it is unlikely that the Sports Authority will continue as is and that we may have the opportunity to get some of those locations back. We continue to invest in our platform as Don mentioned both in systems and people as we drive decision making closer to the real estate. These efforts may drive an additional $1 million to $2 million of annual G&A above our current assumed run rate of $34 million to $35 million on an annual basis, even with that growth, so far below 5% of revenue. And finally, the cost associated with backfilling my position has not been determined or forecast; again, each one of these items that influence where we will come out in the range is positive for the Company in its long-term growth prospect, but they may impact where we land. Before turning the call over to questions, I\u2019d like to briefly thank Don for his friendship, council and support has made a great deal to me over the last 18 years and now as I turn to the opportunity at Brixmor. Thank you, Don. I would also like to thank my partners at Federal who are the best in the business. Chris Weilminster, Dawn Becker, Jeff Berkes. Don Briggs, Jeff Mooalem, Wendy Seher, Debbie Colson, John T., Deirdre, Barry and last but certainly most Melissa. Thanks to each of you for inspiring me with your excellence and your commitment to the Trust and its shareholders. With that operator I would like to turn the call over to questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, guys. Don, I am sorry, I should have told you when you hired Jim, he is a bit of a floozy and it wouldn't last. Don Wood : You've seen it before Jeff. Jeff Donnelly : I have. I have. Congratulations, Jim, and hopefully you didn't just read off the list of the names of people you're going to target when you are at Brixmor. A question about Pike & Rose. I am just curious what is driving the reduction in the stabilized yield. I got on a minute late so I'm not sure if you guys talked about that in your remarks. Don Wood : Yes, Jeff we did. It is really all about residential, as you know that first phase and the second phase has a significant residential component to it. The bottom-line is we were too aggressive in thinking what we were, going to be able to get for residential rent and the market place has an awful lot of supply on it and the place is absolutely a construction zone and will be for some time and so it's, what I always worry about with you know when changing numbers like this is that there's a tank on the project itself. Because there can't be, the project is going as well or better than we expected in terms of its acceptance even in terms of its performance when performance on the residential side compared to the marketplace, is just that the marketplace is significantly lower than we had hoped and thought it would be when we underwrote this. So it's all that. Now obviously the good side of that is we're not locking into 15 year deals or 20 year deals these are 12 month leases. But it would be, it just wouldn't be right for me to have the same expectations of being able to lease up the rest of the buildings we have on phase one and the residential building in phase two at rents that when I look at it right now and our team looks at it right now we don't think we can hit. And that's what causing that. I really don't want to see that as a failure of the project it's market timing. Jeff Donnelly : And maybe to switch gears, I want to maybe circle back on the decentralization plan. I think we've been talking on the call maybe a year, year and a half ago about why it is difficult for the industry or seemingly difficult for the industry to produce call it future leaders and then you announced that plan. I guess I am just curious what was the impetus for it? What do you think it accomplishes for Federal? And I guess not to bring it back to dollars and cents all the time but how do you think we should be thinking about the ultimate effect on G&A as we sort of reorganize people? Don Wood : It's a good, probably my favorite question Jeff, look the bottom line is this company grew and has grown pretty darned consistently over the last 15 years in terms of its value, in terms of what it does for a living, in terms of its breadth and growth. We had to effectively get management closer to the real estate because the real estate is so different. Managing a Pike & Rose and managing an assembly row and managing -- having an opportunity like Sunset and Coco is just darned different than the core shopping center business. So we needed to do -- we needed to align management more closely with the real estate business, that's our business, we are really not a portfolio manager we look at it asset by asset. Now when you do that, there's obviously going to be incremental overhead to be able to set it up that way and that overhead is incremental not only on the to use the hotel vernacular front of the house stuff but also back of the house systems and reporting, accounting all of that. We're in the middle of that transition and that transition takes some time. If you think about an incremental few million dollars a year basically we got to more than make up for that in incremental value. Now where that would that incremental value come from, comes in every part of our business, first and foremost by getting to things more quickly. By getting tenants to through the process of leasing to tenant co-ordinations, opening their door to rent start, that's done a whole lot better if the leasing agent and the asset manager and the developer, tenant coordinator are all working together, there's a lot of that. Secondly down at that level we'll know our markets better, we do know our markets better and closer so that, I'll give a couple of examples. We're talking about Brick Township right now, Brick Plaza. Brick is a great shopping center in Brick, New Jersey that we've owned for a long time. Part of the reason that we haven't been able to get to doing a better job at Brick Plaza is because of the ANP lease and we talked to that about that. But another part of the reason is because it's geographically further away. This helps us focus more on it, it helps us create business and that -- I could say that about 20 or 25 of our shopping centers. So this is truly an evolution of our business, it's a investment in the next decade where the combination of great products in terms of next year's development that we're doing with a more active and proactively managed core together should make the few million dollars of incremental G&A nothing compared to the incremental value that we create. So that's what it is that we're trying to do. Unidentified Company Representative : To put the numbers in a little bit of context, still well below 5% of revenue which has grown substantially. Jeff Donnelly : Okay, thanks, Jim. Maybe one last question. Don, do you have any specific goals going into ICSC? I think typically you guys go in there with one or two things you really want to walk away with. Don Wood : The goals are not -- you know it's so funny we don't and everybody on this call get this. You don\u2019t go into ICSC thinking you are getting leases done. The goals you go into ICSC before is to make sure that you bring as many people to the critical parts of the Company that you can. So for us it is our redevelopment pipeline and in the core it's our Florida stuff that we\u2019re going to be wanting everybody to see and understand. It's the future basis of Pike & Rose and Assembly, as well as our West Coast asset. It's a focus on those things, it's not, we\u2019re going to get this lease done and that lease done, because it\u2019s just doesn\u2019t happen that way. What normally happens is somewhere in the next 30, 60, 90, or 120 days after ICSC there is a lot more deals that get done because they were germinated and taken to the next level of ICSC, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : First, congrats, Jim. We won't miss you because we still get to work with you. So sorry, Don. Maybe just an update on your plans for the center in Noroton Heights given that you recently proposed plans and renderings to the community? Don Wood : Here is where we are. So as you remember you may remember at Darien we\u2019re talking about, Stop & Shop controls the corner event shopping center and so 2020 something 3-something like that. We have to come far more encouraged though that there will be a way to work with Stop & Shop. So that long before that period of time, we\u2019ll be able to create specialty shopping center and I am hopeful with residential as part of that plan over on top and around to be able to really create a great community shopping center there. As you know, lots of work to do with the community itself with the entitlement process and certainly then with tenants like Stop & Shop, and others in the center, so I am not ready to quit out, it's not on the redevelopment schedule yet, it will be on the redevelopment schedule to the extent we can make headway with the community, and so far so good. Christy McElroy : Just a follow-up on your comments on occupancy, just looking at the residential occupancy 95.5, and the same-store pool down 180 basis points year-over-year. Just in terms of trying to keep track of what is in the same-store pool out of the same-store pool, what were the main drivers of that decline for the properties that were in the pool? Jim Taylor : You will note that I am looking directly at Melissa Solis right now. So if you can grad again Melissa, we can do that, if you can\u2019t we\u2019ll follow up\u2026 Chris Weilminster : We\u2019d probably need to follow up with you in more detail. But the bigger drivers in the same store pool are going to be the multifamily as Santana, the Crest Apartments at Congressional as well as Rolling Wood. And I would tell you based on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the rents we\u2019re real pleased with the trends in Northern California. And as Don alluded to in suburban Maryland, Washington DC are we\u2019ve seen a little bit of softness. The other asset in there of course would be Bethesda Row. Melissa Solis : And Christy, Palace and Versailles at Pike & Rose are the two assets that are in the same center pool. Christy McElroy : They are not in the same pool, right? Don Wood : They have not been\u2026 Christy McElroy : And then just lastly on the $600,000 of lease term fees, what was the same-store impact, so was that fully in the same-store and what retailers was that related to? Don Wood : I can\u2019t tell you the retailers off top of my head, but that\u2019s about 60 bps of impact. Jim Taylor : They were two smaller retailers Christy and one in Rockville Town Square and one at Pentagon. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason White with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open. Jason White : Just two quick ones for me, I would just ask them both at once because they will probably be quick ones. A&P, I think you talked about on the last call. I just wondered generically if you could kind of walk through the progress you are making and maybe just what you are seeing from market rents versus where the rents were in place. And then just jumping over to Santana, Westfield the mall is going to have a big redevelopment and wondering how you see that impacting Santana and if that changes the way you merchandise? Don Wood : Yes, Jeff jump in at just anything on A&P. But as you remember Jason we have four A&Ps, one of those was assumed and is underway in terms of being built out on Long Island at Greenlawn, which leaves three more. Melville Mall also on the Island and I did not mentioned when I talked about the good stuff that\u2019s happening at Melville Mall to-date with the signing of Dick\u2019s for example. So last space that we at Melville Mall is the former Walbaums's box and we are making real good progress, but we\u2019re not in a place where I can tell you it's a signed deal yet, and you will like everything about that. The next one is at Brick where again it's part of a much bigger redevelopment and remerchandising of the entire center. And we\u2019re not as close to as Melville but making real good progress. We'll have something to say very next couple of quarters there I think. And the final one is Troy which is in New Jersey and we're hopeful, I shouldn't say it exactly this way. I don't know whether we're going to backfill it or whether it's going to be a bigger redevelopment possibility there, which would include some residential in a more densely populated shopping center, obviously if it comes to something like that which would add the most value which I would love there's a lot of work to do with respect to the community and figuring out if something like that is vital. That's what we're working on there, so that would be the last one of the three that you'll hear anything about I would think. Oh then Cynthiana, let's got to Cynthiana. Oh yes, Valley Fair does what they're doing and Jeff's on the phone, there'll absolutely be an impact. They're talking about adding hundreds of thousands of square feet you know and -- in a great node at a great place.  That will perform a very different function than what we do, and I wouldn\u2019t think -- confident that it wouldn\u2019t have a long term impact on the property but if they're leasing up that much space for that period of time that has to I would think impact us and I just don't know by how much yet, nothing any significant way whether they actually you know they haven't started construction yet, whether they will, when they will, what the timing is that's still I just don\u2019t have the answer to that. But there'd be an impact, I just can't quantify it for you today. Again, a short term impact. Unidentified Company Representative : The only thing I'd add to that Don, Jason we've known this is coming for some time, they got the entitlement before the recession, so you know over the last four or five years we've been doing the blocking and tackling that we need to do with Santana to put the property in the best position as possible including a lot of remerchandising of the stores on the street which I'm sure you're familiar with and continuing to build out the property not the least which is adding more parking and building 500 Santana Row, when Splunk is not in occupancy during the week we'll be available to retail and the restaurant customers nights and weekends. So you know again it's something we've been thinking about for many years now and doing what we can do to put ourselves in the best position and when it happens it happens and we'll deal with it as best we can. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies, your line is open. George Hoglund : Hi, this is George Hoglund on for Tayo. Just one question in terms of REITs getting their own GIC sector later this year. Have you been getting more inquiries from generalist investors and have you been doing anything sort of planning to market the company differently for preparing for those inquiries? Unidentified Company Representative : Sure, let me start with that and Jimmy if you got something you want to add to that, please do. I can tell you that obviously nobody knows really what the impact's going to be in terms of supply and demand and that'll be what it's going to be. It has not changed our approach which has always been very broad based in terms of who it has that we want to invest I mean we have taken pretty regular trips to Europe for example to talk to generalists there we have done that in New York in a broader way. We've always tried to do that and we had some pretty good luck frankly in getting generalist investors interested in our story, whether it helps it or not you know we'll know at some point after September after it get put in place. But that's pretty much what we're doing we you know obviously it's a change in your world more than it is in terms of what we do and just with respect to what we do all I'm really saying is we've been broad for a long time in terms of who we aim for. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks. All my other questions were answered. Operator : Thank you, and our next question comes from Anthony Hau with SunTrust, your line is now open. Anthony Hau : Good morning, guys. First off, Jim, Ki Bin and I just want to congratulate you on your new opportunity. And anyways, just a quick question regarding same-store NOI. Given that this year's winter was less severe than last year, I think last year snow removal costs was around $10 million. What was the impact from that in same-store NOI and can you quantify that? Unidentified Company Representative : It was -- first let me just the main point and look over to Melissa, it was definitely a benefit, not nearly as much as you think because so much of it is recoverable at least the portfolio -- it was a couple hundred grand of benefit. Unidentified Company Representative : It's a 150 in your number actually. Unidentified Company Representative : 300. Unidentified Company Representative : 300. Anthony Hau : Okay. And when you look at your lease expiration schedule, what percentage of your expiring leases is considered as vintage leases? And over the next few years how much of an impact do you think this is going to have on the blended rent spread? Unidentified Company Representative : You know, it's an interesting question because when you looked at our lease maturity schedule, the truth is that we always get to more space than what would be otherwise indicated by that and if you look at our trend and it's important to look at this trend over the last several quarters of where we're signing our new deals and you've seen that average continue to climb that gives you a sense of what the mark to market is if you will over what we have in place, it\u2019s not perfect but if you go back far enough you're going to capture enough of a subset of the portfolio to look at that, and again we've earned this assets for a long period of time, so we have vintage leases rolling every year. There isn\u2019t as far as I can tell not a particular year in which we\u2019ve got a lot of finished closing coming to market if you will. So, best thing to do to get a sense of that though again is to look at our marginal rents that we\u2019re signing each quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Jim, I guess a quick question. Are you guiding to the lower end of the range, or are you just laying out the laundry list of everything that can point you to the lower end of the range? It sounded like you are guiding toward the bottom end. Jim Taylor : I think everyone would be wise to consider this is a range and to think about the lower end of the range. It\u2019s hard to disappoint, to handicap everything, but all the items that I referred to again represent investments in the future, but certainly would be a drag on where we end up for the year. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Chris Lucas : Good morning, everyone. Don, just a couple of quick questions, on the TSA outcome if you were to get the stores back, are there certain centers that would be helped as it relates to maybe future redevelopment timing? Don Wood : Let\u2019s go through on, so here are the five centers and which were in the marketplace. So, you know what\u2019s happening to that marketplace versus because of what we\u2019re doing in the Mixed-Use project adjacent to it. It\u2019s been a very positive thing. And certainly the interest in that power center that\u2019s adjacent is significantly higher than it was before we built the project. So, we\u2019ve got that back that be okay, good thing there. Brick Plaza is the next one. Again in the middle of a complete rebuild, timing of that would be great in terms of the future of Brick Plaza. Crow Canyon, which is out on the West Coast and that\u2019s the smaller store out there and then latest one that we did, we did it some years back. But nonetheless that was the -- the last one it's smaller in a center that we had just redone, which is a good thing in terms of the demand characteristics that you would have. Montrose Crossing is the fourth that\u2019s the one directly across from Pike & Rose, that\u2019s over 35 acres where the section of the shopping center where they are would be dramatically impacted to the extent we can better merchandise that. And the last one is East Bay Bridge, out in Emeryville which the rents in place there are extremely low. And the upside would be terrific and that\u2019s another place that we just put in to new we\u2019re really re-merchandised the shopping center. So as I sit back and look at TSA this is a good tenant to work through this portfolio and into better things in all the locations that we have. But it's a lot of rent in the meantime. And so again can you look through the short term pay for the long-term gain. Chris Lucas : And final question, the Silver Line in Tysons has been a disruptor providing a boon and an opportunity for some property owners, but changing certain patterns to the detriment of others. My understanding is that sales at Pike 7 have been weaker. Are there things you can do there that change the view there or is there some view to the timing of future redevelopment that you would look towards? Don Wood : First of all on the premise I am not with you, in terms of the impact of sales at Pike 7, Pike 7 is an amazing shopping center. Frankly if sales were hit significantly going Pike 7 first of all they would happen during the construction of the Silver Line when basically the entrances were closed and they did in any significant way. But if they were, then we\u2019d had a lower hurdle to be able to do a larger Mixed-Use project at this site which would be great. Having said that your point, your bigger point, so stopping right there, Pike 7 is a great asset for us. What we do there long-term will only be positive. And part of the issue is if so successful for what it is right now, and therefore the hurdle. So I\u2019d say to do something better financially centered there. So that\u2019s Pike 7. And that\u2019s at the bigger premise and just likely it gets really important in terms of the judgment that we showed there. I think you\u2019re right the way the Silver Line is working through Tysons there are winners and there are losers. The type of projects that are being built there, there are winner there are losers. We did not jump and say oh god we got to be the first one to market. We sat back, we renewed leases, we kick out so that we were able to get to face if we needed to, but we\u2019ve created, we are disciplined at that particular asset has so north to our benefit that\u2019s only because we really -- we ran it like a true real estate company would and real estate play and not like a drunken sailor with respect to development for Pete\u2019s sake in terms of what it should be. So I want a little, I guess I really want as I can look the credit for the discipline that we showed in not jumping to what the new Tysons is going to be because as you just point out, it takes a long time with a major infrastructure chains like the Silver Line is to figure out what Tysons should be. Don Wood : Thanks so much. Thanks for giving me a chance on the soapbox by the way. Chris Lucas : You're welcome, thanks a lot, appreciate the comments. Don Wood : You bet. Operator : And I'm showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Leah Andress for closing remarks. Leah Andress : Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you REIT Week in New York in a couple of weeks, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference, this does conclude today's program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Leah Andress. Ma'am, you may begin. Leah Andress : Thank you. Good morning. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are John Wood, Dawn Becker, Jeff Berkes, Chris Weilminster and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our Web site at federalrealty.com. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter 2016 results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everybody. I want to be the first to publicly welcome new CFO, Dan Guglielmone -- it is best to just call him Dan G -- to the Federal Realty senior team. As most of you know, Dan joined us from Vornado, where he served as Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Acquisitions. He will have those roles here too in addition to oversight of accounting, reporting and Investor Relations. He is going to do great here and play an important partnership role on the executive committee, on investment committee and day-to-day interaction. Dan came in for the Board meeting earlier this week and is here with us today on the call. We will even make him available to answer your questions. He will be on full-time later this month and can be reached in Rockville at extension 8232. Welcome, Dan. Now the quarter. It was a really good one, better than we expected with improved occupancy, a strong collections effort and a ton of leasing, more than 100 deals and 467,000 feet of total square footage, all of which resulted in FFO per share of $1.42, nearly 7% better than last year's quarter and the highest quarterly result we have ever recorded. Remember, this is happening at a transitional time in our company, when we are realigning our operations organization and adding and changing staff positions, when we are building and stabilizing two major development initiatives that are in the throes of disruptive construction in a weak apartment rental market in DC, when there is over $0.5 billion sitting on our balance sheet and construction in progress that is not producing an income stream yet, but certainly will be. And some of the most sought after compelling product types in the country and some of the most sought after real estate locations in the country. I am really pleased with how our team is responding and the solid progress we are making. Our heads are down and we are executing and the long-term looks as good as ever. When you break down the components of that FFO quarter-over-quarter result, you will see that it is broad-based; top line revenue increase of over 9% and operating income increase of nearly 7.5% that had contributions from everywhere. Had contributions from the Sunset, CocoWalk and Clarion joint venture acquisitions in for the full quarter; contributions from same center growth that beat our internal expectations at 3.5%; contributions from strong redevelopment results from The Point, from East Bay Bridge, from Westgate from Willow Lawn among others; income contributions from Pike & Rose and Assembly Row of nearly $5 million, up significantly over last year's quarter; marginally lower interest expense despite higher borrowings as we continue to drive portfolio rate down, and SG&A that is well under control. Top to bottom every piece of the business is contributing. Last month, as I am sure you have heard, read, we have opportunistically accessed the 30-year unsecured bond market at a spread of only 160 basis points over the 30 year treasury where we are REIT record-setting 3 5/8 coupon, 3.75% effective yield and $250 million. In effect, world economic dislocation and the flight to quality both in real estate and to credits like ours made the timing of that move really compelling. Now that money paid down the line completely with some left over in sitting in a bank for a few months, but that deal is dilutive to earnings for the balance of year by $0.03 to $0.04 per share and we have adjusted our guidance by the low side of that amount in order to be prudent. But, our current construction underway expected to return 300 plus basis points in excess of that money over the next couple of years, 30-year debt short felt like a good call. Okay, a little more detail on the quarter and then onto the outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, the percentage of the entire portfolio that is leased ticked up to 94.5% at June 30, compared with 94.1% at March 31. Melissa will talk about Sports Authority in a few minutes but for purposes of occupancy and absent offsetting leasing, we would expect a 50 basis point hit by the end of the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, leasing results for the quarter were strong, 91 comparable deals done for 373,000 feet of space at $38.21 a foot, 12% higher on a cash basis than the deals they replaced. That is up 17% on anchors, 10% on small shops. It is up 23% on new leases, 7% on renewals. A couple of the most consequential deals include an important merchandising upgrade at the power center portion of Assembly Square where Trader Joe's will replace A.C. Moore at significantly higher rent beginning late in 2017 and should also help create even more tenant demand when the adjacent Sports Authority vacates later this year. Also in the first couple of days in July, we were thrilled to complete the last piece of the puzzle for the leasing of the power center portion of Melville Mall on Long Island with an extremely well regarded Italian specialty grocer called Uncle Giuseppe's taking the former Waldbaums box at a higher rent. There is not a grocer that we would have rather have done a deal with than these guys at this location on Long Island. Check out the Web site. Uncle Giuseppe's along with the new Field & Stream deals and Dick's deals over the past couple of quarters is transforming this property and with A&P out of there, we are now actively working on adding additional GLA for shops and restaurants assuming we can get the entitlements. That is what we are working on so stay tuned. By the way, I'm fresh off a trip to review the completion of two of our latest shopping center redevelopments, Tower Shops in Florida and Mercer Mall in New Jersey. I left thoroughly impressed with a real sense of pride in the transformation. Not only did they look great with full parking lots but consider this, total combined investment before redevelopment of those two shopping centers was $175 million producing property operating income of $14 million. Total combined investment after redevelopment was $215 million, $40 million more, producing operating income of $21 million, $7 million more. Value creation at a simplified cap both before and after redevelopment so no assumed benefit from obvious cap rate contraction of $100 million over four years. Our ability to transform big properties like this, Tower Shops is 370,000 square feet, Mercer Mall is 0.5 million square feet. It is one of the most important components of our business plan and one we are extremely proud of. It is good to own great real estate and have a creative team that can also execute. On the big development side, no surprises, discontinued execution at Assembly, Pike & Rose and Building 11, that is the Splunk building, at Santana Row. Couple of points on each for you to consider. At Assembly, phase one done, stabilized with every building at least 95% leased and occupied. Because of some free rent in the office tenants you have to burn off income will continue to increase next year. Nearly 2000 employees going to work each day at Partners Healthcare as of today, double that next year, have already created higher shopping and restaurant traffic. Now dust and noise are the flavors of the day as roughly 40% of the phase two spend has been incurred and we remain on time and on budget. The Office Occupation, the T-stop usage, the Trader Joe's deals in the adjacent Tower Center I talked about before, all these really show just how important this community has become to the north side of the city. By the way, check out the video NAREIT did featuring Assembly on nareit.com and as you would expect, it is also available on our Web site. Good things happening at Pike & Rose too, though the pressure on residential rents throughout the market surely isn't subsiding. Leasing pace, however, progresses well with the Big Palace Luxury Tower now 84% leased and PerSei, the other residential building there, remaining in the mid-90s. With our current pace of leasing we expect to be at stabilized occupancy by year-end as planned. Nike opens in the old city sports space in a couple of weeks and like at Assembly, noise and dust continue as about one-third of the phase two construction budget has been spent. More than half of the retail space is spoken for in the new phase two at this point with tenants like Pinstripes, Porsche, H&M, Lucky, REI, Red Door Spots, Sephora, Taylor Gourmet. The environment is shaping up as well or better than we had hoped. What we really could use here is a bit of firming on the pricing in the residential market which is bound to happen sooner or later. And on the West Coast, Splunk is expected to occupy the building by January and the execution of this construction and build out has been nearly flawless. We continue to see strength at Santana not only in terms of its desirability as an office location, but also with respect to residential rents that continue to grow above our expectations. The tale of two cities when comparing Silicon Valley and Washington DC on the residential side. In Florida, plans for our new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk continue to progress well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. The decisions as to the direction and initial phases should go to investment committee later this year at which point we will lay out what we have in mind. It is likely that we will want to add office and residential components in some variation at these properties. In the meantime, we are heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasingly optimistic that we will be able to afford the viable and value creative changes at both locations. At Sunset, we will need zoning changes that permit more height to come up with a viable plan yet we would hope to start out with a retail renovation of the existing important sections of the project first. Fingers crossed, we will see. On the acquisition front, we are working through a number of important deals and though pricing remains uncomfortably rich, we are not afraid to step up to the plate for the right real estate. Nothing to report on this call, but we are working hard and hope to have more talk about over the next couple of calls. Jeff Berkes and I will debrief and engage Dan as one of his first orders of business. I have asked Melissa to talk about the Sports Authority impact, our balance sheet activity including yesterday's announced dividend hike for the record setting 49th consecutive year, big celebration for the 50th next, as well as our full-year earnings expectations. And I'm going to ask Dan G. to introduce himself before we open up the line to your questions afterwards. But right now, Melissa? Melissa Solis : Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. We will start with an update on Sports Authority. First, all five of our spaces were occupied and rent paying through June 30. The lease at Montrose Crossing here in Rockville, Maryland was assumed by Value City Furniture so we will have no down time or lost rent on this one. With respect to the lease at East Bay Bridge in Emeryville, California, Dick's Sporting Goods obtained designation rights for the lease and we are currently in negotiations with Dick's to take over the space. We will know more on this one in the next 60 days. So lease at Crow Canyon was rejected effective July 1, with Brick Plaza and Assembly Square Marketplace vacant as of August 1. All outstanding AR for these spaces was 100% reserved as of June 30. In total, we are losing 103,000 square feet of lease space which results in a 50 basis point decline in occupancy that we will see in Q3. The spaces have a total base rent of $2.1 million or $20.50 per square foot and we expect to be able to release the spaces at rents 10% to 20% higher. We are in discussions with tenants for each of the spaces, final leases will of course take time, typically a full year before new rent starts. For the rest of 2016, we expect these three spaces will impact FFO by approximately $0.02 and of course be a drag to our Q3 and Q4 same center metrics. Enough about Sports Authority. Yesterday, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share to a quarterly rate of $0.98 and an annual indicative rate of $3.92 per share. This is our 49th year of consecutive increases, the longest in the REIT sector and one of the longest for all public companies. While we talk a lot about it, this is something we couldn't be more proud of, to be able to pay our shareholders more every year for almost half a century is pretty awesome. Now turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $59 million of equity on our ATM at a weighted average price of $156.24 per share bringing our year-to-date ATM issuances to $92 million. In July, we opportunistically issued $250 million of 30-year senior unsecured debt at a coupon of 3.625% and an effective rate of 3.75%. We ended the quarter with 18% debt to market cap, net debt to EBITDA of 5.2x and a weighted average tenure of our debt of over 11 years after reflecting the July offering. This leaves us lots of flexibility with respect to the balance sheet and locking in these historically low rates will benefit our company for a long time to come. From a capital standpoint, we expect to incur about $250 million in development and redevelopment spend in the second half of 2016 as both phase twos at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose are fully under construction. The cost will be funded with the remaining proceeds from the July bond offering, equity under our ATM and the line of credit, all with an eye toward maintaining net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid 5 range. Absent a significant acquisition, we do not plan to issue additional long-term debt in 2016. Now turning to guidance. We have adjusted our guidance range to reflect the incremental interest expense from the July bond offering. We had not anticipated accessing the long-term debt market until late in 2016 or early 2017 and consequently had assumed funding on our line of credit. The impact is $0.03 to $0.04 and our updated FFO per diluted share guidance range adjusted the low-end of that to a range of $5.62 to $5.68. A few additional items to note about our guidance range as well as items having an outsized impact in the second half of 2016 compared to the first half. First, consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include any future acquisitions or dispositions. The range includes the loss of the three Sports Authority spaces I discussed earlier which is a drag of approximately $0.02 per share. We will have additional compensation costs associated with our new CFO of approximately $0.015 in the second half of 2016. We still expect same center including redevelopment for the year to be in the 3% area. Given our year-to-date metric as of 6/30 was 3.8%, we do expect some deceleration in the second half of the year as we feel the impact of the Sports Authority vacancies, anchor rollover timing and expected more normalized levels of bad debt expense. We expect this to be concentrated more in Q3 as we will see additional rent starts late in the year for anchor tenants like Saks at Congressional, TJ Maxx at Pentagon Row and Field & Stream at Melville. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Dan to introduce himself before we open up the call to your questions. Dan? Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Melissa. I just want to say a few quick remarks. First, let me say how thrilled I am to be here at Federal starting in a little over a week. Federal is a company whose management team, business strategy and balance sheet philosophy I've truly admired from afar over the past several years and I am really looking forward to joining and becoming a value-added partner to Don, Melissa and the entire senior management team here at Federal. And second, let me just say how much I look forward to getting to know everyone that is here on the phone today over the next several months as I settle into my new role. Like I said, I could not be more excited to be here. Operator, I think we can now turn the call over to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, guys, and welcome aboard, Dan. If I could, I wanted to go to the California market so if Jeff is on the phone, I just wanted to get your sort of developing thoughts on just the competitive landscape for Santana now and in the future, just with Stanford completing a big renovation, Westfield obviously embarking on one and now Related has approvals for City Place. Just curious how you think not just about the incremental retail space, but also how that impacts your leasing options? Do think you guys could maybe lose the high-end if you will and could City Place maybe diminish the uniqueness of Santana? Jeff Berkes : Hey, Jeff. Those are all good questions and clearly stuff we have been thinking about for a long time. I think I mentioned this on our prior call, Valley Fair at Westfield, they've had those entitlement since pre-recession so this is something that has been out there for a while and we think ultimately going to come to bear over the next few years. And from our perspective, we are doing what we can do which is being very aggressive about merchandising the Street, making Santana a great place to come, the addition of the Splunk building with 670 more parking spaces, redoing some of the common areas, all that kind of stuff here. And then thinking about the other parcels we have left to develop and how those are going to get developed out, all of that is being rolled into our thinking. And maintaining Santana's uniqueness in the marketplace is a great place to come and spend time and meet friends and eat out and shop and live and work and all that kind of stuff. And so far everything has gone very, very well. We do expect some headwinds of course when Valley Fair starts the expansion. That is going to be a little bit of a dogfight for a few years but long-term, we are not concerned about it. As it relates to City Place, I don't know, there is still a lot to be written on that development. I would never bet against Related but they've got a long ways to go there and geographically it is a little bit difficult to figure out how that intercepts a lot of our primary shopping traffic so more space in the market always affects everybody and they are putting a lot of space into the market but again long-term we are not overly concerned about that. Stanford is a huge benefit. Jeffrey Donnelly : Why do you say it's a benefit? And I guess when the dust settles -- I know that is a few years from now -- do think your retail positioning changes at all, and maybe you build more restaurants and away from fashion? I guess maybe another question is, are there any critical tenants for you or anchor type tenants there at Santana that expire in the next few years? Jeff Berkes : Jeff, you know Santana pretty well and you know since they opened 14 years ago that the mix of the tenancy here has changed and a lot of the luxury has shifted out already and that happened a long, long time ago and really didn't affect us here at all in terms of our shopper traffic and sales of the property. So the high-end going across the street to Valley Fair and continuing to do so, I don't think matters. Our whole strategy with Santana Row as it relates to not only the experience we provide people that come here to shop, but also tenants who say look, if it is your 400th store, you should probably be at Valley fair. If it is your 10th, 20th or 50th store, you are very sensitive about the image you project to your customer base, Santana is where you should be and we have been very successful over the last few years bringing in some really great merchants like Kate Spade and Made Well and Bonobos and WarbyParker and the list goes on and on and that is continuing to happen in spite of the fact that everybody knows that the Valley Fair expansion is going to happen. So, like I said and like Don said in his comments, our heads are down and we are doing what we need to do on a day to day basis to continue to maintain our position in the marketplace. Jeffrey Donnelly : And just sticking to that area, I know this is a different county and sort of a different property type, but San Mateo recently put the topic of rent control on the ballot out there. Just as someone who is local I'm curious what your reaction is to that and do think if it has legs, it has the risk of flopping over if you will to Santa Clara or not a concern, if I think about it. Jeff Berkes : I mean all the communities up and down the peninsula are considering that right now and if it is not on the ballot in November, it has already happened or it is going to happen, right? I mean the cost of housing here is a big issue and everybody knows that. San Jose has had rent control for a very long time and they recently tweaked some of the rules around how that rent control works. That primarily affects owners of much, much older product than we have and even when you work through it, rent control in and of itself is in my mind not a good thing. But it doesn't really have the adverse impact in a normal market. So yes, I think you are going to continue to see that and how the rubber meets the road is still TBD, but generally speaking most rent control laws are dealing with much older product. Jeffrey Donnelly : Just a last quick one for Melissa, do you have an estimate of when I guess the decentralization plan will be fully implemented and be in the new run rate for G&A? Don Wood : 2017, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. I was wondering if you could provide a quick update on Sunset Place and the recent lease up that you have shown? Don Wood : Surely. So the recent lease up is the Restoration Hardware deal that is taking long vacant space for what will be a short-term deal for them. It may turn out to be a long-term deal but a short-term deal and they simply looked at the location of the real estate and said we don't know what you guys are going to do long-term, but this is a place that we need to be right now and we think we can do a lot of business out of there. So that is what that was about. I want to talk about in terms of longer-term and basically here is the situation. As you know this is a dysfunctional property that has not been good for a long time. What we are doing right now, the dawn side of our business, the operating side of the business is doing everything again it can to keep it moving, to do new deals like that and to keep it in place. The development side of our business is saying this needs to be fixed. It will be fixed if we can get the entitlement to do so in two stages. One will be part of that property that is the best functioning part of the property today needs to be fixed up. There will be effectively a renovation to create a good shopping center there. The second part of the property will in order to do what the real estate needs, need to go vertical. We will need entitlement changes to do that. The question will be do we do the first part without the entitlement for the second part? That we are not sure about yet. In fact we are leaning toward no until we know that we can get the entitlements to make the whole thing make sense. That is why I have been less forthcoming with respect to our plans. We know what we're trying to get to but it really is going to depend upon the ability to get the entitlements to do so and that should happen over the next year and we will have an economic plan before that time to the extent we get them. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. I'm guessing it is probably way too early for some type of dollar spending scope? Don Wood : It is, I would be guessing right now. I don't want to do that to you. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And just a general question. Have you guys adjusted your return hurdles at all or thinking about it just given the interest rate environment and probably every market environment we are in right now? Don Wood : A little bit. We have come down a little bit in terms of what we want. We are willing to be more aggressive on acquisitions for the right property and a lot of that frankly is around where we are able to do 30-year money. That has changed things for us. The ability to do that not everybody can do 30-year because I do believe you've got to match the left side with the right side and I don't think 10 years is long enough frankly. So that has helped us an awful lot in thinking that through. But I have to say it is not about can you do acquisitions or not do acquisitions in my view. It is about where do you allocate capital and how do you allocate capital? As you know and Melissa just said, who has got $0.25 billion to spend in the balance of this year on development projects that are expected to yield 300 basis points plus over what we are borrowing at? So when you think about capital allocation it is not so much about is there an acquisition to do, it is about is there a way to grow. I mean any public REIT has to continue to grow. We just feel fortunate that we have the development opportunities to be able to do that and there certainly will be an occasional acquisition and we will certainly stretch to step up to what we need to step up to do for that occasional acquisition but I stress occasional. Ki Bin Kim : Do you think private market cap rates in general for a good quality real estate has moved at all in the recent half-year or so or is that pretty much as well as a cycle? Don Wood : I think that is pretty darn consistent. Jeff, do you have anything to add to that? Jeff Berkes : Yes. I think things have gotten a little bit more expensive over the last three to six months. So cap rates I think and IRRs are a little bit lower than they were three to six months ago. So we continue to see in the markets where we do business particularly out here in California, cap rates being in the 4 range and unusually the low 4 range and IRRs with an aggressive exit cap rate assumption in the 5s and low to mid 5s and I think that is somewhat consistent depending on the market and the asset over the last year, or so but I think things have strengthened in the last half a year. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Just two questions here. First, actually for Jeff, just out in California maybe just more general if you could just give an update on what you are seeing on the health of northern California as far as -- the apartment guys were talking about you obviously oversupply, but also softness on the job side and the tech. And then, you listen to the office guys and it seems like office is pretty good. So can you just give us your sense of what is going on in northern California as far as the economy and your expectations as you look out to next year? Jeff Berkes : Yes, sure, Alex. I think the Bay Area gets painted with a broad brush which I think everybody understands and probably expects, but I think things are a little bit different maybe in San Francisco than they are in Silicon Valley right now particularly on the apartment side where there is a lot of product coming online in San Francisco. And when you think about what it costs to build a condo or an apartment in San Francisco, you've got to get a pretty high sales price or pretty high rent so most of the stuff that is coming online is targeting the same customer. And there is definitely some softness up there from what we have seen and heard both in condo sales prices and in apartment rents and concessions creeping back into the market. Down in the Valley, I think it is probably a little bit different. I mean like Don said in his comments, we are doing better on our rental increases at our apartments here and Santana Row than we expected to be doing this time of the year, this part of the cycle. And I think that goes to a couple of things of course. One is supply; there is a little bit of a supply lull at the moment. We will see how long that continues but also job growth and I think that is different between San Francisco and the Valley as well. Things might be a little bit more choppy in San Francisco as it relates to that, down here in Silicon Valley, they are very, very healthy. We look at job growth closely and we are still seeing not only a lot of jobs being added, but a big queue of unfilled jobs at most of the major employers. You are at sub-frictional unemployment rates right now in both San Francisco and Silicon Valley and there is a lot of competition still from the big firms to hire the right people and the big firms here are still very, very profitable and they have a ton of cash on their balance sheets and they are growing. And while that may not be at the same pace that it was a year or so ago, it is still extremely strong from a historical perspective. So we are really bullish on Silicon Valley right now, always cautious as you know but very bullish and I think what you are hearing is more broad brush effect than what we are seeing in our product. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. So bottom line is San Francisco maybe a little soft but Silicon Valley is still very strong it sounds like in your view? Jeff Berkes : It is. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Second question. Don Wood : Alex, let me say something about Santana Row a little bit and Donnelly asked about it before and I want to get this thought out of my head. The reality is similar to what we have seen on the East Coast, there is the supply that is around, the pickling on the office side is not necessarily what employers are looking for. So you see vacancies, you see \"softness\" in product that is in some respects not leasable and what has happened at Santana, while there is no question in my mind that we will be under pressure in terms of the rents that we will get on retail because of the Valley Fair expansion -- because of any kind of expansion when you add that much space over the next few years, the place itself is so solidified and is so good at what it is that we do benefit big time on both the residential and on the office. Now at the end of that street we are going to have to finish out one of these days and we are working through an office plan for the end of that street with retail on the ground floor and we are obviously boosted by the success that we have had with respect to Splunk. Now I'm not ready to announce that or to talk about that but given the environment, and all the comments you just heard from Jeff, we are going to have, there is going to be support around here to add incremental office and retail space to -- a small amount of retail, restaurant primarily -- space to Santana Row that captures what it is that we have done. And I think that type of environment, that aminity base, that place that we have created will serve us real well on the office and continue on the residential side. We got to get specific on the questions you are analyzing. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, Don, I appreciate that. Second question is maybe for Dan or Melissa. You guys issued debt earlier than you thought. Rates only seem to go one way for the past almost decade. A year out from now you have the Plaza El Segundo mortgage that comes due, pretty high coupon. As you guys think about your capital needs over the next year, is your view more let's get stuff early like you did with the 30 year; let's half the market early, maybe prepay? Or your view is now, look, rates just only seem to stay low anytime people try to hedge early or do anything early; it ends up costing because rates keep coming down. Given your balance sheet, it is not so bad; you can certainly support it to wait longer until that mortgage naturally matures? Or do you think about maybe attacking that early? Don Wood : Listen, what you just said, Alex, is exactly right. Where we look at the future is very much determined by what we have done in the past, and now we have an awful lot of flexibility. So with respect to the particular loan that you are talking about at Plaza El Segundo, there is a requirement in our partnership agreement that we have some level of debt on that asset. And that particular loan is not prepayable until three months --. Jeff Berkes : May. Don Wood : May of next year. So the likelihood is we will wait until May to effectively do something there. And again, we will wind up putting probably some level of debt back on that property on a secured basis because we need to give tax protection to our partners. In almost any scenario we see, it will be a benefit. It will be cheaper than the debt that is there. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. That is helpful, Don. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the cost of capital discussion, as you mentioned earlier, you just issued the 30-year debt in the mid-3s, your shares trade at we are calculating around a 3 on an implied rate basis. You might have the lowest weighted average cost of long-term capital of any REIT. You talked about being more aggressive on acquisitions for the right deals. I know you have always maintained a list of properties in the U.S. that you would want to own someday. With your cost of capital where it is today who knows how long that will last, are you being more proactive in going out to some of those owners to try to create your own supply of new deals? Don Wood : Well, I don't know, Christy, that we are being more proactive. We are certainly being proactive. You may be seeing parts of that in the next few months and I will talk about that when I can. But again, I really need you to understand on the capital allocation side what we are putting to work in development and it is aggressive. I mean we are aggressively putting money to work in a way that is far more value creative than with any acquisition no matter what is available on the marketplace today. So it is not only, I only want to use this great cost of capital not to create one or two years worth of FFO, but to add value and right now it is pretty darn clear that the development alternatives over the acquisition alternatives are a slam dunk. Now if we didn't have these development alternatives, you would see whole -- we got to grow, right, you got to keep going. That is the deal but we do and we do for years to come so that is really all I can say about that at this point. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then, just following up on the guidance I just want to understand sort of the delta. So you lowered guidance by $0.03. I understand the debt issue causes about a $0.03 to $0.04 drag. You've got Sports Authority in the back half of the year that is another $0.02, the additional comp is $0.015. I know you talked about this a little bit in your opening remarks but what are sort of the offsets to that? It seems like that all adds up to more than $0.03. Melissa Solis : We did have better than expected during Q2 so I think there was some additional benefit from Q2 that was able to offset that, those negative throughout the rest of the year. Don Wood : You know what it really is, Christy? It is our general sandbagging. It is the general reality that we wind up in running this portfolio with good things happening that we could not predict, that is what's happened. So we don't take every negative thing and reduce guidance for it and consider the base at this property -- the base of this real estate allows us to have things happen that are not predictable, whether that is a lease termination fee, whether that is collections. In the second quarter, we were incredibly successful with collections of some old stuff and that is -- nothing happened by itself. That happened with very aggressive running, but not something that we could have predicted. So that is when I say sandbagging, that is what I mean, it is not intentional sandbagging, it is a benefit of a great portfolio that good things happen. So I mean we are conservative people, we do the best we can to make sure we are not surprising you guys to the negative but things happen in this portfolio so we didn't take it all the way down. Christy McElroy : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is now open. Jeremy Metz : Thank you, guys. In terms of the shops at Sunset, I think around the time of NAREIT, you are close to filing those -- indensification there. So just wondering have those been filed at this point? And if so, what has been the initial feedback so far there? Don Wood : We have not filed them yet. We are working through the strategy with the government officials down there on what the right timing would be to file that and there are some things going on, but I would anticipate over the next 30 to 60 days we are going to be in a position to file. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Then just in terms of the Sports Authority lease at Assembly Marketplace -- sorry if I missed this, but do you have control of that box and with the Trader Joe's already slated to come in, who is on the target for that space? Don Wood : Yes. We do have control of the box. I don't want to give you the names of the tenants that we are talking to because we are having them compete with one another and trying to create the best deal, Jeremy. You understand that. But I will say if you take a look at the merchandising in that shopping center, particularly with the Trader Joe's announcement that they are coming in and the success of the Row, the [indiscernible] Plaza adjacent to it, I mean that is pretty much ground zero for boxes. So we would very much anticipate competition for space for that box. Jeff Berkes : The only thing that I would just add is how really thrilled we are with our partner, Trader Joe's, that they are coming in with construction we have going on and all of the residential being added. It is a great co-tenant for those residents and there is already excitement and benefit that we are seeing. Jeremy Metz : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vincent Chao : Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to go back to the cost of capital kind of discussion and you mentioned the attractiveness of 30-year yields today. Obviously did a record-setting deal but just curious, your cost of equity looks pretty much equally attractive there and not that you need to delever further, but just wondering how you are thinking about equity versus 30-year when your FFO yields are pretty similar? Don Wood : Absolutely. And it is a balance and you know, we will do, we will try to do about $50 million a quarter on the ATM for the next two quarters through the balance of the year. We have done a little bit more than 100 -- we have done $92 million in the first half of the year off of the ATM and as you know we did an overnight that way. So it is a balance. We are not trying specifically to delever. We are trying as you know to wind up -- we are working a 10-year business plan here where we are trying to double the earnings of the company from a few years ago. And in doing that, we said we'd do that and we are trying hard to do that on a leverage neutral basis. So that means when we lay out these development opportunities, when we consider new development opportunities or new acquisition opportunities, that does, we look opportunistically at both markets and we are accessing both markets. You will never find us going wholly one way or wholly another way. The beauty of this business plan is it's a balance. Vincent Chao : Got it. What would be the downside of going more equity if the cost of that is similar? Don Wood : We have got money going out in a big way to produce development returns. We are trying to do that in a way that results in 6%, 7%, 8% FFO per share growth a year, that is one component of the plan and you are right, does that matter for equity over debt? No. But we firmly believe that in not overly diluting shareholders in any one period of time to balance that with cost of debt that it 30 years is pretty close to equity frankly -- in balance that that makes sense. Does that mean that we couldn't do more equity? No, it doesn't mean we couldn't but we don't think we need to because all of these markets have been pretty even in terms of their value to us. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Vineet Khanna : Good morning, folks. Just maybe could you talk about the demand that you are seeing for your Sports Authority boxes? Don Wood : Sure, Chris, do want to do it? Jeff, do the West Coast, do the East Coast. Chris Weilminster : Sure. Of course as Melissa mentioned, two of them are not really ours to manage. The two that we have here on the East Coast are brick, there is active negotiations going on with multiple tenants as part of the redevelopment of that property where we also had the A&P box we got back. So I would hope that in the next year or two, Don is going to talk about Brick Plaza and the vision for it just like he mentioned earlier on Mercer and Tower. I feel very confident about that. And as it relates to Assembly as we said earlier in the call, there is a lot of active interest. It is important from a merchandising standpoint to nail that with the right type of tenancy and take advantage of it being a complement to the Row property next door and the outlet mix on softgoods that we have. A lot of interest. As soon as we are able to provide you more guidance on exactly this time we will. Don Wood : Let me add one thing to the bigger picture if I can on the vacancies in the boxes that we have. As you know we work hard to get vacancies from A&P and Sports Authority is giving us vacancies that we didn't necessarily count on, but we got them anyway along with LA Fitness and some of the other stuff we talked about in the past. You should know that since we started talking about that we have done five key deals, Uncle Giuseppe's at Melville, Field & Stream at Melville, Sachs Off Fifth at Congressional, Trader Joe's at Assembly, LA Fitness at Delmar. That is 200,000 square feet of deals where the old rent was about $18 a foot and the new rent is about $27. So the notion of what it is that we are doing -- does that guarantee that the remaining ones are going to be like that? Of course, not. But it does say that this idea of creating better shopping centers for the next 10 years is what our focus is and demand on the East Coast and then Jeff will got on the two on the West Coast, you will see that this real estate will not have a problem releasing and really changing completely the shopping centers that they are in that those Sports Authorities are in, particularly Brick. Jeff Berkes : Out here on the West Coast, we have got two, a small format store in Crow Canyon which we have back and like Chris said, we have got multiple interest from retailers on that as well and the rent will be higher than the rent that Sports Authority was paying. And then at East Bay Bridge, Dick's acquired the designation rights to that lease so we don't know exactly how that is going to turn out, but I will tell you the lease rent is a low double-digit rent and we have interest from multiple tenants to take that should we get it back. But we don't control that at this point. Vineet Khanna : Okay, great. And then just at Palace and PerSei, I know you guys talked about this a little bit, but have you seen any change in rents and in abatements there? Don Wood : No, we really haven't. It has been from the last quarter to this quarter consistent including pace. Pace has been consistently good and the rents have been. I frankly have been looking for more, I've been look for a change in the Spiderman characteristics of the rent to be able to allow us to push rents and we have not seen that and also it has been consistent with what I've been talking about. Vineet Khanna : Okay, great. And then just lastly, Don, has the vast majority of the East Coast operations restructuring related hiring been completed? Don Wood : It has. Vineet Khanna : Okay, great. Thanks for the time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jason White with Green Street Advisor. Your line is now open. Jason White : Hey, guys. Just a quick question on Pike, you talked about the construction hampering kind of the feel of what the property is going to become. When does the dust really settle there where it kind of becomes what it is going to be without all the construction? Don Wood : It is really 18 months. We will be sitting there in 2018. The first tenants and this is the way the stuff kind of works, REI will be the first tenant in the next phase open and that will be open by the middle of next year. Then the numbers kind of follow after that, Pinstripes follows after that, those are in a smaller building. But the bigger building particularly the Tower that has condos on top, a hotel in the middle, retail on the ground floor and the adjacent building on the other side, we are going to be in 2018 as that is being turned over. So it is really that period of time, Jason. When those two things are done, you will see, you will feel what we are talking about. If I could get you onto the parking garage today at Pike & Rose and look out over it, you would get this completely. You would see exactly what I'm talking about. So really it is like anybody who is going to be on the East Coast anytime over the next 30, 60, 90 days, I would be happy to walk up there with you. Jason White : Great, thanks. Just one more. On your lease spreads, the options or the renewals, do you have it broken down into negotiated renewals versus the contractual renewals? Don Wood : I don't. Do you? Melissa Solis : Options aren't in there. It is all negotiated. Jason White : Everything in renewals is negotiated, there is no options baked in the renewals? Don Wood : No, that is right. If it is not a piece of paper that was an executed deal, it is not in the numbers. Jason White : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I guess my question is concerning the experiential retailers and I would like to use Legoland at Assembly Row as an example. One of the pushbacks I get when I talk about these type of retailers is they say once you visit, are you done? Do you ever go back? So I guess I am asking you one, do you know anything about repeat visitors to like a Legoland or is it just a matter that their draw is so much broader that they continue to see good attendance regardless of not repeat? Don Wood : Got you, Craig. Let me give you my point of view and Chris is going to jump in as soon as I am finished. There is no doubt and I agree with the basic concept with experiential tenants particularly that first of all, you know as soon as they open whether there is something that resonates or doesn't and Legoland resonated in a big way. The challenge then is to say okay, is that the level of business that they are going to maintain throughout their lease life? You can't assume it is. It is not like a restaurant -- at least we have found and it is not just Legoland, this kind of notion, it is not like a restaurant that gains in popularity all the way through and it is a lot of small visits that continue to happen. The question is does it settle into a place because of its big draw from a large area where it is always something that people continue to go to once a month. At first they will go a lot and then over time they go less. What we see there is first of all, is like a huge opening and that was so validating to the property that it was critical and they have settled and they have settled down a number from the beginning in a place though that still works really, really well. Now what will be interesting to see is from this point, do they grow slowly like other retailers from here? Do they reprogram the space with different attractions and things like that? How does that work out? That is what we expect to happen but the level that they are doing today is pretty darn impressive albeit not what it was when it opened up. Chris Weilminster : I would say and I think Don answered the business side of it, from our perspective on why we did Lego there and why this experiential use was really important was that it provided a daily draw -- or it provided a draw to the 18 million tourists that come into Boston every year. We got on the same program as the Aquarium and the Duck Tours and the Science Museum so that those constituents coming in came to Assembly to drive traffic to every other use we have there. So there is the business answer and I think that will drive growth but there was also a very defined purpose as to why we did it which was creating a use and a need that attracted a regional draw. There if you talk to them, they draw from about 120 mile radius. We see field trip buses there all of the time. And I have got three kids, I remember when they were younger, the same destination. At the point in time Chucky E. Cheese local for birthday parties I think that probably whether 30 times over a window of time. So I just think that Lego is also serving that same purpose of families and bringing back that recognition. And so we are thrilled with Legoland there. We just added iFLY at the White Marsh which is the same kind of thing. So in the right places for the right draw I think these are uses that make a lot of sense but you have to have the big picture as to what the end use purposes is for this and this was very disciplined in our decision-making to bring them here. Craig Schmidt : Great. Thank you for your thoughts. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Yes. Hi. I guess first on the sub-under property expansion and conversion opportunities, what exactly is being contemplated for 3rd Street Promenade? Jeff Berkes : I'm sorry, can you restate that, I missed the last part of what you said? Michael Mueller : Yes. Third Street is listed under property expansion and conversion opportunities and I was just curious as to what the conversion or expansion opportunity is there? Jeff Berkes : Yes. It relates primarily to some of our second floor spaces and our multi-story buildings. A good example would be 301 Arizona which a couple of years ago we had a two-story retailer and we found some upside in the building by converting the upper levels of the retail space to office, reducing the size of the retail space and making it ground floor only and therefore getting a lot more rent for it. So we have a couple of other buildings that fit into that general configuration that still have two-story tenants or two floors of retail in them as they come back to us we will think through that as well. Don Wood : Not only that, Mike, but because we are a landlord on the street but we don't own it all, we are always looking for adjacencies. So to the extent the primary reason it is on that schedule is for the second floor things that we got to do stuff with. But taking that and moving it across to an adjacent building is why we maintain and try to build on great relationships with those owners and those are the other possibilities that we try to go for. Michael Mueller : Got it. And then just going back to something I think Melissa said, looking at the renewals, were you saying that any lease that expired where there is a fixed option for new price that is being excluded from this pool? Melissa Solis : It is anything that would be a contractual option so if it is already in the lease agreement when we execute it and it is a contractual option that is not included. Michael Mueller : So if you have something that is a 3% increase that is not in here? Melissa Solis : Right. Michael Mueller : Okay. And do you know about how big that pool of leases is compared to the 267 that was signed or renewed this quarter? Melissa Solis : I don't have it in front of me, no. It is typically a fairly small percentage for us. Michael Mueller : It is pretty minimal? Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is now open. Floris Van Dijkum : Great, thank you. On the previous call asking for updates on the Chicago strategic expansion possibilities and I know that the person looking into that previously is no longer there but could you comment on that job now? Don Wood : We are not selling those assets to the person previously looking at that responsibility by the way. You know, I can tell you this, I can tell you that Jeff Mooallem has taken over for Jim on the responsibility for the Chicago properties as a part of that division of the company. That Jeff Mooallem, I shouldn't speak for him but I'm going to -- is more bullish on opportunities in that marketplace and at those particular assets than necessarily we were thinking previously. And so he is going to get some time to do what the previous guy in charge in coming up with a [indiscernible] wasn't able to do. So you're going to have to keep asking it every three months and that is fair. Floris Van Dijkum : Fair enough. You sort of alluded to some of the rental softness in the DC markets and what kind of tax -- would you see any further impact now that you have got the two buildings at Pike leased so far. How has that impacted future [technical difficulty] and? Don Wood : I think I got you, you are coming in and out so excuse me if I haven't fully gotten your question. But I think what you are saying is if we don't see any improvement or further deterioration are our future yields at risk? And the answer is sure, they are. Now where we are today and this is what is interesting to me frankly. We have absolutely even with the construction zone validated that this type of living is what people are willing to pay more for in terms of the marketplace. So we continue, we have gotten -- continue to get premiums to the marketplace for Pike & Rose apartments. The next phase will add more Pike & Rose apartments and in fact we still have more to do in Palace this way. There will be a change in the supply and demand dynamics in addition to a project that is getting a whole lot more as we talked about before stable in terms of what it is going to be. But to the extent it continues to soften yes, there will be pressure on the yield. That is just a matter of fact the way it is. Floris Van Dijkum : Great. Thanks, Don. Don Wood : Anything else operator? Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Leah Andress for closing remarks. Leah Andress : Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you in the coming weeks. Please reach out with any questions you have. Thank you. Bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program for today. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Last night we reported third quarter 2016 FFO per share of $1.41, 3.7% better than last year's exceptionally strong quarter and above our internal expectations. Given these results we're comfortable reaffirming our previously issued guidance range for full-year 2016 in effect narrowing it a bit to $5.63 to $5.67. I want to talk about the third quarter's reported results, expectations for the balance of the year and most importantly what this means for 2017 since we released initial guidance last night that fall short of Street expectations, mostly for value enhancing initiatives that have a short term cost. More on that in a few minutes. Let's get started with the quarter. At $1.41 a share following $1.38 in the first quarter, $1.42 in the second, we're happy with that result given the fact that, as anticipated and as we discussed previously, this is the quarter when you really see the full effect of the big vacancies we have been talking about for the past few quarters. Sports Authority is gone, A&P, Hancock Fabrics, Hudson Trail boxes are gone, etc. And they were all in and rent paying a year ago. When coupled with a particularly strong quarter a year ago where FFO per share had gone 11%, this all made for a tough year-over-year comparison. Those vacancies this quarter, along with the inclusion of poorly leased Sunset Place and CocoWalk, resulted in a reduction of our portfolios lease percentage of 120 basis points to 94.3% and a physical occupancy reduction of 200 basis points. Those vacancies, in addition to some strong bad debt recoveries and percentage rent positives in last year's quarter, resulted in anemic same-store growth comparisons by some 150 to 200 basis points lower than they would have otherwise have been. When you think about it, it does say an awful lot about the portfolio that same-store grew 1.5% in a quarter that occupancy dipped by as much as it did. It would be wrong to conclude that leasing activity has trailed off, however, as can be seen in the leasing done this quarter. There was a lot of it -- 93 comparable deals, that is more leases than any quarter in the last couple of years, for 427,000 feet of space at an average rent of $31.25, 14% higher than the tenants they replaced. In fact, over the first nine months of this year we have done 269 comparable deals or 1.2 million square feet, 17% more volume than the first nine months of 2015. And that leads me into the discussion I want to have about our initial guidance for 2017 of $5.83 to $5.93 per share. So let me pivot now and use the rest of my prepared remarks to discuss 2017. I think this will make us one of the first to issue guidance and this year particularly requires explanation. And let me start out by being crystal clear, that despite 4% projected FFO growth at the midpoint of guidance next year, nothing has changed our outlook as to the achievability of hitting or beating our long term business plan goal of doubling income over 10 years. In fact, it is precisely because of the items diluting 2017 that I have greater confidence we will get there. To make it as clear as possible we have included a schedule of this year's -- this quarter's press release and 8-K on the reconciliation of FFO guidance -- on the FFO guidance page that will parallel the comments I am about to make. A little background first as to why we're so aggressively repositioning so much of our portfolio. We have seen consumer behavior changing and changing at an accelerated pace and impacting nearly every business. Retail real estate is no exception. That is why a couple years back we turned up the heat on virtually every initiative we had at the same time in every facet of our business at a time when capital was cheap in an effort to put this best-of-class portfolio in the best possible shape to thrive in markets where consumers demand a higher level of service and an environment that they want to hang out in as an integral part of their lives. Of course it takes time, often more than we would like. But we view it as critical to the long term strengthening of this real estate portfolio. We feel that we're best positioned to do this given the quality locations of our real estate and our track record of success in transforming different types of retail real estate. So, we accelerated the timing to start the second phases of our big mixed use developments before the paint was dry on the first phases, even though the second-phase construction affects first-base performance until the overall sense of place is established. We jumped into Miami with not one but two new retail opportunities to fix broken but well located retail destinations even though the existing income stream will of course be disrupted in preparation of that process. We accelerated the full build-out of Santana Row, first with the option on the 12 acres across the street called Santana West, then with the spec built, but now fully leased, Splunk office building and currently with the approval and announcement to move forward with the $215 million, 310,000 square foot office retail tower that will anchor the end of the street. We restructured our personnel through a decentralization and systems investment initiative so that the human capital was sufficient, properly aligned and had the tools necessary to accelerate progress in both the mixed use and the core portfolios. We took advantage of a very favorable capital environment; both by delevering concurrent with and somewhat ahead of, any development spend. And by turning out our debt portfolio with $700 million of 30-year unsecured bonds, creating a level of safety unmatched by any of our peers. Of course at the expense of lower earnings caused by higher short term interest expense and lower overall leverage. We have and continue to identify more value enhancing redevelopment opportunities with our new decentralized structure than ever before in our history and we're getting more of them started faster even though they hurt short term earnings. Many of those opportunities have been made possible by our ability to get back underperforming anchor boxes. And it is this last point, the one related to the far deeper redevelopment pool sparked by anchor vacancies, that is one of the three main reasons 2017 appears light, even though it is this redevelopment initiative that will drive significant value creation and earnings growth to follow. And if the markets are softening and the cost of money is increasing, the quality of the real estate location has always been the best hedge possible. We have got the best quality real estate portfolio. Let me give you some numbers. The re-lease of the excess anchor vacancy in the portfolio creates an obvious drag -- earnings drag until the spaces are coordinated into the bigger development plan. Then in some cases entitled, then leased, then turned over to the tenant for interior build-out, then occupied and finally rent paying. Generally we're not just trying to re-lease vacant boxes; we're trying to reposition and fortify retail destinations and that simply takes longer. We have 700,000 square feet of anchor and near anchor vacancy in the quarter, that is more than double the box vacancy that we historically have carry. It's Sports Authority, A&P, it is Hudson Trail, it is Hancock Fabrics -- you know the names. The prior rent on that 730,000 feet was $19.75 and represented $14.5 million of rent or $0.20 a share of former in-place annual rent that is missing. As of today we have got 42% of that space Re-leased and re-leased at 37% higher rent than was previously being paid. It is re-leased to Ulta and DSW at Brick Shopping Center; to Field and Stream and Uncle Giuseppe's at Melville Shopping Center; to T.J. Maxx at Pentagon Row; to LA Fitness at Delmar, etc. Every one of those deals is part of a much more comprehensive repositioning of the shopping center, not merely a re-leasing of the box. But it generally doesn't become rent paying until 2017 and 2018 with a heavy weighting toward the back end of 2017 and 2018. Accordingly, we have forecast 2017 to be roughly $5 million or $0.07 a share lower than it otherwise would be. Of course the value creation of these redeveloped shopping centers would be significant when complete.  Now let's go to the big developments and talk to the natural short term dilution that comes from the delivery and lease-up process associated with the residential development at Phase 2 of Assembly and Pike & Rose as well as the dilution that comes from the probable reconfiguration of CocoWalk that we considered in our 2017 guidance. First, the Phase 2 residential building under construction at both Assembly and Pike & Rose. At Assembly a 447 unit residential building whole montage and at Pike & Rose, the 272 unit residential building called The Henri, will both begin delivery and lease up in 2017. The dilution that comes from this process is expected to exceed $4 million or $0.06 a share. Operating cost, marketing, interest expense naturally exceed revenue as development turns over these buildings to operating teams. Expenses exceed revenues significantly at first, then less so as the buildings lease up. It is unavoidable and will create an earnings drag of about $2 million before interest and an additional $2 million at the FFO line. Those two buildings alone are expected, however, to create well over $100 million of value when stabilized. Similarly, at CocoWalk in Florida, while we haven't completely finalized our redevelopment plans and numbers, we do hope to be able to get those plans through our investment committee early next year which will allow us to begin repositioning space and tenants and beginning construction on a portion of the shopping center in 2017. As you would expect, as you would assume, occupancy at CocoWalk -- and at Sunset, for that matter -- would get worse before it gets better and we thought it prudent to include the impact of Miami's first step toward repositioning, estimated at a couple of cents of share in our guidance. Obviously the value expected to be created at CocoWalk far exceeds the 2017 accounting costs. Basically our 2017 guidance would have been roughly $0.16 a share higher if we were simply not building Phase 2s at Pike & Rose or Assembly and not proactively taking out our anchor space. Hopefully the enhancements we're making to our disclosure, including the timing of income coming online, will provide more clarity now and in the future. Those are Dan's ideas. The final significant item affecting 2017 guidance is our lower near term operating income expectations at Pike & Rose. Continuing softness in the Montgomery County Maryland residential market, especially in the last 90 days and the ongoing construction disruption of Phase 2 simply make me uncomfortable maintaining 7% yield guidance at Pike & Rose. And accordingly, you will note a change in our 8-K disclosure for both the first and second phases which, as I alluded to earlier, are so integrated and they really need to be viewed together, to a 6% to 7% yield with better disclosure on the time period for getting there. The disclosure now also includes site maps that we're adding that make the proximity of the Phase 2 construction to Phase 1 quite apparent along with the land and entitlements for future phases. I, we, remain as positive as ever on what we're creating there, but have our eyes wide open as to the additional time that it is going to take to get there. The combined impact of that lower expected yield and slower pace are negatively impacting our 2017 guidance by about $0.06 a share. All told, the $0.22 a share or more that is pushed back from 2017 to the next 12, 24, 36 months, in addition to the positive momentum and contributions from the many initiatives we're working on and from those that we will add onto in the future. So that is it for my prepared remarks. We have got a lot going on around here and a huge investment in our future. A bunch of construction in progress on the balance sheet and the right type of product for the future on some of the best pieces of real estate in some of the best markets in the country, our heads are down and we continue to execute. I look forward to spending more time with many of you in a couple weeks in Phoenix going through this and whatever else you would like to talk through. Now let me turn it over to Dan before opening up the lines for your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don and Leah. Good morning, everyone. Don covered a lot in his remarks so I will fill in just a few places as it relates to the third quarter and the balance of 2016. Then I want to spend some time going through a few specific areas that will help you with your modeling of Federal going forward. First the third quarter, the $1.41 of FFO per share and same-store NOI growth of 1.5% was fully in step with our expectations for the quarter. As Melissa specifically discussed in our second quarter call in August, same-store growth is expected to decelerate in the second half of 2017 with most of that concentrated in the third quarter. Now that was due not only to the difficult third quarter comp that we faced, but also due to the impact on occupancy and cash flow of our anchor repositioning activity. With portfolio occupancy at 93.1% at quarter end versus 95.1% at third quarter 2015, note that almost 150 of the 200 basis point diminution can be attributed to those eight anchor boxes that Don referenced in his remarks. The three A&Ps, the three Sports Authority's, Hudson Trail and Hancock Fabrics which were all in occupancy in 2015 were gone in third quarter of 2016. Also note that this vacancy totaling over 320,000 square feet is of highly productive centers located in dense in-fill markets, many of which we're redeveloping, re-merchandising like Assembly Square in Boston, Melville Mall on Long Island, Montrose Crossing in North Bethesda, Westgate in San Jose to name a few. Needless to say we feel very good about our ability to reposition these boxes effectively. Through the first three quarters of 2016 our same-store growth stands at 3%, 1.9% excluding redevelopment. We project fourth quarter to be in line with this run rate and expect same-store growth for the year to remain in the 3% area. Next, on the development front with respect to Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, contribution for the third quarter was $6 million, up from $4.9 million during the second quarter. Assembly Row Phase 1 is 100% leased and now is producing approximately 95% of its projected stabilized property operating income or POI. As Don mentioned, Pike & Rose Phase 1 is behind from a run rate perspective mostly driven by softness in effective rents at the PerSei and Palace apartments and currently we're closer to a 60% projected stabilized POI on a run rate basis. Although we're pleased to be hitting or occupancy projections with PerSei almost 98% leased and Palace almost 86% leased at quarter end. Further we continue to command a premium to the market of 10% to 15%. Out west at 500 Santana Row we're slightly ahead of plan and expect Splunk to open at the end of the fourth quarter. Just a reminder, this 234,000 square foot development is delivering a 9% cash on cost yield. Given the success at 500 Santana combined with the continued strong demand for office space in the submarket, we're moving forward with the development of 700 Santana Row, a 310,000 square foot office and retail development located at the end of Santana Row which will effectively finish off the street. We're projecting a stabilized cash on cost of 7% with projected delivery in 2019 and stabilization in 2021. Now, let me cover a few areas to provide additional clarity to your modeling of Federal going forward. As it relates to the core business and the impact of our anchor repositioning initiatives, we expect overall portfolio occupancy to stay at its current 93% through fourth quarter and remain at this level for most of 2017. We project occupancy will begin to improve at the end of 2017 and continue into 2019. With respect to the 730,000 square feet of anchor or near anchor vacancy in effect during the third quarter, 42% or 310,000 square feet is leased. Of that 310,000, 135,000 will be rent paying by the end of 2016 with start dates for the remaining 175,000 square feet coming on over the course of 2017 and into 2018. At this point, I would like to take a moment to highlight the new disclosure in our 8-K regarding Assembly Row, Pike & Rose as well as the recently added 700 Santana Row. In our supplemental information exhibit starting on page 16 we have added detail which provides annual guidance on the timing of property operating income at these developments as each of the phases grow toward stabilization. We have also included site plans on the following pages for both of these communities to provide you with a sense of the progress and the scale of these projects. And also to provide some context to the interconnection between the phases at each development. Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As you know, at the beginning of the third quarter we raised $250 million of 30-year unsecured notes at a REIT record yield for a 30-year of 3.75%. That issuance is now reflected in our quarter end metrics. Let me highlight a few of them. Net debt to EBITDA stands at 5.2 times, our average debt maturity remains at a sector leading 11-plus years and our weighted average interest rate is just above 4% with almost all of it fixed. On the equity side we raised $55 million of common stock through our ATM program during the quarter at an average price per share of $159.38 bringing our year-to-date total ATM issuance to $146 million. As a result of this activity, at quarter end we had cash on the balance sheet of $100 million and our $800 million credit facility was completely undrawn. From a capital standpoint this significant level of liquidity positions us well as we close out 2016 and head into 2017. As it relates to development and redevelopment, we expect to spend approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter and $400 million to $450 million in 2017. We will fund these capital requirements through a combination of cash on hand, free cash flow, opportunistic issuance under our ATM program and utilization on our line of credit which we expect to repay through a bond issuance in late 2017, early 2018 or sooner if an attractive window avails itself. This mix will be dictated by our objective of maintaining our debt to EBITDA ratio in the 5 to 5.5 times range. Finally on the acquisition front, while we don't have anything concrete we can report at the moment, we continue to pursue a number of compelling opportunities. While the market remains frothy from a valuation standpoint, we do see long term value in these opportunities and will be aggressive in our pursuit. With 13 years of investment experience in my previous seat I couldn't be more excited to bring that experience to Federal and work with Geoff Burkes and his acquisitions team on the West Coast and with Barry Carty and team as my partners on the East Coast, as well as with the entire Federal Realty investment committee. Lastly, before I turn it over to questions, I'd like to talk to you about my initial impressions from being here for almost three months from call it a new-to-Federal point of view. First and in my view most importantly, the understanding that the commercial real estate business is constantly changing and changing quickly, especially in retail, is ingrained into Federal's DNA. Federal's approach is proactive and dynamic; it does not approach filling vacancies simply to maintain occupancy and cash flow at a property but where it makes sense uses that vacancy to reposition, re-merchandise and redevelop the entire asset. Each decision that is made is made with a long term goal of ensuring that each center is relevant for the long term. Second, the real estate really is that good. Before coming to Federal I was aware that it had a best-in-class portfolio. In my first months here I've traveled the East and West Coast seeing about half of the portfolio so far and the properties are even better than I had imagined. Third, I am convinced that we're creating the right environments with the mixed-use properties that we're currently developing. I spent time at Assembly Row, Bethesda Row and Santana Row. And to give you a little insight into my personal life, I currently live at Pike & Rose, I work a block away and I spend the majority of my free evenings and many weekends at the property. So you could say I have done my due diligence, a real, live, work play experience and I couldn't be more confident in the communities we're creating at Pike & Rose and Assembly Row. Lastly, I have been truly impressed with the management here. It would be easy for senior management to sit back and simply rely up on the power of its best-in-class portfolio to grow, but there is foresight and dynamism in the way management is looking to implement its growth initiatives and is proactively making investments in its people, in its systems in order to make this happen. As you can imagine, I have been in the weeds during the first 2.5 months here digging into the details that support these initial observations, so I share them with you with confidence and conviction. I look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT and spending more time with each of you going forward to help you see what I am seeing at Federal. With that, operator, you can open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. You may begin. Haendel St. Juste: I bet you haven't been asked this one in a while, but given your historical valuation premium, but what a difference one quarter makes. So my question is, how are you thinking about stock buybacks these days with your stock now trading at a double-digit discount by our estimates NAV? And how are you currently thinking about buybacks versus other capital allocation alternatives? Don Wood : Haendel, this is a long term business and the notion of changing the capital spending plan and issuing equity versus buying equity, etc., etc., versus based on a three-month quarterly earnings point to me is not appropriate. We have capital needs that are very clear, very much in place and all value accretive. The notion of continuing the program where we're is what we believe. Now, for things that have not started -- for developments that have not started, the CocoWalk conversation that I had in my prepared remarks, etc., it's very possible that those -- the decision could start additional will depend on where the marketplace goes in 2017. But every single thing -- I mean, the big point of being disappointed by the guidance of where we're, for the most part, as I think is pretty clear to you, is necessary to create the value that we're creating. So the idea of doing a significant buyback at this point is off the table. Haendel St. Juste: And you mentioned getting rents 37% higher on the new -- the leases you are signing for the boxes, 42% of the space. Curious if you are expecting similar upside for the other remaining 60%-ish, how those conversations are going and when do you think you will have that space tied up? Don Wood : Yes, it is good stuff. I mean what I have got -- and we're going to talk through this in Phoenix to the extent there is more time to do that and the ability to do that -- have got a schedule that shows that whole 730,000 feet. I have got a schedule that shows the 309,000 of it, the 42% that is done already that shows the specific deals and the timing of those specific deals for the 37% rollover. The rents, I have got -- that schedule shows prospects and shows approximately where we think the rents would be. Approximately they wouldn't be at 37%, but they would be double-digit and maybe more than low-double-digits, maybe higher than that. But again, that is the process that we're going through. The most important thing you have to come away with on this is that these are part and parcel of bigger -- of shopping center repositionings as opposed to filling the boxes. And I just don't think that is really kind of understood as well as it should be. It is a value creative proposition here, not a defensive one. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Donnelly : I am curious on Pike & Rose, how do the net rents that you are now putting into 2017 guidance compare to what your original pro forma was? And maybe, Dan, can you kind of walk as through the timing of the NOI and FFO drag in your 2017 guidance at Pike & Rose just as it opens? I mean, just kind of one of the things here, like that pace and price of absorption and some of the other factors that are going on there. Don Wood : Yes, let me take the first part of that and, Dan, jump in on the second part of Jeff's question. One of the things we really wrestled with this time is pretty -- Washington DC in general pre-election kind of every year goes into a fold your hands and not do much kind of mode. And we have seen that in spades over the last three months, not only at Pike & Rose but anecdotally. Everything we hear with respect to not only any other residential project but other real estate projects, other decision making that happens has really slowed down. Now we want it to be -- we're 86% leased at Palace at about $2.40 a foot, Jeff. We expect that $2.40 a foot to grow, but far more modestly over the next couple of years than we had initially projected. So I think we're expecting that $2.40 through the next few years to go to something like $2.55 and initially that number was $2.85 or $2.90. So I want to do something for you for a second if you wouldn't mind and indulge me. And it relates to our residential operations and our ability to figure out how to do them. I think this is a good time to talk about it if you wouldn't mind. If you take a look at what has happened with us in Bethesda, what has happened with us at Santana Row, what's happened with us behind Congressional -- we know how to build residential and I think we do a really good job on it. If you were back in 2008 when we opened up Bethesda Row's upstairs product, 180 units there, we underwrite $2.55 and we hit $2.40 or $2.39 or something like that. So we missed those numbers in 2008 too and if you can imagine what 2008 was like, I think that is probably understandable. We're at $3.10 a foot today and that is an over 3% CAGR over that period of time in a market that also has a lot of additional supply. So the notion that -- and from my perspective, the prudence to take that 7% to 6% to 7% is simply a recognition of not only the supply in the market but what is happening to create that real street with the second phase right on top of the other. And accordingly, I just didn't feel right keeping that number where it was. But I am hoping that you don't view that as, well, my gosh, what in the world are these guys doing in residential. Take a look at Bethesda, take a look at the actual numbers in the West Coast, take a look at Congressional and I think you will feel a whole lot different about it. But that is where we're -- $2.40 to the mid-$2.50s or so over the period of time that we have got it as opposed to something that was much closer to $2.85 or $2.90. Jeff Donnelly : I don't know, Dan, if you have had anything to add on there? Dan Guglielmone : I think I will point you to -- in terms of the ramp up, we have added that additional disclosure on page 16 of our supplemental where we -- I think that gives a fairly good guidance with regards to how property operating income at Phase 1 of Pike & Rose will ramp up. We project kind of a stabilized $17.5 million property operating income on Phase 1 and we -- in 2017 our assumptions assume that we will get about 75% of that income in 2017. And it will progress into 2018 and stabilize in 2019 at that number. I think that that provides -- and I think for each of the phases that we have made an attempt to kind of give you that guidance, you can see how that ramp up progresses. Jeff Donnelly : And just sticking with Pike, where, Don, where are the retail rents that you are sort of achieving for Pike today compared to original pro forma? Have you seen sort of differing trends versus the residential? Just curious how that is sort of sorted out. Don Wood : Yes, that is a good question. Right where we expected them to be in that first phase, but even there a little slower than we had hoped. And the second phase, the big pieces that we have in place -- where is that schedule that has what was leased? The big stuff that we have on schedule; the smaller stuff that is to come will be weaker. So there will be a little diminution I expect on the retail rents that we're getting. In total on the project where we're today 48 plus 16 -- 64% of POI is already -- is basically leased or heavily under lease negotiations now and at 77% of the GLA. So a lot of it is locked in including the big important boxes that need to be there from Porsche to Pinstripes to H&M, Sur La Table, Lucky, REI, etc. Jeff Donnelly : And you kicked off condo sales at Assembly in I think Q2. How has the pace and price of sales there performed versus your expectation? Don Wood : Yes, the easy one to talk about is Assembly. We're kicking it. We have got like 55 of them already locked up way ahead of where we thought and ahead of the numbers that we thought we were going to get. And at Pike & Rose we're on pace, it is only -- I think we have got 19 or 20 of them effectively of 100 done and those have been done at or about where the underwriting was. That also though has slowed down, it has been the same kind of slow process over the last three months that we saw at -- we see in the rental product. So I am looking for this election to get over; I am looking for some sense of freedom, if you will, in the greater Washington DC markets, particularly Montgomery County. Jeff Donnelly : And just the last one and I will yield the floor. You guys have a lot on your plate going on. Are you still active in the acquisition market or are you kind of stepping back a little bit until all of this gets digested? Don Wood : It is not an on/off switch as we've talked about before, it is a knob. And you turn it up as those markets look more attractive, you turn it down as they look less attractive. Certainly the stuff we have been looking at when you start talking about forecast and low forecast on a lot of this stuff is hard for us to make sense of. We absolutely remain in the market, we're on a couple of things right now that if they make I think are a real positive but we have got a ways to go to see if they can make. But again, it is not and on off switch, it is been deemphasized because you compare it to the premiums even at 6% obviously that you are getting in development. Operator : Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. You may begin. Christy McElroy : Maybe I missed this, but what is your overall same-store NOI growth guidance for 2017? And just in thinking about the trajectory of that growth rate through the year given the expectation that some of the anchor re-leasing will commence sort of midyear toward yearend, presumably you start to face much easier comps year over year. But in addition to the closings that have occurred, are you expecting further closings next year? So, done -- proactively pursued or otherwise, as you said in the release? Dan Guglielmone : Well, I will take the first piece of that first. With regards to our [indiscernible] of what is embedded in same-store guidance for next year. Given some of the volatility and just the amount of moving pieces in our anchor repositioning initiatives, we think that kind of staying in line with this year, kind of a 3% area is what we have in our model. There are a couple of boxes that we project will be coming back. One is already re-leased. The AC Moore box at Assembly Row which effectively we proactively went after, it is still occupied and they will vacate at the end of the year. That space will be vacant for most of 2017 until Trader Joe's takes a big chunk of it. Don Wood : Same with Bay Club here at Santana Row which is being converted out and transferred to another use. It is going to be a very big closet, but it is going to come out in 2017. So that process is and I think should continue. Net-net you should see increases overall, particularly as you get into the latter part of the year, though. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just a follow-up on Jeff's question, you talked about slower growth, expecting slower growth in residential rent at Phase 1 of Pike & Rose. But are you actually expecting there to be any rolldown of resi rents at Palace or PerSei over the next year or so? And maybe you can give some color on how the retail and restaurants are performing in the midst of all the construction. Don Wood : Yes. No, we don't expect rents to roll down at Palace and PerSei. In fact, one of the things that has been very clear is they continue to command a premium in the marketplace and that is a real important fact. We're not going to see -- I don't think we're going to see the increases that I had hoped that we were going to see as the rest of the supply in the marketplace dissipated a little bit given the construction that is underway. The construction has absolutely impacted the Phase 1 restaurants a little bit. The restaurants are doing fine, just not great. The retailers are not doing well until that second phase opens up. So there is clearly softness throughout Pike & Rose. But it is funny, you have got both Milam and you have got Guglielmone who both live there and spend their time there. And every single time they come in and say, don't worry about it, we're cooking in terms of getting it right. Also with respect to the construction and how that is moving along, we're moving along on time and on budget which I am really pleased about. So that the -- and when you look at who is coming here, REI is not adding new space; REI is relocating from two miles away or a mile and a half away to a place that is a whole lot better in terms of what they believe their future customer is, the same with Porsche, the same with a number of the restaurants and retailers that we're talking about for Phase 2. So what we're seeing -- and that makes me really happy because it is not adding more retail supply into the marketplace, it is relocating the better tenants to a better product. That is what you should expect as we move forward. But we have got to get Phase 2 open. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. You may begin. Mike Mueller : Question on the disruption I guess at Pike & Rose. How come we keep hearing about the disruption there but we don't necessarily hear about it at Assembly? What is unique to Pike & Rose where it is becoming more of an issue than it is at Assembly? Don Wood : It is really clear, it is really easy to say, the market stinks compared to Assembly. So you have construction -- same thing going on at Assembly, but you have got a very strong residential market. You have power right through to the extent human beings are coming in deciding where they are going to live compared to what their supply choices are. At Pike & Rose in Montgomery County, we don't have that luxury. There are other choices; there are other places. There was lower rent, bad debt alternatives that you can take given the environment that is there. If you just think about that in so many different ways, when you have a strong market, some of the stuff that is happening out here in Silicon Valley and we're having this call from Silicon Valley today [indiscernible]. It's just blowing me away the things people will do and put up with when there is limited supply in the marketplace, it just doesn't matter. There is a lot of choice in the markets, it does. Mike Mueller : Okay. And then for that second bucket where you are walking through for the 2017 bridge and you talked about the development and value creation drag. How much of that $0.06 to $0.10 is really tied to the Miami kicking off those projects as opposed to Pike & Rose and Assembly? Don Wood : Yes, it is a couple of cents in Miami. We really thought should we put that in guidance, should we talk about that. But here is what is happening in Miami. Let's talk about that for a few minutes. The easier of the two to talk about is CocoWalk. CocoWalk -- the dilution that would come from CocoWalk is part of a plan that would knock down part of the shopping center and affectively redevelop physically a big part of the shopping center. And obviously -- from demolition cost to lost rents to disruption, obviously that is dilutive. To the extent we can't get the numbers to work -- and again, that will come through investment committee next year -- we won't do that. But I did not want to not include that in guidance to the extent that we can get to it. Over at Sunset it is a different story. At Sunset -- there is a broken property. We have known that from the beginning, we had some nice income and FFO from that property in the first couple years that we had it. But obviously that income stream is being reduced as the conversation of a redeveloped property becomes very clear and as tenants sit there and don't perform. So there we know we have got at least another year of entitlement work to do to be able to get to what is a much more significant redevelopment. We're not -- the only impact in 2017 will be a slowly shrinking income stream over there. So most of what we're talking about here is CocoWalk and a little bit of Sunset in 2017. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. You may begin. Paul Morgan : Just going to the 700 Santana that you talked about 2019 opening and 2021 stabilization. Obviously in the case of the Splunk site there it was pre-leased. Could you give any kind of color about how you think about the tenancy for 700 Santana, how much you would look to pre-lease, how kind of chunky it might be? Jeff Berkes : Remember on 500 Santana Row we did not pre-lease that building. We started at spec and after construction was underway we leased 100% of the building. So just want to make sure you understand that. Before I get into specifics on how we intend to approach the leasing of 700 let me tell you what 700 is. 500 Santana Row was adding an office building to Santana Row and a bunch of parking spaces that we can use nights and weekends. 700 is a lot more than that. With 700 Santana Row we're capping off the end of Santana Row. And really for all intents and purposes, except for our last residential project over on the east side of the site, we're finishing Santana Row. So 700 Santana Row is some 30,000 square feet or about that of additional retail and a restaurant on the ground floor with a magnificent plaza in front of it that is really going to complete how Santana looks and feels. And it is a 1,300 space parking garage which is going to significantly add to the parking pool at the end of the street and help us drive rents and sales for the south end of Santana Row. So, unlike 500 Santana, it is not just a spec office building, it is kind of a signature development that really caps off and finishes 700 Santana -- or finishes Santana Row. Now, as it relates to the lease up of the office space, we're already out in the market, it is way early, we already have a couple of nibbles which are exciting. But leasing really will kick off in earnest, like it does with every building in Silicon Valley, when there is actually a hole in the ground and construction activity and that is not going to be until sometime next year. As we get into the year and we start to do tours and field interest in the building we will be making a decision about whether we look to lease that building 100% to one tenant or whether we break it up. When we leased 500 we were very intent on leasing that building to one tenant. 700 we will have to wait and see. I think there is a higher likelihood we go multitenant at 700 which is why you are seeing an extended stabilization period vis-a-vis a building like 500. Don Wood : The only thing, Paul, I would add to that is that -- and we had our Board out here and Jeff and I have been talking about it ad nauseam, is the requirement by tenants here, just like everywhere else in the country, to be in places that are fully amenitized and really environmentally friendly to what they are is huge. And the notion of the -- finishing up the back parts looking straight down Santana Row has a whole lot of appeal to a whole lot of office developers. And there is no other product that's gone -- that can be like that which is what we heard from Splunk which is why that [indiscernible] by the way validates this, in addition to AvalonBay having their West Coast headquarters here, in addition to --. Jeff Berkes : Cushman & Wakefield. Don Wood : Cushman & Wakefield, there is 300 Santana Row that is fully leased. So this is becoming or has become a far more validated office location. Of all the possible places to put offices at Santana Row that is the best spot. So with considering all of that we decided to move forward. Jeff Berkes : Yes as you look through the supply pipeline, Paul, in the market right now there is really only one other sort of amenitized place where office tenants can go. And by the time we're leasing 700 that option may go away and we may be the only amenitized place. But regardless nobody has got the amenities we do. And like Don said, that is hugely, hugely important, to all the companies, tech and non-tech, in this market to recruit and retain employees. So we're pretty bullish on it. Paul Morgan : I don't know if I missed it or not, but did you give the cost and yield target? Jeff Berkes : Yes, it is in the 8-K on page 16. Paul Morgan : Okay, I will take a look, thanks. So my other question then on -- going back to Pike & Rose, just bigger picture. If you kind of think about, you have had a lot of the mixed use projects and some kind of you have gone more all in and Pike & Rose you started more modestly. A lot of this is case-by-case and market-by-market, but in retrospect as you look at Pike & Rose, would you have tried to structure Phase 1 a little bit differently or was it just an issue in terms of the residential market there and kind of you still think the phasing was right? Don Wood : Paul, hindsight is a tough way to look at things, there is no question about it that, given everything I know, we would've probably put the money that is in the residential building in Palace on the retail street first, at least I would have done that. We have some disagreement within the Company whether that made sense because at the time we did what we did for a very good reason. And that was the existing shopping center that was there which we did not disturb during the initial phase, was extremely productive. And effectively allowed us to move some of the tenants from that shopping center into the new shopping center like la Madeleine. So there would good reasons to do it, but it is important to have enough critical mass on the street to be able to create the environment. Now, if the residential market had stayed as strong as it was none of this would have mattered. And back to Mike Mueller's question before, the residential would have powered right through without the environment on the street fully created. But when you have a weakness in the marketplace there is no question that the reliance on or the help of the established retail street is a critical component. I don't know if that helps or not but that is what happened. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. You may begin. Craig Schmidt : Looking at Pike & Rose and I guess Palace specifically, how much value is embedded in the top floors versus the rest of the building? So you may be 80% -- 86% leased but how much of that top floors -- is that value related to the rest of the building? Don Wood : That is a good question, Craig. There is no question that the top floors and we have got, I don't know, 20 units, 12 left? 12 left to go up there. It is disproportionately higher. Those units have been slower going, that is part of the math in me feeling uncomfortable with the 7 number that was left there. So you are onto an important part of it. Basically, the lower floors and the cheaper rents have more price sensitivity in a weaker market effectively than we had hoped. So I can't do a percentage for you, but I will tell you that the preponderance of units left are in those upper floors and that that does -- we don't believe we're going to get the rents that we wanted to get to up there and particularly in the first roll or two. Craig Schmidt : Okay and then just thinking about Pike & Rose in total, how much value is assigned to retail, office, resi and then other? Don Wood : Gosh, I don't have that here. But, listen, man and you will never get me to think differently on this. These projects are integral, they are integrated projects. The retail is critical to the resi, the office is critical to the retail all the way around. So we look at them as total projects. So I don't have the pieces here. I suspect we will have it -- we can have it there for you in Phoenix. But you will never get me to suggest that those things would be looked at separately. Craig Schmidt : And then just real quickly, in terms of the anchor closings, how many would you put in the bankruptcy bucket and how many would you put in your proactive repositioning bucket? Don Wood : It is about half-and-half. I am looking in total, I have got spaces that are a couple of sixes. We're breaking them up, they are part of bigger redevelopment. So it is not as pure and as clear as you would like them there. But I would say about half-and-half. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neil. You may begin. Alexander Goldfarb : Just a question for you, you guys have obviously spent a lot of time thinking about the redevelopment projects that you are rolling out. You have a lot that you have done over the years with experience of Santana and Assembly and others. And it sounds like the residential -- like we understand that the residential Montgomery is more, so that is pressuring the rents on the residential side. But can you just walk through why the retail would be pressured there? Is that purely because some of the retail that leases at the smaller spaces is sort of directly attributing to how the residential is going and then those are amenity based and they are saying, hey, if the people aren't here I am not going to pay the rent? Or just help us walk through how those two are intertwined. Don Wood : Well, I guess what I would say to you -- and Chris is here, I don't know if he would -- I assume he will add on to what I say. But the reality is today and we have been talking about this for a while, retailers -- and this includes the boxes, this includes small people -- small shop, it includes really most categories -- are a whole lot more cautious with their underwriting and they are a whole lot more -- the negotiations are more retail centric than they are landlord centric at the moment in a number of places. And when it comes to development the ability to underwrite sales in a new development is less predictable. So if the market is softer and I do believe the market generally is softer from the standpoint of propensity to take risks and it certainly is in the Washington DC area, then you underwrite lower numbers. Lower numbers at lower rent, lower rent is a harder negotiation, it takes longer to do and it also includes the other terms associated with it. That is really what it is about from my perspective as I sit and say it. The other thing and you see it up in Assembly to the other -- going the other way, when you have got a big sample size of a first phase retail project there and that first phase is very successful it makes it a whole lot easier to lease that second phase. We don't have a big sample size in the first phase of Pike & Rose and that goes a little bit back to the question that was asked before. And accordingly it is -- you have got tougher economics to negotiate here. Having said that, I just don't -- I don't want to -- I can't over emphasize enough the fact that the anchor system in the second phase is done and is critical to the project. So even if rents are a little lower in the remaining small shop space, that is not -- it is not a big cause for the differential in the yield. Chris Weilminster : I would just add -- I would add on exactly what Don said and I would just remind you we have got 1 million feet on Rockville Pike, we need to make sure that we differentiate our projects. Pike & Rose is truly unique and authentic to anything else we own on Rockville Pike. The fact that we're almost 80% leased on our retail in the Phase 2 GLA is fantastic. So just keep all of that in mind as you are talking through that. As we get more strength as the street is open, as the experience can be more of a full experience for the consumer it is only going to get stronger. Alexander Goldfarb : Right. Yes. No, look you go to the site, you can see that. But I guess the question is, Don, from what -- when you guys talked about sort of at NAREIT and in second quarter when you revised down the yield expectations until now and now they are being revised down. I guess is it just that the market has been continued soft so therefore that has impacted the retail discussions more? And then the second part of that is for Dan G., should we expect then with the delay through 2019 until stabilization, does that mean that this project weighs on earnings until then? Or there are other things in the Company that will act as offset, so it is not as though mentally we think about Pike & Rose weighing on the Company through 2019, but it is that it takes longer to stabilize but there are other positive offsets to that within the total organization? Don Wood : The Phase 1/Phase yield reductions are largely residential. Don't make a big deal about the retail, it is not that, that is the answer to the first part of the question. The second part of the question is Pike & Rose is accretive to the Company. It is not weighing down the Company. We're talking about a value additive project here. And if you look year-over-year, I mean they gave you the numbers of the income that has contributed from this project and that continues to go up. So it was not that at all. And certainly when coupled with the anchor lease up, when coupled with the opening of Splunk and other development projects, when coupled with the redevelopments all the way through that the total Company continues. And as I started to say at the beginning of my remarks, our business plan is flat on right where we thought it was going to be in total over that long term. So, you clearly have a soft period of time here and from an accounting perspective, if you will, a cash flow perspective relative to value creation, but not from a long term value creation perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from George Hoglund with Jefferies. You may begin. George Hoglund : Just one question in terms of kind of medium term strategy\u00b8want to look past the current projects. Kind of what is your appetite to do further projects or take back certain anchor space that will cause near term drag? Because I fully get the longer term value creation here. But what is that appetite to take more space back, things that will cause that near term drag to where, okay, 2017 growth will be muted, but then if you do more projects will then 2018 be muted as well because of these longer term value creation projects? Don Wood : George, it is such a great question and it so gets down to the balance of the business plan. And I tried to address this in my remarks as best I could, the combination of all of the things, including the decentralization which is really working well as it relates to getting to redevelopment and getting the focus. Those things, as you have pointed out, are dilutive in the short term. There is a lot of it, there is no doubt about that. It is happening at the same time that the two major development projects, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, are coming up to the heavy construction phases which are also dilutive. So all of those things happening at the same time have the balance, moves down to 4% growth rather than 6% or 7% growth or as they are coming out 8% or 9%. If we don't do any more, George, you are looking at 8% and 9% earnings growth. The notion of getting there but not having additional future raw material doesn't excite me. So I suspect what you will see is heads down and executing what we have, a slow down at the period of new raw material for new projects for the bulk of 2017 to allow us to get back into balance. But this long term business plan includes those initiatives as the way that we create value. So you will see them. I am not going to tell you every year you have to wait until next year, you have to wait until the year after that, you have to wait until the year after that for earnings because that is not fair to do and it is not what our anticipation is. You should see an acceleration in 2018, you should see an acceleration in 2019 of the earnings growth rate. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. You may begin. Chris Lucas : Just a couple of quick questions, Dan, just going back to the same-store NOI guidance for next year that you softly provided. Is that inclusive or exclusive redevelopment? And just trying to understand whether or not things like CocoWalk would be included in your thoughts or not? Dan Guglielmone : Yes, that is inclusive of redevelopment. And, yes, we're including CocoWalk in that number which obviously will have a negative impact on that number and that is why --. There is a lot going on; I think with our anchor repositioning, with including CocoWalk and Sunset, but that 3% is something we're -- area is something we're comfortable with. Chris Lucas : And then just do you have any maybe additional color on guidance as to what relates to maybe G&A? Dan Guglielmone : G&A for next year is going to be call it $36 million, $37 million, roughly about $9 million a quarter. Chris Lucas : And then last question, Don, the development exposure, at least as it relates to CIP, is continuing to move higher as you guys put more money into projects that will deliver revenue down the road. Do you have a sense as to what peak CIP levels will be? And then when you think about how you manage risk what are you comfortable with and how do you measure that risk as it relates to the amount of development that is in progress? Don Wood : Yes, that is a very fair question, Chris. And by the way, CIP at the end of the fourth quarter will be lower than CIP at the end of the third quarter as we put the Splunk building into service. And that is, for all intents and purpose, a stabilized building. So the notion that it will continue to always rise is not what you should be assuming. Basically at the end of the day 10% of the value of this Company with respect to big development is what I feel comfortable with and not more than that. In fact, if you sit back and you take a look at -- take a look over the last three years, you will see that we peaked even higher than we're today a couple of years ago, I can't remember [indiscernible] -- remember what year it was, 2013 -- when effectively we had all the Phase 1s that were not yet in service but going. So you are seeing this heavy construction in the Phase 2s right now. Those things, as they are put into service, will reduce the CIP. And I don't think -- I think the way you should look at it is debt to EBITDA coverage which we're very comfortable with in the low to mid-5s, fixed charge coverage through the roof is kind of why we have refunded a bunch of this development in the form of reducing our leverage in the Company, terming out for 30 years what we got. But on a broad basis, Chris, look at 10% of the enterprise value as kind of our rough estimate of the math. It is really much more limited by our debt coverage, though and our fixed charge coverage and what we place into service. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Leah Andress for closing remarks. Leah Andress : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We do have a few additional meeting slots open for NAREIT. If you would like to meet with the team, please reach out to me directly. We look forward to seeing many of you in two weeks at the conference. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

Given the number of participants on the call we kindly ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to rejoin the queue and we\u2019ll happy to answer them. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end results. Don? Donald Wood : Thank you, Leah. Good morning and happy Valentine's Day, everybody. A real solid quarter for us with FFO per share of $1.45, the highest quarterly earnings we ever reported and 6% better than last year's fourth quarter which at the time was our highest quarterly earnings we ever reported. We ended 2016 year with FFO per share of $5.65, 6% better than 2015. We feel comfortable to hit this point reaffirming our 2017 FFO per share guidance range of $5.83 to $5.93 despite plenty of uncertainty surrounding the changing policies of the administration coming out of Washington. So let\u2019s dig into the quarter for a bit. Same-store property operating income rose 3% in the quarter as it did for the year, and perhaps more importantly, total property income rose 7.4%, reflecting the progress we are making on the income generation side of our new profits, more on that in a few minutes. So far as leasing goes, we did 77 comparable deals for 275,000 square feet at an average rent of $37.10 in the quarter, 15% higher than the tenants they replaced as cash basis; last year the old lease versus the first year the new lease. When you look back at the entire 2016 year, it was amazingly and unusually consistent. Lease rollovers up 13% in the first quarter; 12% in the second; 14% in the third; and 15% in the fourth. All totaling nearly1.5 million square feet of comparable space compared with $1.4 million the year before. Add to that 214,000 square feet of non-comparable leasing on the new products in 2016 compared with 188 the year before and you can see the plenty of productive leasing continues to be executed. The business was solid, despite overall retail headwinds and deals taking longer to get done. We ended the year at 94.4% leased there are only 93.3% occupied indicative of the signed deals for which rent is yet to start and is good news for later in the year and 2018. After the quarter was over, we also executed two leases that continued the important progress in our anchor vacancy lease up initiative including the former Sports Authority space at Crow Canyon Commons and San Ramon, California and the former Hancock Fabrics space and Westgate Shopping Center at San Jose, California. Both the Sports Authority and the Hancock Fabrics spaces were leased to far better uses for the long-term relevance of properties in both a healthy increases to the prior tenant. Crow Canyon Commons and Westgate Center are being repositioned. We merchandised and transformed into modern and relevant retail destination for decades to come. Rent will commence on those two deals into late 2017 in one case and mid-2018 and the other as the occupancy in the re-positionings are all completed and tied together. Of course, this property investment initiatives and a number of our properties will continue and always result in some dilutiona to our redevelopment. Right now that leaves us with two vacant, Sports Authority boxes left incorporate, it\u2019s the property repositions. One, Brick Plaza in New Jersey, the other is Assembly Square Marketplace, Somerville. Active negotiations with multiple tenants at both, but both vacancies are being integrated with broader property redevelopment, so they're not done yet. So we do expect them to be done this year. The earnings drag from those two spaces alone is almost $0.03 a share annually. On the acquisition front, you may have noticed press release that we put our last week announcing the ground lease that we purchased under 15 acres in a Sears, Marshalls and CVS anchored shopping center, right off 210 in Pasadena, California. We bought it at a six cap. This Sears paying virtually no rent and while we have no direct path toward getting to that box today, we're patience and optimistic that we will. In the meantime, consider than other yielding LAN play in our portfolio. It does feel like attractive acquisition candidates are potentially becoming more plentiful as they\u2019ve been in recent history. So not at better prices, at least not in the markets we're most interested in or at the properties were most interest today. We hope that more to share with you on acquisition front for next few quarters. In the development pipeline, lots of solid news, Assembly Row continues to perform extremely well really cementing itself as substantial and important live, work, play shop environment. They\u2019re now over 300 or 400 partner\u2019s employees working there up from 1,800 last quarters and the daytime traffic increase is palpable. Adding a boutique hotel, condos our own residential offerings and a larger and richer retail experience will only enhance it. Construction of Phase 2 remains on time and budget 66 of the 107 market rate condos are under binding contracts and we'll start leasing the apartments this summer. If you find yourself involved in the spring, check our Assembly and then are being created really private. In Maryland, Pike & Rose continues to progress. I will not at the pace of Assembly Row, due to weaker Washington DC markets, particularly Montgomery County. We just as confident and its long-term value creation by year-end the residential product was over 96% lease, but only 90% occupied, so income will build there during there year. And office and retail, we\u2019re now 100% leased and occupied. We've been important objective here by getting ourselves in the strongest position possible in terms of leasing before beginning to open pieces of the next phase earlier this year. We'll see how that goes when we start to residential in early summer. 21 of the 99 condos are under binding contract, again certainly not at the peak of Assembly, but where we expected to be at this point. And importantly cost and scheduled for the second phase, remain on budget. Work continues to get CocoWalk investment committee later this year for approval to move forward with this redevelopment as does our plans for variant shopping center, 700 Santana Row [broke ground] a few weeks back. The core beliefs throughout our Company is that investment and great real estate is increasingly necessary to position if it relevant in the next decade, consumers are demanding high levels of service, consumers are demanding an environment to spend time in that their choice, not a necessary evil. You don't have to look any further than the predicament many department stores are in today, consumer behavior is changing at an accelerated phase. It is our strong view that under investing in great real estate today for the purpose of generating higher current cash flow, with the expense of the properties longer-term relevant is extremely short side. So I would just not going to passed up on opportunities to re-merchandise, redevelop and reposition shopping centers for long-term sustainability even though it hurts short-term earnings. So I'll take a holistic view of our portfolio and our portfolio and are actively working to better position each and every one of them in places where we can, you'll see a look for other ways to heart has value. So that's it for my prepared remarks. We've got a lot going on around here, and a huge investment in our future, nearly $600 million of construction in progress on the balance sheet, in the right type of product for the future, some of the best pieces of real estate, some of the best markets in the country. In addition to that, acquisition opportunities maybe opening up that allows us to apply our core competencies to add value there. We surely never take for granted a balance sheet that some set up over the last few years that provide flexibility and cushion when things don't go exactly as planned. Now let me we turn it over to Dan for opening up the lines for your questions. Daniel Guglielmone : Thank you, Don and Leah and hello everyone. Don covered almost everything in his remarks, which should surprise no one on the call. Let me provide some additional color. Despite continuing to work in the drag towards by our excess anchor vacancy same-store NOI growth was solid, as we put a 3% for the quarter and 3.1% for the full-year, which is in line with the guidance we provided previously. Please note that the same-store pool of assets, which includes those under redevelopment, represents 93% of our total POI for the quarter. Lease up at Pike & Rose residential increased markedly over the quarter at 96% overall. Although, those revenue gains were somewhat offset by higher marketing costs in the quarter into the final push to achieve full occupancy. As a result, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row contributed $6 million for the fourth quarter versus $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. As it relates to 2017, the new disclosure, we introduced in our third quarter 8-K relating to the progress we are making at each of these development is unchanged. Assembly Row Phase I, is running at 100% of stabilized POI and Pike & Rose Phase I is on track to deliver 75% of projected stabilized POI in 2017. The Phase IIs are on budget, are on schedule to begin contributing POI in 2018. At 500 Santana Row in early December, Splunk moved into its recently delivered 234,000 square-foot headquarters building. We are already seeing the benefits of increased daytime population and traffic at Santana. Our 2017 FFO guidance provided last quarter of 583 to 593 remains unchanged. We also reiterate our expectation for the same-store growth in 2017 of around 3%. This guidance reflects the continuing efforts to reposition our portfolio to outperform of the long-term in a rapidly changing retail environment. While we don't provide specific quarterly FFO guidance, we do expect first quarter 2017 FFO per share to be lower than fourth quarter 2016 driven impart by a step up in our anchor repositioning strategies, which I will touch upon in a moment. As relates to our anchor leasing, in addition to the deals that Don mentioned, we continue to aggressively look to reposition and re-merchandise our portfolio by proactively upgrading our tenant mix. At Santana Row this quarter, we are preemptively taking back third floor health club space, terminating the current tenant and converting the 34,000 square feet, which has great bonus of [indiscernible]. Publicly traded technology innovator Broadsoft will move in during 2018. While compelling from an economic perspective, this lease is also a testament to the power of having great real estate. This location, combined with the immunity base and sense of place we have curated at Santana Row over the last 15 years, allows us to considerable terms of uses such as office, which currently command rents at a significantly higher than comparably located upper floor retail, plus, we received the added benefit of increased population. On the heals of this success, we are moving forward on the conversion of 32,000 square feet of vacant second floor health club space at Pentagon Row on Arlington, Virginia, where we hope to produce similar results. Other examples of proactively upgrading our tendency can be seen. At Assembly Square where traded euros will open in late 2017 at a healthy up tick in rent replacing AC Moore who vacated in early January at Westgate in San Jose where you will see us replace two non-credit apparel tenants in early 2018 with TJ Maxx taking possession later in the year, and in Santa Monica where Addidas will replace Express. As you would expect these preemptive re-merchandising initiatives creates short-term drag on occupancy and cash flow in 2017 and 2018 due to downtime as we deliver the space to tenants. However, this activity will make the assets more relevant to the consumer provide cash flow growth and provide long-term value creation. Further demonstrating our balanced business plan, we are thrilled with the West Coast teams\u2019 acquisition in Pasadena that Don outlined earlier. It will be an attractive addition to our West Coast portfolio providing a strong yield, the low market in-place rents and an additional 274,000 square feet on 15 acres, raw material to potentially drive longer-term growth in our portfolio. However, it will not materially increase FFO per share in the near-term solely due to its relative size. Accretion will be less than a penny, so it will not impact our 2017 guidance. Now to the balance sheet. We finished 2016 continuing to have strong liquidity position with our $800 million credit facility completely undrawn. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at a comfortable 5.25 times for the quarter and our fixed charge ratio remained steady at 4.5 times. From a capital standpoint, during 2017, we project to spend approximately $400 million to $450 million in development, redevelopment and releasing and $30 million for our recently completed Pasadena acquisition. We expect to fund this capital through a combination of free cash flow draws on our lines of credit and opportunistic issuances on our ATM program. On unsecured notes offering still slated for late 2017 or early 2018. We did modestly utilize our ATM program during the fourth quarter, leasing $29 million at an average price of $1.41 per share. Now let's stay on this topic for a moment. One of the things I\u2019ve come to appreciate in my first six months on the job here at Federal is appreciating federal skilled management of its balance sheet. As I work through the refinancing of our mortgage at Plaza El Segundo, which should be completed in early June, a new tenure loan with a rate inside of 4% I realized that we do not have another sizable debt maturity until late 2019, almost three years away. I then began looking back over the last five years I have noticed a meaningful average spend on development, redevelopment and another property investment of roughly $350 million annual. That\u2019s roughly $1.7 billion in total and another $500 million in acquisitions. Federal\u2019s funding of these investments included $1 billion of equity, 700 million of 30-year debt at a 4.2% blended rate and roughly $350 million from free cash flow and asset sales. As a result, over this five-year period, we have maintained debt-to-EBITDA steadily in the 5.2 to 5.4 times range. We have increased our fixed charge coverage from 3.2 to 4.5 times, achieved an A minus rating from all three major credit rating agencies and we've lengthened our weighted average debt maturity to a current 10.5 years along the way producing FFO growth and a rock solid five-year CAGR of 7.2%. Truly impressive track record of stability and consistency further evidences of our long-term focus and commitment to a balanced business plan. Now before we start with the Q&A, I'd like to congratulate my colleague Craig Klimisch, Federal's Controller and his promotion of Vice President. Clearly a recognition of value he brings not only to me and my partner Melissa Solis, but to the finance and accounting function as a whole and to the entire Federal organization, well deserved Craig. And with that, operator you can open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Donnelly : Good morning, guys. Actually Don, I don't mean to gloss over the upcoming investment and work ahead of your Pike & Rose and Assembly, but maybe is the bigger question is that for many years, I'll call the mega projects like those as well as Santana have been the focus for investors and your organization. But in a little over a year or so from now you're going to be in the final innings of the Phase II investments there. And I'm just wondering what seeds your planting today and how that bodes for that period beyond 2018. I'm just curious if you think going forward we should expect a similar type of commitment to these kind of chunkier projects or do you see yourself cycling more to smaller projects or even more external growth? Donald Wood : That\u2019s a great question, Jeff. I appreciate you\u2019re asking it. It\u2019s funny. While I absolutely agree that Pike & Rose and Assembly get the most attention and the things that sit up on top of the Company. You got to know how hard I try to fight to make sure that everybody understands the balance of this $15 billion portfolio of real estate. So I never want to gloss over that we do with core and the redevelopment. Having said that, without question, we also talk about Pike & Rose and Assembly as being a decade long project, and so certainly in the case of Pike & Rose with the second phase opening up, starting later this year and then into the next. We still have a ton more entitlements to do; we have a bunch more to do the same thing at Assembly. So thinking about those two projects as time being done from a value creation perspective is way too premature. On top of that sitting and looking at what we'll be doing with CocoWalk, sitting and looking at what we're doing on the West Coast at Santana with $200 million plus project at the end of the street effectively there, sunset, a little bit further down the road, but coming after that. And inside our company the amount of redevelopments has never been higher and so the combination of using all those arrows in the quiver from the larger projects to the smaller redevelopments to the core, it's all really important. So don't think about Pike & Rose and Assembly as being done after 2018, please. In addition, when you see the type of acquisitions we've made, what we bought, when we bought San Antonio center a number of years ago, if you were at that property today, you would be as sure as we are that there is a whole lot much more to do there and maybe that will be done in one big way, more likely it will be done in phases until it ultimately is a mega project, if you will. Similarly, when we look at what we just bought at Hastings. It's all about big pieces of land that really should be a whole lot more than they are today. Obviously, it takes time to get to them and I know it\u2019s a long winded answer. But I wanted to give you a full and complete answer of all the tools that we have in a toolbox. Jeffrey Donnelly : Just to clarify maybe not done, but I guess is it fair to say that. Beyond these two projects will begin to see your development and redevelopment pipeline becoming maybe broader in each asset being maybe a little bit smaller in scale, little less chunky? Donald Wood : Until the next great mega project makes a lot of sense for us to do. I mean so as I sit here today and look at that. Yes, I would expect it to be if you will broader and less chunky. But the right opportunity avails itself at San Antonio center or Hastings Ranch or at Pike 7 and I go back on what I\u2019ve said. So it's about finding the right risk adjusted project and everyone separate projects of size because obviously it's a whole lot different thing to be talking about $1 billion investment on one piece of land or more. So just by definition, how many of those things there are, it's likely to be smaller, but I don't want to count out that possibility of finding the next one. Jeffrey Donnelly : And just one last question, is just many of the assets you guys have historically targeted I've been privately held for an extended period, with all the discussions that are going on out there right now, but changes in tax policy around 1031 elimination or deductibility of interest. Are you finding any rumblings from owners being more willing sellers or is it just too early to know? Donald Wood : Well I will say, I mean I don't know if that's it. Listen there is no question that this new administration and whatever happens with respect to tax reform and not just 1031 depreciation rules, it's the board of tax that retailers will have to pay. I mean there's a lot of stuff out there that could impact the real estate business that time and so having a presentation by NAREIT and by our own efficiencies is critically important. And that\u2019s up even talk about changes to immigration law, what it does in California, retaliation [indiscernible] there is a lot out there. So there is no question that there is more uncertainty in our business as I think about looking forward in the next year, 18 months, two years than there\u2019s been. And that has to impact the way sellers think about their real estate. I will tell you what we have seen as we have seen more opportunities for acquisitions. What we have not seen is any weakening in the pricing that does that those sellers expect. I don't expect that the change in any of the locations. Jeffrey Donnelly : Okay. Thanks Don. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler, O'Neill. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey good afternoon. Don, just two questions here. First is maybe just following up on Jeff\u2019s. As you guys have been restocking the redevelopment kitty for some time, Darien a few years ago, Coco, the latest one in Pasadena. As you guys stockpile these and work through entitlement, so whether it\u2019s in entitlements are trying to get at the actual box itself. How long do you say that you work on something versus you say, look, we've tried this thing, we're not getting where we want to go and it\u2019s time now to put the asset on the market and move on? Donald Wood : Well, there is not \u2013 I\u2019m not able to say to you again nine months 14 days, three hours and two minutes Alex, but it \u2013 and I\u2019m trying to be thesis there and trying to say we have a local teams that as you know by focusing on smaller portfolios within this Company. Clearly within that they need to prioritize where they spend their time with \u2013 I mean Darien is a great example. We're still not there completely with Darien, its taken time. But we are running the assets anyway that we own. The teams are there anyway. And so everyone of the assets, whether it's something we've just bought or something that we've held for 20 years, but it\u2019s been tied up with leases and things that restrict what we can do or all under that the pressure here to be able to create value in real estate. So there are clearly times as have happened where we have a base in a specific development plan because they haven't panned out. The latest one I could point to would be for our shopping center, where we really thought we'd be able to do a pretty comprehensive residential plan there and that's just not panning out the way it is, so it will remain a retail property. And so that conversation happens in each of these small groups and then up through investment committee on a regular basis. And that frankly is why we're able to turnover in my view as much as we do with a really reasonable size team here. We get to a lot of development and redevelop. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question is, as you guys talked to tenants and there seems to be obviously more interchange from mall tenants going to open-air, maybe some of the larger open-air going to the malls. Do the tenants think of it like a linear relationship, so if their occupancy cost goes up by 2x, they expect sales to go up by 2x or vice versa if they're willing to trade to lower cost venue they don't mind, lower production sales or is it less of a linear and more something else that the tenants trying to drive out when they make a decision whether to go mall or open-air? Donald Wood : I'll let Chris add with respect to what you are seeing out there. But you are asking a really what you are generalizing a specific \u2013 generalizing a financial model that really is different for every specific company. It depends on our operating margins, it depends on their online and verticality in terms of their business plan. It's not about percentage of sales, right it's about percentage of products and our whole industry has been very focused, as you would expect on occupancy costs for the last 40 years because sales data from stores something that's askable and attainable, but the reality is that that really just a surrogate for profitability and those metrics are changing. So when any particular company, whether it's a retailer or restaurant or an entertainment source or whoever it is, is considering the best way to distribute their goods or services, it's got everything to do with their particular business model where they're going in profitability. So trying out to make it as linear, a conversation has it would be helpful, obviously would be easier to analyze. If you aware, we are seeing in almost every case, a tenant that we are trying to convince to come open-air with us, what we are seeing generally is the belief that their customer is shopping in our type of shopping center rather than in a mall. That's almost the driver to everything. Where is their customer? Where they likely to find their customer then the economics in the business plan is huge on that and they have to find how to balance. Christopher Weilminster : Yes. All I would add to that comment is that from a holistic standpoint with the retailers are good example just happen out at Santana Row where in Valley Fair also floor is at a very successful store. They opened a store at Santana Row right across the street. There has been \u2013 as we are hear no impact to Valley Fair store and they picked up a whole new grouping of customer. So I also think the retailers are getting a lot more holistic interview of customers that shop all may not always because same customers that shops on the street retail environment. So I think the pool of opportunity of our retailers looking in the types of assets that Federal Realty owns is really it provides a lot of optimism for us on a going forward basis. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. I was wondering with the Phase IIs at Assembly and Pike & Rose starting to open up soon, I mean how are you thinking about the initial NOI drag when these types of projects open up compared to what we saw in the Phase Is opened up? Donald Wood : Go ahead Dan. Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Now with regards to the drag, I mean, I think we are trying to outline some of that in our disclosure in the third quarter with regards to the range of about $0.06 to $0.07 of drag from the opening of Phase II in 2017 and likely into 2018. And I\u2019d just point you to how we expect in 2017 and in 2018 and into 2019 how the NOI will proceed in terms of growth at both Assembly and Pike & Rose. I mean, I think that's the best way to kind of express to you kind of how we see that ramp up. But $0.06 to $0.07 that we outlined is the impact on 2017 as they open and as capitalized interest rolls off and as we lease up some of the residential with very limited pre-leasing. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then just one other question for you. In terms of equity in 2017, is it in the range of call it $150 million to $200 million or something which is embedded in guidance, a good proxy? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. We've got a $150 million modeled in for 2017 at this point. Michael Mueller : Okay. $150 million, great. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is now open. Paul Morgan : Hi, good morning. There have been some comments by some of your peers this earnings season about kind of a further widening in cap rates between A&B assets. And warning number one, I guess if you're seeing the same thing and the number two, is there any signs kind of early on that it might be kind of blending into the types of valuations for the centers that are in your target markets are A centers and in A markets? Donald Wood : Hey, Paul. Let me start and Jeff wouldn\u2019t mind jumping in from your perspective what those. I'd like to say that I recognize a widening in terms what we see between A&B&C centers, but frankly we're only looking at real estate and I can tell you at the stuff that we've been looking at and having some more success and hopeful of looking to turning into some substantial negotiations and then hopefully getting deals done that we have not seen any backing up of cap rates on stuff that we're looking at. Jeff, anything further from your side. Jeffrey Berkes : Hey, Paul. Yes, I mean anecdotally, Paul we hear that B&C properties are either not crediting are not getting the buyer pool of these two which is affecting pricing, but thinking we are not really out looking for B&C real estate. I can tell you no change at all of the pricing for A\u2019s it still extremely competitive and expensive. Daniel Guglielmone : I will add one thing to you, Paul that you might find interesting. There is a shopping center here in the DC area that has been on our list for a long time. It's not a regional center, but it is that\u2019s more of a strong community center with some opportunity both in leasing and potential into small development. We basically dropped out at a high 3s, 4 cap on our underwriting and it went for significantly more money than that to a private company not a public company, but private company now that is in our business. And when I looked at that and I shook my head and said that we\u2019ve been looking really carefully to see if we could see any kind of weakening in or backtracking if you will of cap rates and that one looked extremely high and we\u2019re not being able to looking at that property either and it just want for a really big number in the 30s. Paul Morgan : Yes. I understand. Thanks. And then just to follow-up on kind of on re-leasing spreads, first on the renewals, they were lower than what you had recently was plus 1% renewals and I just wonder that\u2019s anything about kind of what you're seeing in terms of small shop rent growth. And then on the anchor stuff you\u2019ve provided I think 15% to 20% expected spread on the anchor leases that were vacant that were remaining to be leased, and you've done a few more deal since than and I wonder if that number is kind of still what you're ball parking? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Too many questions, listen with respect to the fourth quarter renewals, I mean that\u2019s an anemic number, 1% anemic number anyway you look at it. I also have to start by saying it's a quarter, so what. And inside of that, when you look at it, there is one particular deal in there where we specifically roll down a tenant to keep them in the properties that we were looking to or looking at to redevelop and we're not ready yet, so we didn't want to lose them to the center all the way. So we keep them and that brought us down without that would be in the mid single-digit still, nothing wonderful to write home about, but a whole lot better than 1% what that looks. And then with respect to anchors we did the guidance that you just is something that we are comfortable with in terms of the rest of the anchor leasing to lease up in the two deal that I talked about were two of the better deals. In terms of that rolled up that we're remaining list. So we still expect to be rolling up the balance and the teams certainly but not maybe down to 20s. Paul Morgan : Okay, yes. But including the deals you did, I mean overall it's consistent with kind of what you provided, even though you may picked off some of the better one so far? Donald Wood : Completely consistent make a little bit better. Paul Morgan : Okay, great. Thanks. Donald Wood : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Don, you talk about the change in retail environment and changes in the way people are shopping and realizing that\u2019s more longer-term, but you also an environment right now were you seeing by spending on apparel and accessories, many retailers are struggling and it could be another tough year for store closures, aside from some of the occupancy loss that you've already suffered what impact is the current retail environment having on your business strategy today? How are you thinking about tenanting your centers differently and maybe you were just a year ago? Donald Wood : Yes, everything is around the edges, Christy. I'm very much believed that this is \u2013 what we've been talking about for years, is accelerating and tenants that have kind of hung on coming through the recovery are under stressed, payless is the next one \u2013 that closed and we\u2019ve got a $900,000 or $1,000,000 where the payless income that is that certainly the risk at six different properties. So the reality is it gets down to this real belief that in everything I\u2019ve been talking about that we need to provide merchandising that is so much better balanced toward the type of food offerings, the type of entertainment offerings, the type of clothing offerings, we need to be making sure that we're doing deals with retailers as best we can that getting. And a lot of that does mean investing in these properties and making sure that we're giving them the best mousetrap, if you will to be able to offer their good sense. One of the things that as you know we struggle with and I would hope our competitive struggle with is how much do we take to the short-term to be able to make sure these properties are as strong as they can going out and we just completely taken the point of view that we're going to the large because we have the real estate where we can get paid back for such investment and we were going to accelerate that notion of the right type of mix of all of those tenants with the people who are getting it more in terms of providing customers the services that they demand today then with the older brands that are slower on the uptake. Christy McElroy : So in the context of your 3% same-store NOI growth forecast, if I think about some of those at risk tenants that you could payless is $900,000 to $1,000,000 and some of the others that may result in further store closures. What is the risk potentially to that 3% forecasters or to what extent do you have something embedded in there, some buffer for further\u2026? Donald Wood : And I will leave the specifics to Dan and Melissa, but just notionally how we try to do this, courses risk and on all of these companies today, I do think there is more variability, if you will in the standard deviation, on all of these numbers that are out there being given in that time of cycle that we are in our business in terms of that. But we do that \u2013 when we give a number of 3% so 2.5% or 3.5% and you look at the kind of numbers that difference is that it takes to move that, it's not a lot. And so, surely we have some question put in there, but we also know we believe some of that, if not all of that question which we are trying as best we can to give you a balanced view in a time that I believe that in our business is less predictable than it has been. Christy McElroy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you and good afternoon. I'm looking at the 2006 acquisitions and the vast majority of them include a supermarket anchor or supermarket exposure. I'm just wondering if Federal looking to increase its exposure to supermarkets and just kind of given those comments you just made is that part of the draw that will be part of the future federal mix. Donald Wood : Just want to make sure, you said 2006 and I'd love to go back to 2006. Craig Schmidt : I would too. Donald Wood : I do expect you mentioned 2016. Craig Schmidt : Yes, I did. I'm sorry. The six assets you\u2019ve bought, five of them had a supermarket anchor. Donald Wood : Yes. So remember that was us buying out the 70% that we didn't own of our joint venture with Clariant and those \u2013 that particular portfolio was meant to be a supermarket-anchored portfolio and so that's why it \u2013 when we look specifically at risk-reward, we make any money with that investment of those net 70%. We said, yes. That was not a specific supermarket initiative that position in 2016. So I don't I think relating into that all. Generally, we are all about the best real estate and the components of it or the format of it is just playing less important to us, it's about the real estate and what we can get at and what we can do with it. So I don't think we should read into that at all. We are a retail company although in terms of the way we think about things. Yes. We want to make money vertically above it in cases with residential and with office, but our bonds are retail, but as this broadly retailed and not just supermarket on shopping centers. Craig Schmidt : And just looking at the development opportunities at Hastings Ranch, is that on existing land or would that be the conversion and repurposing of some of the anchor space there? Donald Wood : Yes. Jeff wants to talk about Hastings in a little bit more. Jeffrey Berkes : Okay. Sure, Don. Hey, Craig. Yes, I mean I think find the best way to look at Hastings is way down laid it out on one hand, we are sitting on 15 acres land or 274,000 square feet of improvements on it that generates the 6% return that it\u2019s going to grow roughly the rate the same is the rest of our portfolio over the foreseeable future. And that's the scenario we priced and underwrote and that\u2019s something we can happen obviously, if we don\u2019t get control over the land or get control over the Sears box. On the complete other end of the spectrum what you're getting to Craig, is if we do get control the land and we do get control over the Sears box. There is a significant opportunity to reposition that property over the coming years. It's got a zoning that allows anywhere from a 1.0 to 3.0 FARs roughly 650,000 feet three times that. It's right next to the 210 free ways where there's 240,000 cars a day that goes by and walking distance to the metro gold line. So it\u2019s fundamentally great real estate with a wide range of potential outcomes and we won't know we're headed on it for several years, but it's again what we always look for this real estate which is protected downside, which in those case has been sitting there and run it like it is today and running the six and watching it grow or doing something significantly different. And then of course there's two or three scenarios in the middle that could work out to just way too early to tell. Donald Wood : Craig, I want to add one thing to that just a \u2013 the Sears box has paid very little rent here, it\u2019s partially sublet thing that HomeGoods\u2026 Craig Schmidt : Yes correct Don. Donald Wood : And so from a profitability perspective for Sears, this is a great piece of real estate where they pay little than they earn. So we don't think that there is past the day to have basically said we're not interested in giving the space at this point, we just want to be there to the extent that situation changes. Craig Schmidt : I was just looking at Google maps, it looks like there could be some interesting opportunity just give us surrounding retail and uses on that area? Donald Wood : Clearly, 15 agents that far is a lot of land. Jeffrey Berkes : Yes, it\u2019s a great note Craig. Great note, that\u2019s a great piece. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Donald Wood : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund of Jefferies. Your line is now open. George Hoglund : Hi, guys. Just wondering if there's any sort of additional color you can give on plans for CocoWalk in some sort of place? Donald Wood : Yes. I gave have some last time and we're work the numbers of like crazy because constructions expenses. But yet coco in particular we\u2019ve settled on a plan that will effectively part of the shopping center down as you're looking at the fund at the right side of down and create office overall retail with a completely reconfigured center if you will of the common area there with the Starbucks is today. And overall renovation, not only of the outside areas of the retail part, but inside of the Cinepolis Theaters that is a critical anchor there and so as we pull that together will have a total numbers of down yet, but it we'll be a $50 million or $60 million redevelopment plan that is that really should said that property up to be a great held asset, if you will, for the next 20 year and 30 years. And over it Sunset it's all about the entitlements and that is the case in all the markets that we're in I don't think we are in one market we're getting the uses in the high-end and the entitlement to do what we want to do is easy. Now one market we're in that's why we're in those markets and we I don\u2019t want to say, we want to be hard to get the new investment, but it's hard for us, hard for everybody. And so we still have time. I think I would say into working through that in the meantime, we are doing the best we can operating a less than perfect retail assets. So stay tune that we more Sunset I will be more coco. But I just told you, it is probably where it's going to end up, so we can get the numbers, where we need to get the numbers. George Hoglund : Yep thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vincent Chao : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just question we've talked a lot about the training consumer behaviors and how that changes now accelerating as well as the fact that there's more acquisition opportunities out there, but the pricing hasn't changed. So I'm just curious, obviously have a very high quality portfolio already, but any thoughts on taking of the current conditions and making portfolio little bit better quality of asset sales at this point. Donald Wood : Yes, great question, Vin and let me give you the answer is yes, but let me specifically point to what the challenges are in this portfolio. The first I talk about forever as we've got some really significant tax gains in just about every asset that we own. And so without having the ability 1031 it's hard, so we1031, whenever we buy an asset for cash as opposed to what units dealer or some other financing. We do look hard at trading out. So I do hope you see that this year starting with using the facing for proceeds. The other thing that should really keep in mind with respect to this portfolio is when spin off big part of the company or sell 20% of the assets or whether. It\u2019s whole lot easier make that work when there is a big giant standard deviation between the great stuff that\u2019s you have and then anchors are great stuff that you have. And as we\u2019ve looking over for years and really what that standard deviation is, I mean, we certainly have property better than others, but I will say that even on worst assets are awfully play in terms of growth rates and things like that. So spending off 10% or 15% of this Company, you do all they long, if you could bring the 3% same-store growth that\u2019s the 4.5% or something like that which you might not do it if it was the 3% to 3.2% or something like that if you kind of get my drift. So it will likely continue to be a one-off selective philosophy of improving the quality of the portfolio, which we should always be doing and just like we buy these assets one at a time you'll likely see a trade out one at a time. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks a lot. That\u2019s all I had. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups here. First on lease spreads, can you give us some sense of what type of vintage you are rolling over for rent leases that you are signing in 2016? And tied to that is, how long is your runway for continuing to post these very healthy double-digit lease spreads? Donald Wood : Ki Bin, I\u2019ve been asked this question for 10 years and I keep looking for the end of the runway, but I will tell you well certainly there are quarters and there are periods of time when we don't roll as well as we would like to. Overall, we're still sitting here at a portfolio, which has basically, in total, as far as we could tell, we've got sales from everybody, but something like 9% or 9.5% cost occupancy in it. So, as you look and I love the schedule that we have in the road show, which basically shows here are the average rents that we're getting, and here is the average in place rent for as you say all the vintage, but former leases that there is still more upside in this portfolio. I think in terms of those roles overall than in any of the other reported information that's out there for the competitors. So I feel like that will continue. That doesn't mean is there every quarter and I don't have a specific answer. I'm looking over it. Dan have said specifically the vintage that we get here, but you do know that our average leases on hand are between 7.5 or 8 years. So whether at this specific quarter on average where we\u2019re rolling over leases every 7.5 or 8 years. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And the second question on the Pasadena asset, could you just talk a little bit about like how you source that type of deal and maybe some commentary around, I believe there is a ground lease on it? Donald Wood : Are you asking for Jeff Berkes, secret soft? Hi, Jeff, how are you going to answer that question? Jeffrey Berkes : Well, I wish I could like say that we\u2019re superhuman, but we're not, the asset was actually marketed for sale back in 2015. And there were some complications of getting the deal done and what we've done in the past, we have hung around the hoop and work through some of those issues with seller, we developed really, really good relationship with and we are able to get the eventually the deal done. So nothing more magic to it than that. We\u2019ve found over the years persistence and patience to give the kind of real estate that we want to payoff and this will be a great example of that. Donald Wood : And Ki Bin, the only thing I'd add to that is buying something whatever it is in these locations and with the opportunities here at six is great, but there's a reason for it. It is not a ground lease. We are at 40 years of term or so in terms of that. And there is no direct path to getting the fee, there is no direct path to getting to this year's which pays no rent. So it makes sense that is that a six or six plus something like that. But when we look at and say okay, what's your downside if you never do, downside we never do is 40 years of 2.5% to 3% annual growth in a great real estate location. So pay for itself if you will in 13 years or 14 years and then what 25 years after that of cash flow. So economically I think it works all day long, but specifically having it turn into the next best mixed-use project or whatever it's ultimately going to be, we don't have any visibility too. Ki Bin Kim : Okay, thank you. Donald Wood : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas at Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Christopher Lucas : Yes. Don, you basically answer the question I was going to ask, but maybe just one more on Hastings, if I could, which is if you we're able to get the feasible interest, if that deal was completely put together, what kind of a cap rate with that go for in the marketplace today. If you were able to get in six with kind of giving the leasehold interest? Donald Wood : I\u2019m going to provide a crazy number and then Jeff going to argue with me, so you are going to see it right here on the call. He is 3,000 miles away, I can\u2019t even look at him Chris, so can get two very independent things. Everything that we've seen in and around California in the markets that we're talking about where we would like to be, if you were completely fee owned with the climate upside that 200,000 square foot Sears and HomeGoods and part of the shopping center that doesn't pay a lot with that upside, it would shock me if this were not of sub four. It\u2019s just pure guess. Jeffrey Berkes : Well, I would say there is a lot of nuance in all these deals, Chris and I\u2019m sorry that I kind of pinpoint that number, but on Don\u2019s point not far off whether it's high 3\u2019s or low 4\u2019s that\u2019s kind of the range. Christopher Lucas : Okay, thanks. And then just, Don one quick one kind of a follow-up to an earlier question about sort of change in tax policy. But I guess I was wondering if you guys are finding more opportunity and whether you're actually pushing this idea or not of doing more down REIT type transactions given the environment? Donald Wood : You know, more or less is a relative term, I will tell you anytime we go into a property that we would love to have an interest and we try to use whatever tool is in the toolbox. As you know we're not of volume acquirer. So it's not like there is a memo that comes down from my office or from Dan\u2019s office, it sounds like the acquisition guys use more down REITs in every units. It really is what can we best do to convince a seller to do a deal with us and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. But, no, not more, no trend difference there at this point. Christopher Lucas : Great, thank you. Donald Wood : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Collin Mings of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Collin Mings : Hey, good afternoon. Just Don going back to just the acquisition opportunities you're starting to see out there. Has there been any really discernible pick up of deal flow, any specific markets that has you particularly encouraged or that you're particularly focused in on ongoing back to some of the prepared remarks? Donald Wood : And I don't know if this is the direct impact \u2013 has it had a direct impact or not, but I really do like the fact that we are operating on more of a decentralized basis now. We are in \u2013there is a team in Boston that looks at Boston. There is a team that specifically looks to Chicago. There's a team that specifically is working on the West Coast and in Washington et cetera. And so, while I'm constantly frustrated because I'm a cheap guy with the cost of deals, the type of deals that we are seeing in terms of is it real estate that we have the potential to do something with. That does seem to be stronger in all of our major markets. Now whether that converts into actual deal flow or not for billion reasons including the one that took Hastings Ranch. That small acquisition, 18 months or 20 months to get done, these things there are unpredictable in terms of what we're actually looking at. But there is certainly more in each of these teams that is being served up, today, frankly. Collin Mings : Okay. And then maybe just switching gears, just given the pressure on labor and then clearly some commodity prices, just maybe a broader update on your overall outlook for construction costs as you pursue potentially some additional redevelopment opportunities or what have you, looking out over the next 12, 18 months? Donald Wood : Yes. You must have our conference room booked, because the last Investment Committee we specifically were talking about expectations with respect to construction costs, Boston in D.C., certainly in California and we don't see it going down anytime soon there. This is where we are and probably a little bit more expensive. This is where we're going to be in terms of where we're planning to be in terms of the ability to buy out these jobs. On both the material and labor perspective and that's another area that when you start talking about immigration, when you start talking about workforce changes, there is some unpredictability. And so it\u2019s a reason I\u2019ll always say we're not totally \u2013 we're never going to go all-in mixed use development. We\u2019re never going to go all-in on shopping center acquisitions if you will. We're never going to go all in on any piece of our business and we've got them use to more, but we're certainly not expecting any significant change, there's no change down and no significant change above in the cost construction over the next year to 18 months. Collin Mings : Okay, thanks. Donald Wood : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Floris Dijkum of Boenning. Your line is now open. Floris Dijkum : Great, thank you. Hey Don, one thing that things a little bit loss that is another year of 7.4% overall NOI growth, which is pretty impressive for any REIT, alone of REIT of the size of Federal. But obviously you guys have a plan of doing this for a number of additional years as well. As you look out over the next couple of years, how would you rank the risks to your growth in your overall NOI and by order of magnitude, whether it's cost pressures, whether it's tenant bankruptcies, whether it's financing markets or the potential other events that you \u2013 that we don't know about this stage, how would you rank that the risk? Donald Wood : It's a great question, Floris. I think you're really asking why would sleep over and I can\u2019t just give you my standard everything because it's true. What it really - what I feel best about is the cost of money. When I feel best about is that balance sheet and so I\u2019ve got to tell you that is the single biggest \u2013 I mean 2008, 2009 showed everybody what is important tool that is to have that right and we\u2019re heck of a lot stronger than we were even 2008, 2009. So the one of the things I worry about lease is the financing, because of our track record and because of the strength of the balance sheet at the way we have set. Now, so I guess I start with what I worry about lease and you ask what I worry about most effectively and most has everything to do with the changing retail environment and the ability to have retailers clear enough in their business plans to make decisions to open source. And that is just the single biggest thing. It's less about the bankruptcies. I always expected to be bankruptcies it\u2019s part and parcel of our business it often results in and don't just mean bankruptcies I mean tenant failures. However, more broadly defined it all these results and some level of lease termination fees that part and parcel of our business, it always results in opening up the redevelopment opportunities, which are always a part of our business, a huge part of our business, but the deal making requires a retailer to be very clear or residential or apartment dwellers to be clear on where their future is. And right now to me that's the fundamental question it's the changing consumer and it\u2019s online shopping, uncertainty in the administration that stuff is what worries me because the end of the day, we need to people for REIT space before I think REIT space I think a bunch of money. So that's the overriding risk I see our business, and frankly a lot of businesses that that you forget in good times, when people are clear about when management team CEOs are clear about where their companies are going they invest, they invest in good factory, they invest a new shopping centers, they invest and what are people work hiring et cetera. In our business with the change in consumer with changing \u2013 all the change we talk about that is my largest worry. Floris Dijkum : Okay. One follow-up question I guess and this from a couple of calls ago, but update on Chicago, I noticed you mentioned earlier, you now have a specific Chicago team, is that new and should we expect more investment into that market? Donald Wood : Well, I don't know whether you're seeing with their more or not in Chicago. I do know that the team that has the responsibility for Chicago we really like. And if you just get down to the centralization part and you think about a specific team that really like the market that they're in, for whatever the reasons are. I would expect to see more stuff coming up for investment opportunities in that and all our market and all of our markets from those individual teams. Now whether they work their way through investment committee and whether they make sense or not stay tune that is yet to play out, but that's probably how I would answer Chicago. Floris Dijkum : Great, thanks. End of Q& A Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Leah Andress for any closing remarks. Leah Andress : Thanks everyone for joining us today. Looking forward to see many of you as well in Citi Conferences in the coming weeks. Thanks. Good bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

As a reminder, to this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Leah Andress. Ma'am, please go ahead. Leah Andress : Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Dawn Becker, Jeff Berkes, Chris Weilminster and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. Certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected earnings or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and the supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our website at www.federalrealty.com. (Operator Instructions) And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. Another real solid quarter for us, with FFO per share of $1.45, 5% higher than last year's strong quarter. So this is a tough comp for and above our internal expectations also. Due somewhat due to the timing of quarterly expenses, particularly demolition of properties to be redeveloped, those will hit later in the year. But also due to less vacancy than expected and low snow removal in Philly and the Mid-Atlantic regions. Now there has been so much talk about the state of retail real estate in the past few months and I'll leave it up to the experts to who determine whether evaluations has overcorrected. Clearly, as of today, the short-sellers are winning. But I do want to make some observations about the environment that we're operating in. First of all, there's plenty of leasing that's getting done, we're doing a ton. In the latest quarter, we did 102 deals for more than 1.5 million feet of space, more in terms of both the number of deals and square footage leased since second quarter of 2014, 10 quarters ago. I've personally never been more convinced that the benefit of the highest quality real estate locations and products particularly in difficult times than I am today. But all the space that's either on the market today are believed to be coming to market, it clearly moves leasing leverage the tenant from the landlord in many situations in many situations. That shift manifest itself in negotiations that hurts in three ways, more tenant capital, more favorable deal terms for the tenant, and more timing to get the deals done. Not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination, they certainly make the economic sense to do, but helpful nonetheless. The combination of strength of location and strength of balance sheet together make for a huge, that's right, huge, advantage in an environment like this. So let's talk about the quarter from that. Same-store property operating income rose 4.3%, including redevelopment in the quarter, which is the way we run our business as redevelopment of existing properties is such an integral part, an important part and a big important part of what we do. Rent start from splunk certainly helps as their strong growth at Melville Mall, Power Shops and Congressional Plaza. The overall portfolio was 94.6% leased versus 94.4% at year-end, and 94.1% last year's first quarter, to gain of 20 and 50 basis points, respectively. Note that we ended the quarter at 94.6% leased, though only 93.1% occupied, indicative of the signed deals for which rents is yet to start but that's good for later in the year and for 2018. Also, we continue to work through the excess anchor vacancies that we spoke about over the last 2 quarters. Of the 730,000 square feet of total anchor vacancy that we first talk about in November of last year, we're now over 50% leased of that pool, with the income from many of those deals scheduled to start later in '17 and 2018. Rent from new tenants exceeds rent from former tenants by 36% on those deals. Our team is working diligently on our anchor vacancy lease-up initiative to bring us back to a more normalized level, around 98%, and we're almost there with the anchor portfolio now at -- the anchor portfolio is now 97% leased. We'll have the updated detailed anchor vacancy schedule, including the timing of rent start, available at NAREIT in June. In addition, we expect to have last 2 Sports Authority boxes released as part of the redevelopment of both Brook Plaza and Assembly Square, the marketplace portion soon. In our development pipeline, continued construction progress is at the stage where all Phase 2 buildings at both Assembly and Pike & Roses are topped off, with the majority of work going on in the interiors. A higher construction cost estimate at Assembly is largely indicative of how higher leasing capital required there that's more than paid for with commensurate rental income. Preleasing preparation and marketing for the late summer residential movements is underway in earnest in both Assembly and Pike & Rose, and condo sales have picked up at both properties also. The occupancy there will begin in 2018. Please remember how dilutive the residential lease-up period would be at both properties beginning next quarter, but certainly works the value that's being created. 78 of the 107 market rent rate condos are under binding contract at the Assembly, and 27 of the 99 are under binding contract at Pike & Rose. CocoWalk came to investment committee and the Board just yesterday, and we're going to go forward with its redevelopment subject to finalizing the GNP contract shortly. We expect to add to the redevelopment schedule next quarter, but expect the $73 million to $78 million project. Darien shopping center's redevelopment is up next later in the year, we'll be talking about that. We're still working through the Sunset Place entitlements, 700 Santana Row construction continues. Core belief in all of this stuff throughout our company is that investment and great real estate is increasingly necessary to position it for relevance in the next decade and we have a lot to do. In terms of restocking our shelves with raw material for development in the coming years, the first quarter was productive with the February closing of Hastings Ranch in Pasadena, California, we've discussed it on our February call; and the March closing of Riverpoint Center in Chicago. We signed a press release a couple of weeks ago about that acquisition on 17 acres on the western edge of Lincoln Park. And except for the fact that it's the first acquisition we've made in Chicago over 20 years, it's right down the middle of the plate for the type of stuff we look for. It's very infill, it's very unattractive as it currently sits, other anchor markets with limited term and a big piece of land that's subdividable. Chicago [indiscernible] as opposed to Chicagoland suburbs has been a magnet for the continued trend for the organization and most major cities in the U.S. are experiencing. Nowhere in the country had the trends that's more pronounced than Chicago where [indiscernible] companies have moved headquarters since 2008, ConAgra, Google, Kraft Heinz, Motorola, even McDonald's is moving in. Those 17 acres on the Chicago River and Lincoln Park can only get more valuable in our view. And it looks like we may not be done with the acquisition this year. I can't fill in all the details yet because deals aren't fully negotiated. But the reasons I'm bringing it up on this call is twofold. First, with all the handwringing and remind [indiscernible] concern for the fast-changing consumer shopping and behavioral patterns that we're witnessing, we are firmly demonstrating our commitment to the future of great quality real estate. Over the past 20 years that I've been at Federal, there has simply never been a time, never, not 2007, not 2009, not today, where our poor quality real estate outperformed our better assets. Never. For us, great quality has simply defined as locations and the product on them where retailers, residents, office workers and shoppers want to be and will pay up to be there. In short, where demand exceeds supply. In our view, the future locations like that look better than ever. Secondly, because uncertain times like these sometimes provide that final push to convince sellers to part with long-held properties. The property is well located, desirable and has redevelopment possibilities, cap rates remained extremely low as they always do at times like this, but the mere availability is a huge opportunity. The strength of our balance sheet left us to selectively exploit those opportunities. Now [indiscernible] and a personal note, we'll be losing Jeff Mooallem as our Senior Vice President, running the core portfolio as he takes on the CE role -- of the CEO role of a new venture with long-time veteran [indiscernible]. Just a good man who's done a terrific job of setting up our decentralized core over the past couple of years, and I wish him all of the best in the top job he's taken. As most of you know, our bench is deep and I'm thrilled to replace Jeff with 15-year Federal Realty veteran and Senior Vice President, Wendy Cyr. Wendy previously ran leasing for the core with Jeff, is widely respected both inside our company and most assuredly, outside by peeries, brokers and tenants nationwide. Asset management, core leasing and tenant coordination were for important to her. Many of you already know Wendy, but she will be more visible to you in the quarters and years ahead. That's it for my prepared remarks, we've got a lot going on around here and a huge investment in our future. Over $600 million of construction in progress on the balance sheet, in the right type of products for a future with some of the best piece of the real estate and some of the best markets in the country. We're surely will never take for granted the balance sheet that's been set up over the last few years that provides exactly the flexibility and cushion when things don't go exactly as planned. Let me turn it over now to Dan before opening up the lines to your questions. Daniel Guglielmone : Thank you, Don and Leah, and hello, everyone. As Don, we'd another strong quarter despite the increasing headwinds facing the retail sector overall due largely to a very active quarter on the leasing front, with 592,000 square feet of total leases signed and 524,000 square feet signed on a comparable basis. For comparable results, we drove an average increase of 11% on a cash basis and 23% on a GAAP basis. The 11% on the cash basis and that's 11.49% to be precise is in line with our expectations. The breakdown for the quarter was 17% on new leases and 5% on renewals. Our same-store NOI grew 4.3% despite a drag of roughly 70 basis points from lower term fees, with only $300,000 of same-store term fees during the quarter versus $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2016. This 4.3% is also impressive given the impact of our proactive releasing efforts. If you recall on last quarter's call, I highlighted a few examples of our proactively leasing activity, which would negatively impact near-term operating metrics. On Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, where Adidas will replace Express, switching out A.C. Moore for Trader Joe's at Assembly Square up in Boston; and at Santana Row where we traded Bay Club Fitness for Broad Soft. All 3 deals were at meaningfully -- meaningful increases to previous rents, add to that the recently publicized deal at Santana Row to bring in Amazon Books, in place Brooks Brothers. Those 4 leased deals alone represent over 50 basis points of negative impact on our first quarter same-store growth metrics, as well as 30 basis points in occupancy drag, both represent $18 million to $20 million of value creation where you consider the increased rents, impact on real estate value after deducting capital. That's $18 million to $20 million value creation through 4 leases. Clearly a trade-off we would make every time from short-term dilution versus long-term value creation perspective. Plus, the benefits of significantly upgrading our tenant mix further solidifies these properties for the future. Also creating drag in our same-store pool are the activities of our 2 South Florida properties, CocoWalk and Sunset Place, which we intend to significantly redevelop in the coming years. For example, during the first quarter, Sunset Place produced a drag of 30 basis points on our same-store growth, drag we fully expected and underwrote when we acquired the asset in 2015. As we prepare to execute on these extensive redevelopments over the coming years, occupancy and NOI are forecasted to decrease meaningfully as we care down and rebuild significant portions of the existing structures. As a result, as we get to a late 2017, early 2018, we will begin to provide occupancy and other operating metrics with and without CocoWalk and Sunset to better isolate the performance of our portfolio. Now on to Assembly and Pike & Rose. As we highlighted last quarter, Assembly Rows Phase 1 is fully stabilized. Pike & Rose Phase 1 continues to make progress with Dallas and PerSei being 96% and 97% leased, respectively, and the office being 100% leased at quarter end. The property overall continues to be on track to deliver 75% of projected stabilized POI in 2017, in line with our guidance. On a tax co redevelopment side, we continue to find the opportunities to redevelop our core portfolio, creating value and positioning our centers to outperform in their respective markets. Two new projects have been added to our redevelopment schedule in the 8-K. At [indiscernible] and Richmond, where we are demolishing small shop and anchor space and relocating another anchor to accommodate Dick Sporting Goods at the property in a new free cut 9,000 square foot store; and at [indiscernible] Mall outside of Princeton, where we acquired an office building adjacent to the center and are redeveloping the property for retail use. With respect to AFFO for the quarter, it increased 8.4% over 2016. FFO per share was $1.45, which represent the 5.1% increase over the first quarter in 2016 and is $0.02 above both our internal projections and consensus. As Don mentioned, this was largely due to the timing of demolition expense between the first and second quarters, which roughly was $0.01 as well as forecasting higher tenant bankruptcy that actually occurred during the quarter, with our portfolio so far having minimal exposure to many of the troubled retail names declaring bankruptcy so far in 2017. This, coupled with lower removal expense, represented another $0.01. On this point, let me highlight them. We have no Eastern Mountain, no Gander Mountain or no Gordon, no Family Christian, Route 21, Limited or Gas, no American Apparel, Wetseal or Crocs, we have only one [indiscernible] and the rent is well below market. So it's unclear if we can even get that back. Only 2 BCBG's, one of which we presently expect than to keep open and another we have already backfilled. Just 1 BBN and 2 RadioShack and only one of our 6 Payless is currently on their closure list. Plus, our total exposure to Payless is just 0.11% of total revenues, although we do have 3 [indiscernible] locations, which closed the last week. Of what we know today in terms of closures from those tenants, it represents just 0.1% -- 0.16% of total revenues and our total exposure to those tenants is just 0.44% of total revenues. While we forecast to give back part of this outperformance over the balance of the year as the delayed demo commences this quarter and the challenging retail environment continues, we are revising upwards our 2017 FFO guidance to $5.85 and $5.93, increasing the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.02 to $5.85. This is being driven largely by our recent acquisition activity with the combination of our acquisitions of Hastings Ranch in Pasadena, and Riverpoint Center in Chicago, getting about $0.015 of gear with Hastings Ranch providing an NOI yield in the low 6s and Riverpoint in the mid- to upper-4s. Please note, we left the upper end of the range unchanged at $5.93 given the uncertainty still facing the retail sector and remain cautious on our forecasting for the remainder of the year. Despite the strong first quarter, we still expect same-store growth with redevelopment for 2017 to be around 3%. Second quarter is not expected to be as strong given the difficult comparable relative to 2016. Now with an update on the balance sheet. We had $217 million outstanding on our $800 million credit at quarter end, driven in part by our acquisition of Riverpoint on the last day of the quarter. Our the credit facility is the only floating rate exposure we have. Our weighted average maturity remains an industry-leading 10-plus years and our weighted average interest rate is now at 3.9%. Our debt-to-EBITDA is at 5.6 and our interest coverage ratio remains very healthy at 4.5x. Before we turn the call over for your questions, I would like to share with you another discovery we've made at Federal since joining late last summer. During our Board meeting earlier in the week, we took a look back over 15 years to review how Federal has performed during some of the previous difficult cycles in retail, and again came away extremely impressed by the resiliency of Federal's portfolio as well as the performance of the company as a whole. We compiled numbers for report publicly every quarter under 1 sheet showing FFO, FFO per share and same-store growth quarterly over the 15-year period. And the performance is remarkable, particularly when you consider that the great recession occurred in the middle. Remind me to show it to you next time we are together. For many of you that will be at NAREIT next month, Leah tells me there are a few slots still available given we have 3 schedules running as Jeff Berkes will join me and Don at the Hilton in New York. And with that, operator, you can open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeffrey Donnelly : Dan, I guess, if I could just stick with you on sort of the source of the newses. Can you just walk us through how you're seeing that for the remainder of this year? Just I was thinking between development spending and debt obligations on the horizon that it might command a lot of your cash flow this year and I'm wondering whether it intensified any of these asset sales or equity issuance or due to some cash at refinancing? Daniel Guglielmone : Well, from where we stand right now, I think we have about $206 million of -- or $217 million of mortgages, which we'll refinance at the property level. So that's any of the near-term debt maturities that we have. With respect to our development spend for the remainder of the year, it stands at around $300 million roughly. We will utilize our free cash flow, which is projected to be in the $70 million to $75 million range for the year, as well as we do have some assets under consideration for sale currently. And I think we'll look to be opportunistic with regards to issuance of equity as necessary. But I think that, that is generally how the rest of the year lays out. Jeffrey Donnelly : And maybe just a follow-up, I recognize you guys aren't here to give us guidance on 2018. But current consensus estimates for this year about 4% FFO growth and next year, it accelerates a little bit about 6.5%. I recognize you have some major developments opening, with also some capitalize costs coming into the mix. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about given this current retail environment, is there sort of a chance? Or how we should be thinking about maybe a slow down or a slow wing of stabilization on some of those new development assets? And just how that can kind of flow through your FFO grow into '18? Donald Wood : That's a good question, Jeff. When I sit back, we think of it in 2 kind of buckets. The same-store portfolio and when I say same-store I certainly mean, redevelopment I mean, the stuff that we do day in and day out. And then the hedge is to create a value and not only is that obviously that Pike & Rose and Assembly and also CocoWalk, [indiscernible], there's a whole bunch of other smaller initiatives that fit in there. I'd like to break those things out going forward, and Dan and Melissa and I are talking about that to be able to show kind of the base case the wheel of the company and then what those other initiatives are doing. And the reality is as we've been saying for a couple of quarters, you've got dilution in the period of time that we're talking about, the end of '17 and into '18 from building those things and doing those. Frankly, more confident than ever before, even given the current environment, Jeff, that what's happening with the type of product that we're building, that we're doing is being accepted. So this bifurcation if you will between the have and have nots, be it quality real estate, it gives [indiscernible] becoming more pronounced to tell you the truth. And so as long as we do a good job disclosing and showing the difference between kind of the base portfolio and the other initiatives, I think you'll like what you'll see. And the reason I'd say that is, I don't know whether because of that some level of unpredictability, if you will, is how Henry leads us up, Montage leases up, et cetera, being as precise as we'd like to be for 2018 is not possible. But when you bifurcate it between the stuff that's more predictable and the stuff that's longer-term value creative, it will give you the tools to decide what you think about the value is being value creative and that's the most important thing that we want to do to improve our disclosure that way. So I'm not just -- I'm not being pinned down, if you will, to a specific number, which is really hard to do at this point in time. But the value creation part of it is, frankly, easier to see than it's ever been before. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Nicholas Yulico : Could you just's talk about, you put the new, I apologize I joined a little late, you put the new details in the credit quality of the tenants, the credit ratings of the tenants, which was helpful. Do you have any historical perspective you'd be able to provide on how you think that's been trending over the last 5, 10 years? Donald Wood : Well, it's plenty of asset because I do think that Dan was referring to in his prepared remarks with respect to the 15-year history, we've got some pretty good stuff behind that. That kind of shows, historically, what has happened as tenants go out, how they are, what's happening after releasing of that. And I've been talking to Dawn Decker, who's been here in the middle of that for the longest period of time. And we are putting together some analysis probably I have on the phone for you today. But Dan's comment, coupled with mine about over that period of time, 10 years, 5 years, 15 years, it's really clear how better quality properties perform in terms of being released and turning over rather than poor quality properties. And we're breaking that up and kind of looking that internally at ourselves a lot, and that's why I said what I said that. Maybe by the time we get to NAREIT, we'll be share some of that. But you will see a bifurcation between great assets and the not-so-great. Operator : Our next question comes from Christine McElroy with Citi. Unidentified Analyst : This is Katie McAnon [ph] for Christy. Can you provide a little more color on what you're seeing on the demand side to the backhaul space today? And how much of a crossover are you seeing as far as more traditional mall-based tenants looking for space in open air centers today and vice versa? Donald Wood : Yes. Well, let me start, Chris, you're going to do the second part of this. The first part with respect to backfilling and the demand is, I think pretty well represented by this anchor sheet that you have all seen before, and we'll see again in terms of that 730,000 feet of anchor vacancy that we had. Do I wish it were back in the day when there were 3 and 4 tenants competing for every space? You bet I do, that is no longer the case in my conversation about the leverage that has moved 2 tenants from landlord is spatial. Having said that, as you can see if you own the great -- if you own well-positioned, great quality assets, demand is strong. And I think we're demonstrating that clearly with the empirical data with the announcement of leasing that we're doing. Deals are not as good and that -- I hate that. And that's what happens cyclically throughout our business, but demand remains strong. Christopher Weilminster : I agree with everything Don said. What I would add is I think that's a great example of a tenant we've secured 2 deals with, one has opened at Santana Row and the other one we've announced for Pike & Rose and that's Sephora, which is traditionally been a pure mall-related retailer, they see that there's a core customer that is not shopping at the malls. And as they open up Santana Row, it had no impact at all on what was going on, on the Daly Mall. So I do think that, that test will turn into a more opportunity for well-located real estate that matches up with the attributes that our portfolio has. And so we look forward to having more of those conversations and we would at other mall-related retailers as they look for growth opportunities. Donald Wood : I think the thing that Chris is saying that it's an important point that retailers are less discerning as to the format that they're going into, whether it's a mall or whether it's opening or we're something in between. It's about where they think, they are more open-minded because they have more leverage too. They're more open-minded about where they will go to and that's why we're having success in the locations that we are in pooling malls tenants, but also pooling other types of the dwindling number of boxed tenants, et cetera, that come fill our properties. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Paul Morgan : I think you said that the spread on the released anchor space, was it 36% for the GOC, Don, which is I think around kind of where you had, in your prior presentations, what that had been. Any color on kind of whether there's been movement since kind of the past disclosure? You talked about roll over on the remaining square feet being more in the 15% to 20% level. Does this happen been a lot of new deals since that time? Or those that you have done have been a little bit better than what you were looking at? Donald Wood : Yes, it's interesting, Paul. There hasn't been change at all in terms of what it is that we had told you and what we're expecting, although it depends on which deals, obviously. And you have to remember the big schedule that showed kind of what they are, we added this quarter a couple of deals that we're on, which included A.C. Moore. It included a fitness company that got took out Hancock Fabrics space of Westlake. We previously talked about Total Wine that was this year, but it was announced last time. Those deals were in line with what we thought it would be and they tie down into that 36%. As I look at all the remaining anchor space, I think I told you one time the implied role of the remainder was about 19%. The schedule I'll show you today shows that at 21%. Now these are small, little differences when you're talking about this amount of space. But it does all -- much of this is happening, the stuff that's taking the time particularly is happening in products, which are under redevelopment. And that's a real positive thing from a standpoint of retailer looking to what's going to invest -- where it's going to invest his capital today. Paul Morgan : Great. I know there's lots of kind of puts and takes going on in same-store number. It sounds like Q2 will be lighter than Q1 based on what you know now. Do you have any color on kind of how you expect the cadence to look as you head into the back half of the year? Obviously, I think the comps are going to start to get easier, but any other stuff you know in terms of openings coming in and how that will impact the number. Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. No, I think that with the demo expense lighting from first quarter into second quarter and with a tough comp in the second quarter from a lease termination fee perspective, we're expecting second quarter to be lower than our first quarter same-store. I think that our proactive leasing activity is going to continue to put some pressure on our occupancy levels. And I think that we're making good progress leasing rates are increasing. However, occupancy is going to tread water for probably at current levels through the middle 2 quarters and probably look to tick up towards the end of the year. So but that's why we're keeping our same-store number kind of when you look and see and are proceeding with caution from a forecasting perspective, we're maintaining our 3% same-store growth forecast for the balance of the year. Donald Wood : But you know, Paul, this is my particular [indiscernible] in terms of these numbers what we are absolutely going to do is to enhance our disclosure. That shows, that gives you a very clear reason, very clear understanding of what's bringing same-store up and what bring same-store down. And we haven't worked that through, it's just in this quarter close, as I've said to Dan, he said to me, we've got to talk about this, we got to talk about that, but there should be a graphical way then we can do a better job communicating with you on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Samir Khanal : When I look at your 3% guidance number, how much sort of extra bankruptcy or occupancy loss is baked in the guidance at this point? How much more cushion is there? You've obviously baked in [indiscernible], BCBG, Payless. Just trying to see what else, I mean, how much cushion is there at this time for occupancy lost? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. I think that we do a pretty rigorous forecasting as we talked, Samir, before in terms of where we expect vacancy space by space, property by property over the course of the year. And I think -- our bad debt expense over the last 5 years has run 2% to 5%, 0.2% to 0.5% I think we're kind of forecasting that same amount. We're forecasting some unexpected vacancy on top of that. And I think we feel very good about the cushion or our forecasting for the balance of the year based on where we sit today and the fact that we're really not getting impacted by the bankruptcies and the store closures that occurred have today. But we remain cautious and we remain cautious through the balance of the year getting over our SKUs. Donald Wood : Let me point to that, Samir. I don't want Dan to be mad at me for showing how quickly things can change. As of 1.5 weeks ago, we had 3 operating [indiscernible] new stores. And overnight, the Canadian company decided to close down all of its U.S. stores. They're still obligated on the lease, we will see what happens, we've got some pretty good security. But that's all got to play itself out of yet. But overnight, there was a company that closed down its operations. And so that's the kind of environment we're working. That is why you're hearing the caution throughout our whole industry. That part of it is absolutely appropriate. It's [indiscernible], are we over-the-top in terms of that caution. It's a good example, stuff like that happens every single year. And we got cushions to effectively be able to handle that. Can we handle 3 and 4 and 5 and 7 of those? No, but we don't see that's the thing. That is the type of environment we're in and that's [indiscernible] cost with it. Samir Khanal : But if you kind of take a step back and you think about sort of the pace of closings, I mean. What inning do think where Julian for the industry as a whole? I mean, look, there's headwinds are clearly impacting growth this year and in the 2019. But I just kind of getting a sense from you as to how you guys are thinking about this internally? Donald Wood : Well, I can tell you, Samir, I'm not sure I can do the baseball analogy part. But what I can do is it's really important that each guy in my position at all of these companies has done their best over the -- not today, forget about today, over the past 3, 5, and 7 longer years to set the company up to be able to take, if they get through, periods like this, which are inevitable. And so it is -- when I look at it, it does, it is why there is development product that's coming on. It is why we've diversified a bit to include residential, to include office some other uses on the real estate we have. It is why we tried really hard to not go after the particular tenant that's doing deals with everybody like HH Gregg was 5 years ago or 7 years ago whenever the heck it was. It's a myriad of a whole bunch of things because we are in a cyclical business, there's no doubt about it. It's why I want to show you how this portfolio has performed over 15 years. And you can compare that to anybody you want to compare it to. And you'll see, well, I'm not going to tell you it's the third or the fifth or the ninth because I don't know. I can tell you how we're prepared to continue to grow, that's a bit slower. But we're prepared to continue to grow through the depths of the situation like this. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Just may be continuing that from a different angle. As you guys, obviously, experience the current environment, do you feel that your traditional credit underwriting model, your grid, is as effective as ever? Or you found that you have to tweak how you underwrite a retailer or tenants credit? Donald Wood : That's a good question, Alex. And understanding the way we view credit, the way we view our capital, the way we view our allocation of capital is similarity with a long-term focus in mind that left side of the balance sheet, the right side of the balance sheet needs to make sense together over that period of time. There's no doubt that parts of the cycle that we're in, that we toughen that up a bit. With respect to, and we have a totally different standard to the extent that there's significant capital going into a space versus a place that's got no capital or less capital going into the space, we'll be much more relaxed in the latter case. And going through this, I'll tell you through '08 and '09 and '10, I'm not saying it's the same thing. But at a time when there's trepidation on the retailer side from however you look at it, that we had some real good experience in terms of how we take it up our credit positions, on how we thought about our allocation to capital, that same thing is happening today absolutely. And by the same token, when there are tenants who have kind of figured it out how, I mean, TJX, carries more weight with us today. They've always been a huge important tenant, but they are not over another tenant. We're looking in a particular place where we got 2 tenants competing, one of them is CDS, the other is not. And the CDS leases is clearly being given more credit -- not the one you're thinking about, Dan is looking me, I'm sorry, ordinarily. And so you're right, once you have to take that subpiece and put that within the prism of the entire long-term view that we have of creating this, making these properties as good as they're going to be in 2025, even though it doesn't feel good today when you look at the stock price or figure out how it's going to impact in the short-term same-store income. Alexander Goldfarb : I think we're all trying not to look at stock prices these days. Second question is, on the investments side, you said though there's more of the acquisition [indiscernible]. Just curious, just given how the stocks are performing and the trepidation over the retail environment, in times like you guys are comfortable buying in the market even if cap rates are influx or maybe cap rates are influx, it's just the headlines. But if you could just help us understand how you guys lock in a deal knowing that it's not going to close for a period of time. And in this environment, there's a chance that cap rates do move the wrong way versus where you underwrote. Donald Wood : First of all, it's a very, very good question and the first answer to that always is balance, right? It's why we're not a giant acquisition shop, never were, never will be. But having said that, we did learn some pretty good lessons in 2009, '10 and '11. And the first thing that we learned during that period of time was this giant bunch of additional great property that was going to be available to us was not. And the reason it's not is because great quality real estate is not often available, and the cap rate on it often doesn't change at all in some crazy locations because it's such a rare commodity. It actually gets more [indiscernible]. So from our perspective in the type of stuff that we want, we need to maintain a business focus and a balance that includes all 5 tools, I'm not going back to the -- based on analogy the past year's because you will make fun when I do, but we do need to make sure that our toes in the water with every single tool development, as well as acquisition as leasing. So making sure that stuff that we've been working on for a long time, that could really work out well for the long-term part, piece of the company even if it seems expensive, if you will, today because of the uncertainty and what's going to happen to those cap rates, doesn't to us to the extent we know that we'll never get a chance to own it again. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Don, you mentioned tenant negotiating leverage. And I think importantly, you mentioned about TI's possibly going up. Could you guide us a little deeper into to that? Because to me, it really feels like that is the variable that doesn't get a lot of attention that needs to. Donald Wood : All right. I completely agree with you. The notion of capital to get deals done, from our perspective, frankly, has always been an important part of our business. Because often, I don't mean going back in the redevelopments, but when we have the ability to get the right tenant in the space that's going to really help us solidify shopping center, with our cost of capital, we are willing to use it with respect to that tenant. Those tenants are demanding more today, there's no doubt about that, it's an important part. What has never happened is the understanding throughout our industry of the cost of the capital, no understanding for our industry whether it is likely that after a fix leave term and option is exercised so as to which how you lay out that capital, how you get a payback, how you determine in the contract what the capital is specifically used for, it's a big deal. It ain't an open check. It can't be an open check. So just like all other parts of our business, there are differences to between how capital is employed, what the terms are, and the period to how it gets effectively paid back. We are -- we treat TIs just like we treat request for redevelopment money, just like we treat request for acquisition money, or G&A for that matter. It's allocation of capital. There's no doubt that those trends are going negative from the standpoint of landlord that we are putting more capital out. We're also saying no a lot more, too. We're saying no where we're not comfortable as that capital is going to create a return based on the life of that tenant, based on the terms that they're demanding, in terms of the use of that money. It's part of the reason these things take longer for us to get deals that. We're not going to just build it to get a deal in there. And so I don't know how you look into it deeper, but I welcome it because I think that discipline for tenant capital is every bit as important as any other use of capital. Let me do my [indiscernible]. So thanks. Ki Bin Kim : And [indiscernible] percentage is way too tough to do it now. But what's the magnitude of that change you think? Daniel Guglielmone : I didn't understand the question. Ki Bin Kim : How much more capital is it -- are tenants asking for? Where is this trending? Donald Wood : Yes. I don't know that I can do that. Listen, if you take a look at our schedules and pull it together from long period of time and you look at all new leases, it's hard because there's a lot of in our redevelopment capital also, but over the years, I mean, there is a clear trend to additional capital. It's not crazy. I mean, it's nothing like you're saying, oh my God, these deals don't make sense anymore. But -- and I'm afraid you have to lay out a percentage because it's not any particular 90 days or even any year. But if you look back and you can look at it over 5 years or so or even more than that, you can get the idea that there's a slow increase in the demand, the movement of risk, if you will, to reach from landlords because they perceive our cost of capital being lower in some cases and because they can. In other cases, you have to have a point to say no on deals that don't make sense. Ki Bin Kim : And do you any quick update on the occupancy cost ratios for the tenants that you track? And how that's trended lately? Donald Wood : I really don't. It so hard for us. I think it's the least reliable metric that we have. Something less than 1/3 of all of our tenants report occupancy. The other thing about that is, I don't have a good number for you. I know that when we pull it together in some kind of a regular thing, that the last time we tried to make some big exercise to see kind of where that was, we're around 9%. And I still feel like that's about where we would be. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : One quick question on Freight Farm venture. Just want to get a little bit of sense of why you made the venture? What are you trying to get out of it? What's the thought process behind it? And then on a separate note, maybe if you could just talk about what are the potential negative surprises at this point? It seems like businesses doing well and the same-store don't find that. What would be a potential negative surprise at this point? Donald Wood : Well, that by the way, those 2 questions are very different. Let me start with the last one. I mean, the negative surprises are the things that are the macro surprises. They are the [indiscernible] that decide to close all their stores over a night. We have no more visibility that way. As I said before, we do have bad cushions in our assessment, that's part of our regular forecasting process that hits that. But there are negative surprise. And depending on who they are and what happens that, that is certainly a risk. Our construction cost absolutely remaining high. I'm actually really proud of how we do manage construction costs. It's -- we certainly have our overruns at times, but usually very small or manageable. Things come up, especially redevelopments that were not anticipated, but that's always a possibility. The issues on the negative surprises are very much macro issues today. In terms of Freight Farms, I appreciate you asking the question because it's deeper than Freight Farms, and I don't want to be on a high horse here at all. But I do want to say, we always look for ways to increase the value of our real estate. And it's kind of through and through, all of our ways of thinking. And the notion of -- I mean, sustainability throughout this company is kind of the way we think. We are an urban company. And so we don't have a lot of stuff in any stuff in rural areas, we don't have a lot of stuff in suburb areas. So there's an urban thought process throughout this company. It's why there's more solar income at this company per amount of GLA than I think anybody else. I know companies like Kimco may have more solar income, but they're a whole lot more real estate, too, despite the number. So what's really an important part of the way we think. The back of a shopping center that has -- that is not the most attractive place in the world, that has great restaurants outfront. The notion of being able to use a part of the unused part of the back to put containers that are able to grow vegetables with the right light, with the right water that the restaurants outfront can use, I call it farms to table, I guess it's container to table, effectively there is a really powerful thing. It's not a powerful in terms of the income generation that Federal gets from it. It's small, it's rounding. But what it does do is create a sense of community that we tend to believe in. And so that restaurant or that investor, et, cetera look favorably to things like that, and we get an outsized benefit for doing things like that as evidenced by the call -- your question on this call. But it's more about a mindset of how we look at our real estate and our responsibility environmentally. Daniel Guglielmone : Can I say one thing on that? I think it's also really important internally that the employees done really has driven this culture internally at Federal and it's something we're all very proud of. So as Don talks externally, I also wanted to make a point, it's really important internally to us, too. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Christopher Lucas : As you guys look to refinance the mortgages that the [indiscernible] got going and to grow very different products. Just curious as to sort of in the conversations that you're having with lenders, whether or not the conversations are different than you expected, whether or not there's a perspective that they're bringing that is different than you might have expected 6 months ago. Donald Wood : I would say that we are already kind of locked in on our refinancing of the Plaza El Segundo mortgage. It comes due in August, we have an open prepayment in June. We'll be refinancing it, I think, we got excellent execution. I think it will be sub-4%, 3.83% for $125 million, got to right size the mortgage. We had a lot of interest from both the insurance company and the lending market and CMB assets as well as balance sheet lenders. The lending market is still very, very strong even for retail properties. I think we're about to launch a refinancing of the October maturity for the growth. And we'll let you know when we get in different feedback as we enter that process. But we fully expect to get a very, very attractive pricing on that and kind of in the 3 handle on it with significantly improving from a cash interest expense and also from a GAAP interest expense, the financing costs will come down significantly on both of those. Christopher Lucas : So you got, what, about a $50 million GAAP in the refi between what the balance is on Plaza El Segundo and what the new mortgage will be, how are you planning on funding that? Daniel Guglielmone : With cash. Effectively, you get free cash flow, we've got asset sales that we've executed and that are in the pipeline. So it's a combination of those. When we acquired Plaza El Segundo, one of the variances we had was we were able to a very highly levered asset. We were able given kind of our balance sheet to be able to take that on and not face some of the issues that a lot of other buyers would have to deal with regards to absorbing that high leverage mortgage and satisfy the lender's requirements. So, yes, this is just the right size of it. And we fully have the cash on hand to kind of fill the gap there. Operator : I'm showing no further questions in queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Andress for any closing remarks. Leah Andress : Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. As Dan mentioned, we do have couple of slots up at NAREIT. Please let me know if you're interested in meeting with the team. Have a great day. Goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great afternoon.",

Hope you are all enjoying the summer and hopefully have taken a little bit easy this time of year. I assure you we're not. In an industry that's been under siege at least from an equity valuation standpoint for the last six months in particular, we're performing particularly well and not just measured by plugging holes for today, but most importantly, measured by positioning and investing in tomorrow. So here's a list of seven initiatives that we've been up to that will surely position us well. First, our recently announced, and in our view forward looking, $345 million investment in the partnership of Primestor, Los Angeles-based operator and developer of resale centers serving the underserved and densely populated Latino communities out west. I'll talk more about that in a bit. Second, the decade long creation, expansion and improvement of live, work, shop, play communities at Pike & Rose, Assembly Row and Santana Row. Third, the most active core repositioning program in our 55-year history with planning our construction underway in every state that we have a meaningful presence. Fourth, the investment committee approval to move forward with redeveloping and repurposing CocoWalk for $75 million or so in Greater Miami. Fifth, the $400 million issuance of 10 and 30-year unsecured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%. Sixth, the sale or near sale of a $120 million of real estate as components of Assembly Row and our San Francisco office building at a weighted average low-to-mid forecast. And seventh, a dividend raise for the 50th year in a row, every year since 1967 to $4 a share; the only REIT in any sector to be able to do so and one of the few companies in any business who have done so. By the way those dividends have grown at a CAGR of 7% over those 50 years. That's pretty amazing. So you take those seven major initiatives, all happening in this retail real estate environment off a base of great quality real estate conservatively capitalized as we report a record earnings quarter of a $1.49 per share, beating consensus and beating the prior year by 5%. That's a lot of stuff going on, much of its short-term dilutive, but all consistent with our mantra of long term increased cash flow and value creation. Of course the retail real estate environment remains tricky, but in our experience it is precisely at times and the sizes [ph] like this that higher quality real estate puts some distance between itself and lower quality portfolios. Dan's going to do the heavy lifting on this call and discussing the quarter. My remarks will focus on the reporting in the context of those seven initiatives. Digging into the reported FFO per share of $1.49, it's comparison to the second quarter of last year and what it means to the rest of the year, really requires an understanding of three competing components. First, the accretion that comes from the beginning of the rent starts and the strong leasing that we've been talking about over the past few quarters, along with meaningful contributions from our accretive capital allocations to development and redevelopment. Second, that accretive earnings positivity is somewhat offset by the loss rent from bankruptcies like Sports Authority and proactive property level with merchandising. That together contributed over $1.5 million in last year's second quarter and a big fat zero to this year's quarter, hence modestly negative same store growth excluding redevelopment. But that's only part of the story. Those same spaces that were causing over $1.5 million of dilution this quarter have been re-leased - they're very nearly re-leased to a far stronger tenant with a far better long term prospect, with new quarterly rental obligations of nearly $2.5 million. Trader Joe's or A.C. Moore at Assembly, Amazon Books for Brooks Brothers at Santana, Burlington for Sports Authority also at Assembly; you get the idea. After considering the capital required to get those deals done, value added exceeds $25 million. The net of those two things, rent starts and new leasing in the core and rent starts in developments and redevelopments, partially offset by old vacancies that have largely been released but are not yet renting are the two primary drivers to our earnings growth this season; both very positive from any real estate focus point of view. The third component that doesn't impact the quarter but that does impact the balance of the year is the delivery of three of our residential developments later in the third quarter and fully in the fourth. Harris [ph] at Pike & Rose, Montage at Assembly Row, and our 105-unit project in Towson, Maryland, on excess land that was part of our White Marsh acquisition some years back, will all be turned over to operations from development later this quarter and create the understandable and unavoidable earnings drag common to a partially leased out building. Leasing has commenced on all three buildings with Pike & Rose preleasing starting out strongest, 60 of 272 units are leased already, hitting and beating effectively our pro forma rent with occupancy beginning in September. Followed by Montage here at Assembly; Towson, which just started preleasing a couple of weeks ago, 30 units and 20 units respectively. Obviously, despite the dilution in the second half of '17 and '18 the expected value creation in those three buildings alone of over $100 million net of capital makes the short-term hit well worth it. I go through this top-down setup of some of the larger dynamics that affect our reported numbers, because in this retail real estate environment it takes a deeper level of analysis to assess the likelihood and extent of future cash flow increases. My comments are meant to make our path here clear and obvious to you. We're getting a lot of leasing done, as Dan will touch on and as our 8-K shows, and our mixed-use developments in shopping center redevelopments are all being done with an eye toward long term relevance. To be able to report and expect to continue to report cash flow and earnings growth, dividend growth, and most importantly, value creation when looking forward to the next three to five years is a strong testament to the demand that the strong majority of our real estate locations exhibit. As well as the open-mindedness and core competencies that we've developed internally to extract additional value from all the different types of real estate that we own. Now in that vein, we all believe internally that from a macro perspective our country is over retail, and supply exceeding demand has never been a good formula for creating higher real estate values. That's why we've never been bigger acquirers of commodity like shopping centers and have basically cherry picked our portfolio on a one or two off basis over the last 50 years. Now some years back we identified the Latino communities in our largest cities as a place where demographics were improving rather dramatically in terms of education, in terms of buying power, in terms of population. But that the mainstream retail offerings that supported that population were far behind, and that those urban populations centers were difficult to find land or redevelop even if retailers wanted to compete in them. Our primary obstacles historically in acting on that reality were internal. We didn't have the expertise in-house to build or serve the Latino community and that we couldn't find enough critical massive credit anchored retail centers to make a difference for a company our size. That changed this year, with our newly formed 90-10 joint venture with Primestor, the 25-year old Los Angles owned - owner and development - developer of premier retail properties serving the urban Latino customer in Southern California and founded by my fellow ICSC Trustee Arturo Sneider and Leandro Tyberg. We announced the closing of our venture in a separate press release couple of days ago, check out Primestor's website at primestor.com and our slide deck available on Federal Realty's website that goes through our investment pieces and rationale as well as an in-depth look at the seven properties that will be part of the venture. The portfolio is home to some of the most productive Ross, TJX and other national retail store in their respective companies. These are big regional shopping centers averaging about 200,000 square feet and comprising over a 100 acres of dense urban land. Jeff Berkes and I are available to answer questions about the prepared remarks and we're just starting to talk about organizing property towards later this year. An anticipation about questions - of questions about price and returns on investment approximately $345 million, $325 million now and $20 million to complete to redevelopment of one of the centers over the next two years. We expect the stabilized properties to yield in the low fives and the property under development Olivo at Mission Hills to yield in year six, when complete in 2019. It will be dilutive this year and next until development is complete and rent is commenced at this target Anchorage [ph] center. We believe rents throughout the portfolio are under market as these assets have over time established themselves as dominant regional shopping centers. Certain yield costs that are not capitalizable along with our open financing strategy will limit earnings accretion this year, so please consider that as you update your models. Primestor is right down in the middle of the play for Federal in terms of our most important business principle of owning and developing retail-based real estate properties that have the best chance for long term cash flow growth and value enhancement. To do that demand has to exceed supply and barriers to entry need to be present to make it difficult for competition to directly change that. This portfolio has those characteristics in state. We'll see - but we also hope to use this platform for future expansion. Now let me turn it over to Dan, to talk about the quarter, before opening up the lines for your questions. Daniel Guglielmone : Thank you, Don and Leah. And good morning, everyone. Federal had another record quarter for FFO per share in the face of increasing challenging retail environment. Our second quarter FFO per share of $1.49 represents a 5% increase over 2Q 2016 result of $1.42. We had another strong quarter on the leasing front with 432,000 square feet of total leases signed and 398,000 square feet signed on a comparable basis, which drove an average increase of 13% on a cash basis. This represents 18% on new leases and 12% on renewals. On a GAAP basis we put up a 27% increase. Our same store NOI grew 3.9%, which was well ahead of our internal forecast. This is impressive in the face - space of roughly 130 basis points of drag from our value creating releasing efforts that Don alluded to in his remarks as well as drag from a difficult term fee comparable relative to 2Q 2016. Our over overall portfolio stands at 94.5% leased and 93.0% occupied, which is flat with last quarter when you back out the impact of our recent acquisition in Berkeley, California which is just 55% occupied; more on that later. Please note that the 150 basis points spread between our leased and occupied rates at quarter end highlight leases that have been signed or rented as yet to commence and which should enhance growth over the next 12 months. On the anchor leasing front, we continue to make progress working for our excess vacancy. Of the 730,000 square feet of space we initially highlighted in November of 2016, we are up to 70% leased on that pool with releasing spreads at a positive 37%. The leases that are currently under negotiation that lease percentage will rise to north of 80% in the coming months. To highlight some of the activity. Burlington is taking the former Sports Authority space at Assembly Square in Boston next to Trader Joe's, which opens next week. Target taking the former Pathmark space in Parsippany, New Jersey where an 800 - where an $8 million capital improvement in plan is underway, and Michaels who is taking a portion of the old A&P space in Brick, New Jersey, joining the new line up which includes DSW and Opra [ph]. On the development front, Phase 2's at both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row are in the process of opening this quarter. At Pike & Rose, Rose Avenue and the extension of Grand Park Avenue have opened creating greater vehicular access to the property. REI's flagship has opened, Pinstripes opens this coming weekend and H&M, Sahora [ph] and Sur La Table among others are all set to open later in the third quarter. The 272-unit Henry Residential Building is scheduled to open later this quarter with strong preleasing momentum as Don mentioned. The Phase 1 residential units of Palace and PerSei stand at 97% leased and the condos continue to make progress with 34 of 99 under contract and activity picking up meaningfully as we're beginning to get perspective buyers up into the building for hard hat tours. At Assembly Row, the retail openings are in full swing with Colombia Sportswear, Mike's Pastry and the FitRow boutique fitness tenants among others all open. About two-thirds of the projected retail rents are expected to commence by year end. The 447-unit Montage residential building is scheduled to start delivery in September. And on the for sale front, 97 of 107 market rate condos are under contract, that's 91% complete, well above our expectations. As a result, this quarter we began recognizing gains on the sale of these condos under the percentage of completion method, and expect that it will begin closing in the first quarter of 2018. Please note that these gains will not be reflected in FFO. Additionally, during the quarter we closed on the sales of the land under both the Partners' office building and the Avalon Bay Phase 1 parcels with total proceeds of $53.4 million, a blended implied yield - NOI yield of 4.25% and a gain in excess of $15 million. At 700 Santana, construction continues on time and on budget for our 284,000 square foot office building. And you will see in our 8-K, CocoWalk has been added to our redevelopment schedule with a projected incremental cost of approximately $73 million to $77 million, a targeted incremental yields in the 6% to 7% range and an expected stabilization in late 2020 or early 2021. We're about to commence redevelopment on the west side of the property and expect to commence demo on the east side of the property in early 2018. On the acquisition front, as Don highlighted earlier, we invested in a roughly 90-10 joint venture with Primestor Development to own a seven property portfolio totaling 1.3 million square feet located in urban Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles California. But we also acquired a 90% interest in a 71,000 square foot retail asset located on Fourth Street in Berkeley, California for $22 million. While this asset is only 55% leased, it is located in one of the Bay Area's premier street retail districts and it has significant redevelopment potential over a long-term, which could include other usage. Given the existing vacancy there will be some modest near-term FFO dilution until we lease up the asset. Now with an update on the balance sheet. In late June we were opportunistic in accessing the unsecured bond market issuing $300 million of 10-year notes at a yield of 3.36% and reopening our 2044 notes to issue $100 million at an effective yield of 4.14%. That's $400 million of debt capital at a blended 3.6% rate with a weighted average maturity of the almost 15 years. That issuance lengthened the weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio to a sector leading 11-plus years and brings our weighted average interest rate to 3.95%. It positions us at quarter end with significant liquidity. As our $800 million credit facility was completely undrawn and almost - with almost $100 million of cash on the balance sheet as well. At quarter end our net-debt-to EBITDA remained flat at 5.6 times and the fixed charge coverage sits at an extremely healthy 4.4 times. As we move forward, we will continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively looking to operate over the long-term with leverage metrics in line with our A-minus rating. As a result we will access both the debt and the equity markets opportunistically. We also look to take advantage of the continued strong investment sales market for assets of Federal's quality, and selectively step up our acquisition - our asset disposition activity. In addition to the $53-plus million of dispositions completed so far this year, we expect to have up to an additional $70 million to $100 million sold by year end at a blended pricing which will not be dilutive to FFO. Also note, we forecast that we will generate free cash flow after dividend to maintenance capital of roughly $75 million in 2017. With respect to guidance, we are pleased with our outperformance this quarter, beating our internal projections and consensus by a few cents. Please note this outperformance was fairly broad based with stronger operation's been forecasted from both a revenue and expense perspective as well as failing retailers having less impact on our bottom line than forecasted. Also note that similar to the first quarter a portion of this outperformance is timing related, with respect to demo and other operating expenses pushing into the second half of the year. Roughly $0.01 is projected to be given back later this year. As a result we are increasing our 2017 FFO guidance to $5.86 to $5.94 increasing both ends of the range by $0.01. Additional considerations going into that upward revision are, one, the acceleration of our unsecured debt issuance relative to our forecasted timing of November, plus the fact we raised $100 million more than our forecast will be dilutive by almost $0.01 for the balance of the year. Secondly, we do not expect our recent acquisition activity Primestor and Fourth Street in Berkley combined to be added to FFO for the balance of 2017 due to deal costs over expense on Primestor and the initial dilution from the Fourth Street purchase. As it relates to same store, given another strong quarter, we are slightly modifying our expectations for same store growth in 2017 from about 3% to 3% or better. As you know, this guidance includes redev as this is the way we run our business with redevelopment being a critical and integral part of our operating and investment approach. Please note that we continue to contemplate a refined - and refine a revised approach to same store reporting and we will update you on this effort in the coming quarters. Before we go to Q&A, as I come upon my first anniversary at Federal, like I have done on past calls, I would like to share with you another observation I've made about Federal in what will be the final installment of this series. And that relates to the strength and the breadth of Federal's diversification, which is key to our balanced business strategy. Whether there's diversification by tenant or no tenant is greater than 3% of total revenues or by retail format where we are essentially retail format agnostic with the exception of in closed malls or by market where we operate in nine of the top MSAs in the U.S. Our diversification by tenant category however is something I would like to emphasize further, as managing our exposure to various segments is also central to our strategy. Federal's largest tenant categories by revenue are through discount apparel at 9%, full-service restaurants at 9%, full-priced apparel at only 9%, grocery stands at just 8%; fitness, health and beauty at 8%, office at 8%, residential at 7%; which is heading higher as we deliver Phase 2s at Assembly and Pike & Rose. Home furnishings' at 7%, entertainment at 6%, limited service restaurants in 4%, all the other categories totaled 24% with no single category of up 3%. Balance in our approach has always been a key stone at Federal's business strategy, whether it'd be related to capital allocation, balance sheet management, operational or development initiatives as well as merchandising and tenant exposure. This focus on balance has resulted in Federal not having significant revenue exposure to any one tenant category and positions us to outperform as we approach in more difficult and challenging retail environment moving forward. And with that operator, we can open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your question please. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. I guess just big picture. Given many of the changes in the retail real estate environment a concern I often hear is that it can be expensive to accommodate these changes, and I guess, the question is are you seeing the revenues or the rents paid in the position to make these shifts profitable? Donald Wood : Yes. That's a good question, Craig, and it's something we're on all the time. There is no doubt that that leverage has moved to tenants as we talked to before from landlords. There is also no doubt that we don't do deals - we don't need to do deals effectively that are - that don't make sense in and of themselves, and that's a really important part. When you look at the value creation that we've got, there is no doubt that even though there is more capital going out selectively, because we're not going to invest capital where we don't believe that income stream is going to be sustainable or be maintained. And I will tell you - let me give you one great example. When you look at our numbers this quarter, you will see that - you'll see a renewal that has a lot of capital in it. That is one specific deal on Greenwich Avenue and Greenwich Connecticut for our completely redone and extended lease term with better credit that we were able to enhance in terms of the deal that allowed us to put capital in a completely redone facts or looking to do that. We won't do that until all obviously it's been supported and it works in terms of the agreement that we have. But would we invest on Greenwich Avenue and Connecticut to be able to lockdown that location for the next 20 years, you bet we will. That's different than just say an overall comment of you're going to throw capital at deals - to make deals, because if you do that those deals often don't work. So the selectivity in terms of where it's being spent during this comes - certainly a change in the - in consumer buying habit has to be selectively applied. With great real estate you've got more choices to do or not do it. Without that great real estate it's harder and I believe that's really true. I'm sorry for the long winded answer but I hope that helps. Craig Schmidt : And just to change it a little on the Primestor operations, the densities that you're going to be dealing with will they be in line or even higher than your portfolio today? Donald Wood : They'll be higher than the portfolio today. Craig Schmidt : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your question please. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. So first question is just going to be the Primestor. Can you just walk us through bit on the sales productivity, the rent upside? And then when you guys are working with Primestor how the relationship is? The press release indicates they're managing it with you guys on the investment committee, but obviously you guys have a lot of capacity on your own. So how you're going to share that responsibility of managing plus the redevelopment? Daniel Guglielmone : You bet, Alex, and make sure you calling it Primestor, not star. But Jeff Berkes is on the call and I want to make sure that he takes the first shot at this. Jeff Berkes : Yes. Alex, let's talk about the second part of your question first and how we're going to run this JV. So as is the case in most JV's you have an operating partner and a capital partner and that's generally how this would setup. And as you pointed out we're pretty good operator at shopping centers ourselves. So we've worked something out with Primestor where they're going to be doing management, leasing, development and redevelopment services, and Federal is going to be handling lease documentation and accounting. So that's what the document says. All major decisions have to be approved by the partners and there's perimeters around what those major decisions are, right. That's a pretty traditional setup in a joint venture of this nature. Practically speaking, I think we are going to fit together kind of hand and glove, whether it's me and Arturo on big picture strategic and investment decisions, Juan Felipe [ph] and his asset management team with Primestor's asset manager Elena Chavez, Jeff Kreshek with their leasing person, Seth Bland with their development team. So that's the crew of executives out here at Federal and will be meshing directly with our counterparts at Primestor. And it's going to be a very interactive relationship. It's not going to be a situation where like a typical maybe institutional capital partner talks to their partner once a month or once a quarter and get some reports and makes a couple of decisions and moves on. We expect this to be a very, very active dialogue back and forth between the two of us. So does that cover you on the second part of your question? Alexander Goldfarb : Yes. But the first part Jeff, is on the sales productivity I assume it's the - it's a typical higher than average and then also what that translates to as far as rent upside. Jeff Berkes : Yes. I mean if you step back and look at everything big picture, there's a couple of things you need to keep in mind. First is, Primestor was or is the leader of developing high-quality retail space in the types of trade areas that Don mentioned in his remarks, which are very densely populated. Craig, to your question the population density within three miles of a Primestor center north of 300,000 and the Federal center is - it's a little bit less than half of that. So significantly more dense than our portfolio on average. Donald Wood : And Alex what they had to do to get this going is develop a story for the mainstream retailers, and if you look on Page 10 of the slide deck that we posted on our website their top 10 retailers are listed in there. The same retailers that you would see in our centers, right? And they started doing this literally 25 years ago but in this portfolio a solid 10 to 15 years ago, right? So the retailers that came into these centers got first-mover advantage in terms of rents. And if you look at the box rents in the portfolio the ABR is only 15 and if you look at the overall lands in the portfolio its only 21. And I would say two a box, every box in the portfolio is below market and below market by a pretty good margin. The most recent leases that were done at the redevelopment, two of them start with the two and one of them starts with the three. So that will give you a benchmark as to the spread between the in-place box rents and the market rents in these concentrated areas today, and its significant. Sales productivity, unfortunately, like our portfolio it's not like a mall portfolio where you have 85%, 90% of the tenants reporting. I think 35%, 40% of Primestor's tenants report. And when we look at those volumes and match them up to the volumes for the same tenant in our portfolio that's a very, very good matchup and when you look at the occupancy cost ratios and consider my first comment about where the rents are the occupancy cost ratios, particularly for the anchors and junior anchors are very favorable. We're talking low-to-mid single digits. So does that helps? Alexander Goldfarb : Yes, that helps. And then just quickly just following up, and then I'll get back in queue. You guys - are you guys paying any management fees to Primestor or that's all part of the cap rate? Donald Wood : No, we're paying a property management fee. And that's typical in a setup like this. Just like we got paid property management fee as part of our joint venture with Clairon that we formed in 2004 and dissolved in the last couple of years. The operating partner just paid management leasing fees. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeffrey Donnelly : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Dan, you mentioned the prospect of additional asset sales by year end. Federal has not historically been a seller of assets and with the stock I guess of an NAV discount. But the appetite for high quality product is still pretty robust. Have you guys considered using dispositions as an even larger funding source for your development pipeline or asset purchases in lieu of common equity? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Now I think it's something that certainly we've stepped up this activity this year. I think this year we expect to achieve the total asset sales we've made over the last five years. We are still constrained by the fact that we have significant gains embedded in our assets, so that gives us a little bit of limitation on how much we can step up that activity without kind of using 1031s to kind of mitigate those gains. However this year, I think we expect to - we have one asset under contract we expect to close as Don alluded to. We've got\u2026 Donald Wood : On that contract, just to be to clear to Dan's point, Jeff, that's because we bought River Point earlier in the year, we're able to 1031 into this. So we have a huge gain to the extent this property closes which we expected to. So we are limited by that in terms of creating cash beyond this. But there are some cases that we can cover it and that's what we're working through. Jeffrey Donnelly : I guess as a follow up. Are there any lack of a better term sacred cows in your portfolio? I mean do you see opportunities to dispose of some assets that might frankly be trophy quality but are fairly low growth and I guess I'm wondering can your 2018 disposition potential exceed what you're planning to do in '17? Donald Wood : It's great question, Jeff. There are absolutely no sacred cows in this portfolio. But what we do believe I mean this is a handpicked portfolio, one off. And so when it comes to - I hate using the word trophy but to the extent we've built something or created something which we believe is the future, which is a real big part of what you should be thinking about, right, 2022 instead of 2012 out there. We believe in the long-term growth of those assets. It's not because they're sacred cows, it's because we love them is because the future potential on them. So I hope that helps. Jeffrey Donnelly : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy : Hey, good morning. Just a follow up on Jeff's question in regard to asset sales, the $54 million plus another $70 million to $100 million of sales that helps you keep Primestor at an almost leverage neutral basis, it doesn't get you all the way there. How are you thinking about leverage given all the irons in the fire you have in the redevelopment side as well? And just to clarify in the $70 million to $100 million maybe some more color on what you're planning to sell on timing? Daniel Guglielmone : Well, I think the $70 million to $100 million is inclusive of the West Coast office building that Don alluded to, and we've got another asset or two that are in the market and in the queue. But with regards to - I alluded to it in my remarks and I think we positioned the balance sheet to allow us to be opportunistic with additional issuance of debt and equity. Be opportunistic on the asset sale front, utilize the free cash flow that we'd continue increase and generate in our business. And the A minus rating affords us other opportunities to tap into the capital markets. We'll be opportunistic but we think we've positioned the balance sheet to absorb Primestor I think very, very comfortably. Donald Wood : Christy, the only thing I would add to that is, if you look at our track record, this whole notion of balance where it's so critical to who we are. So we do equity we don't do big amounts of equity. We do debt deals, a big source of debt in relation to the overall market and even on the asset sales for other reasons. We try to use all the tools in the tool box here. So it's all on the table of course, as we run our business plan including finishing out the Phase 2s of these assets. But you shouldn't expect to see anything that makes us say, oh my god, well - crazily diluted or anything. The choices that we make are balanced, it's just critical to what we do. Christy McElroy : Got it. And then just Dan, you might have then used 3% or better forecast for same store NOI growth, how should we take that? I think you were previously expecting a deceleration in the second half, has that changed now? How should we think about the trajectory there? And how much of this Splunk lease really contributing to the growth rate? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. No, I think that given in combination with a lot of the proactive releasing activity that is a drag on our portfolio, I think that we will see some deceleration in the second half of the year but we still feel comfortable that we'll exceed that 3.0% number. And Splunk, over the course of the year, is kind of in that the ballpark of about 200 basis points. But we fully - if you think about the drag that we have of about a 130 basis points on our proactive releasing efforts relative to last year, I think that we felt comfortable, given the first half performance on the same store basis to kind of a give a little bit of increased and modified expectation of 3% or better. Donald Wood : Christy, I want to add one thing if I can about Splunk. It's important. It's hard if you think about all the irons in the fire and the office stuff that we do, the residential stuff that we do, all the proactive redevelopment. It's hard to kind of put a matrix up and have Federal's numbers on an apples-to-apples basis with every other shopping center company that's out there. You know I don't believe in it in terms of how we look at the over the lines module on same store. But Splunk, the ability to put - you guys, our investors gave us $112 million that we put to work at a nine, and we put that to work here at Santana Row because of all the decade and a half of work that created the environment in the first place to allow that to happen. So I never want to sound or feel anyway apologetic for that investment - actually the investments that we make, and that it's at a stabilized property of ours. And I just want to make sure that when you look at Federal in total it doesn't fit the box exactly of a shopping - a grocery and a shopping center company which we're offering compared to. It sure checks every box in terms of growing cash flow and value creation. That's the only point I want to make. Christy McElroy : Great. Thanks, Don. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your question please. Paul Morgan : Hi, and good morning. About the Primestor acquisition and to say that's part of your strategy, I mean how specific is this to the opportunity that you sourced and how would you consider expanding that type of focus in terms of your investments to the rest of Coastal California or South Florida or other markets that have kind of similar kind of stuff markets where there might - those opportunities might exist for you? Donald Wood : That's a great question, Paul, and I - and let me put it in this context. Our job is to on a risk adjusted basis make investment decisions that give us the best chance to create an increasing stream of cash flow and value creation. And when it comes to thinking about 2022 and not 2012 and you think about the fact that there's a lot of retail in this country that mind you is obsolete in terms of where we are going, not today, where we are going. And when you sit and you think about that and you've got a community that has basically 6.5 square feet of retail space per capita and a ridiculously low number compared to everywhere else in the United States, it's pretty clear to us that the serving of those customers is behind the income generation and the population growth and the education increase that have happened within that population. So sure, we love that. In fact as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean we wanted to do this, I wanted to do this in Miami six or seven or eight years ago. We just couldn't find - first of all, we didn't have the expertise and second of all, we couldn't find enough critical mass. The fact that Primestor has been doing it and getting it to this point over its period of time, and that we can have this relationship with them is really important to the future. And when you think about the high-end mixed used stuff that we have on one side of the company and that's 25% or 30% of the company or so, this part in terms of demographics and density that is so important to us on the other side and growing, yes, I certainly hope we can use this as a platform to increase first in Southern California and then over time we'll see about other markets. But there's clearly more to do in Southern California. Paul Morgan : Great thanks. And then to my other question, Dan you mentioned going from, I think, it was 70% to over 80% soon in terms of the 730,000 square feet of anchor space. And I was wondering if you give me an update about kind of the cadence of those openings and how much will kind of hit in the fourth quarter versus various points in '18 and into '19? Donald Wood : Yes. That schedule that we've been handing out does exactly that and it does do exactly that. And actually I'm just buying time for Dan to get out - get that out in front of him. So you can get a pretty good idea as Daniel, if he can kind of layout just in rough numbers how much in balance of '17, how much in '18 and then '19. '19 on those deals - yields are when do you've got most of it in there. But it will be coming up rather strongly through the second half of '18 and that's probably the deal - is the second half of '18 deal, for example, at Assembly. Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. And just to go on and in terms of - I think we had talked previously that we would expect kind of the balance of the leasing and - the lease rollover on the latter half of our - the pool of leasing to be done to be lower than the first half. The first 70% was done at 37%. We still expect the lease rollover to be north of 20% on the balance of this based at what we're looking on, and kind of a handful of deals that we expect to sign over the next quarter or two that won't start producing until and rent commencements until later in the year in 2018. We would expect that in the balance of '17 roughly 35% of the prior rent would hit go up to 66% in total for 2018 and then hit a run rate and hit a kind of more stabilized level in 2019. Paul Morgan : So those newer deals are more consistent with that kind of 20% range than what you've done in\u2026? Daniel Guglielmone : It's probably, yes, more kind of in a - on a blended basis called in a mid-20s as opposed to kind of what we had talked about 15% to 20% previously. So we continue to see on our anchor releasing, strong productivity for that pool that we - that 730,000 foot pool - square foot pool that we talked about last November. Paul Morgan : Great thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So going back to Primestor, I think you guys mentioned that this might your vehicle to do more deals and - it is vehicle, right, versus wholly-owned on the balance sheet. So just curious why would you choose to use this vehicle versus wholly-owned, and if there is also a promote going back to the GP? Donald Wood : Yes. Let me start and then Jeff, please feel free to join in. Look the - all the conversations that we've had on this call so far do talk about how it is that we can best execute on a principal that we believe in. The principal that we believe in is clear. Demand exceeding supply in those markets. Now you have to ask how you go get it done, what's the best way to get it done, and we have - personally, we've had little success previous to this in - and as I said in Miami, where this was the specific thing that we've been looking at. And frankly, and let me just jump in for a second, Art Coppola is a great guy to talk to about this at Macerich, I know you're jumping on his call later. Ask him what he thinks about this strategy. Because the issue has always been how to execute under this strategy and to be able to take the work that was done for basically two decades in this space by folks that understand their customer way better than we do. It makes - it's such a risk reducer from a Federal Realty perspective to have a near 90% interest in these real estates - but more importantly this real estate but mostly to have a partner. That is - Primestor is a real company, I mean there's 30-35 people of at that company who are out there every day working at this. We can't duplicate that on our own. And so if you believe you've got something or you've found something where demand exceeds supply, and I think challenge most of the stuff you're talking about in our business over the next five years to give you comfort, that demand will exceed supply. This one is the easiest to do that. And so the execution of it this way gives us the best choice. Jeff, you want to add anything to that? Jeff Berkes : Yes, I mean - just following up a little bit Don on what you said. Keep in mind that like Don said, Primestor is not two or three guys and a New York [ph] office that just happened to have a few assets and needed some capital, right. They've been around since 1992, 25 years. 30 to 35 people, and they have a material investment in our joint venture going forward. They are committed, as are we, to growing and expanding this strategy in Latino community in Southern California and hopefully beyond that and other markets where we operate, provided we're able to find the kind of trade areas like we have here in Southern California where demand exceeds supply. That's what it's all about, that's what we intend to do. And it's important to know that because a lot of times when you hear about joint ventures where read or some other institution is coming in with an operating partner, the operating partner is just that. It's a handful of people that don't really have a real investment in the deal and that don't have the unique skill set and Primestor certainly does. This is not something that really we or anybody else that's like us could go and then do. It's taken them years to develop relationships with the communities that they operate in and the tenants - to help the tenants understand that they can come into these centers and be very productive and make money and that's very valuable. And without them\u2026 Donald Wood : And to promote what we are doing. Jeff Berkes : To promote, yes, there's a promote. It's a backend promote and it's over an IR hurdle just like again a traditional joint venture structure. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And before I get to my second question, I've realized you guys definitely deserve the market credit for using your capital correctly on kind of a risk-adjusted basis for a TI usage. But I'm looking at Page 25 in your supplemental and your new lease deals. If I look at deals in the fourth quarter of '16 and third quarter of '16, they were cash flow accretive deals, meaning the rent increase you got offset the annual full-in CapEx that you were spending. But if look at the couple of deals this first half and in second quarter, first quarter, it looks like the TIs you're spending were above the annual rent increases. Obviously this is not meant to be a gotcha question just curious to see what was happening there. Donald Wood : Well, I'm going to - Dan's looking at the schedule particularly, but let me give you the overall answer to that, Ki Bin. When you look at the deals we do and a bunch of these deals are in properties that we're redeveloping because that's just part of what we do. One of the things that I've always had an issue with and that we're trying to figure out in our reporting is how this works out with the redevelopment schedule. Because overall, when we're doing deals in a redeveloped shopping center or a shopping center that we're trying to redevelop, I can tell you that the capital that is going into any particular deal works within the overall investment committee approved budget of that overall shopping center redevelopment. Are there deals that we will do to effectively - subsidize deals that effectively get other things done in that redevelopment, sure there are. But overall, that when you look at the value creation in that redevelopment the capital in there works. Now how to translate that to the specific 8-K and what it says, I got to turn it to Dan and let - because I don't have to add anything to it. But that is the single biggest thing and I love that you're looking at capital. I think you should look at it all the way around and I think you do. If you come back - if you come down and we kind of go through some of those redevelopment economics you'll see what I mean pretty clearly. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your question please. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. I guess just two quick ones here. Maybe just to kind of bring the discussion back to the core portfolio. Don, could you or Chris maybe just discuss kind of what you are seeing in the overall leasing environment and maybe if you guys have looked at a kind of watch list or have a running watch list how would you say that that watch list of tenants sort of stacks up today versus maybe six to 12 months ago? Donald Wood : Yes, I'll start on that and Chris is here and will add to it certainly. I mean look when I look at it there is no doubt I still worry about a senior [ph] more than anybody. That's the single biggest tenant that I look at and try to figure out what's going to happen with them, how they're going to remain relevant and pay rents and stay in deals. That is a six months certainly - six-month tenant that's impactful. Overall, it's about - it feels like all of the concern with respect to the environment that was really at its peak I guess it's really the end of the first quarter and in that period of time hasn't changed much in the past 90 days, from what we could tell. When we're looking at our perspective bad debt, when we're looking at some of our outperformance has been because things that we thought would go wrong have not, yet to this point. Will it come in the future? Sure. It's our watch list, it's our worry about the business which is why it's so important to make sure you've got visibility on cash flow growth wherever it's coming going forward. But I don't see it over the last 90 days as a very different, actually a little bit better than maybe the overall worry, but it's there. Chris, you want to add to that? Christopher Weilminster : Yes, I would just say that where we do get sales info we certainly pay attention to the rent of sales ratios and keep an eye on it. I think in general when we match that up against what you can find on this companies on a public basis or reported basis, we're in fairly good shape from that standpoint and where we do see those issues I can tell you we are very proactive in our releasing efforts to be prepared when they go down. As far as Steve, is the activity in the market I mean we are seeing a lot of good activity in the market. We are seeing in bulk category, the entertainment category, the arts & crafts category, cosmetics and programs, fast fashion. Target certainly is out there still looking at doing these smaller deals and the Total Wine is growing in a big way. The at leisure apparel whether its Lulu, Atheleta or Nike or Under Armor, all of those categories are growing. So we are finding the replacements. They may not be the ones that looked at in the past but we are finding lots of replacement tenants that lease to move being value added to the merchandize mix in our properties. And then the other thing we're keeping our eye on as the - as you do and you guys have a much better sense based on the mall related rents sales ratios, as these retailers that are mall based say, \u201cI can't afford to continuing to operate those high rents sales ratios\u201d, we are actually starting to receive phone calls than what have been traditionally mall-based retailers say, \u201cHey, Federal, I want to earn more value portfolio\u201d and the opportunities are for us. So overall even though as Don talked about and as we clearly acknowledge the retail world right now is very unpredictable, we do and are mining grade opportunities to back fill our assets in a way that I think is improving what we offer to the communities we serve. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I guess just second question. Don, when your sort of look at the Primestor portfolio and the growth, I mean I guess you guys have historically been very good about finding little jewel box assets you can add to the portfolio that have generally had equal or maybe better long-term growth. How do you sort of look at the growth of the Primestor portfolio over the next say five years? I know Jeff talked about getting some of those boxes back at higher rents. And then what do you think the opportunity is to deploy more capital with this JV partner over the next say three to five years? Donald Wood : Yes. So well first of all, we closed - let me take it from the end to the - so and we closed this morning or last night. So figuring out how our relationship's going to work and what that turns out to be, its early. Obviously, you always start out with big hopes and also we are going to make sure that we've done everything we can to let that happen. But we know - I mean the relationship that Jeff has with Arturo, that I have with Arturo - and that company, we've had a lot of discussion. We've been talking about this for a long time with respect to this is the opening day. This is the last day. So there is no doubt that with respect to the existing portfolio I think Jeff has - I mean it's obvious that the rents are under market, it's also obviously that they're long-term leases. And so the idea that immediately there's going to be a big pickup in the rent growth as a result the of big pieces in the portfolio that's not the case. This is longer term in terms of that. But the notion that we are right away working together to see where else we can exploit this notion of serving customers that are underserved that's starts now. So I am hopeful that you'll see us grow this portfolio over the next few years. And it probably won't be outside of Los Angeles for the first couple of years anyway. And then to the extent going away we hope it's going, maybe there's something we can do in other markets with this team. It's a real team. I mean this is a real strategic add to Federal Realty's arsenal. The five-tool player thing maybe it's a six-tool. Jeff, you want to add? Jeff Berkes : I think you covered it pretty well, Don. The growth on our underwriting is not - is similar from our existing portfolio comparing on how you look at it or over what period of time you look at it, it's kind of mid-two to three without giving any space back early. And without maybe tweaking around the edges on some of the assets and adding a pad here and there or acquiring an adjacent property. So I'd call it again, right now down in the middle of the play in terms out backs up from annual NOI growth perspective to the rest of our portfolio. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. That's it for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Your line is open. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Just a couple on Primestor. First, was this a marketed deal? Jeff Berkes : It was, but in a different way that we ended up executing it is probably the best way to say it. They came to the market with an advisor to a select group of people and what they were looking for really didn't work or fit for our needs, and we were able to craft a bigger relationship with them out of the discussion and ended up where we ended up. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. Yes, I'm just wondering also what other types of buyers may have involved in the bidding process here, just sort of curious? Jeff Berkes : Yes, I would say the usual suspects. I would imagine that their advisor did a good job of talking to other institutions and possibly other REITS, and what you would expect in this kind of process, right. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. And I guess\u2026 Donald Wood : Let me just add one thing to that. Primestor had a lot to say here in terms of who they wanted to marry up with because we basically took out cap serves in terms of the money to in the biggest way. And so the idea of who they were going to partner with was going to be where was their shared vision, where was there something more than just a money partner who was going to put this together and be able to see things in terms of the way we see merchandising communities and where we're at we're adding value. So I think there was a common ground early on in our negotiations with the Primestor team that was important. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. And just one last Primestor question. How much is left at Primestor that you would be interested in buying or is there other California land they own that would be development opportunities, and I'm also just wondering if you have any source of rights of first offer on any future properties Primestor is looking to sell? Jeff Berkes : Yes, to take the last part of the question first. We definitely have priority on new investments, again, that's a pretty typical feature in any joint venture. In terms of what they have in the portfolio right now that didn't come along with us, I think for the most part we got license that we got - we were able to invest in what we wanted to invest in. Nicholas Yulico : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning. Your line is open. Floris van Dijkum : Great, thanks guys. I wanted to follow up on the comment Dan made about the way that your tenant base is mixed up or mixed I should say not mixed up, and how that - how has that changed over the last five years? Have you seen increases in food and entertainment for example, and decreases in apparel, I'd be curious to get your take on that obviously. The malls are rapidly changing as well. Donald Wood : It's a great question, Floris. I mean look the idea of our overall investments in our properties and what we're trying to do to make them as relevant and that is such a word, man, that's the word, relevant five years from now. We kind of - everything we kind of do is look forward five and look back five. And when you think about the difference between back five and 2012 in terms of where the prospects future are and forward five to 2022 they're very different. So obviously we want to use retail. But the reason we use retail as the center piece is because that is how we get gatherings of human beings to experience life. So whether that is in a grocery anchored shopping center that is - in very most of in our cases the best center in that market or whether it's a big mixed used project or whether it's in a Primestor asset frankly, what we are talking about is the merchandizing that is going to be sustainable relevant five years from now. So you bet, you've obviously seen because of the mixed used form of our business, the increase in our residential income stream and the increase in our office rent income stream. So that starts out as 15% of our income stream between the two at this point, and yes, that is - that continues to grow. But you do see additions to entertainment, the right type of food uses, there hasn't been an increase in our grocery business in any significant way. There's been redevelopment and bettering of the ones that are there, there's been investments that way, but not in the overall income stream. That is 8% that has been about 8% more before we had the residential and the office component throughout the company obviously. And when you get down to health and beauty, there is no question. We've made the specific effort to increase health and beauty and fitness as a component. And it all ties in to where we see the world going in 2022 in the particular markets that we're in. So I hope that helps. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks, Don. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeffrey Donnelly : Hey guys just two quick follow ups. One, I think Dan, you had said that the drag on same store NOI in the quarter was about a 150 basis points from the managed vacancy. Is that a similar pace that you maybe expect in Q3 and Q4 this year? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. And I think it should - it may moderate a little bit as some of the proactive releasing the tenants take occupancy and start rent pay. So it should stay healthy but it should moderate as Trader Joe's is opening here at Assembly, kind of this month, and so, we would expect obviously that would reduce the amount of drag for the third quarter. But it still will impact kind of the balance of the year generally, but it should kind of diminish over the third quarter and further on the fourth quarter as tenants open. Jeffrey Donnelly : And on CocoWalk, I'm just curious as you move towards I guess the getting demolishing work at that property, how should we think about maybe the dilution that could hit FFO in 2018 from that? Donald Wood : Yes. It's a real good question. I'm looking at over a bit. I want to make sure that doesn't get lost. I don't want everybody to supply numbers because we do have dilutive value creative of things. The demolition will basically be done in the first quarter of 2018, that goes the right to the P&L. Number, rough, pick a number out of your head. I'm looking at - there's all kinds of things happening. I mean that's $0.015. So that's the start. That doesn't include the fact that tenants that were paying rent will no longer be paying rent while we work it through. So that's - I don't know if you want to use two cents on that enough, but you got two cents sometime certainly in that on CocoWalk in 2018. Jeffrey Donnelly : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Andress for any closing remarks. Ma'am? Leah Andress : Thanks for joining us today. Have a great rest of summer and we look forward to seeing you this fall. Goodbye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference.

Really good quarter for us folks between another earnings beat this year at $1.50 a share of FFO to strong initial residential leasing progress at the new phases of both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row to the successful integration of our Primestor joint venture in California, to an oversubscribed preferred stock capital raise that one of the lowest coupons ever offered in our space, this company continues to address and face head on the challenges to retail-based real estate, with more arrows in our quiver than most and a clear vision for the future. We are not playing defense, we are on offense and we are moving the ball aggressively. At $1.50 a share of FFO this quarter, which is 6.4% higher than last year\u2019s comparable quarter and our newly raised dividend rate of $1 a share per quarter, we are generating more into net cash from operations than ever before, some $75 million annually and the most efficient capital source and deploying it into value-creative repositionings and developments on both coasts. Our leasing was strong this quarter, 82 comparable deals, 400,000 square feet at rents that were 14% higher than the previous leases, 23% higher on deals with new tenants, 8% higher on renewals. In addition, we did 25,000 feet of new and non-comparable deals at Pike & Rose, at Assembly, and in other places at an average rent of more than $55 a foot and by the way, tenant improvement dollars were down overall in the quarter. Japanese retailer, Muji, with more than a dozen locations in New York and California, was a big contributor with a lease signed on Third Street Promenade n Santa Monica, replacing Abercrombie & Fitch, as was Target in Parsippany, New Jersey with their brand new smaller format replacing the bankrupt, Pathmark supermarket at Troy Shopping Center. Rent from both of those deals will commence later in 2018. Lease termination fees were also up during the quarter by about $2.8 million, attributable primarily to two tenants, the reorganization of the La Madeleine restaurant chain, along with the withdrawal of all U.S. Kit and Ace stores. I talk a lot about the strength of our leases from a landlord perspective and what an important part of our business plan they are. And these are two tenant failures that are great examples of what I am talking about. On average, we received the equivalent of about 2 years of full rent through about as fast and efficient a negotiation as you can have and fully expect to backfill those highly desirable spaces long before that. The ability to do that had everything to do with the non-financial parts of the lease. This was a very strong leasing quarter. Also in the quarter, you will note that overall occupancy improved to 93.8% compared to 93.0% at the end of the second quarter and 93.1% a year ago. Turning space over at Target at Troy Shopping Center and BroadSoft and Amazon at Santana for their build network there were the largest contributors. Assets and results of the Primestor joint venture are included in the quarter as of August 2, the closing date, and our teams are working closely together. With respect to Primestor, we are actively pursuing an additional smaller acquisition together with them in Southern California and also are actively marketing one of the assets that we bought in the joint venture for sale. Our entire team remains extremely bullish about the productivity of this relationship, serving the underserved Latino population. On the development front, residential leasing and occupancy kicked in full force this quarter at both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, the Henri & the Montaje, respectively and initial demand is impressive. At the Henri at Pike & Rose, 140 units of the 272 total have already been leased at an average of $2.35 per foot, well above budget in terms of pace, slightly above expectations in terms of rent. And by the way, the 493 Phase 1 Apartments remain 95% leased despite the new supply coming on the project, that\u2019s important. In addition, 44 of the 99 for-sale condominiums are under contract at/or above budgeted pricing with closings beginning in the middle of 2018. We are off to Boston here \u2013 to Somerville. At Montaje, at Assembly, 97 units of the 447 total rental units have been leased at an average of $3.40 a foot, well above budget in terms of rent, slightly above budget in terms of expectations and in terms of pace. And most impressively, 106 of the 107 market rate for-sale condominiums are under contract at over $850 per square foot and are scheduled for closing in the first half of 2018. It\u2019s noteworthy to mention that this building sold out without any of the purchasers physically walking through their units as the building is still under construction. The location and amenity-rich environment was enough. The expected proceeds are more than $10 million higher than we anticipated. Both of these projects are coming into their own very nicely and of course the lease up of the apartments will create dilution in earnings drag of a few cents per quarter, particularly larger in the fourth quarter than the third. There is no surprise there, I hope. The retail leasing on both projects are also progressing though not as fast as we would have liked. Seems like every deal these days takes longer than it should, but the anchor systems at both projects are all set, but there is still some wood to chop in the shop space. 88% of property operating income at Pike & Rose and 74% at Assembly are under signed leased or fully executed LOIs and tenant openings at both projects have begun this quarter and will continue throughout 2018. Construction at 700 Santana Row continues in earnest and on budget and on schedule. Two other points I want to make on this call and the first relates to same-center growth. Computing same-center growth with and without redevelopment consistent with the way that we have for years reflects growth of 4.4% and 2.6% respectively. But as you know and as Dan will discuss further, we believe that the same-center metrics, historically used in our industry, are of limited use for companies whose business plan is based not on triple-net lease properties or commodity type asset management, but on a wide variety of value creative strategies deployed on an even wider variety of real estate types and sizes. And accordingly, we have been considering a metric that might better reflect our portfolios period-over-period income contribution that might be more germane to our firm\u2019s approach to operations and investment. In that regard, we are also disclosing, what we call, comparable property growth, a measure that starts with GAAP, operating income before depreciation, before G&A, of course, taken directly from our income statement and then adjusted for those assets that\u2019s historic comparability between periods in two categories, either newly acquired or sold properties or those that are under development or being positioned for significant redevelopment and investment. On that basis, which we call comparable property results, those assets grew 3% during the quarter. You will note additional disclosure in our Form 8-K that reconciles comparable property results with the primary income statement and provides capital spent at those properties during the period. Of course, there is not a direct correlation between capital spent in the current period and the current period\u2019s results as there is obviously a lag of 12 to 36 months or more between capital deployment and a return on that capital. And finally, if there is one takeaway from my prepared remarks today that I would love investors to thoughtfully consider. I hope it\u2019s the understanding that in these days of dramatically changing consumer behavior and technological change, the idea of measuring this business every 90 days is really tough to do. We thoroughly and completely believe that the retail real estate-based companies will not only survive, but thrive in the quarters, years and decades to come, will be those who have positioned themselves to this point for their assets to be the real estate of choice for the widest possible selection of tenants, not any particular tenant, the widest possible selection of tenants, not a narrow, limiting business plan, but a broader, wider funnel in selected markets. It seems to us that in order to best positioning ourselves for that outcome, location matters more today than it ever has and assets need to be in flexible formats that can be approved upon through profitable reinvestment. And that\u2019s a big one, because on many retail based properties in the United States, the new revenue numbers that we generated after redevelopment just aren\u2019t enough to justify the investment. And lastly, that\u2019s truly enhancing the experience, the place making, the tenant line up and the customer service at those places is both critical and harder than it sounds. Creating the environment is a lot more than just going down at cool things to-do checklist. So, that\u2019s it. Everything that this company is doing today even if modestly short-term earnings dilutive is meant to be able to act on this necessary long-term philosophy. The fact that we are doing it while still growing current earnings and still growing current cash flow at the same time is a true testament to quality of our real estate and our team\u2019s vision and execution competencies of that vision. Now, let me turn it over to Dan to talk about the quarter before opening up the lines to your questions. Daniel Guglielmone : Thank you, Don and Leah and hello everyone. Our team feels really good about another record quarter in the face of the challenging retailing landscape. Our third quarter FFO per share of $1.50 beat our internal projections by a full $0.02. This outperformance was primarily driven by stronger than expected NOI growth as well as getting some term fees earlier than we had forecasted. Don told you about the strong leasing we had in the third quarter, but let me tell you that the momentum continues into the fourth quarter with HomeGoods signing on at Brick Plaza to join a lineup of Ulta, DSW and Michaels and the former A&P, Dollar Tree and Tuesday Morning spaces, and a new anchor who we can\u2019t disclose just yet, signing on as part of a repositioning of an infill Washington, D.C. asset of ours. This latter lease being another example of our proactive releasing activity, creating short-term vacancy and dilution in order to achieve significant upside from a value creation, growth and merchandising perspective. Our same-center growth with redevelopment was a solid 4.4%, again beating our internal forecast. Same-center NOI without redevelopment rebounded with a solid 2.6% increase. While these metrics were helped by a positive term fee comp of 70 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively, note that these same-center results were achieved in the face of roughly 70 basis points of drag from our value-creating, proactive re-leasing efforts, which as I mentioned, position our portfolio to outperform for the long-term but create short-term drag on our growth rate. As Don highlighted in his remarks, we have introduced a new metric, comparable property POI growth, which was 3% for the quarter. We believe this metric best reflects our core portfolio level performance and is more applicable to our business strategy and our capital allocation approach. Please note that we intend to provide all three same-center metrics over the coming quarters in order to provide comparability and continuity before ultimately transitioning to a comparable POI metric. Now, let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet. We closed on our Primestor 90 :10 joint venture in August for $340 million, which includes the assumption of $79 million of debt. I would like to take the next couple of minutes to lay out how we positioned our balance sheet to comfortably absorb this acquisition. Let\u2019s first look at our disposition activity. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of 150 Post Street, our boutique office and street retail building in downtown San Francisco for $69 million as well as the sale of North Lake Shopping Center in suburban Chicago for $16 million. That brings our gross disposition proceeds to the year-to-date up to $138 million. The blended cap rate for these dispositions is in the mid-4s, representing a meaningfully accretive form of capital and also a testament to the quality of Federal\u2019s portfolio, even our non-core assets. With respect to our disposition pipeline going forward, we have an additional $200 plus million of assets under contract or being marketed, which we expect to close over the course of 2018. These include the condos at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, which have zero income dilution associated with them and two other non-core assets, which should sell for a blended 5% cap rate. Our ability to sell non-core but high-quality assets accretively is another competitive advantage in Federal\u2019s capital markets arsenal. To further enhance the positioning of our balance sheet, we opportunistically turned to the preferred market, where in late September we issued $150 million of perpetual preferred stock at a 5% dividend rate. That\u2019s the lowest preferred rate for a REIT so far in 2017 and the second lowest rate ever achieved by a REIT. Perpetual equity, with a fixed 5% cost and a one-way call option for Federal after 5 years, is extremely attractive permanent equity capital and further illustrative of us taking advantage of our A- rating and fortress balance sheet to opportunistically and attractively fund our capital needs. At quarter ends, we had strong liquidity, with just $42 million outstanding on our $800 million credit facility. While our net debt to EBITDA ratio edged up to 5.8x, note that with $200 plus million, a $200 plus million disposition pipeline in 2018, combined with the significant levels of EBITDA, a high proportion of which is contractual, coming online from the second phases at Assembly and Pike & Rose, we fully expect our net debt to EBITDA ratio will come back down into the 5x to 5.5x range over the course of 2018. Our first charge coverage sits at an extremely healthy 4.14x and is forecast to improve as well over the course of \u201818. Additionally, we will generate, as Don mentioned, free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital of roughly $75 million in 2017 and forecast similar levels or more in 2018. As we move forward, we will continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively, looking to operate over the long-term with leverage metrics in line with our A- rating. Now, on to guidance, we are pleased with our continued outperformance this quarter, beating our internal projections and consensus by a couple of cents. This outperformance was fairly broad-based with property NOI coming in higher than expected, less impact than forecasted from failing tenants and higher term fees than originally expected in the quarter. However, we do expect to get some of that back in the fourth quarter. We have modest short-term dilution from our preferred issuance relative to our original forecast. We will also incur some costs associated with the upgrading of our accounting and IT platforms, in addition to the dilution that Don mentioned earlier from our commencing on the delivery of our residential units at The Henri, the Montaje and Towson, in total, 825 units that will be delivered into 2018. As a result, we are tightening the range of our 2017 FFO guidance to $5.89 to $5.92 per share, essentially affirming guidance with a slight uptick. As it relates to same-center growth with redevelopment for 2017, given another strong quarter, we affirm our estimate of 3% or better for the year. Now on to 2018, as most of you know Federal successfully reorganized its operating structure into a more decentralized model back in 2015. As a result, this year we took on the task of restructuring our budgeting process with the goal of providing a more robust forecast of future performance given this decentralized approach. As a result, our budgets will not be completed until mid-December. Therefore, we are providing just a preliminary estimate of 2018 FFO per share of $6.06 to $6.26. We expect to refine this outlook and provide official guidance during our fourth quarter call in February. At that time, we will also provide an estimate of our comparable property POI metric. And with that, we look forward to seeing many of you in Dallas in a couple of weeks. Don, Jeff, Melissa, Leah and I will all be there. And with that, operator, you can turn the line over to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. A couple of questions. You mentioned the lease termination income did you mention what the specific number was during the quarter? Don Wood : I know we are 2.8 incremental, I don\u2019t know if we have a number. Do you have that? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Now, for the quarter, we had about $3.25 million of term fees, a large proportion of that was in our budget. We did exceed that \u2013 our forecast slightly and that\u2019s part of the reason for the $0.02 to $0.03 beat. A lot of that was not in the same-store pool, but those are roughly the numbers. Michael Mueller : Got it. And then I guess, if we think about 2018, you mentioned a couple hundred million of asset sales that are underway to retain cash flow. As you look out there, does it feel like 2018 could be a year where you don\u2019t tap the equity markets to continue funding the growth? Daniel Guglielmone : I think we will look to kind of take advantage of the breadth of our balance sheet and our capital market\u2019s capabilities. I think we will be tactical and opportunistic when equity is attractively priced. As I mentioned in my remarks, our disposition pipeline is strong and looks good. That could grow, but we will be nimble and opportunistic as it relates to issuing capital going forward. Don Wood : Mike, the only thing I want to add to that is and it ties into the question, because of the asset sale piece, remember, we are talking about a lot of that coming from the sale of condos. And what effectively that does is obviously de-risk and de-lever the big properties at both Pike & Rose and Assembly and so especially with the Assembly results that we have seen, that\u2019s better stuff than we anticipated. Michael Mueller : Got it. And is that actually ties to the last question, which was of the $200 million that you talked about for next year throughout there, you mentioned the condos at 0%. What portion of that $200 million is 0 cap stuff versus the 5 cap? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes, probably kind of $140 million to $150 million of condo and call it $50 million to $60 million of other, non-core. Michael Mueller : Got it. Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your line is open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I wanted maybe a little discussion in how you keep up-to-date and stay focused on that, why the selection of tenants or put in other way, how do you source these unique tenants? And then just maybe one follow on, how much of a pioneer do you want to be versus leasing to the better funded established players? Don Wood : Craig, first of all, it\u2019s a great conversation, it\u2019s what we spend an awful lot of time doing. It is all about balance, you are exactly right, but one of the things that frankly, the entire open air sector has over malls is more flexibility in the product type or in terms of what you can do with spaces, whether that be combining for smaller spaces with the right depths that make some sense or in some places going the other way. The idea of making sure that \u2013 and I think there is wide funnel notion. It sounds obvious, but you have got to be thinking about it as you are locating your properties, where you are obviously and what format they are under. I think one of the best things we have is not all grocery anchored centers, not all mixed-use properties, not all any one thing, but it\u2019s much more real estate based in terms of it. And so the balance between the great tenants that we think are the great tenants today that we don\u2019t know, because they are all trying to figure out what their 5 and 10 and longer models will be and those tenants that are a bit pioneering, you need the right kind of balance. I hate the word duration, because it\u2019s overused so much, but there is something to it. And as you know, Craig, we have talked about it for years, it is what we do. So, I can\u2019t tell you 40%, 60%, 50%-50%, whatever, it very much depends on the piece of real estate, it very much depends on how wide that market is drawing from. But I can tell you in every decision we make, with respect to what tenants to put next to get and how to be relevant for the future, those considerations are made. Sorry, to get wordy on this, but it\u2019s such an important part and thinking about the future of our business. If you take Brick Shopping Center in Brick, New Jersey, this was a shopping center that had an A&P, a sports authority, a Bon-Ton in it, Dollar stores, etcetera and that is now HomeGoods, DSW, Ulta, gymnast deals that\u2019s just about done, that should like a lot. It\u2019s a completely different environment and it didn\u2019t just happen with the tenants, it happened with the physical place, with the outdoor seating, the place making, etcetera. It\u2019s the consolidator in the market. And that you will have to be thinking about as you go forward. Who were the consolidators, where is the real estate that can act in it, in a country that\u2019s got too much retail as the consolidator? We think we are really well positioned for that. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. And then just quickly, do you think there will be any difficulty in keeping the construction workers working on stuff like a project at CocoWalk or has the disaster made that prove to pull them away on other stuff? Don Wood : Well, I will tell you this, I am glad particularly with respect to Coco, you know that the project is priced out that it\u2019s effectively what had gotten to the point it did before the hurricane struck. There was no damage to the property. I do not believe from everything we are hearing that we will have issues with respect to the construction execution. Now when you look going forward on projects, there is no doubt, construction cost in this country is something we are \u2013 everybody is thinking about with respect to maybe number of workers cost wise, just why can\u2019t you make big rents to be able to pay for it. So, physical damage absolutely not, great shape on our line of the assets. With respect to what construction cost due to make numbers work in the future, we are going to have to see. They are up right now, that\u2019s for sure. Craig Schmidt : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy : Just in thinking about guidance, Dan, just following up on some of your comments and thinking about getting from that. It\u2019s a 144 to 147 range in fourth quarter on an FFO basis. I realize that you are not providing same-store NOI guidance at this point. But just as we think about some of the moving parts there, maybe if you can kind of walk us through what you expect through the guide sort of the 70 basis point drag that you talked about presumably that\u2019s reversing into next year from the re-tenanting. You have got the CocoWalk and Sunset drag from starting those projects. On the other hand, you have got Assembly and Pike & Rose, the retails coming online, but then you have got the apartment leasing drag. And then presumably, you are budgeting something for further tenant fallout into next year. How do we think about all that? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes, all good questions. I think kind of given where we are in our process, it\u2019s a little premature to get into kind of some of those detailed assumptions behind \u201818 and we will definitely cover that in February. But to give you maybe something in terms of where we see maybe same-store next year, it\u2019s preliminary, but maybe 2% to 3% is a good placeholder on the basis of our new metric comparable property POI, but I think at this point, it\u2019s too premature to provide detailed assumptions. Christy McElroy : And then just on the IT and accounting cost that you mentioned in Q4, is that sort of one-timeish and how much is that \u2013 how much is that impacting? Daniel Guglielmone : I think for the fourth quarter, we could \u2013 maybe it\u2019s $0.01, but I think that will continue. This is upgrading and really improving our accounting and IT platform, it\u2019s investment we feel is going to improve the productivity of our company on a go-forward basis. The bulk of that spend will be in 2018 and some of that will be reflected in our guidance in 2018, but again a little preliminary to kind of be detailed and give a detailed estimate of that number at this point. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just really quickly, in terms of the asset sales, the $200 million, I got the breakout, but in terms of the timing of that occurring between the condo sales and the two non-core assets, how should we think about that? Don Wood : Throughout 2018, Christy, I would \u2013 to model it around the middle of the year, some will start before in terms of the condo closings, end or later in the year, all of the Assembly will be done next year. You can basically put that around in the middle of the year. Pike & Rose, obviously, we are halfway done. And so we have got another half to do and that timing of those sales will determine what the timing is on that. Daniel Guglielmone : Probably I would say the asset, the non-core asset dispositions are probably towards the first half of the year, maybe this should be done by then, but that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a modest kind of $50 million to $60 million number. Christy McElroy : Okay. Thanks so much for the sense. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, guys. Maybe just building off Christy\u2019s question, Dan, I know specifics are unavailable. But can you talk directionally about how you are thinking about things like renewal probabilities or downtime on leases. Are you on just capital investment on any vacancies in your budget for next year versus maybe what you are assuming this year? Daniel Guglielmone : I would generally say that we have shown consistency in our operating metrics over the last several quarters, I think heading into 2018, I think it will be consistent. I think again, it\u2019s a little too premature kind of given where we are. We still got another 45 days of going through our budgeting process before we are able to provide that level of detail, but again we will talk about that in more detail in February. Jeff Donnelly : And just are there factors that would maybe put your earnings at the low end of that range, the $6.06 a share. Are those, I guess I will say were they within your control or do you see that as more of a reflection of your view on the economy, the industry to kind of bringing you down at that level? Daniel Guglielmone : I think that we are sitting here and looking at 2018, it is an uncertain retailing environment and I think that our range kind of reflects some caution and some conservatism at that low end of the range. Don Wood : But Jeff, it\u2019s something bigger than that. I mean, the reason even we gave such a wide range to start. Think about the things that we are doing, the timing and the pacing of the lease up of the residential properties, that matters, it matters a lot. The timing of when we demolish the biggest piece of CocoWalk and do we get the entitlements on Sunset and can we get started with that? When you think about some of the other projects, like Darien that we are making really good progress on, but aren\u2019t sure when we\u2019ll be starting. This company does a lot. So the notion of \u2013 it\u2019s hard to kind of invest or not invest in a company based on 90 days in the real estate business, this isn\u2019t the retail business, it\u2019s the real estate business. I am not trying to be detour of you, but when you think about the components of this, it is more complex than a commodity-based company and there is more upside than a commodity-based company. Jeff Donnelly : Don, how do you feel about just the negotiating environment? I guess, right now on the leasing front, I mean, do you think the accumulation of vacancies that will happen in the industry, I know the far-reaching suburbs are very different than maybe some of your submarkets. But I am just curious I mean, have you sort of perceived that or have you felt that in your business or do you think it\u2019s relatively the same as it was maybe a year ago? Don Wood : Well, it\u2019s interesting. And I think I have commented over the past year or the past 2 years that I did feel like the leasing leverage, the de-leverage and you just \u2013 in general on everything was tipping more to the retail and that\u2019s particularly given that uncertainty, kind of feeling like that\u2019s found the bottom, if you will, or piece of stability. And we are seeing it in a number of places. What I\u2019d love to give you our specific examples, I don\u2019t want to do that for obvious negotiating reasons. But there have been tenants that have come back to us and said, hey, look, we\u2019d like to exercise that option, but you are going to have to renegotiate that down and sometimes we have to do that. But what our policy is, is no, there is a contract in place this is the contract, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be. And I can give you, I\u2019d love to give you, but I will not on this call, three specific examples of three specific tenants that you would know very well, that basically have to then ask, simply exercise their option at the higher rent and moved forward. And so the notion of taking this, this dislocation in our business and trying to use it to the best advantage, that\u2019s what we all do. That\u2019s what the landlord side does it\u2019s what the retailer side does. But I feel like there is no doubt property by property, the leverage that the conversations that we are having feel more settled to me than they have been over the past few months. Jeff Donnelly : And just one last one, I suspect you guys are a party to 1 or 2 bids for Amazon\u2019s new headquarters, I think Amazon has said that they are looking to take delivery of some of that the initial office space as early as 2019. I am just curious given how fast moving that process is? Have you guys heard anything further or do you have any expectations on when you might hear more? Don Wood : We don\u2019t. Obviously, what we do for living and when you think about where Assembly is located, what we have entitled, what\u2019s there, we obviously think there is a great case to be made there. We feel the same way in and around Pike & Rose in that Montgomery County area. And having said that, we know nothing more than that and every city that I go to, things, they are getting Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, no matter who you talk to, their city will make that and it will go somewhere. And in some ways, the best place to be is just on the periphery of it, because who knows what those deals will look like, right, as it happens, but the fact that we are having this conversation in a what is plain, old shopping center companies suggest this isn\u2019t a plain old shopping center company. As we are getting something different when I don\u2019t know how many calls you have had with the shopping center guys where you are asking about Amazon\u2019s second headquarters and the real estate that you own to get there. So no, I don\u2019t know anymore now, but I sure know that if you look through the type of things that, that company and many other companies like them are or smaller obviously, but like them are looking for in their workforce. We are set up with those type of locations in the markets that we are in. That\u2019s the big takeaway. Jeff Donnelly : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys. Don, I think you may have just actually hit on this, but for 2018 obviously, there is a lot of moving pieces and continued repositioning going on here. But broadly, it sounds like we should be thinking about growth accelerating in the back half of the year and into 2019. There is a lot of the development operations open and stabilized. At a broad level, is that a fair way to think about the cadence of earnings in next year? Don Wood : I am going turn it over to Dan, as much close on the numbers, I will tell you, Jeremy. I mean, there is no question we are doing a boatload of leasing. And so \u2013 and we are doing leasing as I have said in the past, in places that are under redevelopment, are being repositioned. I think we do a lot of it. It\u2019s not a little bit on the edges. And so most of that leasing is coming in, I think we\u2019ve stretched on the schedule for a number of quarters, for sure, in terms of how that income stream comes on. And yes, it comes on throughout into 2018 and \u201819 and it builds. Now as question was implied earlier, how much of the lease in the bottom of the bucket, what\u2019s going to come out after the holiday season and all that, we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know. But what we know is we are, we go hard to our tenant base. And when we have weakness or when we see tenants, we are worried \u2013 weakness in those locations. We are looking really hard right now to how to backfill it. So the big question, Jeremy, as you go through on the basic business side is the bottom of the bucket, how much of a leak there will be for that and that\u2019s not known yet. When you look at the other value-enhancing things that we are doing, whether we are talking about Coco, whether we are talking about Pike & Rose or Assembly, there is no doubt in those big projects that there is dilution before there is accretion and 2018 will be dilutive from the standpoint of leasing up 800 and some odd units, but that\u2019s okay. So, it\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s harder to look at and just apply the same metrics that you use. But generally, with respect to the business part that you are talking about growing throughout 2018 toward the latter part is a fair assumption. Jeremy Metz : Appreciate that. And then sorry if I missed this earlier, but at Pike & Rose, can you talk about the residential leasing there, how rents are trending, but also how that initial leasing has been in Phase 2? Don Wood : Yes, no, no, I did, I went through that in all my prepared remarks, but just quickly, on the residential side in particular, strong stuff, much faster and a little bit more money, I wish the money were higher. We are getting 235 a foot or so, which is better than our budget, but the most important thing about that is the existing product in Phase 1 still 95% leased. We haven\u2019t diluted the first half, because demand is growing, because the place is finding its way there. The number of people on this call have been there lately. Everybody who is left there lately has been blown away, I loved it, I would love to show it. On the retail leasing side, as I said in my comments, slower than I wanted to be, not in the anchor system, but in the shop space that fills in around the anchor state system, where still 88% of the NOI is under lease or negotiated NOI. So, the work \u2013 there is a word slower and the word slower applies to our business in terms of navigating through this environment. Jeremy Metz : Thanks, Don. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. Don Wood : Good morning. Haendel St. Juste: Don, I was wondering if you could perhaps extrapolate on your comments about the higher construction cost in Miami. I am wondering if that\u2019s changing your thoughts, plans, timing, return expectations for Sunset, still in the shadow pipeline. And I think we saw in the recent article that you submitted your plan to the city planning board in late October, I am curious how that was received? Don Wood : Yes. So with respect to Sunset, I mean, absolutely, the issue, the first issue there is we have to have the right to go north, to go north in the air. The ability to make money at Sunset is proportionately directly correlated to being able to build up in the air, and we\u2019re now through the entitlement process there. And the entitlement process in South Miami as it is, there\u2019s an awful lot of communities like that in the country is tough. So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to get it there. So we\u2019re not yet at the point of what the construction cost would be to make a bigger project work. We\u2019re still at the point of, can we get the right to be able to expand that yet. And as you would imagine, the hurricane has slowed that process down from the standpoint of there is just other things that people are worried about these days. But we are expecting to hear something soon before the end of the year? If it\u2019s not finalized, we will be out to February for the next way to look at it. So, we can talk more about Sunset as we go forward. But as I say, the entitlements are the same the biggest thing that the single biggest hurdle that has to be overcome. And if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s going to be just the basic it\u2019s going to be what it is as opposed to something a whole lot better, which will be a shame for the community. Haendel St. Juste: Okay, okay. I appreciate the thoughts there. And then one more for me, I guess, the imitation is the serious form of flattery they say, right. So, I guess, I am curious what you make of a lot of your retail peers talking more of and introducing more a mixed use into their portfolios. Maybe perhaps what advice you provide, some of the key lessons you learned? And are you concerned of maybe mixed use could swing too far, maybe perhaps presenting a bit of a risk down the road? Don Wood : Sure. Well, Haendel, first of all, that question is, I mean, we got to sit over a few beers and talk that one through, because it\u2019s complicated and the conversation is not for this conference call. With respect to, am I worried that there is \u2013 sure I am worried. I mean, in our business, there is no magic elixir of the type of product, there is no magic elixir into the tenants who is the greatest tenant that\u2019s going to fix everything. I mean none of that \u2013 none of it happens. So, the idea of being balanced, the idea of having \u2013 being a real estate company more than just having a narrow business plan is very important to us. And as you would imagine, just deciding to do mixed use, whatever that means and the definition of that is so darn light to so many different people\u2019s points of view. People don\u2019t think that, that\u2019s the magic elixir, but they know that creating environments and places that serve the consumer not only this year, but over the next 10 years and 15 years, that there is an awful lot to this trend toward organization in the country, towards this need for higher services, it\u2019s hard to ignore it. I mean, it\u2019s frankly it\u2019s as obvious as it can be. Will there be too much done in terms of poorly executed projects and things that don\u2019t work? Sure, there will, just like there are in other sectors. So yes, I mean, it\u2019s proceeded at your own risk. Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate the thoughts. We will have to grab that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Collin Mings of Raymond James. Your line is open. Collin Mings : Thanks. Good morning. First question for me, just earlier this year, Don, you noted that relatively more attractive acquisition opportunities were before becoming more plentiful and can you maybe just update us on what you are seeing now and maybe how that has evolved throughout the year from your perspective? Don Wood : Yes. Well, look, first of all, it\u2019s not business as usual when you have cost of equity of not only our public company, a lot of public companies down to where it is. You better be more disciplined in terms of the allocation of that capital, and you better look at things with the light of today\u2019s environment rather than previous environment in terms of the left side and right side of the balance sheet. Most important thing, do I think that there is a disconnect between public valuations and private valuations? Yes, I do. And Jeff can probably talk more about this. When we went into Primestor, what we loved about Primestor was the notion of an underserved community in terms of GLA per capita. And it\u2019s so crystal clear to us that, that\u2019s such an important metric in terms of \u2013 way more than same-center growth is the other things that wind up on some of the schedules or truly how do you compete, how do you create demanded that exceeds supply. On the acquisition side with our cost of money to get in there and buy things in the fore is hard to do. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense for us today. Whereas it could have in the past to the extent the IRRs are in the growth. So Jeff, why don\u2019t you add specifics about what you\u2019re seeing? Jeff Berkes : Yes. Sure, Don. It\u2019s interesting. We are seeing more deals come to the market than maybe a year or 18 months or so ago. It\u2019s really interesting how the investor community is looking at those deals. A couple of years ago, there wasn\u2019t a big difference in price between what we call a great deal. And by great we mean how we define great, which is an imbalance between supply and demand and a lot of population density and ability to grow NOI and all that kind of stuff and kind of so-so deal, which may look good on paper. But when you start to peel back the onion, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. What\u2019s happened over last year or so has become very clear that if it\u2019s an institutional quality deal, it\u2019s going to get crazy pricing and we have seen a couple of deals out in California that get marketed and priced since all the headlines started appearing in March or April. And the pricing of those deals, quite frankly, was just amazing, it\u2019s low for cap rates, the way we underwrite deals, I know how to operate a shopping center, kind of 5ish IRRs. Honestly, that doesn\u2019t interest us much. On the other end of the equation, you get moved out a little bit from that and pricing really gaps out. And there might not even be better choice now for certain properties. So, our challenge is kind of defining the middle and making sure we are buying a future real estate and making sure buying something where we can grow NOI. Those opportunities will come around we think in \u201818, but there is not a plethora of those around right now, quite frankly. You guys don\u2019t know we are selective and disciplined and tend to get stuff done over time and we expect that to be the case going into the next year. Collin Mings : Okay. I appreciate the color there. Maybe just following up on that just as it related to the prepared remarks, as it relates to the Primestor, can you expand upon the comments regarding possibly selling one asset and maybe acquiring additional property in terms of that partnership? Jeff Berkes : Yes, it\u2019s further, I mean. Go ahead, Collin. Don Wood : Yes, that\u2019s funny Jeff. I was going to say, no. Jeff Berkes : Yes, there is not much to add. Don Wood : Well, I don\u2019t want to get into the sale process of an asset. I don\u2019t want to impede with that, that\u2019s not done yet. And the same on the acquisition side, the only thing I would say on the acquisition side, which is very cool, is that it\u2019s a deal that includes development. It\u2019s a very simple grocery anchored format, not a hard thing, but it\u2019s something that has been in the works by that company for 7 years, in terms of where it is, the returns, the subsidy from the city and other agencies, etcetera, when you spend that much time, that\u2019s for us to come in and to be able to jump on that effectively, that\u2019s something that we wouldn\u2019t be able to do on our own in some of these markets. And so this partnership is we are really positive about this as an engine in this sector of our business plan going forward. Collin Mings : Alright. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you and good morning down there. Don Wood : Good morning. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Two questions. First, can you just talk about up at Assembly Row, the apartments that you have leasing up. It\u2019s a rather large project and if you assume 30 a month, it seemed to take you into the second year before stabilizing. So, can you just give us thoughts on how you are approaching that to try and minimize the year-over-year lease up while it\u2019s still leasing against yourself? If there are ways to mitigate that or if the view is that you are going sort of as full speed as it can if you have to deal with it at that point? Don Wood : I just don\u2019t understand the question with respect to leasing against ourselves there, Alex, because Avalon owns the review of the product at this site. So it\u2019s not us, first of all. Second of all, it\u2019s a big project, it\u2019s 447 units. And to be 100 done at this point, this is really good and this building is not done yet. With respect to the supply and demand characteristics, we are not managing that to the dilution or accretion of any particular quarter next year. We are running a real estate company and therefore, we are trying to create the right balance between rate and volume in a big project where we have an awful lot of money invested already creating the environment. So sure, it\u2019s going to take all of 2018 to lease it up and we will create \u2013 I forget what the number is in terms of value as it\u2019s finished in \u201819 and \u201820 and \u201821 and \u201822. And that\u2019s what we are running it to, not to the 90-day pieces of 2018. Alexander Goldfarb : That\u2019s helpful, Don. I was referring to if you assume 30 units a month that would be sort of 14, 15 months, but if you said you are already 100 underway leased up, then that\u2019s good to hear. The second question is on the comparable NOI or comparable property disclosure that you provided, can you just go back and just help us understand. This excludes acquisitions and redevelopment. But how else does this improve or help us understand better versus the same-store NOI metric ex redevelopment? So, what are the nuances that we will get out of this versus the traditional metric? Don Wood : I am not sure it does help you. What I know it does is reflect the way we run our business and how is that\u2019s more important. What I mean by that is the first thing it does is it starts with the audited annual financial statements. And I think it\u2019s really important that \u2013 I wish other people did this, that you start with the P&L of the company and make sure that you\u2019re reconciling down to what it is that you\u2019re calling same-store. The fallacy to me is that, same-store, with and without development in a company that again, is not a commodity-based company, does not have capital in it in terms of the same-store is wrong. I mean, there should be capital and there is many of the assets that we own as possible, because if you believe in us as capital allocators, that\u2019s the way you create value in real estate. And so for us, what we are trying to say is start with the whole company. Back out of the company obviously, things that are bought and sold in one period of time. And then also if we are doing our job right, we are impacting both positively and negatively the income stream of significant amount of assets. I wish it were more and we are working on being more that, that may have dislocations in income streams that are caused by development plans to add value to these things, that should be taken out to leave what is effectively the part of the portfolio that is not under that active major redevelopment or development piece of the business. That\u2019s how we run the place. And so whether it\u2019s helpful to you or not, I don\u2019t know. We are still going through the charade of the other metrics that we have been doing for years. So, you will still see that and you can use whatever you want. It can\u2019t hurt if we are adding it, right. And hopefully, we can get there too, have more people understand the way we make investment decisions in our properties to create value and not just how many more quarter pounders of cheese we are selling out of this unit this quarter versus the quarter before. Alexander Goldfarb : Well, given your dividend track record, I think you can \u2013 that\u2019s probably the most tangible way to see the value creation that you guys have done is the dividends over time and the cash flow that Dan G. referred to earlier. So, thank you for that, Don. Don Wood : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Don, I am just curious whether institutional investors are coming to you to sort of look at the acquisition market, bring in an operator like yourself and be able to take advantage of some of the uncertainty that\u2019s in the marketplace. Clearly, overall transaction volumes have declined given a lot of what\u2019s happening within the retail sector. And I just don\u2019t know whether that has stimulated any larger institutions who may have redlined the sector, whether they start coming to you and saying, you know what, let\u2019s figure out if there is some opportunities where we can go out and take advantage of a potential of some of the carnage out there? Don Wood : Mike, the direct answer to your questions, no, not yet at this point, but it\u2019s a really good question. What you are really saying is look, there is a real disconnect in terms of this industry, I mean \u2013 and it can\u2019t stay the way it is that there has to be it seems to me, because of a disconnect too between private and public values, there needs to be with an amount of time, certain people are going to try to exploit those differences. So we are not particularly interested in diverting the attention that we have on our specific business plan today in any meaningful way. There is lots of conversations we have. The specific ones you are talking about, no, not in my notch at this point. We will ask Jeff that same question on the West Coast to make sure I am responding accurately, but whether it\u2019s that or whether it\u2019s other ways to exploit effectively public and private valuation differences, got to believe that over the next year, 18 months, 2 years that you are going to see some creative solutions. Michael Bilerman : What are you hearing from the institutional investors that you are talking to on the private side that have a lot of retail holdings, I guess how are they reacting? I would assume, if anything, if they are performing well in their asset base, however, as best as they can within the environment, they are the first most likely to say, why don\u2019t we increase more versus someone who doesn\u2019t have exposure that in their mind would want to be to contrarian to start buying in this environment? Don Wood : Yes. I don\u2019t have a lot to add to that, Mike. I haven\u2019t heard much about it yet at this point, but it\u2019s an interesting fourth quarter coming in when you think about NAREIT and the conversations that will be happening at NAREIT in just a couple of weeks, when you think about all of that focus as it turns to 2018 and \u201819 and the shape of some of the balance sheets that are out there, which are fine. But how long does the equity value stay where it is, there has to be some of those conversations, I just doesn\u2019t have them yet. Christy McElroy : Hey, Don. It\u2019s Christy again here. And just looking at your comp property POI disclosure and thinking about sort of this new way of thinking about it and I totally get you in terms of incorporating the cost associated with driving that growth. You also provided the CapEx disclosure associated with the comp property pool. Should we be adjusting for that as well in thinking about the costs that are driving this growth? Don Wood : Yes. What I think you need to do and we are going really try to help with this is build a database on this company, any company that you are thinking about investing and look quarter-after-quarter, because it\u2019s \u2013 look, there is no correlation, there is hardly any correlation between the numbers on the bottom of that sheet in terms of capital and the numbers on top of that sheet in terms of the income it produces, that\u2019s obvious, right. We are not selling, which it\u2019s real estate investment. But after next quarter and the quarter after that and the quarter after that, you are going to be developing a database here. And then we are going to be able to talk about some trends and what\u2019s causing X to Y. So to me, this is just the first step in trying to make sure we are not having conversations that the sell side in particular, but also buyers, the buy side are trying to fit into boxes that we don\u2019t feel really represents the way we run our business. We are looking for real estate investors that can gather this information over a period of time and make the biggest assessment of all. Are we making any money on the capital investments that we are making? And to me, if you don\u2019t start by tying into the base of audited financial statements, it\u2019s really hard to do that. Christy McElroy : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there is no other questions in queue. I will turn it back for closing remarks. Leah Andress : Thanks, everyone. We have a couple more slots left at NAREIT. Please reach out to me with any last minute requests and we will see you there. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter and year-end 2017 results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone. A good quarter and, in fact, another good year for us, between meeting or beating estimates with fourth quarter FFO per share of $1.47 and $5.91 for the full year, 4.6% growth over 2016. To strong residential leasing progress with the new phases of both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, not to mention Santana Row and Bethesda Row, further validating the relevance of our mixed-use product nationwide and our broader real estate capabilities. To strong comparable lease rollover rates throughout the portfolio of 15% for the quarter and 13% for the year; to further fortification of one of the strongest balance sheets among any REIT; to another timely and opportunistic debt refinancing and small but carefully executed equity issuance, which, by the way, significantly derisked our development pipeline, this company continues to face head on the challenges to retail-based real estate with more arrows in our quiver than most and a clear vision for the future. We're not playing defense, we're on offense and we're moving the ball aggressively. Consider for a moment that by reporting FFO per share this year of $5.91, or even $5.74 when including the opportunistic cost of retiring our 5.9% notes due in 2020, we remain the only publicly traded shopping center company to grow FFO, by NAREIT's definition, each and every year since the beginning of this retail cycle in 2010, the only one. In fact, we've grown NAREIT-defined FFO per share 48% over that period, even with last month's debt extinguishment charge. The consistency in which this company grows bottom line earnings truly sets us apart, no excuses, no exclusions, no reorganizations, no defensive dilutive asset repositionings, no recapitalizations, just consistent growth. And we don't expect that to change in 2018, as Dan G. will go over in a few minutes. Hard for me to believe that history and track record don't matter in predicting the future. All right, back to the quarter. Leasing in the fourth quarter was again strong at 15% rollover growth and remarkably consistent all year. Consider that on over 1.6 million square feet in comparable deals done in 2017, which, by the way, was 10% more than we did in 2016. Rollover growth was 11% in the first quarter, 13% in the second quarter, 14% in the third quarter and as I said, 15% in the fourth. And tenant improvement dollars stayed relatively stable and under control. Deals included TJX's HomeGoods concept at our Brick Plaza redevelopment, Marshalls' renewal at newly redeveloped Northeast shopping center and a new urban-format Target deal at Sam's Park & Shop in D.C. Deals at redeveloped or remerchandised shopping centers clearly more than paved themselves in densely populated areas, and here again, our cost of capital advantage makes the underlying value creation even higher. Occupancy gains in the fourth quarter continued that trend that we've seen all year. Our overall portfolio lease rate of 95.3% was higher than both our 94.7% lease rate at September 30 and 94.4% last year at this time. Of course, our total portfolio occupied rate at 93.9% suggests that there are 140 basis points of leasing that's been done, if not yet paying rent, certainly a positive for 2018. Okay. On the development side, a couple of noteworthy advances. You might have seen in our press release last week that in the fourth quarter, we've signed a deal with Japanese apparel retailer, UNIQLO, with their first location in Maryland will be at Pike & Rose opening in the fall. That's significant because UNIQLO is international in scope and has largely selected productive malls as their real estate of choice. Our mixed-use alternative was clearly more attractive to them and, to me, signals another hurdle that we've met in putting together an attractive and sustainable long-term neighborhood and place for shopping, living, working and playing. We still got more to do on the retail leasing side. We're 91% leased or under LOI, but getting deals over the finish line is arduous, but we're getting there. And the residential leasing momentum at Henri, our latest apartment building at Pike & Rose, along with a 97% occupancy stability at PerSei and Pallas, make it pretty clear that the long-term growth prospects of neighborhood like these are very much intact. More than two thirds of the market-rate units are already under lease at Henri at rents that meet expectations with lease-up pace that exceeds expectations. In addition, 54 of the 99 condominiums above the Canopy Hotel, which will open shortly, are under contract. Similarly, at Assembly Row, we've signed a very significant deal with Polo for a 10,000 square foot outlet store in the base of the hotel condo building in Phase 2. The deal was particularly significant because we couldn't get Polo to come into the project in the first phase because of the unproven nature of the urban outlet mixed-use model, product types that we pioneered. The success of the first phase at Assembly got them over the hump. As with Pike & Rose, we still got more wood to chop on the retail leasing side. We're 77% leased or under LOI, but again, we're getting there and the environment and place are second to none. Residential lease-up of the 447-unit Montaje residential building is strong, with over 190 units already leased at rents which exceed expectations, and we expect to close on all 107 market-rate condominiums in just a few months, which will raise over $80 million. The dilutive impact during lease-up from these two residential projects totaled about $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter as expected. The value created above cost at those two buildings alone in the next two years is estimated at nearly $100 million. At both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, we're evaluating and working through the next phases as we speak. Our mixed-use development capability, particularly when paired with our demonstrated cost of capital, is a true competitive advantage. Now on the West Coast, the fourth quarter was the first full quarter in which we operated on an integrated basis with Primestor, a Los Angeles partner specializing in shopping destinations serving the Latino customer. It's an important additional arrow in our quiver going forward, and actual results in the fourth quarter exceeded our acquisition underwriting, a good start. That start continued into the first quarter this year when we signed a lease for the only vacant box in the Primestor portfolio months ahead of our expectation, a vacant Walmart grocer replaced by Bob's Furniture at more than double the Walmart rent. We had underwritten a much smaller bump in rent. It's hard not to see the Primestor joint venture as a competitive advantage for us. The end of the street at Santana Row looks a lot different these days as our office development is fully out of the ground, remaining on budget and on time for delivery in 2019. Now we've got to get it leased, and initial interest has been encouraging as we fully engage the community and capitalize on the attractive amenity-rich environment that office users in Silicon Valley and nationally are demanding. The initial positive experience at Santana Row that Splunk employees and Splunk management have been sharing in the community is particularly encouraging and helpful to our process. And finally, I'd like to hammer home the philosophy in which we're making real estate decisions these days because it puts our entire business plan in context. The retail real estate-based companies, who will not only survive but thrive in the years to come, were those who have positioned themselves to this point for their assets to be the real estate of choice for the widest possible selection of tenants, not a narrow, limiting business plan but a broader, wider funnel in select markets. It seems to us that in order to best position ourselves for that outcome, there are three important considerations. First, location matters more today than it ever has, it seems obvious to us. Two, assets need to be in flexible formats that can be improved upon through profitable reinvestment. And that's a big one because on many retail-based properties in the United States, the new revenue numbers that will be generated after redevelopment just aren't enough to justify that investment. And third, truly enhancing the experience. The placemaking, the tenant lineup and the customer services at those places is both critical and harder than it sounds. Creating that environment is a lot more than just going down a cool things to do checklist. So that's it. Everything that this company is doing today, even if it moderates growth in the short term, is meant to be able to act on this necessary long-term philosophy. The fact that we're doing it while still growing current earnings and cash flow at the same time, as we have throughout this entire cycle starting in 2010, is a true testament to the quality of our real estate and our team's vision and the execution competencies of that vision. Now let me turn it over to Dan to talk about the year before opening up the line to your questions. Dan G.: Thank you, Don and Leah, and hello, everyone. We are really pleased with our results of FFO per share of $1.47 and $5.91 for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, slightly ahead of our expectations on both measures and ahead of consensus for the quarter. The numbers in the fourth were driven by higher NOI, primarily due to higher percentage rent and less impact from tailing tenants, offset by higher G&A due to year-end compensation adjustments and costs associated with our planned accounting and IT platform upgrade. On the same storefront, our quarter came in at 2.6% for same-store with redev. Our new comparable POI metric came in at 1.7%. These results were impacted by a negative comp on term fees as well as the negative short-term impact of value-creating, proactive re-leasing initiatives, which produced a combined drag of 60 basis points. For the year, our same-store with redev metric came in ahead of guidance at 3.4%. Calculating this metric using a simple average of all four quarters, a more representative measure of the year, same-store growth was 3.8%. Don touched upon our progress in the leasing front, but let me provide some additional color. Our lease percentage at year-end is 95.3%, up a full 90 basis points over year-end 2016. And our occupied rate increased to 93.9%, 60 basis points over year-end 2016. The gains over the course of 2017 can largely be attributed to the significant progress we've made on the anchor leasing front where our anchor lease percentage is back to a more normalized level of 98%. With respect to 2018 FFO guidance, we are formally providing an estimate range of $6.08 to $6.24 per share, affirming our preliminary guidance midpoint of $6.16. This 4%-plus FFO per share growth positions us at the upper end of our peer group again. This guidance assumes the following : first, capital spend on development and redevelopment of $250 million to $300 million for the year, which effectively has been prefunded; closing on the sale of up to $150 million of condos at Assembly and Pike & Rose, the gains associated here will not impact FFO. We forecast to refinance our $275 million term loan in the fourth quarter of 2018, although please note, we have the flexibility to extend this loan to November of 2019. We will continue our value-creating, proactive re-leasing activity in 2018, with leases already executed such as Anthropologie replacing Barnes & Noble at Bethesda Row; Target replacing Petco at Sam's Park & Shop in D.C.; and Muji on Third Street Promenade replacing Abercrombie, along with a few others. This activity will weigh on results in 2018, creating $0.03 to $0.04 dilution on FFO and roughly 50 basis points of drag from a comparable POI perspective. But it will also drive growth and value creation of $50 million to $60 million once stabilized. Please note, this activity will put some pressure on occupancy during the year due to downtime, although not leased percentages as the leases are already executed. As is our custom, this guidance assumes no acquisitions. With respect to G&A, we forecast roughly $36 million in 2018 or about $9 million per quarter. This reflects the additional costs associated with the upgrade of our accounting and IT platform. And with respect to same-store, our estimate of comparable POI growth, our new metric introduced in the third quarter, it is affirmed at 2% to 3%. And as a result, we project total property operating income will grow in the 5% to 7% range in 2018 relative to 2017. Now on to the balance sheet. We continued to be opportunistic during the fourth quarter, further derisking our best-in-class balance sheet. First, with a $175 million reopening of our benchmark 10-year notes due 2027. This decision came in advance of the expected mid-December Fed rate hike and the anticipated passage of tax reform, where there a lock-in, a 3.32% rate at a record 10-year spread for Federal, of 97 basis points. We used the proceeds to redeem our 5.9% notes due in early 2020. And note, we did take the $12.3 million charge due to the early redemption, which was recognized in the fourth quarter. With the 10-year treasury up roughly 50 basis points in the last 60 days, this decision looks like a prudent one, at least so far. Second, we were also able to tap our ATM program during the quarter to efficiently issue $66 million of common equity at a weighted average price of $132 per share. This opportunistic activity has set off our A minus rated balance sheet to be extremely well positioned heading into 2018. As we have prefunded our capital plan over the course of 2016 and 2017 at an extremely attractive cost, we effectively have no need to raise incremental capital in 2018. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at a modestly elevated 5.8 times and is poised to decrease into the 5 to 5.5 times range over the course of the year as executed leases commence and as we reduce leverage through condo sales, 75% of which are under contract. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio had a four times run rate for 2017, and we expect that four times coverage to remain there for 2018. Our weighted average debt maturity has been extended to a sector-leading 11-plus years. And we reduced our weighted average interest rate to 3.8%, with 99% of that balance sheet fixed. Despite the disruption in the equity markets and the rising interest rates, the strength of our best-in-class capital structure positions us to continue to significantly differentiate Federal as we move forward in a challenging retail and capital market landscape. And with that, operator, you can turn the line over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Yeah, thank you. I was wondering how much reserve is being attributed to Ascena. I know you have 33 stores, and I guess we're expecting them to not spook the restructureds and the store closings to spring. So if you could comment what you see the bad debt might be from Ascena. Dan G.: With regards to Ascena, we factored in, we have 33 locations. We, in our conversations with them, expect to rationally kind of shrink our store footprint with them over the next 12 to 24 months. I don't think we can kind of specify a specific number with regards to how much bad debt or cushion we have. We've kind of looked at space by space, but I don't have that number for you. Don Wood : The only thing I would say to you, Craig, the only thing I would add to that is we got pretty comfortable with \u2013 when we laid out the guidance that we laid out, making sure that we were not overly conservative at all but certainly looking at tenants like Ascena and making sure that other than something much more catastrophic than we expect that we're covered. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Great. And then I just wondered if same-store NOI and FFO growth by quarter will be back-end loaded as you start to bring on some of the Assembly and Pike & Rose stuff. Dan G.: Yes, no. Certainly, with FFO, in 2018, it should be back-end loaded towards the third and fourth quarter as we accelerate FFO in bringing online the benefits of Assembly and Pike & Rose. It's a little tougher to say whether or not we'll see that cadence with regards to same-store. Obviously, Assembly and Pike & Rose Phase 2s are not in the same-store portfolio, so it's a little tougher to kind of describe that cadence over the course of the year. Don Wood : Don't get too carried away with the back-loaded stuff, though. There's a lot of things we're doing for the future, et cetera, that will go both ways. So a little bit back loaded, but don't overweigh too much. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. So just two questions here. First, Dan, you said that the G&A guidance for this year is $36 million, which is \u2013 yes, yes, for 2018, which is flat with this past year. On other REITs, we've heard a lot about payroll pressure, increased wages. And just sort of curious, how are you guys able to maintain sort of flat G&A? And obviously, I'm not sure what you've embedded for growth in payroll at the property level, but how are you guys tackling this because it seems to be a growing issue across the different REITs as they reported this season? Dan G.: Alex, it's a great question. I mean, there's no question that we're in a period of time that is less predictable than it's been in the past. And so we're certainly more conservative on G&A. You'll certainly see it within the officers. There were basically no ratings given to Vice Presidents and above with only a couple of exceptions. This year, we're very conscious of it. We run a tight ship just like we did in 2008 and 2009 because you don't know. And times where we're not putting up the growth that I'd like us to put up, we're going to get tight on that. And the average executive at this company has been here something like 15 or 17 years, something like that. And so we understand their cycles. And sometimes you're tight, sometimes you're less tight. And that's just part of the DNA in this company. The real estate business in total, it's nothing more than that but straight out honesty. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question, Don, is you guys are \u2013 have sold off basically in line with peers despite your track record. Obviously, the year-to-date doesn't disrupt against them that you would have. But at what point would your depressed stock prices start to affect how you plan new projects or view in terms of make you reconsider what you think is the best way to create value at Federal? Don Wood : Yes, Alex, there's no question, I'd be straight out lying to you if I didn't say a dip down to the values that we're in \u2013 at right now. If they're sustainable, it doesn't have an impact on our capital allocation. I would hope you would want us to become more disciplined, and basically, it raises the bar on those type of capital allocation decisions. So the cool thing about the business plan, I'm really just thrilled by this, is that as we're finishing Phase 2s of both Pike & Rose and Assembly, as we're underground with the construction of 700 Santana Row, we have funded those capital needs before, as Dan had said. That's really important. And coupled with mostly sold condominiums or under contract condominiums that will be sold this year, as Dan said, we have very little capital needs in 2018 and 2019. Now that's important because as we look at incremental phases, as we're doing really hard now with existing projects or new things that we want to do, they're being put through a lens of this current capital on environment, they should be put through a lens of that. Now the good news is the \u2013 what is \u2013 what seems to me very clear is that we're creating a lot of value with the mixed-use portfolio, but in particular, the redevelopment portfolio within the basic shopping centers. And you can see that leasing and you can see where occupancy is and all that. So those levels of clear value creation, they're not going to be impacted by where we are in a significant way. But sit back, put that through the microscope of cost of capital and every incremental phase, and yes, we're going to be tighter on it. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, thank you, Don. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Christy McElroy : Hey, good morning. Just to quickly follow-up on Alex's question. Just beyond the current capital plan, you've used your balance sheet in the past to be opportunistic on acquisitions as well. I'm just thinking of the Primestor deal last year. In sort of this higher cost of equity capital world, how do you approach any potential acquisition opportunities that might come your way? Don Wood : Christy, with a sharper eye. Now I don't know whether this will \u2013 we'll see what happens with cap rates out there in terms of all properties. We know what's going to happen with those cap rates on lessor properties. It feels a little bit like when we looked at what was happening the last time in this location that there would be some great buys for us to find, and we didn't find a lot because the good stuff just doesn't back up in terms of cap rate or very much at all. And so I don't know that we're going see much of it. We'll see. We're on it all day long. The Primestor quiver, I do \u2013 I know you, in particular, had been through the property, so you kind of know what it is that we're doing there. And now seeing the results effectively exceed what we had hoped, and as I think I mentioned last time, there's a potential small development that is still being worked its way through the funnel there. We're hopeful that, that is \u2013 that will be an important part of the next 10 years of growth for the company. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then just at Bethesda Row, it looks like in the K, it looks like in late December, you sold a land parcel. Just wondering that was really the two. And then with Anthropologie replacing Barnes & Noble there, just give maybe your thoughts around this new larger concept for them, how something like this fits with urban and other retailers and sort of how they are thinking about brick-and-mortar concepts going forward. Don Wood : Yes. Let's \u2013 I'm going to let Chris do the \u2013 let him to do the Anthropologie conversation. The small parcel was what we call the [indiscernible] parcel. It's across the street, was very small. We really couldn't figure out how to make a value-accretive deal on that parcel. And so we were able to sell it effectively back to the county, right? On that, to the county at what was a very \u2013 in our point of view, a very fair number. So that's all that was. And with Anthro? Chris Weilminster : And with Anthropologie, Christy, what got us excited about the concept is that in this new large format, Anthropologie is putting many of their brands and other things under the same roof. So if you think about taking three people to frame, the Anthropologie product, the whole furniture line, cosmetics, a large shoe department that brings in other produce shoes, so they're not all vertically branded by urban, all of those things under one roof, to us, very much became a department store of the future. We thought that, that really resonated with all the soft goods that we've added over the years on the business ads. So we were thrilled to have that opportunity and also thrilled with the backfill of bringing the bookstore back into the project. Don Wood : The other thing that \u2013 just to mention to that, Christy, is it's one of the biggest reasons that proactively \u2013 I mean, we took Barnes out of there, Barnes & Noble in that corner, and we stood in front of that with you a lot of times over the years. It's iconic there, but the three-storey Barnes & Noble is not the future, and it's pretty clear. And so we proactively \u2013 not kicked them out, but they left, and they would have been happy to stay. In order to get this new concept theme for Anthro, that's going to be a ton of downtime and a ton of loss rent in 2018. But so what? The value being created by the new lease is significant. Christy McElroy : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeremy Metz : Hey good morning. Don, you mentioned the challenges getting some of the leases over the finish line. As you look to bring in tenants for some of these larger boxes you've taken back or even the bigger mixed-use projects, wondering if you could talk about how tenants are evolving and thinking about profitability differently, and therefore, what sort of rents they can pay versus the old occupancy cost model? Don Wood : Yes, and it's a very good question, Jeremy. I mean, first of all, you have to see \u2013 I think it's evident in the numbers, certainly evident in the occupancy stats, we have done a ton of anchor leasing over the past 18, 27 months. And you can see it, some of it's paying already, some of it will be paying in 2018, more in 2019 along the way. If you were to ask me, one thing is different about February where we are here in 2018 versus February 2017, it would seem to me that more \u2013 that in February 2017, last year, at this time, fewer retailers really had their idea of how they were going to handle the future, and today, much more \u2013 many more of them do, and that's what's been happening over the last 12 months. Within that notion, and we're seeing it everywhere, they will \u2013 absolutely we can get good deals, good economic deals that add value to both the property and to the rest of the tenancy in the center on filling those boxes for most of them. You just saw what we're talking about in Bethesda. Now some of the challenges in the future will be those second-floor boxes that made sense \u2013 Burlington is a good example. Those boxes that made sense in the olden days that make no sense today. And we had a couple of those, not a lot, but we have a couple of those. Those are the things that will be challenging to effectively be able to accretively add value to the shopping center. So there really is a tale of two cities in terms of the ability to do that. I think if you look at the amount of leasing that's been done and where it's been done, it kind of gives you \u2013 where it's been done accretively, the value kind of gives you the answer. Is there capital that goes into those deals? Absolutely. Is there so much capital that the deal doesn't make sense? No. And so we can still make good deals, not as easy as they were, that's for sure, but still good deals. Jeremy Metz : Great. And then a question for Dan. You mentioned Q4 came in slightly ahead of expectations. So in terms of the guidance, is it just some of the additional re-leasing you talked about in your opening remarks that's changed since the last call that you kind of took the top end of the preliminary range? You previously provided the 6.26% off. And then, Don, you talked about capital allocation decisions and those possibly changing given where the stock is. I think guidance you were doing called for, call it, $50 million in noncore sales. So is there any thinking about increasing asset sales at all? Or is it just too early to make that kind of decision? Don Wood : Let me get to the last piece, and then \u2013 since I remember it, then Dan can take the first piece. Yes, we absolutely look at increasing asset sales to the extent it makes sense. One of the things I wonder about, I don't know, it's not worry but it's wonder, is everybody is talking about asset sales. So is there enough capital out there? Who is buying that stuff? How are they financing it, et cetera? How much is too much on the marketplace? So it's nice to be in a position where we don't have to, but if we have an opportunistic way to move a couple or a few of the assets that we own, we will do that. Remember, we have a tax issue, and on almost every asset here, we have a tax basis that is lower, in most cases significantly lower than the value. So we have to figure that in. But yes, we would open up our bag of tricks, if you will, to consider incremental dispositions. Dan G.: And then with respect to the fourth quarter coming in better than we had expected, clearly, we felt very, very good about the 4.4% kind of exceeded our expectations for the year. And that was because the 2.6% came in ahead of kind of where we expected going into the quarter. As we head into 2018 in guidance, I would not look into \u2013 too much in terms of us tightening the range in any way. We just felt as though \u2013 coming through a very rigorous budgeting and forecasting process through the fourth quarter, we felt as though we owe you guys a little bit more precision with regards to our range of FFO. We kept the midpoint and the 4.2% number in terms of growth constant and just tightened the range a little bit on the upper band and lower band, wouldn't read too much into kind of that \u2013 those moves. Jeremy Metz : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Mike Mueller : Hi. Just curious with the 10-year backing up and changes in the REIT environment. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of market pricing for different types of assets? Dan G.: On the acquisition side, Mike? Mike Mueller : Yes. Dan G.: Yes, I'll let Jeff chime in as well. But put the best assets that we're looking to acquire, we still have not seen kind of a backup in cap rates, as Don has alluded to. Maybe we will, but it still has not filtered its way into the market yet with comps. Jeff, I don't know what you're seeing on the West Coast and other parts of the country. Jeff Berkes : Yes, hey Mike. There's a round of deals out here, high-quality deals that close towards the end of the year, beginning of 2018 that were all in that forecast by our range, which is great pricing, very, very aggressive pricing for the kind of assets we're talking about. I think there's still a lot of capital that wants the best of the best, so I'm not sure the treasury has come up enough yet to really affect the pricing on those assets. But like Dan said, we'll see. And we really haven't seen anything that's Class A institutional quality price since the treasury has popped out, but there is a ton of capital chasing those deals. So I wouldn't expect for the best of the best huge change in pricing. You fall off from the best of the best quicker now than you have in the last few years, so like Don alluded to earlier in the call, the lower-quality assets is a different story. Dan G.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, guys. Don, there seems to be like an increasing burden on landlords out there to not only understand the value of their space to retailers but to communicate it or sell that to retailers. Malls arguably have sort of an imperfect metric of sales productivity, but shopping centers don't have such a yardstick. Do you see retail landlords, I guess, malls and shopping centers, leaning to invest more in big data and analytics to improve operational excellence with merchandising, choosing tenants or working more collaboratively with their retailers? Don Wood : I do, Jeff. It's a great question. I do, but the question is how. For somebody who's always skeptical of consultants because a consultant wants to take whatever issue there is in the marketplace and make a career out of it, there's a billion people out there saying, I just got the greatest data information for you. And maybe somebody does, but the reality is you're talking about a data transformation in terms of its importance to retailers, to others within \u2013 studying the consumer that I think is critically important. How \u2013 we are looking strongly right now of how to go about that, how to participate effectively in that part of the world. I don't have any answer for you yet, but I can tell you, if I look over the next decade, there will clearly be not only investments but careful investments in the right data, the important data that retailers are using to make their decisions. Now they're investing, too, obviously. And the biggest issue is every four months, whatever was important four months ago is now obsolete. And so sticking with that process or figuring out the best way to participate in that process is a key goal for Federal over the next couple of years. Jeff Donnelly : Just as a follow-up. I mean, do you see that as something that's more about helping identify tenants, tenant selection? Or do you think this is more about helping in-place tenants generate more sales? Don Wood : I think it's both, but \u2013 I think it's both. I mean, when you sit \u2013 as I was saying before, even in the last year, as more and more retailers kind of figure out how they're going to approach, not sure if they're going to be successful or not, but how they're going to approach this new economy and the new consumer, there's all kinds of information that they are grasping for as part of that plan. This \u2013 what you're describing is not an either or, it is a combination of both, and it will evolve month-by-month over the next few years. Jeff Donnelly : And just one last question is, I'm not sure if you can speak to it, but just there's certainly been a lot of attention on Amazon second headquarters. Can you speak whether or not Federal has a direct involvement in any of the remaining bids or proposals? Or you guys just sort of located in the vicinity? I'm just curious as to how we should be thinking about that and maybe to the extent you have any color on the decision process. Don Wood : Yes. Well, there's a bomb that's around it, right? First of all, it is an honor to be a shopping center company that is in the conversation as to where the second headquarters for Amazon is going to be. The end of itself, that's kind of cool. You bet you, we're in the vicinity. You know we're in the vicinity at both Assembly and at Pike & Rose, two of the 20 funnelists. In terms of getting deeper into that conversation of direct or indirect, I can't talk too much about that yet. I think you should be thinking of our impact as indirect there. But there are still negotiations to go through on their side, the county government, state government, et cetera. We'll see where it ends out. But in two of those locations, it's very possible that we have a benefit, I would assume an indirect benefit. Jeff Donnelly : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is now open. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Just going back to the same-store NOI guidance for this year. Can you give us a feeling for what rent spread assumptions are in that guidance along with how to think about occupancy? You mentioned there would be some pressure on occupancy because of downtime, but maybe a little more detail there would be helpful. Dan G.: Sure, sure. I would say with regards to rent spreads, I mean, one of the things, if you look at over the last kind of eight quarters, remarkably consistent in terms of kind of low double digits to mid-teens, quarter in, quarter out. From where we sit today, I would expect through 2018 that kind of comparable. You may see a little volatility, but on the average, over the course of the year, you'll see generally comparable leasing spreads reflected in that 2% to 3% comparable POI growth. With regards to that number, though, I mean, as I mentioned, that proactive re-leasing, which will put some pressure on occupancy and put some pressure on that same-store number, roughly about 50 basis points is reflected there with regards to some of the downtime. And obviously, it will be dilutive, because cash flow won't be there, by probably in the range of about $0.03 to $0.04. Nick Yulico : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just going back to tough box sizes to fill. I guess as we think about 30,000 to 40,000 square foot boxes, feel like they are some of the tougher ones to backfill because maybe you're competing with power center, et cetera. Don, you talked about this a little bit earlier, but I just want to get a little bit more detail on your exposure to what is those tougher box sizes. Don Wood : Well, it\u2019s not \u2013 certainly, the size is important, but you have to look at it in the context of where it is. So the reason \u2013 I gave two examples before, and one is a second floor-only, accessible second floor-only big box in a \u2013 even a high-quality shopping center, certainly tough in a low-quality shopping center. But in a high-quality shopping center, whose business plans really look to that going forward? And I don't see name. So it's that second-floor, older space that I do worry about that we're working through. It will be \u2013 in many cases, because we have other arrows in our quiver, including other uses, whether that be office or azure, whatever else needs to happen in that space, we're looking at all kinds of stuff. So for example, at Pentagon Row, a second-floor health club, which has gone \u2013 we converted to office space, with a very strong office market just over the river from D.C. and Arlington, Virginia, and we're going to really well associated with that. So it's not just \u2013 it's hard, Nick. Don't just look at the box size. Look at the real estate location and the alternatives and what the company is able to do with them. Look at that stuff, and you got it. When \u2013 you take a look at a Bethesda, I mean, almost anywhere else, lots \u2013 not anywhere else, but lots of other places, a three-storey Barnes & Noble, basement, main floor, upper floor, of 45,000 feet or something like that, how else would you \u2013 who else would have gotten a whole space user in the form of this Anthropologie concept today? You would almost \u2013 any real estate guy would say, well, you're going to have to break that up. There'll be lost basement space, good space on the ground floor, but because at that corner in Bethesda, Maryland, we had choices. So I'm not going to be able to give you a generic 30 to 40 is bad, 15 to 25 is good. You got to get local on this analysis. I know it\u2019s harder, but you do. Nick Yulico : Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hoglund with Jefferies. Your line is now open. George Hoglund : Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But just wanted to get your sense on, based on your discussions kind of year-to-date with retailers and grocers, is there anything that's surprising you in terms of changes in sentiment with regards to additional store openings or sort of closing plans or kind of retailers that have maybe been deteriorating faster than you expected? Chris Weilminster : Yes\u2026 Don Wood : Well, not in particular but \u2013 Chris, go ahead. I mean, obviously, we've been looking forward, we've been monitoring tightly coming out of the holiday season. Seeing where January and February had been, it feels more stable than I had anticipated at this point, which is good news. It's a settling. And I think that settling is part of that \u2013 each of them or more of them, if you will, not all, that's for sure, but more of them figuring out their business plans. I'm sorry, Chris, go ahead. Chris Weilminster : No, I was going to reiterate that, Don, because you made that point earlier that the market \u2013 these retailers just need to have a firmer handle on their business plan and what they're trying to execute. And those are high-quality real estate. They're looking for lots of foothold and traffic from consumers, and a lot of our properties resonate with that. So in general, we're finding a firmer environment with regard to having these conversations with the retailers. But that's \u2013 it's organized as Don said just in his last comment, it's all about location, it really is. It's not an equal opportunity proposition for everyone. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Collin Mings : Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to go back to some of the prepared remarks. Can you maybe just expand on what you're seeing on the multifamily side to start 2018 as it specifically relates to the impact of incremental supply in some of your key markets? Don Wood : Yes. Let me do the two, the biggest and \u2013 actually, we'll do three. Santana Row, Silicon Valley, I mean, there's like one Silicon Valley. Housing, clearly, is limited there. Jeff can certainly talk more about that, I'll go through the three of them quickly. But we still have \u2013 we've done remarkably well on our residential rents, on our ability to keep vacancy out on each new product that we add at Santana. That \u2013 in the marketplace, there's certainly additional development, but that market certainly seems to be able to handle it. And by the way, the amenitized environment part of that, you cannot underestimate. It truly is \u2013 has become \u2013 we've been talking about it for decades, but it is here, man. In places where your lifestyle is able to be supplemented with all these amenities, it's really important. Come across the East Coast and go up to Boston, I mean, you can see it in the results at Assembly. And Assembly, remember, is in Somerville, outside of Boston. And Boston rents on the residential side are through the roof. And some numbers like $4.50, $5 a foot per month. We are getting mid-3s at Assembly Row. And that's really strong. And by the way, I mean, we did 190 of them already in this building, which is \u2013 it's strong. There's more competition downtown, absolutely, but what it is that we're doing is really unique. Move down to Pike & Rose. When we did the first phase, we had tons of competition or new product, if you will, being built. That has subsided in large measure certainly in Montgomery County. And the development of Pike & Rose as a place is solidified. So nothing suggests \u2013 nothing, to me, proves it more than $2.40 rents, which I wish were higher, but that's where they are, $2.40 rents, still profitable rents, but \u2013 where we're adding new supply and keeping the existing 500 units completely filled, that's a hard thing to do. We thought there would be more dilution from Pallas and PerSei, the first two products that we've built, when we opened up Henri. There's not. It sets the time. And of course, it's location-driven, but the amenitized environment, the pieces of the mixed-use communities, clearly, and we see it in every survey we take, are an important consideration for why people are choosing to live there. Collin Mings : Got you. So it sounds like, again, kind of the amenitized environment is helping insulate you guys to some degree from the supply pressures out there. Is that the overall message? Don Wood : I think I'm crystal clear, and I think you've seen it on the office, too. It's amazing that the office portfolio of this company is like 100% leased or nearly 100% leased. When you take a look at that building that we built at Assembly in Phase 1, that was not originally going to be built at that time. But we saw what we were doing with demand on the retail side, what was happening with AvalonBay up top, and we added a 100,000 square foot office building, completely leased up very quickly with people on the waiting list, and that will roll up as those tenants go. And so partners, the recent partners are there at the Assembly environment. The recent Merrill Lynch is at Pike & Rose at the amenitized environment. It's both office and resi. Collin Mings : Thanks for the color there. And then just one kind of housekeeping question for me. Just as far as the size of the active development \u2013 active redevelopment pipeline, looks like that's down here to start 2018 relative to how you started the last few years. Is this just a function of timing? Or are you being maybe a little bit more selective going back to some of the comments about allocating capital given some of the pressures in the environment? Don Wood : No. You don't see that yet. I mean, that's just timing. We delivered \u2013 we deliver ahead of that. Chris Weilminster : Well, we also have stabilized products that's kind of rolled into the stabilized pool and add up kind of the end process. The point is like a point. Don Wood : That's the point. The point is done. And so that jumped off. But so, no, you'll see that \u2013 I mean, not always being a little lumpy, but \u2013 no, I think what we're seeing on the redevelopment side within the portfolio is as active as ever and delivering good yields despite what's happened. Look, the capital allocation conversation really applies more to the bigger next phases of the big mixed-use portfolios. Dan G.: Yes, we got a pipeline on the redevelopment side, and you'll see that get replenished over the course of the year. Collin Mings : Great, I appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Vincent Chao : Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a quick question. Tax Reform Act, I guess, has been talked about generally positively for retailers, which makes a lot of sense. But I was just curious, for the guys that are struggling already that maybe don't benefit from tax reform even they don't have any profits, I mean, do you think this potentially could accelerate their demise as the better retailers have a little bit more firepower? Don Wood : Oh boy, I don't really have a good answer to you \u2013 for you on that one. I don't really know. I mean, the \u2013 I think it's a footnote to the bigger conversation as to whether that retailer or those retailers have a viable business plan in the new world. And those that do, I do think will benefit from tax reform. Those that don't, whatever. So I just don't think it's a \u2013 I don't know enough about those particular business plans, most particularly financial situations, which is what that comes down to. But it's hard for me to imagine that's the final thing that puts them over. I think there's bigger reasons they'll go. Vincent Chao : Right. That makes sense. Okay. And just one other question. You mentioned the sort of TIs and those kinds of costs staying relatively stable, but we have been hearing consistently about wage inflation and labor costs and material cost increases. So just curious, as you think about 2018, do you expect that number to stay stable in the face of some inflation here? Don Wood : Yes. Your point is dead on. I mean, there is certainly more pressure, continued pressure, but this has been the past five, seven years of more pressure to move risk from tenant to landlord. I like that we've kind of found some level of equilibrium overall. That doesn't mean there's not going to be a deal that we'll do with a big TI that has other benefits to the shopping center that happens occasionally, but basically, I see it stabilizing. I think that's a good thing. Look, that's again a property-by-property decision, the better properties are more leveraged. Vincent Chao : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is now open. Floris van Dijkum : Great, thanks. Hey, guys. As we\u2019re looking at a screen of thread again today and Federal's implied cap rate is in excess of 5.5%, what point do you start to consider share buybacks? And maybe if you could also, Don, maybe touch upon giving some cap rate guidance to the market perhaps. Don Wood : Floris, let me handle the buyback question because it's a good one. Look, we've been asked about buybacks over the past year at one point. And I've always said and I will still say with respect to this point that it's obviously not our preferred alternative. We absolutely prefer to allocate capital to projects that are long-term business plans, and that short-term variations in the marketplace are no reason to disrupt that business plan. I still believe that. But at some point, Floris, your point is not unheard at all, particularly in a year where we basically don't have the significant capital needs that we've had over the past few years. It can be on the table. Now how to execute that within our A rating, how to execute that within our overall business plan, probably requires asset sales to fund that. So the question earlier as to whether there could be increase in asset sales, I mean, that's part of the things that we're considering because markets are markets, there's not so much we can do about that, that's for sure. But we're getting close. We start talking about $100 here, that's $100 a share and 6% yield and better than 6% yield on this company, and it's \u2013 it will not be something that's ignored. And let me just leave it at that. Floris van Dijkum : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Your line is now open. Samir Khanal : Good morning. Dan, I know you've talked a little bit about this, but can you walk us through sort of your sources and uses? Just remind us, please, how much you generate in terms of free cash flow sort of annually and how much funding you'll need for sort of ground-up in developments over the next sort of two years to three years maybe after you generate \u2013 after what you generate from the condo sales at Pike & Rose and Assembly Row. You talked about being prefunded for 2018, but I'm trying to get a sense of what the picture looks like over sort of the next two years to three years. Dan G.: Yes. I think the $250 million to $300 million we had in guidance is kind of a general number. Maybe it's in the $200 million to $300 million range as we put a tighter lens on capital allocation over the course. And I think that the asset sales that we've kind of alluded to will be potentially a source of funding kind of going forward. Certainly, the condos in 2018 give us that prefunding. We also generate pretty significant, call it, $70 million to $75 million, in that range, of free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital that we use are very efficient form of capital, very low cost form of capital that we can reinvest into our business. That's a meaningful piece of it as well. And our balance sheet is positioned to \u2013 is positioned very well with very little drawn on our line of credit to start the year, and that we feel very, very good in terms of where our \u2013 not only for 2018 but even into 2019, where we stand from a capital plan perspective. Samir Khanal : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions in queue, so I'd like to turn the conference back over to Leah Andress. Leah Andress : Thanks, everyone. We look forward to seeing many of you in the next couple of weeks. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

Don Wood : Thanks Ms. Brady and good morning everyone. Really good quarter for us with all metrics from FFO to lease rollover growth to comparable property income growth, and others exceeding our expectations. Strengthened with across the board and while I always caution about reading too much into any 90 day period, our performance here was encouraging. FFO per share of a $1.52 beat consensus estimates by a couple of cents and was nearly 5% better than 2017 first quarter. That growth came despite the 60 basis point hit to occupancy caused by a couple of big vacates like DSW and Hollywood, Walmart and LA Sardines and [Mart] at Grand Park. Those vacancies were all anticipated and either have been or nearly released or part of a broader redevelopment plan as is the case Grand Park. In any event those rents will be more than replaced when backup. Rental income was up nearly 8% in the quarter reflecting both the Primestor acquisition mid way through last year and the fruits of strong leasing over the past few quarters in both the core and mixed use divisions. When those things are combined with lower operating expenses in G&A in many areas the overall result is powerful. So let\u2019s get some of the results and let me start with leasing. 78 deals for over 400,000 square feet at an average rent of 31.4 to 51 a foot 22% above the $25.91 that the previous tent was paying in the last year of their lease. By the way, TIs this quarter were lot lower than last year it\u2019s not a trend just the fact this quarter. Example of strong rollover deals were evident in both small shop and anchors and on both coasts. Floor and decor replacing one of our two Kmarts in the portfolio, a deal we\u2019ve been working on for quite some time and so with shopping center and suburban Boston was a big one. So with Bob's Discount Furniture that has taken the old Walmart space and one of the Primestor assets in greater Los Angeles that our restaurant offerings at places like the avenue at White Marsh and Linden Square at Wellesley, Massachusetts also contributed. Quarter-after-quarter the evidence suggests that tenants will pay higher rents when they\u2019re confident that they\u2019ll do the business to support it playing a good deals are getting done. Earnings growth at comparable property were stronger at 3.8% quarter-over-quarter and lease termination fees of those properties contributed 90 points of that result. As you know, we feel very strong with the lease termination fees are often the result of landlord leverage and a stronger negotiated lease and therefore belong in a comparable number. Sometimes it helps the comparison, sometimes it hurts but it's always an integral part how we run our business. It was a particularly strong quarter and our core shopping center business. I mentioned a minute ago that big store openings like Burlington at the Assembly Square Power Center, Michael's Brick Plaza and Melville for example resulted in strong leasing in past quarters really made their impact felt in this first quarter. Tighter cost controls and renegotiated vendor contracts also helped us drive the number to the bottom line. These results were posted despite the dilutive impact of new residential lease up at the Henri and Pike & Rose and the Montaje Assembly Row but based on the current pace of lease up those two buildings will be accretive to earnings by the latter part of this year and at current residential cap rates we\u2019ve already created about $100 million of value in those buildings. So let\u2019s talk about our residential portfolio for a minute and I\u2019ll start with an update on that residential leasing at our two buildings currently under lease up. The 272 unit Henri is now 82% leased, 76% occupied at net effective rate rents of $2.35 a foot ahead of budget on lease up pace and meeting budget on rate. When you factor in the other two stabilize residential buildings Pike & Rose they\u2019re already open which by the way we\u2019re not significantly impacted by the new supply coming on the combined residential lease percentage is now over 90% at that project. Adding the condos there are more than half way sold out at about $600 a foot which is above pro forma and there are nearly 800 families now living at this former strip shopping center beside. Pike & Rose quickly establishing itself as the regions residential destination choice. At Assembly Row the 447 unit Montaje High-Rise is now over 69% leased and 40% occupied and net effective rents of $3.37 a foot well above budget. As far as the condos are concerned there, all 107 market-rate units are sold out at $850 per foot and as of last week 96 of them have been closed on and delivered. As far as we know Avlon base product at Assembly continues to perform very well and now combined with our makes Assembly Row the residential destination of choice in the surrounding area. At Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, not to mention Santana Row, Bethesda Row and Congressional Plaza we think we just beautifully made the case for the strong demand for quality residential product at various price points and well planned Massachusetts communities. In its first 15 years of existence at Santana Row, the compound annual growth rate of the overall residential offering there approaches 4% I like this business. By the end of the year \u2013 the end of this year federal own and operate nearly 2700 residential units in major coastal markets. Those apartments are expected to generate about $55 million in operating income by calendar 2020 roughly a $1.2 billion residential portfolio. As far as other components of our development program, the 177 room Canopy Hotel by Hilton opened at Pike & Rose at the end of the first quarter was real with the product. The Grand opening parties saw a nearly a thousand guests, dignitaries, even Christmas [indiscernible]. We now strongly encourage investors and analysts and anyone else for that matter to experience this hotel anytime you come to Montgomery County, Maryland. As you may remember, we own 80% of equity in the hotel and a joint venture with local developer BPG group. We continue to make progress on completing the phase 2 retail lease up at those Pike & Rose and Assembly Row as they are 91% and 80% leased respectively. Both of these projects are creating very significant real estate value. Construction at 700 Santana Row our 300,000 square foot $210 million office building being built to anchor the end of the street remains on budget and on time for a late 2019 delivery. Leasing efforts are ongoing with lot of interest in both and the community for this heavily amenitized office environment. In Greater Miami, we\u2019re now under construction at CocoWalk to roughly $75 million redevelopment of this well located multistory retail center into a mixed-use project that would certainly offer seats to the Coconut Grove community with the addition of 80,000 square feet of prime office space on five floors. We\u2019re currently pretty far along in the lease negotiation with our national tenant but roughly half of that space in line with our pro forma rents without any but drawings to show them, it\u2019s a great start this transformation. Nothing more to say on Sunset Place given the challenge rejection of additional height and uses at this world shopping center and so we\u2019ll continue to operate it as it is for the time being. And that's about it from my prepared remarks for the quarter with a really good one that we hope to follow with another and another. Let me now turn it over to Dan for some additional color and then open the line to your questions. Dan G.: Thank you, Don and Leah, and hello, everyone.  Another solid quarter to start the year for Federal with FFO of 1.52 per share almost 5% above the first quarter of 2017. This result was a few pennies ahead of our expectations and $0.02 above consensus. Year performance was driven by higher NOI primarily due to less impact from failing tenants, higher other property revenues, lower property operating expenses with a slight offset from higher real estate taxes. On the same-store front, our comparable POI metric of 3.8% is driven higher by term fees which boosted the result by 92 basis points but was offset by additional proactive releasing activity which produced a drag of 42 basis points. With respect to our former same-store metrics which we will provide for a couple of quarters for comparability, same-store with redev was 3.6% for the quarter and same-store without redev was 3.5%, very solid figures which highlights strength across the core portfolio. Now to put in context Don\u2019s earlier comments regarding lease termination fees, the integral part of Federal's business strategy. Over the past 10 years Federal has averaged roughly $5.5 million of term fees annually. Since 2000 term fees have average roughly 4.25 million annually while it does vary somewhat from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter it is a consistent and recurring part of our business. We had a strong lease rollover number for the quarter 22% on over 400,000 square feet of leasing but not extended capital of just $18 per square foot roughly half of what we spent in 2017 on a per square foot basis. With prior rents of around $26 that represents $5.60 of positive rollover per square foot or $2.3 million of incremental rent windows leases start. Whoever as Don mentioned let\u2019s not get caught up in one quarter\u2019s results. We expect lease rollover for the year to be consistent with the past two years activity in the low to mid teams and capitals have also normalized, but we expect to see consistency in our ability to push funds across our best-in-class portfolio. On the occupancy fronts, our overall leased and occupied figures were 94.8% and 93.3% respectively both metrics growing by 20 basis points relative to first quarter of 2017. While there was roughly 50 basis points of decline relative to year-end levels, that can be attributed to our proactive releasing activity, deleasing at our Sunset place and Grand Park assets, as well as some seasonal impact following the holidays and our remerchandising activity at the [indiscernible]. On a proactive releasing front, where we initiate vacancy downtime and downtime with the objective of creating long term value and an enhanced merchandizing mix across the portfolio. In addition to the large leases we have already disclosed such as the Anthropologie flagship [indiscernible], Bob's Discount at Les Sardines and Los Angeles, Target at Sam's Park & Shop in Washington DC and a couple of deals on Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, we have added a TJ Maxx deal replacing two non-credit tenants at West Gate and Silicon Valley and [foreign to Cordele deal] in the Kmart bar in Greater Boston. So the list of value enhancing leases were produced down time and drag in our 2018 metrics and FFO per share and that\u2019s roughly $0.03 to $0.04 of drag on 2018 FFO but we will drive the long term value of our company by $50 million to $60 million net of capital. With respect to full year 2018 guidance, we are maintaining our range of $6.08 to $6.24 per share. There are no changes on our assumptions. Although with respect to our comparable POI metric, we should end up in the upper half of our 2% to 3% range given this quarter's outperformance. Now, onto the balance sheet. We entered 2018 extremely well positioned from a capital prospective and as a result there was not a significant amount of activity in the quarter. As John mentioned, we began closing on the condos under contract of Pike & Rose and Assembly Row in March and this has continued throughout April and into that. We raised $51 million by quarter end and roughly $100,000 in total year-to-date. As a result, at quarter end our net debt to EBITDA ratio improved from 5.9 times a year end to 5.7 times currently. This positive trend from leverage perspective should continue throughout the year as condos close and EBITDA ramps at Assembly Row, Pike & Rose. With respect to other credit metrics, our fixed charge coverage ratio improved from 3.9 times during the fourth quarter to 4.1 times for this first quarter. Our weighted average debt maturity remains in sector leading 11 years and our weighted average interest rate stands at 3.8% with nearly all of it fixed. As continued volatility in capital markets and arising interest rate land keep prevail, our A minus rated fortress balance sheet continues to position Federal to outperform in a challenging environment ahead. And with that operator, you can open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Nick Yulico from UBS. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] with Nick. Just thinking about the development pipeline between Assembly and Pike & Rose you are quickly winding down on over $600 million in development. Are future phases of those sites or other large development projects likely to be announced soon or are you expecting to your foot of the gas this year. Don Wood : The cool thing about both of those projects is that there is sufficient critical mass there in terms of a place that\u2019s been developed. So let us be opportunistic and so certainly construction costs are up, certainly our use of capital and this time environment is one that we are more spending on effectively than what we had done before. And having said that, we got deals in terms of the ability to build the next phase of Pike & Rose, the ability to push out incremental profits or residential product in particular at Assembly that we are working through. So, if you can think about what\u2019s going on as cyclical to some extent, to a larger extent my point of view, the last time this happened 2008 and 2009 we did not take off the foot of the gas in terms of planning and being ready to go at all in terms of future phases or in that case the initial phases. We are doing the same thing now. So, we are developing our plans. We are working through drawings. We are working with contracts et cetera. So that we are already to pull the trigger when we feel like we got a project that works in terms of our cost of capital. So you can expect that all of that lead up work which is significant as you can imagine for those that type of building that is still ongoing depending upon where we are later on the year with, construction cost and G&P and that kind of stuff, as well as the rest of condo proceeds and some asset sales that Dan will talk about we may very well be - will announce the next phase of those projects. Unidentified Analyst : And is there any update on fund side is there another vote in the work expansion? Dan G.: You know we\u2019re not spending a lot of time there. Yes, this is me speaking Chris, I\u2019ve kind of done those things for now. And you know the rest of our team is operating it, Chris Weilminster spending more time down there specifically for CocoWalk, but right now at Sunset, those guys doesn\u2019t want anything more, we\u2019re big company we have plenty of other things to do. That sounds a little bit right yes it is. Unidentified Analyst : Does that asset make sense to own if there is no redevelopment underway? Dan G.: I am not sure. It certainly carries itself and we will continue to carry itself for the time being. But in terms of what we do long-term if there is not a bigger play, I am not really excited about. So we\u2019ll have to - we\u2019ll evaluate that but it's not a 2018 decision. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Don I was wondering if you give an update on Primestor? Dan G.: Sure. In fact, I am looking for Jeff Berkes. Jeff Berkes want you an update on Primestor at this point. Jeff Berkes : Primestor I would say is going as expected. We've been closed now for seven to eight months and the operating team have come together and replace functioning efficiently and those are priorities and pulling on the same order, pulling already to the same direction, however that saying goes. We\u2019re actively looking to make some new investments, definitely to talk about on that front yet. But we\u2019re getting close and hopefully in the next quarter or two, we will be able to tell you something. So I think it as expected and going well. Portfolio is very well leased and as Don mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had a room I feel back - the former Walmart able to market space that will certainly and so happy how things are progressing with Primestor. Dan G.: The other thing I would add to that, I have because I cannot help myself Craig is that with respect to the development that we mentioned in the past when I just said we hopefully will be there in the next quarter or two. But it has made its made its way through our investment committee and that improves at our investment committee level. So we\u2019re ready to go to the extent there they are [indiscernible] with respect to the other specifics with the city. Craig Schmidt : And then just a question on CocoWalk, are you essentially done with any zoning or municipality approvals that you need for that project? Dan G.: Completely. Operator : Our next question is from Christy McElroy from Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Just a following up on hotel opening taken room, you had a - I know in the Q about an associated loss in equity and income. Just wondering from a cash flow perspective, given your 80% equity interest, how should we thinking about the impact of this investment kind of coming online in March, since we had the rest of the year? Don Wood : That impact in our financials was really just a preopening cost and the marketing cost where a 28 days of operation in the quarter. So clearly that was expected. Yes, we would expect some ramp-up in the hotel over the course of the year, clearly, but if the new hotel we don\u2019t expect a lot of contribution until later in the year with regards to our investment in the Canopy. But we are really pleased with the products and we're pleased with the opening thus far. Christy McElroy : And then just related Don. In your shareholder letter, you highlighted that 17% was Federal, minimum range comes from residential and office tenants, not retail. You also highlighted the mixed use and the diversification of the income stream. I'm just wondering if you think of sort of where Federal could be five and ten years from now. And in context of your views on retail per capita shrinking in the U.S., how we should expect your mix and diversification to continue to change? So where could that 17% go? And you also highlight in your remark how the resi portfolio is growing. So everything coming online, presumably it goes up. Just wondering how much is acceleration? Don Wood : First of all, it will accelerate or be a larger percentage - not a much larger percentage. And let me kind of get to why that all is. Obviously the point on making in there which I think is frankly the most important thing to think about is the diversity of any income stream. And the more diverse that income stream is, lower the lows if you will during an uncertain time. We are and should always be considered, as long as I'm here, a retail company. And if you think about it, the reason residential and office are an important part of our income stream yes, 17% is a real important part of our income stream. It's because we've created that environment with retails on the ground floor. And it's a really, really, really important thing to remember. And so, what we think are or the thing we do the best is figure out how to take a piece of land or a location and get lots of people to it on a regular basis. Then in places that can handle densification and intensification, the way to make money is up. And so up we go, and so the notion of that mixed use piece of the business which is 25% of our total business - and that 25% includes the retail and nothing else. That's about where that will be. It could go a little bit higher, but about like that. But just like last year, when we made a $350 million investment in Primestor which is all-retail and boxes in large measure that would bring that 17% down or did bring that percentage down. So it's balanced. We're growing and trying to use all of the arrows in our quiver, all the tool boxes, [indiscernible] is what we do. So you should think about I think the notion that this is a retail company through and through. Even in 2018 or 2020 or 2022, put that we know how to create place. And with place, comes the ability to maximize real estate value and maximizing real estate value means residential, on that property, means office on those properties. And as I said at the beginning, we believe thoroughly through and through those properties work on an immigrated basis. And so the idea, the value of Santana Row or Pike & Rose or Assembly Row is very, very much tied to the way those pieces work together. I hope that's helpful. Operator : Our next question is from Jeremy Metz from BMO Capital Market. Your line is now open. Jeremy Metz : You had a strong start to the year with a 3.8% comp NOI. You mentioned the benefit from the term fees, but you hold onto that 2% to 3% range. It sounds like you're pointing towards the high end now. How much of not formally changing the range at this point is just adding caution given the current retail environment. There's maybe more known items that could drag you back down in that 2% arena when it's all set and done. And then maybe as a follow on, can you comment on the demand you're seeing, and maybe break down the demand side a little bit in terms of traditional open a retailer, how much is maybe typically more and more retailers looking to enjoy some fresh air and maybe appetite from e-tailers to brick and mortar. Don Wood : Look, it's May 3. It's May 3rd, and in a company, that does have a lot of parts of our business as Christy was just talking about. So we are bringing in - new product being developed. We do have an uncertain environment with respect to some extent, bankruptcies. But the biggest thing is we're not a commodity company. So there is a bunch going on. During the year, lots of thing that do affect capitalized interest. When you bring properties - when you bring up the big construction of profits into service, and that creates some uncertainty. So on May 3rd, we're going to keep the guns right where it is. It's not any particular known thing that's going to the other way which is specifically what you're asking I think. In the latter part of the year, it is a caution, but the caution is not sandbagging, the caution is a complicated business but a lot of stuff happened at this point. With respect to the second part of your question, I think there's nothing more interesting than looking at UNIQLO choosing Pike & Rose in terms of what retailers are trying to do and figure out, in terms of their future. Every one of these retailers is grappling with how many stores, what size the store should be, and most importantly, where they should be. And everyone of those retailers has a different business plan and what we are absolutely finding is that there is more certainty in 2018 versus 2017 in terms of what direction those retailers are choosing. What we don't know is, are they right and whether those plans will make sense in 2020 or 2022 or 2024. That has a landlord. All we can do or what we think is the most important thing to do is to create a place, create that environment that they could do the best business in. It starts with location, it includes place making, it sort of includes the other merchandising that's happening within the center. And that's where I think we have a big competitive advantage. Jeremy Metz : I just have one follow on here on toys. I think you only have the one box, I know I think it's almost back filled or maybe you can talk about that, that existing store release. And then I think you had some adjacent unknown toys at various assets. So any color you can share there in terms of the process or - are you bidding on those and do you think you can shake some more fleet that could create potentially larger opportunities? Don Wood : We did get control of the one that we do own in [indiscernible] which is great news. It's way under market, we've got demands, that'll be a good story when that's back on. That's the one that we own. The real interesting one to me is the box that we did not own, but as you said, was adjacent to East Bay Bridge which is a traditional power center. I mean, if you listen to the common dialog, it's a power center, there was Toys R' Us adjacent to it, how can that be a good thing. But that particular piece of land and the performance of that particular power center meant that the auction process that happened on toys are unboxed for which we did go through investor committee and approve a big number in terms of our ability to control that box. And by the way, that big number meant that we could have either backfilled it with another box retailer or it's a really good residential site. Given what's happening there, we bid aggressively. We and 14 others for that site, and at the end of the day, we lost it. We did not get it to a number that we could make sense with. So, supply and demand matters, and also issue really matters. And those are the two toy boxes that were in play. There is a third one in the Primestor portfolio that has not worked its way through the system yet and we're hanging around the hoop just to see how that plays out. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeff Donnelly : I guess your competitors reported, I guess that they're weakening pricing in lower cap rate markets. Do you believe that to be the case and do you think maybe the 7 to 8 cap rate dispositions that are coming into market are providing a source of competition for retail capital? Jeff Berkes : So kind of two thoughts on that question. First, for the high quality product, we really haven't seen pricing change. There hasn't been a tremendous number of trades but the trades that have happened have been priced very, very aggressively and we don't think cap rates are backed up at all from the high quality stuff. What has changed I think is how people define high quality. It used to be that if a shopping center has a grocery store and within a major metro area in the United States, it was considered high quality. And I think people are a little bit more discerning and a little bit wiser now and even want to see true brochure of quality asset or what we like to buy which is in still properties with a lot of people and income round of those assets and some definable go forward and line growth. So the definition of the quality has changed a little bit but what people are paying for quality hasn\u2019t changed at all. Second you get outside out that and it\u2019s anybody guess. What the cap rate is going to be on an asset or whether the asset even going to trade, could be a six could be seven could be an eight, we are seeing a lot of deals just not happen right now because the buyers aren\u2019t showing up. And my own personal view on that is the market whether its equity market or debt market to buy those centers is nervous that the values have bottomed yet and they are not defined. So interesting time, I think that answers your question but if not let me know. Jeff Donnelly : Yes, it does and maybe just as follow-up to that, what is thinking you mentioned through grocer, I think that\u2019s for many, many years there was having a traditional grocer if you will ever since stop and shop however depending on the region of the country really defines that. I means what\u2019s been the reaction to sort of Walmart or Target with food or Trader Joe's and all the you mean are lenders or buyers viewing those as grocery anchor right now or is there still sort of chasm between traditional and maybe there sort of emerging types of food we get? Jeff Berkes : Lenders are looking at it and we don\u2019t feel like secure debt so and I\u2019ll spend a lot of time talking to the life insurance or securitized communities to figure out what they think of those types of alternative grocery anchors if you like on that. I mean again in my view and this has been our view for a long time et cetera what\u2019s important is having the right grocer and the right trade area. So could that be and old deal leader or could that be Trader Joe's or small local chain or whole foods and non-traditional grocer absolutely. And yes as you look I am talking to Walmart and others putting more feed in the stores, absolutely that can take the place of the traditional grocer in certain trade areas. So I think it's very trade area specific but I do think the shine is off the traditional grocer drug anchored 125,000 square foot neighborhood somewhere. Jeff Donnelly : You touched on this in a earlier question but just seems like last year there was just such a flood of daily announcements round sort of closures, this year if feels sort of like desert if you will by comparison. But there is still that overhang out by retailers. I am just curious as it relates to leasing have you guys see any change in the tenure of appetite releasing and specifically have you seen any sort of change in either resistance to sort of venture coding or seeking more TI or lease duration are going to like kick out, so I am just curious if that's most are evolved into different kind of lease negotiation may be then you had 12 months ago? Jeff Berkes : I would say no Jeff not for 12 months ago, I would say absolutely yes over the last five years. And I am making a distinction there, I think importantly I think the notion that tenants want to pay less rent and have more control of their space through other things being a new concept is not true. Those negotiations are - have gone for a long time there is no question that over the last five years pushing harder on tenant improvement dollars themselves, pushing harder for terms that whether the kick outs whether they use restriction other things in the leases are absolutely negotiated hard as our rent. So I mentioned only one thing but I see such difference in places where we got leverage and places where we don\u2019t have leverage. And we have leverage its no difference you either want in or don\u2019t want in and places where you\u2019ve only got one choice one day yes, they are going to get a whole lot more in terms of those deals. And so over the last 12 months what I\u2019d like about over last 12 months is I think as I said before tenants they picked a direction and not all of them but more of them certainly then a year ago have a picked a direction and here they go. This is what they are doing, this is what the plan is and that\u2019s a very positive thing. Now depending on the location and depending what is it that they want, who else wants the space there is you\u2019re going to have those negotiation points that you just mentioned, some would propel on somebody won't. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a last 12 months that\u2019s changed - that changed that amount of leverage. Jeff Donnelly : And may be just one last question Don, I think it was about a year ago you could talked about maybe the greater need for data as landlord in this business. Maybe the investments there or you kind of explored that further I am curious what you are thinking is? Don Wood : And I do believe that, we have not made investments yet to this point. We\u2019re looking at some stuff hard and I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re looking at this point from an investment perspective as it is really trying to get a good look as to what of it matters. I mean there are a lot of - I am going to calling fly by night consulting firms and data firms affectively taking advantage or trying to take advantage just as you would or I would in a dislocated market and fearing with landlords who fear oh my gosh I have to have more data, I have to understand and we\u2019re making good money consulting. But how much of that is actionable and how much of that is relevant today but not in six months because the technology is changing so quick, those are really open questions. And so what we are doing here is there is a task force here with upper companies that exclusive Jeff Berkes and some other folks. We are exploring and talking to companies to try to uncover really whether they have anything here that valuable or not and how do affectively play along. So that\u2019s where we are in the whole genesis and lifecycle of figuring out the best way to play in technology as opposed to jump in water with stuff that may not nearly be as valuable as being portrayed. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Don can you talk about the average occupancy cost in your portfolio and how that\u2019s trended over time? Don Wood : I can try Ki Bin, but one of the things about us is we don\u2019t have a lot of reporting in terms of sales reporting. So what I am going to say take with in that context roughly 30% of our tenants report sales and therefore allow us that really figure out what occupancy is with the data that makes sense. We also have very active property management group that tries to get that data so that we can accumulate that database and try to figure it out. And when you look and you see it our best guess, is that somewhere around 9%, 8.5%, 9.5% something like that but again it based on a whole of lot of limited data that number has trended up as we would expect. Over the past three years but we\u2019re also doing it awful lot in changing out ports and its renew tenants and that\u2019s whole proactive leasing initiatives that we have been pushing like crazy over the past three years and so from that perspective, you\u2019ll see it coming down a little bit but I am kind of working around the edges because they don\u2019t have good clean data but in trying to answer your question that\u2019s affectively what we believe overall in the portfolio. Ki Bin Kim : I see and may be this is one even tougher then, so when you think about the leasing spreads on renewals that were out 20% in general are these retailer have been there for awhile and their sales have maybe increased over the life of lease. Have their occupancy cost dropped and when you renew it up 20%, you're bringing it back to like a portfolio average or is it more of a case where it goes above the portfolio average? Don Wood : Look I get the point a 110%, think about this way first of all. This is not a commodity company, so if you were to look at the standard deviation around lease rolls up, lease rolls down things being flat it\u2019s what. And so that's 22% don\u2019t expect 22% as the Dan has said as a run rate for this company, that 22% was a couple of deals in particular I mentioned them that we were real hard in with respect to old space that Kmart space since August has been under market for years and as a result, we finally were able to get that back and put the market rate tenants. So boom, rent was up 400% in that case. That\u2019s always been the case with Federal, that continues to be the case with Federal, the other thing associated with that as you kind of think of tenant sale is you do, you do have a mix of tenants that\u2019s all over the place in terms of occupancy cost for restaurant versus occupancy cost for furniture store or growth, so we did, it\u2019s very wide and going back to Christy\u2019s question in terms of the diversity of our income stream that makes it even, even harder to kind of put us in the same place as others. Overall, we\u2019re running individuals places and locations where we\u2019re constantly trying to change out tenants to get best-in-class. And so as a result, if I had perfect information you would see occupancy cost ratios going up, going down, going up, going down that would be relatively volatile overall I don\u2019t have that information but that\u2019s how we\u2019re running the business. So it\u2019s certainly not direct answer but it\u2019s directionally how it is that we\u2019re doing. Operator : Our next question is from Daniel Santos from Sandler O\u2019Neil. Your line is now open. Daniel Santos : I was wondering if you could talk a bit about acquisitions, as you\u2019re looking at new deals, has your underwriting changed and what your focus unchanged over the years given the changing environment? Don Wood : Daniel it\u2019s good to talk to you, I can\u2019t imagine Alex not being on the call, I\u2019m very disappointed and you can tell him that. Jeff Berkes : It\u2019s harder now to find a deal from underwriters deals appropriately certainly then were because we\u2019re on the market real time, leasing space, operating centers and we\u2019re in relatively few markets and understand the markets we\u2019re in well. That diligence if you will is constantly evolving and to make sure we\u2019ve made investments and we find assets where we can create value. So yes, there is nothing static if you will about the way we underwrite it or look at any of our investments. So I don\u2019t know if that answers your question but something that is constantly evolving here. Daniel Santos : And I just wondering on Pike & Rose and Assembly Row if you guys had a guess where you would be on the retail leasing front in the holiday season this year, what would you say? Dan G.: Well, I think in both cases we will be nearly fully leased, we won\u2019t be fully open and so that\u2019s the difference, the build-out, so I was just looking at this morning as it related to couple of new deals that we did at Pike & Rose and there is a couple of concepts that we\u2019re doing that are really cool but they won\u2019t be open until the spring of 2019. So when you think about really Pike & Rose being a real fully opened experience in terms of the street, we\u2019re talking of 15 months from now or 18 months from now something like that but the leases, the commitments if you will be certainly done by the end of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Mike Mueller : I was wondering when you look at the redevelopment pipeline and think about the mix of spend over the next five years or so coming from Assembly, Pike & Rose, Santana in that bucket versus the other catch all buckets, I mean do you anticipate the things similar to what it\u2019s been or will that mix change? Dan G.: I do Mike and let me talk about that in a couple of ways, first of all the redevelopment of our core shopping center is such an important part in this business. The initial yields are usually better, obviously the risk is lower, it\u2019s the established places that we\u2019re adding and but it\u2019s very hard to put 100s of millions of dollars in any period of time to work on that, it doesn\u2019t work like that, there is smaller projects but in an important part. In terms of the bigger projects, there is - I got a lid of $1 billion of just went through with the board of capital that could be deployed over the next three years in primary the big projects including Coco including Santana et cetera, as well as Pike & Rose and Assembly but whether we deploy that or not goes back to the first quarter Mike if that was asked and that its\u2019 going to be, can we understand our cost to capital, can we get construction cost online to get comfortable with the rents that will get in that projects that makes some sense, can we get the appropriate counting assistance in the case of Pike & Rose, I don\u2019t know yet. But we\u2019re going to be ready to go to the extent the answers to that yes and depending on asset sales in other ways capitalizing. Mike Mueller : And then switching gears for second on the Primestor portfolio, is there a any notable differences that you're seeing in terms of lease spreads, NOI growth or mark-to-market versus your other comparable assets that on the coast. Don Wood : I want to just thinking about them will give you an answer. I got a pretty strong view on this and there is no question that while the Primestor assets, don't look or feel the same way as Third Street Promenade or even Escondido Shopping Center or Plaza El Segundo, they act similarly and the reason they act similarly is because demand exceeds supply and so that\u2019s a gain that's what's necessary here, so I don't know Jeff if you can. I don't see when we look at the numbers of the renewals, when we look at new releases they just the case of big box that we just saw like from Bob's for Wal-Mart. They're similar things that happen in our portfolio and so a more high profile asset like Third Street Promenade has been deliver in that way for 20 years frankly for us. There and continues to keep giving, so we obviously don't have that level of history and understanding of the price of our assets over that longer term but today I don't see the remarkable difference personally I don't know Jeff you want to answer that? Jeff Berkes : No, I don't either and I think it's a good question and ask as in the year or two again we've only been in the portfolio for a few months there has not been a tremendous amount of space the reviews the ways. What we have done is generally been in line with what we underwrote with the exception of the Les Sardines deal which was significantly accessible we under wrote. So it's just not enough because three for me to give you really going to answer that question but its general in line with everything else in our portfolio in California? Operator : Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Your line is now open. Floris van Dijkum : Don you made a comment a little bit earlier you alluded to some asset sales and then suggested that Dan was going to gets some more detail but I\u2019m curious what you had meant by that? Don Wood : Floris it's funny. I do that a lot and then Dan doesn\u2019t give more detail I don't know let's see if you can hold on for good. Dan G.: So what was the question for us? Floris van Dijkum : Well, if I try to get a sense of any planned asset sales I guess and if you guys can get some color. Dan G.: Look we got a and I've talked about this with folks before, we got a pool from an asset sale perspective of high tax basis, tax efficient assets that we can sell and is roughly around call the $0.5 billion or more. And we feel so we can be very opportunistic with regards to getting into the market and taking advantage of strength in the investment sales market where it\u2019s strong. But that's just one arrow in the quiver that we have from a capital perspective and I would expect us to kind of fund our business going forward with, as Don like to call them from in technical terms of a little bit of this from a little bit of that from a capital perspective. We generate that $70 million to $80 million annually of free cash flow as the dividends and maintenance capital that we can redeploy into the business. We've got this pool of $0.5 billion plus of assets that we can sell on reasonable tax efficient basis. Look we already closed $100 million of condos sitting here in the last two months, very, very cash efficiently and probably have another $50 million more to sell over the balance of the year and into 2019. We have A minus rated balance sheet, that gives us the flexibility on a move forward basis, we will operate in our - within the metrics of A minus rated balance sheet but it\u2019s a balance sheet that has tremendous capacity. Plus we\u2019re getting a lot of reverse increase from institutions who want to partner with us and we will explore that and if it makes sense we will go there but I think we\u2019ve got multiple areas where we can fund the business on a go forward basis and I think that\u2019s what I talked about in terms of having a balance sheet that is positioned for us to continue our growth plans over the next two to three to five years without kind of over the lines on common stock. Don Wood : Maybe Floris, the only thing I would add to that, I do pay I like the point on raising $100 million so far with condos can\u2019t be overlook, it\u2019s been really important, 35 more of that to go this year, the rest in the next year that\u2019s great tax efficient fully usable in terms of proceeds money and $0.5 billion that Dan talked about in terms of the overall fed up assets that we could sell tax efficiently if we wanted to, we have identified about $75 million of that, so we would expect to have on the market by the end of June or early July something along that and therefore see readily a lease closed at $75 million by the end of the year. So when you look at that, that\u2019s $200 million plus in 2018 of proceeds through selling assets, very tax efficient. Floris van Dijkum : One other question I have for you guys, Don you mentioned I believe that refresh me on the fact but your Santana Row apartment NOI growth has averaged something like 4% over the last 15 years, I\u2019m curious to see how does that compare to your retail NOI growth there and curious to see if you think something obviously you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019re going to do something similar, Assembly and Pike & Rose but is that achievable as we look forward? Don Wood : Floris, I love the question, it\u2019s really cool into that really and we\u2019re one of the only that has some real history on what happens with next years\u2019 projects and it\u2019s facet, I don\u2019t know if you remember or not, I certainly do, the Santana Row could not have started out and even in terms of the apartments and terms of the rent growth that way. But when you look at what happens as that place is established and if I come the place to hang out, I mean we were doing by the end sorry not by the end but even in the last phase of Santana Row is was adding in residential products that we would not have thought of before because we haven\u2019t figure out a way that add a product that got in there under $2000 a month and that product was very small work with spaces in the back of the garage that we had that sold out. So that is about 4% effectively has come from over that period of time. On the retail, the retail like retail everywhere does particularly well in strong economic periods of time and today our retail growth at Santana Row is slower than it\u2019s been before because it\u2019s retail today. Having the ability to exploit the place sold up in terms of residential product like that is a real advantage, it is only the retail you\u2019re going to move up with up and down with the retail market but having the incremental uses that exploit that retail place is really special. Over the 15 years, the retail number on a compounded annual growth basis at Santana Row is also close to 4%, 3.5%, 3.7% something like that but a bit more volatile. Operator : Your next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Haendel St. Juste: So question for you, a couple here quickly. Curious on your view on converting potentially converting some deal space to create of office space certainly seems to be I think we\u2019re hearing more of these days how relevant perhaps how attracted of an opportunity, do you view that for your portfolio. Don Wood : Yes, I love that question. The one thing that the question is it being done defensively or offensively and I make that distinction because it's really important. When you're saying gosh I have a place that doesn't have any more retail demand for whatever reasons they are and so maybe let me convert it to some type of trade office space and the results aren't great but they're better than they would be zero for retail any longer. I mean assets defend to move and that happens it's not a bad thing, it's better than the alternative what we're focused on is the offensive side of it, so when you take a CocoWalk which is a multi level retail property with an absent some but there of office products a office product in the marketplace and the marketplace is one that's filled with, it well to do people that are sick and tired of driving in their carts in Miami because of the traffic, now you have an office of situation and so converting that retail product from all retail basically to have retail and have office. I mean we'll see we don't have the sign deals yet but the demand on that office side is powerful and so I don't think like anything in real estate I think it's, I don't think it's a trend as much as it is a parse you need to parse the opportunities between offensive and defensive we are in a couple of places called one being the most obvious looking at it from that offensive expansion. Haendel St. Juste: And sort of an earlier question looks like just looking at reading pipeline here the next three, four years you need to find a billion ish, billion plus. Sounds like asset sales are now part of the consideration and JV Capital that was certainly the crux of my question, so I guess I'm curious is if you look at the potential JV interest, what type of cap rates you think you could fetch should use partial interest? Don Wood : Let me stop, let me reset your premise, if you don\u2019t mind. The idea of how to fund development or redevelopment I think or acquisitions capital use is something that we're really proud of not having only one alternative and so the reality is it would probably be if I were betting on this you'll probably see a little bit of everything, so you'll probably see more debt that gets issued you'll see a bit more asset sales as we just went through. We will absolutely look at and understand the JV market for certain assets. I don't really want to we\u2019ve done I think a very good job of not doing joint ventures, not complicating this company for fund raising purposes but we do a joint venture it's for strategic purposes. It's because the Primestor folks are bring something strategically, the most important thing strategically to the deal that won't change. I don't think you should look at JVs in this company as oh that's how we're going to raise the money to do something. I think you should look at it, it's strategically does something important for us. And so that will be a component there could be a components that\u2019s - so if you can think about this on a more balanced approach to that $1 billion again and then on the other side is it a billion or is it $0.5 billion that some project to make, some projects won\u2019t make that way. All of these things are happening together and I think if you look at our path for how we try to stop to execute that balance, you'll see that we don't go all in on any one time. Haendel St. Juste: And one last one it\u2019s the question on Primestor and maybe it's not a fair question asked but I'm going to try anyway. I'm wondering if the change in let's call it the political climate is impacting how you're thinking about your Primestor JV in potential future investments. I was probably surprised to hear that there doesn't seem to have been any impact to sales and traffic given the demographics of the neighborhoods involved here but curious how the political climate is playing a role in your thinking about, the underwriting of future investments on the JV. Don Wood : Yes, and first of all nothing wrong with that question and it\u2019s certainly something that if you had a spy and ICSE last year when we were in the final negotiations you would have seen Dan Guglielmone and myself outside of the nascent top-dog place on the phone with Berkes and some other people saying, what do you think political climate going to do to the demand on. So those assets over the long-term and the boats and everything else, and so it\u2019s a real good question and we without question after going through at all after trying to understand that the retailers points of view of their understanding looking at the empirical fact in terms of the sales and what it happened over the previous couple of years that way and also very much being completely supportive of the most diverse population that we can have, we think it\u2019s a positive thing in so many ways over the long-term the idea of being a major player in California and not participating in the Latino community seems like we are taking one hand and tying it behind our back with respect to it failing our business and seeing the opportunities we had. It\u2019s now a year later we are, and I am now speaking for me and I am looking at Jeff see if he\u2019s going to agree with me or not. I am 110% committed in the same way that we were before and over the long-term I just don\u2019t know how in the world you can ignore 50% of the population in Los Angeles count. Operator : Thank you. At this time I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We will look forward to seeing many of you at May REIT in a couple of weeks. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Leah Andress Brady : Good morning, I would like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Dawn Becker, Jeff Berkes and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that certain matters on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty\u2019s future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our website. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Well, thanks, Leah. Good morning, everybody. Another really good quarter for us and one where it\u2019s increasingly evident that we are using our existing real estate platforms to create and enhance real estate value through redevelopment and intensification on both coasts. The focal point is exploitation of our superior locations and cash flow stream through the lens of a broad real estate perspective. So consider it the breadth of these opportunities that are well underway on sites that are already demonstrated in proven retail destinations. First from big pad sites and often multi-talent \u2013 tenants being built and delivered at places like Montrose Crossing in Rockville, like Pike 7 in Tyson\u2019s, Willow Lawn in Richmond, Dedham Plaza in Massachusetts, to name a few, to the addition of two unique and market relevant hotels at Pike & Rose and Assembly Row. The boutique Canopy brand by Hilton that recently opened at Pike & Rose and the boutique Autograph hotel by Marriott that\u2019s about to open any day at Assembly Row to the reimagining of obsolete CocoWalk into a vibrant mixed-use community partial, but significant demolition is well underway, and leasing is just as strong, to the first new investment in the Primestor portfolio, about $40 million from Federal, since the formation of the venture in the form of Jordan Down, a to be developed 113,000 square foot grocery-anchored shopping center in Greater L.A. To the newly executed lease or about to be executed lease, with a powerful and growing technology firm to take the entirety of our 280,000 square foot spec office building an anchoring the end of the street at 700 Santana Row and so on. Now while most of those initiatives do not yet produce cash flow and, in fact, they were overall dilutive in the quarter to the tune of $0.02 a share, they will and have already significantly enhanced the value of the established shopping centers that they sit on. So while those and many other real estate transportation initiatives are moving ahead at full speed, our core business is doing just fine. We reported FFO per share of $1.55 in the second quarter, ahead of both consensus and our internal expectations by a couple of cents, as well as the $1.49 reported in last year\u2019s quarter. Since then, sustainable growth. Rental income was up nearly 8% in the quarter, reflecting both the Primestor acquisition midway through last year and the fruits of strong leasing over the past few quarters in both the core and mixed-use divisions. When those things are combined with lower operating expenses and G&A in many areas, the overall result is powerful. So let\u2019s get to some of the results and let me start with leasing. 99 comparable deals for 449,000 square feet at an average rent of $34.75 a foot, 10% above the $31.61 that the previous tenant was paying in the last year of the lease. TI\u2019s were high this quarter, largely due to a couple of deals important to our redevelopment efforts like L.A. Fitness at Brick Plaza in New Jersey. Let met spend a quick minute on this, because TI is offensively invested as part of a property\u2019s repositioning in a strong location are, in our view, an important and productive allocation of capital. And Brick Plaza is a great example of what has to happen in today\u2019s retail environment to strive in the future. Arguably the best located shopping center in the sub-market with numerous other retail choices, Brick needed a far more relevant tenant base for the future along with commensurate physical improvement and place making to assure it was a consolidator in the market. The shopping center can not only survive, but they\u2019ll thrive in the next decade. We\u2019re well on our way. Let me tell you about this. The 400,000 square foot-plus center that is, up until a few years ago, was merchandised with a failing A&P, a failing Bon-Ton, a failing Sports Authority, an old format and outdated theater, Dollar Tree and an underperforming Ethan Allen. Compare that with the new anchor system that includes TJX\u2019s HomeGoods, Michaels, Ulta, DSW, a multimillion complete renovation of the Lowe\u2019s Theater and the aforementioned L.A. Fitness. A couple more yet to come as we\u2019ll be getting back Bon-Ton the next month or so, and the physical improvements in placemaking are nearly done. Imagine what those changes do, not only to the direct cash flow stream, but also to the future small shop demand and most importantly, the centers cap rate. Offensive capital allocation creates significant value. All TIs are not created equal. Earnings growth at comparable properties were strong at 3.6% quarter-over-quarter. And our overall portfolio was 95% leased, up 20 basis points since the end of the first quarter, 50 basis points since the second quarter of 2017. And while we are 95% leased, we\u2019re only 93.7% occupied, a good sign as it relates to upcoming rent starts and their impact on the future income stream. I also think we\u2019ve done and continue to do a really good job managing expenses in this environment, both at our corporate both the corporate and the property level. We do so without compromising the customer experience at our properties. Property level expense savings achieved through aggressive negotiations and constant focus on scope are shared with our tenants, which have the added benefit of relieving rent pressure to an extent. It\u2019s an underrated, but an important balance of professional shopping center management, something we pay a lot of attention to. In terms of the status of many of our initiative, let\u2019s start with CocoWalk in Miami, where the redevelopment is fully underway. Of course, that means we are now in the particularly dilutive demolition stage, which negatively impacted earnings growth by about $0.01 this quarter. Lots of interest and demand from both retail and office tenants, now that it\u2019s physically clear that\u2019s something significant is happening there. The continued maturation of both Assembly and Pike & Rose is proceeding as expected, with initial residential lease up virtually complete at Pike & Rose, we\u2019re just recently 95% leased and should be similarly occupied by the end of next quarter. Excuse me, with average net effective rents approaching $2.40 a foot. In at Assembly, we are currently 85% leased and 73% occupied with stabilized residential occupancy by the end of the year. Average net effective residential rents approached to $3.40 at Assembly. You will note in the 8-K a cost overrun of about 3% at Assembly Row Phase 2. The result of a more cautious approach to an expected Massachusetts development grant, along with an upgraded unit and common area investment at the Montaje residential building. So we felt that those enhancements were prudent, given the significantly higher and underwritten rents. Those rents more than covered the higher cost, which will result in a stronger Assembly stabilized yields. As I touched on earlier, the additions of hotels at these two largest mixed-use communities adds to a unique destination dynamic that we saw work firsthand immediate \u2013 amazingly well at Santana Row. The Canopy is open and it started ramping up the Pike & Rose, and the Row Hotel at Assembly Row will open any day now and will also start ramping up in the third quarter. Ramp up is naturally dilutive and is negatively impacted second quarter results by about $0.01. Out on the West Coast, we added to our Primestor venture, the first round of development opportunity $40 million to construct Jordan Downs Plaza, a 113,000 square foot shopping center anchored by New York Stock Exchange public company grocer Smart & Final. That lease, coupled with other signed LOIs puts us at about 80% pre-committed when construction started. Primestor has been working closely with the Jordan Downs community and a Los Angeles housing authority for years. The property is located in the Watts section of Los Angeles in close proximity to other assets in the Primestor joint venture, particularly La Alameda in Walnut Park, and of course, is earmarked by its incredible density and lack of shopping alternatives. Perhaps the best news is the new lease by a large technology firm to take down the entirety of 284,000 square foot office component of 700 Santana Row. Both economics and tenant occupancy timing beat our underwriting. We have been asked by the tenant not to reveal their identity at this point, as they want the opportunities to do so to their employees first and we\u2019ll respect that. As you may recall, the building is still under heavy construction and won\u2019t be turned over to tenants for their build out till next year. So the strong interest in economics from a number of perspective users, both full building and multiple tenants so soon is incredibly satisfying to us. We gave lots of thoughtful consideration to a full building user versus splitting it up among multiple users. But economic, credit and other factors led us to the conclusion that this was the best risk-adjusted decision. We would expect occupancy late in 2019. And before I open the line to your questions, I wanted to acknowledge the contributions and friendship of both Don Brigs and Chris Weilminster over the past couple of decades here. I assume most of you saw the press release yesterday. I\u2019m sure going to miss these guys and wish them the best of luck at Urban Edge. I\u2019m also certainly happy to address your questions in this regard in the G&A section \u2013 sorry the Q&A session, not the G&A section. And that\u2019s about it from my prepared remarks for the quarter. It was a really good one that we hope to follow with another and another. Let me now turn it over to Dan for some additional color and then open the lines to your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our $1.55 per share of FFO for the quarter was a few pennies ahead of our expectations and $0.02 above consensus. This outperformance was driven by higher NOI through occupancy gains across the portfolio, less impact from failing tenants and lower property level expenses, as well as lower G&A, but was offset by drag from the start-up of our two new hotels, at Pike & Rose and Assembly, the latter of which is yet to open. Our comparable POI metric of 3.6% in a solid result and it also bested our forecast as a result of the items I just mentioned. Our continued proactive releasing activity this year provided a drag of 70 basis points in that result. Please recall that we project this year\u2019s proactive releasing activity to lay on FFO by $0.03 to $0.04, but it will generate roughly 50 to 60 basis points of incremental value-creation. With respect to former same-store metrics, which we will continue to provide for another quarter or two, same-store with re-dev was 3.4% and same-store without re-dev were 3.5%. Our lease rollover number for the quarter stood at 10%, almost 450,000 square feet of comparable leases. Combined with the 22% in Q1, our growth for the first-half of the year was 15% and on an LTM basis also 15%. But I have \u2013 as I have highlighted on previous calls, remember this is real estate, where true value creation and growth should be measured over the long-term, and let\u2019s not get overly focused on any one quarter or even any one year\u2019s metrics. With respect to occupancy, our overall leased and occupied figures were 95% and 93.7%, respectively, with the metrics growing by 20% and 40 basis points \u2013 20 basis points and 40 basis points, respective \u2013 relative to the first quarter. When compared to the second quarter a year ago, they grew 50 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. This leasing momentum was driven by several large leases, forward systems at Pentagon Row, where we converted 30,000-plus square feet of second floor retail space to Class A office, demonstrating both our mixed-use expertise, as well as our benefits of \u2013 as well as the benefits of having well-located high-quality real estate, which can be utilized for multiple uses. We also signed Bob\u2019s Furniture, who\u2019s taking our only Toys box at Escondido at double the previous rent as well as the L.A. Fitness Box at Brick. Occupancy was driven higher as Dick\u2019s opened at Willow Lawn and Richmond. Target took possession at Sam\u2019s in D.C. 49er Fit at West Gate in San Jose, will have opened Ferguson\u2019s at Crossroads in Greater Chicago and HomeGoods as part of the Brick redevelopment highlighted earlier. These positive operating metrics put us in a position to revise our FFO guidance upward, shifting the range up to $6.13 to $6.23 per share, up from $6.08 to $6.24. That represents a $0.02 increase and the midpoint from $6.16 to $6.18. I\u2019ll caution folks not to get too aggressive in their own revisions higher. And please note that some of these gains are relative to our forecast were timing related, particularly on the expense side where we forecast some of those gains to come back in the second-half of the year. With respect to our comparable POI metric, we are also revising our outlook higher to about 3% from a previous range of 2% to 3%, driven by another strong quarter of 3.6% to go along with 3.8% in Q1. At this point, I would like to address the new lease accounting standard, which will go into effect on January 1, 2019. While we are still going through a full evaluation of the standard, there was one area that we wanted to highlight. The new standard requires certain leasing costs, which were previously capitalized to be expensed in earnings as incurred. This reclassification does not affect cash flow, cash available for distribution, nor AFFO. And as a result, there is no real economic impact. However, it will change FFO. We forecast the impact to be roughly $0.07 to $0.10 or in the 1% to 1.5% range. The change to our 2017 and 2018 FFO pro forma for the new standard would have been similar. So there\u2019s effectively no change to our FFO growth rate on an apples-to-apples basis. With respect to consensus 2019, my sense is that very few of the analysts have this impact incorporated into their numbers. Now on to the balance sheet, which continues to be extremely well-positioned from a capital perspective. We continue to make progress closing on all 107 market rate units at Assembly Row and 52 of the 99 units at Pike & Rose at quarter-end, raising over $120 million of proceeds year-to-date. As a result, our credit metrics continue to improve with our net debt to EBITDA ratio improving to 5.5 times for the second quarter, down from 5.9 times at year-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio improving to 4.2 times, up from 3.9 times at year-end. We expect these credit metrics to continue to trend positively through the balance of 2018, as we raise additional capital cost effectively through opportunistic asset sales, where we have targeted roughly $70 million for the balance of the year. Now before moving to Q&A, this call signifies my second year anniversary at Federal Realty. As part of that milestone, I would like to bring back a common theme of my first few earnings calls, where I highlighted some of my initial observations since joining Federal. For this call, I\u2019d just like to highlight the fact that, again, Federal has increased its dividend. That\u2019s 51 years of increasing the dividend on an annual basis. A record in the REIT sector, where no other REIT comes close to demonstrating this level of stability, growth and execution through cycles and over the long-term. That growth still stands at a 7% compounded rate over this 51-year run. That\u2019s a truly impressive record and one that all members of the Federal family can be proud of. And with that operator, you can open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. Don, just a question, I guess, to use a baseball analogy. You\u2019re a big fan of sort of farm raising talent and developing people. With these departures, do you think that you\u2019ll do sort of a direct replacement, or do you think that the departures and the people that you\u2019re thinking about mean that you may look at the organization a little bit differently as far as what the structure may be? Donald Wood : Yes. Good morning, Alex, and thanks for asking. Let me put some perspective on this whole thing. First of all, often got two great guys here. And he paid up handsomely to do so, which makes me really happy for my guys and it certainly shows as that, I guess, mixed-use is the magic elixir these days in terms of ways to move forward. But let\u2019s step back for a minute to your question, right? Our company\u2019s goal is not to imprison the team for a lifetime, so that nothing changes and keep them inside the place. It\u2019s rather, as you say, to create a team atmosphere, great team atmosphere, grow careers, learn from mistakes and build the deep bench of talent, who will get their own opportunities as time passes and changes are warranted. Both Chris and Don love Federal, and we love them. And it shows in even the ways this was done. Both of them are committed to be here through the end of the year. Now, I don\u2019t think it will take that long for the transition. But the fact that Chris is working down in Florida with Don also to an extent there. It just shows kind of the way they want to go about making that change in the straightforward and honesty, I love that. I want that from anybody that works here and I want them to all feel that way. I mean, if you think about it, if somebody said to you 20 years ago, I\u2019ll give you 20 years. We\u2019re going to train and build and hire underlings, get better at what we do. Then at the end of 20 years, you get $10 million and twice the pay, I\u2019d say, great, I\u2019ll sign up for that all day long. So it certainly shows the value of mixed-use and they\u2019re going to do wonders for that platform over the next 20 years as it takes a while. But with that happening, we can get down to, okay, now what will we do, how will we do it And the bottom line is, there will not be a plug-in, plug-out replacement for either of those guys. This \u2013 what we\u2019ve been doing specifically over the last five, with \u2013 you saw last year, we promoted the Vice President, Patrick McMahon up in Boston. We hired couple of years ago Ramsey Meiser as a Senior Vice President out of Forest City. You think about a guy like John Tschiderer, who has grown up in this organization and created the type of value and not only the core, but in redevelopment and mixed-use, all the way through and their teams under them, we\u2019re ready for this. But what it allows us to do is have a clean sheet of paper, great opportunities for others, but we have the time to figure out basically how to look towards the next way to approach these projects. Don is a visionary man and he\u2019 a damn good in terms of mixed-use. But at this point, we\u2019re not looking for the next giant piece of land to create the next big mixed-use project. We\u2019ve got a ton to do, executing the specific places that we have already built. So when you look at Pike & Rose, the next phases, Assembly, the next phases, certainly on the West Coast with Jeff and his team, the next phases, that\u2019s kind of where we are. So as you think about it, I look today, they\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not saying, we won\u2019t add to the team. We probably will add to the team as it goes through. But mostly this will be a re-jiggering of people inside and giving some opportunities to folks that had been dying for it. When you have a senior team, that\u2019s been here 20 years, one of the downsides of that is you have other people saying, what about me and where do I get \u2013 how do I get my opportunity So this is net-net, believe me, I\u2019ll miss these guys, but this isn\u2019t a bad thing for Federal over the long-term. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is just going out to California and prime start \u2013 Primestor, sorry. the Watts development, I mean, it\u2019s good piece of dirt, but maybe you can just walk through the economics, I think it\u2019s a groundless But if you could just walk through the economics and how you\u2019re thinking about it? And then the other thing is, it certainly a productive portfolio. But is your sense for, when you go speak to retailers that they\u2019re willing to commit to the rents that really are commensurate with the productivity, or there is still a bit of skepticism by retailers about going \u2013 about building in Watts and going there versus if it was a center on the west side? Jeff Berkes : Yes. Let me answer that question for you in a minute, Alex. I want to go back to your question to Don and just pile on a little bit. So one thing, I think everybody needs to keep in mind about Federal, obviously, you all know we have a great portfolio of real estate. But really what we\u2019ve done over our 50-plus-year history, if you will, is kind of lead the charge in how you take care of that real estate and how you redevelop that real estate, right? So, Federal was one of the first company as to really think about running a neighborhood or a community shopping center better than it had ever been run before with great signage and a great tenant mix and great landscaping. And 20, 30 years ago, we got into the street retail business before anybody else did. And then we got into the mixed-use business and with the development of Bethesda Row over 20 years ago. Lately, we built some great mixed-use neighborhoods like Santana Row, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, we did the Primestor joint venture. We are always forward looking here. We are thought leaders in our business. And I\u2019m really going to miss Don and Chris too, not only where they\u2019re great work colleagues, but they are good friends of mine. But I want everybody to be confident that we built the team here and we will continue to grow and staff the team to be thought leaders and do what\u2019s best next for our real estate. So, probably didn\u2019t need all that detail, but I just wanted to let you know how I was thinking about this as well. As it relates to Jordan Downs and your question, we\u2019re really excited about Jordan Downs. Like Don said, Primestor has been working on this for a number of years, have been working very closely with the community and the Los Angeles Housing Authority. The property sits about two miles south of La Alameda and about three miles west of Azalea, two of our other assets of the Primestor joint venture. What\u2019s happening is Century Boulevard, which if you\u2019ve been to LAX, you\u2019ve been on Century Boulevard. It starts at LAX and it goes east and it stops when you get to Jordan Downs. And as part of its development, Century Boulevard is being extended through Jordan Downs to Alameda and making a great new intersection which is right where Jordan Downs Plaza is located. There is 700 not so great looking affordable housing units that are being taken down, and the unit count within Jordan Downs over time will be doubled to 1,400 housing units. So the whole area is undergoing a transformation. There are more people within three miles of Jordan Downs Plaza than any of our other Primestor centers, nearly 500,000 people within three miles. So the density is just incredible. And when you think about tenant demand and economics, because Primestor did in these communities for long time, first with La Alameda and then with Azalea, because they know how the tenants do, because they know what the community wants and needs. They put together a great tenant mix for Jordan Downs. Like Don said, we were \u2013 we had a grocery store lease signed before we close, and were committed on just more of, if I think of 80% of the NOI in the project with other tenants and there is a strong, strong tenant demand. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s \u2013 is there a discount for the website? Yes, there is a discount in the website for a variety of reasons but are the rents strong and will the economics be strong based on the cost to build the project absolutely, we are real excited about it. Alexander Goldfarb : But Jeff, can you just give us a sense of the net yields after the ground lease payment what you guys expect Jeff Berkes : Well, it\u2019s in the 8-K, right So the projected return on a costs is 7. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Jeff Berkes : If we have a shot at during better than that, we\u2019ll see, it\u2019s a development project. So we\u2019ll know better in a year or so. Alexander Goldfarb : Great. Thank you. Jeff Berkes : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Good morning, everyone. So, Don, you guys have some great pockets of vacancy in some of your best centers like Bethesda Row, Village at Shirlington, San Antonio Center and Hollywood Boulevard. Any near-term updates on those projects or those vacancies? Donald Wood : Sure. Yes \u2013 and I think this probably goes back a couple of years, keeping in terms of our real heavy looking at how these things need to be improved upon from a merchandising perspective in particular, as well as physically for the next 10 years. So in Bethesda, you absolutely see vacancy. You see the vacancy that is a turnover from kind of the old tenancy to what we\u2019ve done, virtually all leased up other than a couple of spaces on Bethesda Lane, but not yet occupied, not \u2013 in some cases, not yet lease has been signed, but all the way there in terms of the new thought process, the negotiations with tenant, et cetera, other than Hollywood Boulevard, for example. So Bethesda, there\u2019s Hollywood, God, Hollywood, we are close on two other deals, there again improving merchandising in that network \u2013 in that area. Jeff Berkes : And that will result in a redevelopment of the property. Donald Wood : Yes. And what were the other specific ones, Ki Bin? Ki Bin Kim : I think Village at Shirlington, San Antonio Center, just to name a couple? Donald Wood : Yes. All right. Shirlington is a great example. Shirlington has been a terrific kind of local restaurant street, if you will, for the last 10 or 15 years and particularly that we did. Today, we want that to be \u2013 to reach further, to be more. And so we are looking at redevelopment opportunities. As a result, we are shortening some leases in the building that would be impacted by that, which causes more vacancy today. But as you sit back, if I took you, we walked through Shirlington, as an example, and told you the plan not well enough to have it lay down in every dollar that you get at this point. You\u2019d say, I get it. The thing\u2019s going to worth a lot more than it is today. Ki Bin Kim : And just touching on that, your shadow pipeline of new development or redevelopment projects that look \u2013 that are probably a little bit bigger at scope. What is the main trigger point for those projects to be greenlit? Is it the fact that maybe market rents have to rise a little bit more to justify economics, or is it just timing of getting space back, or it is more simply a fact that you have a lot on your plate? Donald Wood : It\u2019s a combination of that. We always have and this has kind of been one of the hardest things for me to decide over the years was, how big do you want to scale the company, how big do you want to development group. Could you get to more, is that better, how much should development be as a percentage of the whole company I think we got it about right. And so there is a component of capacity on our side, which I do think works in the balance. But it\u2019s much more complicated than that. It does get to what \u2013 primarily what are the lease terms of some of the major tenants in there. That\u2019s a perfect example in Darien, for example in Connecticut. And a number of these, so we work through continually ways to get back space, economically does it make sense, would it be better to wait. We also have high construction cost today. And if I were to say, what\u2019s the one thing that is making it tougher to pull the trigger on deals, it is the development costs relative to the ability to underwrite the rents necessary to get there. Develop \u2013 there was no question that construction costs have risen in a lot of markets that were in over the past five or six years faster than the rents have, which squeezes it. But it doesn\u2019t change the long-term viability of these assets being intensified and more valuable. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. Thanks, Don. Donald Wood : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Dan, just wanted to follow-up on the same-store NOI growth forecast. At 3%, so that implies a \u2013 obviously a deceleration into the second-half. Can you just maybe talk about the moving parts of that? And you mentioned that expenses were expected to come back or some timing issues there. How does that play into it, as well as maybe the lease term fees and some of the normalizing of the re-tenanting drag? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. With respect to comparable growth, I would just say that, third quarter probably is forecasted to be down \u2013 to be the weakest quarter of the year primarily given a pretty tough comps, as well as the fact that the \u2013 our proactive releasing activity will have its greatest impact in the \u2013 in that quarter. And we\u2019ll also start feeling the drag from things like the Toys Box in Escondido, which we\u2019ve already released, but which will have some downtime and vacancy before Bob\u2019s takes possession. The fourth quarter probably will bounce back. So that gives you a little bit of \u2013 to around kind of the 3% range. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of where we expect things for the last two quarters. With regards to some of the expense get back, some of it\u2019s G&A related. But for the most part, we don\u2019t expect much movement with regards to term fees. Term fees probably will not influence or impact in our forecast the next two quarters. Christy McElroy : And then Don, you made a comment about the next phases of Pike & Rose. You recently sent a letter to Montgomery County about the White Flint sector. How do your current views about what\u2019s happening there impact the potential for additional dollars that Federal would commit to projects in the area? Donald Wood : Yes. Listen, it\u2019s a good question. I mean, what \u2013 that letter got leaked, which didn\u2019t get leaked from us, but we were. I have no problem with it being out in the public. What you\u2019re seeing is a little bit of the sausage making of development. And that\u2019s what \u2013 what effectively that is and there is no question that we continually fight to make sure that we are getting the \u2013 an economic deal that make sense. We need in projects like that partners with state level officials as the letter kind of stands on itself. There is absolutely stuff. I think you and I talked about that in the past. That should have been done already there. That has not been done to this point by in terms of County obligations. And so we\u2019re fighting through that. So in terms of, does it stop the capital allocation or not, we\u2019re going to have to see. But we\u2019re going to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to negotiate that here on this call certainly. But that\u2019s part of the sausage making of figuring out how to create acceptable returns, it\u2019s nothing more than that. Christy McElroy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I\u2019m going to Brick Plaza. The 13% vacancy at Brick Plaza, does that include Bon-Ton? Donald Wood : No, it does not, Craig, we\u2019ll get the Bon-Ton back. If you \u2013 if I took you there, you would see a property that, it\u2019s big, right, it\u2019s 400,000-plus feet. So there are sections of Brick Plaza. The first section is complete with respect to its re-tenanting, with most of the tenants that I enumerated in the prepared remarks in terms of it physicality, et cetera. The second part of it is not yet complete. We\u2019re working that through. The third part will be Bon-Ton. So there\u2019s still work to do in terms of what we are getting there. The hard part was to get that first group of new merchandising, if you will, in place, and you can imagine what that\u2019s now doing to the acceleration of tenant demand for the balance. Craig Schmidt : Yes. It looks like a casebook example of good dirt. You almost had a near complete recycling of the anchor tenants there. Donald Wood : Well, you know what flaw \u2013 and this is \u2013 to me what this is a flaw. We believe we have the best piece of dirt in that market. And I think if I took you there, you would agree with me. And yet, if you look at a few years ago, the merchandising in that shopping center versus the other products, six in one half dozen of the other, it didn\u2019t matter which one a tenant would go to. And that\u2019s an anathema to having the good dirt. You can\u2019t have that. If you\u2019ve got the best dirt, you need to be able to get there. So this effort to redevelop can\u2019t happen without the best piece of dirt, because you\u2019re going too uphill against the other. So it is textbook. And I think we\u2019ll be talking about it for years. You\u2019ll get sick of hearing about Brick. Craig Schmidt : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Your line is now open. Samir Khanal : Hi, Don, good morning. Can you generally talk about your conversations with some of your top tenants in light of sort of the slight moderation and spreads in regards to negotiating rents? I know Ascena, I think the increased their sort of fleet optimization scope recently to like it\u2019s 800 stores versus a former 600. So where do you stand on negotiations with sort of your top tenants in general and maybe Ascena, in particular? Donald Wood : I sure can. And as you asked the question, I guess I thought of one in particular and that\u2019s Bed-Bath. As you would imagine, the negotiations of options coming up and what was going to happen, we knew it was going to be a negotiation. And so \u2013 with that tenant. And yet of the five locations that had renewal options coming up and immediately without negotiations, four of them were renewed. That speaks to it, that\u2019s a testament to the real estate, right, then and there with respect to that. We had option rates \u2013 rents. And the fifth one is a property that we are looking at redeveloping early on. And so those conversations are the same type of conversations that have always happened and I believe will always happen. You are trying to create a place where that particular \u2013 whatever particular tenant is there can make money. And they can see a way to make money, you\u2019re going to have a pretty good negotiation. If they can\u2019t and you don\u2019t have choices, you\u2019re not. Now Ascena is one that is kind of such in the middle of figuring themselves out and working through their issues that we\u2019ve approached them and continue to approach them on a one by one locational negotiation, if you will. And so far, there have been a couple that we\u2019re going to lose, that\u2019s okay. There are others that updated just at option rents or renegotiated rents. And everything in between, that continues Samir. I don\u2019t expect that to change throughout the balance of 2018 in terms of that process. Samir Khanal : Okay. I mean \u2013 I know the retailers always ask for the lower rent if possible, but have you seen sort of that with volume or the level of ask sort of come down maybe in the last six months? Donald Wood : Not, not broadly. I can tell you that I certainly believe retailers in general are doing better. I believe that the tax cuts that happened earlier in this year are having a good impact on consumer spending, I believe that. Accordingly, I believe that executives in charge of retailers are more optimistic. And hence the negotiations are more likely to exercise an option or at terms that the landlord needs. And that\u2019s \u2013 but \u2013 so from the standpoint of hopefulness, if you will, in that community, I do think that the last six or nine months of increased consumer spending and sales in a lot of cases has really helped that negotiation process. Samir Khanal : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Donnelly : Hi, good morning, guys. Yes, Don, if I could just maybe go back to the departures of the other Don and Chris. Look, I will say, it\u2019s good to have maybe one less Don there, it makes it a little less confusing. Donald Wood : That was the motive. Jeffrey Donnelly : Yes, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m just curious, how does their departure affects, maybe relationships with retailers or even municipal and joint venture partners or whom might have seen them as sort of the special sauce of Federal like they keep one in contact? Donald Wood : Yes. Well, you remember, Chris went from leasing to the mixed-use side a few years back. And with that came the ascension of other people, more people in our organization doing anchor work led by Wendy Seher, who worked under Chris, now she has been here 15 years. At this point in time, absolutely no diminution at all from the retailer side would we expect, absolutely not. And with respect to the development side, in terms of municipality and relationships that in particular sure. So Briggs\u2019 relationship at Sunset in Florida could absolutely impact the way we move forward on Sunset. I\u2019m going to send somebody down there. We\u2019re going to do a complete relook without any of the biases as to what we should do there. That\u2019s a pretty good example of that. In terms of the others, Somerville, for example, close to your heart, we\u2019ve got deep relationships in Somerville beyond, Don. Not that Don isn\u2019t the primary spoke person, he is. But so do I so do others in the company along the way. And by the way, it\u2019s \u2013 the master plan is done. It is now execution of existing things a long way. So just don\u2019t think about us, including me as anyone person at this company is \u2013 changes what Federal Realty does and how we\u2019re able to take the real estate we have, which is really good stuff and execute value-enhancement on it. Jeffrey Donnelly : You were speaking earlier about, or maybe it was Jeff, actually was speaking earlier about how Federal was sort of leading the charge in the different areas of retailer over the years. Do you look at projects like Jordan Downs as maybe that next evolution, I mean, going into sort of inner city retail that something that many times over the last decade or two actually been talked about as an underpenetrated market, but you have really seen many people try to crack it on a bigger scale basis. Do you think that is something that you guys are looking at I know progress has a little challenging, because it\u2019s more of a public/private partnership with? Jeff Berkes : It\u2019s one arrow in a quiver. And I think if you sit back and you think about \u2013 look, this business, the most \u2013 the greatest thing about this business was, if you were going back at 2003 or 2004, there were in the new age, if you will, when REITs were only 10 years old generally. You would have undermanaged shopping center in a great location, where it was under private ownership and underinvested in, and you\u2019d be able to take it over, put a little lipstick on it, clean it up and increase rent points 20% and 30%, while by the way, cap rates fell from 8% to 6% or whatever it was. That\u2019s a great business. That\u2019s a tough business today. The ability to create value through development clearly is a better business than trying to find those needles in the haystack alone, because I don\u2019t believe there are a lot of them. When you sit back and go forward, and think, okay, what\u2019s next, you are talking about scale of mixed-use. How we should do mixed-use well, how we should look into new markets like Primestor with a demographic, that\u2019s clearly underserved. There\u2019s also a couple of other things that we\u2019re looking at. Should probably think about technology and how that\u2019s used in terms of data for retailers and for landlords. So maybe the analogies, it\u2019s another arrow in the quiver. But there are two or three or four of them that we\u2019re all looking through right now. Jeffrey Donnelly : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys, sorry, if I missed this. I just wanted to go back to the lease spreads here. I know it can be a volatile stag, given the size of the portfolio and the spreads were good, but below your typical levels in the mid to high-teens. So I get you\u2019re a bit of a victim of your own success on this. But can you talk about the spreads a little bit for the quarter? Any deals in particular that impacted things that are worth highlighting And then I guess, as we look out, spreads balanced to the mid-teens for the first-half year. So fair to assume sort of return to that level in the back-half? Dan Guglielmone : Well, let me talk about this first-half. I guess, we shouldn\u2019t have reported 22 in the first quarter and 10 in the second, should have just done 15 15. But it doesn\u2019t work like that, right? It is what it is. The \u2013 this company does about 400 deals a year. So 100 deals a quarter or something like that. And that means there are always a few deals that are going to create volatility associated with that. One is a deal that hurt that today is a really important deal out of Plaza El Secundo. And that\u2019s the Nordstrom Rack deal that replace a Cost Plus tenant and that was a roll down. That\u2019s okay. It does a whole lot more for that shopping center, than any other tenant frankly, that we could have done in that space. But we had heartburn over doing the deal, but we did it. And so there\u2019s always \u2013 there were a couple of deals like that. That one was the largest that I talked about in the quarter. And overall, there is no doubt in my mind that market rents exceed the rents in place in this portfolio. And significantly, and I think that slide that we show is my favorite part about that in the road show in place versus what deals are being done at. That we expect to continue. I just can\u2019t tell you 90 days at a time, which \u2013 how that\u2019s going to continue journey. So that\u2019s probably the best I have. Jeremy Metz : No, I appreciate the color. It\u2019s helpful. And second one from me, just going back to Primestor, you obviously kicked off another deal. But maybe stepping back, this is a bit of a pioneering adventure for Federal in terms of the communities it was targeting in the west. So can you just talk about what unique insights you\u2019re maybe gaining there? And then how that could possibly translate across either other parts of the portfolio or even opportunities in other similar markets? Jeff Berkes : Yes. Jeremy, this is Jeff Berkes, and that\u2019s a great question. Although I don\u2019t really have a great answer for you, I think it\u2019s a little early. I mean, we\u2019re closing in here on our first year of kind of running the portfolio we bought with Primestor. And obviously, looking at a bunch of new opportunities. We\u2019ve got one done in the form of Jordan Downs. What we\u2019ve thought going into the venture is proving out to be true and that is \u2013 there is significant unmet demand. And that unmet demand kind of comes in two forms. One the people are going \u2013 they live in a community that need a great place to go shop and spend time with their families, go out to dinner, that kind of thing. The other unmet demand is there\u2019s a bunch of tenants that are not in the market yet, that should be, right, which creates competition for space and which creates upward pressure on rents. So we thought that going in and that\u2019s absolutely proving out to be true. Where we can take that beyond Southern California, which is really Primestor\u2019s expertise, PBD, something we are always thinking about, talking to my counterparts on the East Coast about similar type things, but no definitive next steps as it relates to that at this point, little bit too early. Donald Wood : But what I will say, let me just add to that, Jeremy. The important thing about the concept, I do think this pioneering, if you would call it that, is not really pioneering at all. I really do think, it\u2019s \u2013 I know why you\u2019re saying that and it\u2019s from that perspective. But when you look at demand versus supply, I mean, the one thing \u2013 the one worry I have about this is that, I think we\u2019re doing a lot to bring this idea into the forefront, which brings down cap rates of these type of properties, because you can see the \u2013 that demand obviously exceed supply. And so, I think it\u2019s harder for companies to get into this. I think, you\u2019ll see more companies trying to do this. I know there are a couple of private guys that are talking to us about trying to do more and having us invest with them. And I don\u2019t know how I feel about that for purposes of this call. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to feel that this is pioneering two years from now and that\u2019s just an opinion. Jeremy Metz : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open. Vince Tibone : Good morning. Now that your cost of capital has rebounded some from earlier in the year. How are you thinking about acquisition opportunities today? And can you also just touch any trends in cap rates you\u2019re seeing in your markets? Dan Guglielmone : Do you want to take it? Donald Wood : Yes, sure. I mean start with any size, I\u2019ll finish up. Dan Guglielmone : We\u2019re \u2013 let think of a good way to start this off. We, of course, cost of capital bounces around, right, and it\u2019s bounced around for years. And our view when we\u2019re investing capital is not so much to look at the spot price of our cost of capital, but to look at the longer-term weighted average cost of capital and make our decisions, investment decisions that way. So bump up or down in the stock price or in the interest rate or a bump up or down in the cap rate really doesn\u2019t have a material impact on our view of how we should invest our money, because again, we are in the game for the long-term and when we\u2019re making investments, we think about the long term, right? We are always in the market, looking to buy. But we\u2019re only in the market looking to buy great locations that we\u2019re pretty comfortable, we can add value to \u2013 over time. Those deals, as Don mentioned earlier, are difficult to find and this market they continue to be difficult to find it. But we\u2019re out there looking and we always have a number of things that we\u2019re working on. And from time to time, we\u2019ll get those done and as we do with Jordan Downs, right? Donald Wood : I would \u2013 the only thing I would say to that is that, those opportunities are more likely to have redevelopment components to them as the way to create value than just blowing up rents on existing shopping center. Dan Guglielmone : Yes, absolutely. The days of buy an old center and giving it a little lipstick and rouge and rolling rents up, I\u2019d love to find those, but they are not around like they were 10, 15 years ago, right? In terms of cap rates, where cap rates are going, really, really tough to say right now. I think on prior calls and you probably hear this from other management teams as well that the really good stuff is still trading at really aggressive cap rates. I think maybe what\u2019s changed over the last six, nine, 12 months, is if that bull\u2019s-eye was a size of a quarter year ago, maybe that bull\u2019s-eye is the size of a nickel now, right? Fewer deals are viewed as \u2013 fewer properties are viewed as really, really good properties. And when you start to move out on the Target away from the bull\u2019s-eye, than it\u2019s kind of anybody guess as to where the cap rates might be in the secondary and tertiary markets. It\u2019s just very difficult market right now, a few buyers showing up to bid. Vince Tibone : No, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful color. Just one more from me and maybe switching gears a bit. Looks like shop occupancy was down about 50 basis points on year-over-year basis. Within that segment, can you just discuss kind of where you\u2019re experiencing the move-outs, whether merchandise categories, specific retailers, just curious if get a little bit more color on kind of why that ticked down some? Jeff Berkes : Yes, that\u2019s not me. Someone else is going to have to take that question. Who wants it, or we\u2019ll look at it and get back to you. What do you think? Donald Wood : I think let us kind of focus on that. It wasn\u2019t something that popped out to us. We can follow back up with you Vince on that one. Vince Tibone : Okay, no problem. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hoglund with Jefferies. Your line is now open. George Hoglund : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you can just give any kind of update on your view of the grocery exposure. And how you think grocery environment may change over time and then your exposure to grocery there? And also how it relates to kind of ethnic grocers and what kind of performance difference you\u2019re seeing there versus kind of traditional grocers? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. I\u2019m not sure with respect to the latter first just have to get that out of the way. I\u2019m not sure I have a macro comment in terms of that difference George. I will tell you, but this is such a local base business. And so what we\u2019ve really tried to do hard over the last year, year-and-a-half, in particular, is meet with grocery management teams, try to understand where they are going. I mean the real interesting one is Harris Teeter, which we have along with Kroger, so now the same company at Barracks Road, they had two grocers in the same shopping center in a market that does have competition in terms of that. I can tell you, they like others are trying lots of different things to figure out their next steps. They\u2019re also doing a pretty darn good job \u2013 a far better job than ever before on prepared foods, on those things that bring somebody into the shopping center or to the grocery store. Are we at the point where we can say the middle to \u2013 all the middle of the aisles of the grocery store macro-wise are going to go away and all you\u2019re going to need is 15,000 square foot grocers with prepared foods and flowers and other things that are experiential? No, we\u2019re not at that stage. In fact, what we see is a lot of grocers in the markets that we\u2019re doing business in doing very well. Are they \u2013 are sales going up, the way they did a decade ago? Absolutely not, and there is clearly pressures. They are clearly trying to figure that out. But their cost ratios and their ability to be four walls profitable or in fact, effectively increase that profitability, looks very promising. So, it\u2019s so hard for me and maybe it\u2019s just because our company is not that big. But to make macro statements with respect to grocers in the U.S., I can make micro statements with respect to the markets that we\u2019re in and rightsizing and sometimes that\u2019s big and sometimes that\u2019s smaller in each location that we are in, is something that \u2013 every grocer we talk to is actively interested in the conversations and that\u2019s says to me, yes, they are absolutely looking for ways to improve profitability in a more aggressive way than they have before. But beyond that, I don\u2019t have much to say in terms of the Primestor portfolio and the food that we have there. Those are strong performing grocers as they are in our markets. And in terms of where they go, I just \u2013 I don\u2019t have anything unless you do Jeff to add to that. Jeff Berkes : I don\u2019t think we have a deep enough pool to really answer that question broadly. George Hoglund : All right. Thanks for the color. Jeff Berkes : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. Donald Wood : Good morning. Haendel St. Juste: So the Brookstone bankruptcy filing this morning reminds us that while the retail backdrop is improving there\u2019s still some challenges out there. So can you talk a bit about your tenant watch list and on tenant credit underwriting today? How are you thinking about tenant credit quality? Have you made changes in your underwriting of new tenants this late in the cycle? Are you raising standards, requiring more deposits? And then on Funk specifically, they become one of your bigger tenants and they become bigger as they grow. So I\u2019m curious how are you thinking about exposure to a tenant like that and what it means to your credit risk profile? Donald Wood : Yes, in terms of the second one, by the way, I really don\u2019t want to comment on that. I didn\u2019t tell you who the tenant was in the building that we were at 700 Santana Row, so I don\u2019t want to comment on that any further at this point. I hope you understand that. And then with respect to overall tenant credit and underwriting, look, man, we \u2013 not \u2013 no different, no different in terms of what this company has consistently done and every investment we make in a space. If we\u2019ve got to put money into a space and all deals we need to that for, I get, we are absolutely running through a vigorous credit process to underwrite whether we are probable or more likely than not to get through that lease and if not what protections that we have. We negotiate termination rights extremely aggressively. We negotiate go dark, right, extremely aggressively. We have a pretty good track record of \u2013 to controlling the space and controlling the shopping center to the extent we can and obviously relative to other deals that are out there, that is a really important thing. In terms of the \u2013 if there\u2019s not money going into the space, we\u2019re a loser on the ability to try something out with the tenant \u2013 with different types of tenants along the way there. But none of that has changed. You\u2019re still taking your most aggressive shot at control and obviously rent. So no, man, I don\u2019t see a big difference and obviously then that, I don\u2019t have to say it, but I\u2019m going to say it for the record, we have no Brookstone\u2019s. Haendel St. Juste: Okay, thanks for that. And then one more follow-up on the departures of Chris and Don. Look, I don\u2019t know if I missed this, but is there going to be any G&A impact in either 4Q or early 2019? And then more broadly curious on any implications there to your readout spend going forward? You talked about the not starting any big projects right now, cost exceeding rents. So I\u2019m curious if we should be thinking about a deceleration in spend on re-dev in the coming years or perhaps am I reading too much into that? Thanks. Donald Wood : You are. You shouldn\u2019t be. I mean, there was another question about the next phase of Pike & Rose. I mean with Pike & Rose, we\u2019d like to get going with that whether we can or not, that\u2019s got nothing to do with the departures, that\u2019s got everything to do with our underwriting. Assembly Row, we are getting close on the next thing to talk about at Assembly Row. That will not be changed one way or the other. With respect to the West Coast, we are making real progress on Santana West, whether that gets announced shortly or not, certainly isn\u2019t impacted by the departures. So no, you should not see \u2013 you should not see a reduction in that. And by the way, if we did buy the next big piece of land for a mixed-use property, you would see no benefit of that for five to seven to nine years, right, just to put that stuff in context. Remember, we got Assembly, we acquired it in 2005. We acquired Pike & Rose. We got control of Pike & Rose in 2009. Stuff takes time, no question about it. So please don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be a diminution in development activity or redevelopment activity because of the departures. If there is, it\u2019s because of economics. And we are not going to \u2013 we\u2019re not going to put money to work in a dilutive way. So that is to be seen. But so far nothing that I would say would cause that diminution. Dan Guglielmone : And with regards to the G&A question, the first part of your question, there may be a modest pickup, but it won\u2019t be material and wouldn\u2019t change kind of how we are thinking about G&A or G&A forecast for the balance of the year in a material way. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you. Much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Donald Wood : Mike, you there? Operator : If your line is on mute, can you please unmute. Operator : It looks like he\u2019s not on the line anymore. So I\u2019ll go ahead and turn the call back over to Leah to \u2013 for closing remarks. Leah Andress Brady : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Hope you all enjoy the rest of the summer and we look forward to seeing you this fall. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Leah Brady. Please go ahead ma\u2019am. Leah Brady : Good morning, I would like to thank everyone for joining us today for Federal Realty\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Dawn Becker and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that certain matters on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty\u2019s future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These documents are available on our website. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everybody. At a $1.58 a share in the third quarter, we generated more funds from operations in a 90-day period than we ever have in our 56-year history. On an absolute basis, this was simply the best quarter we\u2019ve ever had. More than 5% ahead of last year\u2019s quarter, and in excess of both the streets and our internal expectations contributions came from all parts of our business and on both coasts. Overall rental income grew 5.5% quarter-over-quarter. Earnings growth at comparable properties was particularly strong at 3.5%.  The comparable portfolio remains 95% leased and 94% occupied and operating expenses including G&A, but not including real estate taxes, actually fell slightly quarter-over-quarter despite 12 million more in revenue, real estate taxes it seems never goes down. The only metric that was underwhelming for us on the surface was comparable retail lease rollover growth at 6%, 90-day comp, 90 comparable deals were 448,000 square feet and an average rent of 38.31 per foot, 6% above the 36.22 that the previous tenant was paying in the last year of the lease. Not bad, but it\u2019s not what you\u2019re used to seeing.  So let\u2019s take a deeper look and breaking down the overall results space leased to new tenants grew at 13% with the previous tenant, while renewals of existing tenants grew at only 2%. That\u2019s the combined 6% rollover. The detail supporting this 2% renewal rollover rates revealed that more than half of the renewal rent came from just two deals, both of whom renewed flat for the last year their previously lease and therefore depressed the reported percentage increase. A strong credit anchor at East Bay Bridge in Emeryville, California and the Best Buy building at Santana Row. Now many of you who are familiar with our portfolio know both of those properties well. So let me spend a minute on the transactions behind the summarized metrics to hopefully help interpret what they mean. So consider this, rent in the East Bay Bridge anchor lease has been increasing annually at 3% since its inception in 1995 through 2009 and 3.5% annually since 2009. I don\u2019t know of any big anchor deals that have those kind of embedded annual bumps in them.  Most for flat for five or 10 years and then bump 10% or so. Run the math, those are very different economics. So we decided to renew it flat to the grown prior year rent and from here it will continue to grow 3.5% annually for the option period and by the way no tenant improvement dollars from us. Given more typical anchor lease tenants, this new rent would equate to a huge bump over the old rent, and our rollover statistics would have reflected double-digit growth yet we\u2019d be far off economic, the far worse off economically. The strengthen location the lease terms from the very strong productivity of the store allowed us to get paid millions more in rent along the way, deal terms matter. Next, rent paid by the anchor at the hard corner of Steven's Creek Winchester Boulevard and Santana Row more than paid for construction of the building they occupy by the time the initial terminal lease expired in 2014 and with the exercise of their first option back then has paid to the building more than twice over. The exercise of their second five year option came in this quarter at the same rent despite significant supply coming on line at Valley Fair across the street and again no TI dollars paid by us.  The real estate economics here are incredibly compelling despite negatively impacting the rollover metric. I go through those two leases at the pick of it, because digging behind any in all of the reported metrics is increasingly important as all of our businesses get more complicated and harder to compare. But at the end of the day, it comes down to FFO per share growth. We\u2019re particularly proud of the consistency and sustainability of that earnings growth year-in and year-out, no excuses. It\u2019s widely worked as hard as we have to diversify our revenue streams and why are we using our existing real estate platforms to create a real estate value for redevelopment and intensification on both coasts. The focal point is exploitation of our superior locations and cash flow streams through the lens of a broad real estate perspective. And this isn\u2019t just about our big mix use projects, because it applies with our core shopping centers too. For example, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve added to our 8K redevelopment schedule this quarter a $23 million, 87 unit residential project at Bala Cynwyd shopping center on Cityline Avenue just outside of Philadelphia. This will be our seventh residential project developed internally by our team to intensify one of our core shopping centers. The other is being two with Congressional Plaza, Winwood Shopping Center, Chelsea Comments and London Square with more on the horizon. In terms of Bala Cynwyd, we would expect this residential project to be just the first step of what will hopefully be an ambitious redevelopment there. The great example of how we continue to find ways to extract real estate value in so much of our portfolio.  Now let me update on our largest initiatives. With the 765 unit residential neighborhood in Pike & Rose fully 95% occupied and stabilized. In the 375,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space nearly fully leased but not yet fully open and rent paying until later in 2019. We are ready to move forward with the next phase, a 212,000 square foot Class A spec office building with about 4,000 feet of retail on the ground floor along with the 600 space parking garage that will be used by both office and retail users. The 11 Story Glass Curtain Wall building addressed as 909 Rose, will sit on the hard corner of our Pike & Rose Avenue, literally Pike & Rose and is expected to begin occupancy in 2021. Our investment will approximately $130 million with an expected stabilized yield between 6 to 7. Separately, we\u2019re accessing the viability of relocating federal territories into two of the 11 stories about 40,000 square feet of the building. Doing so, would validate our believe in the advantages of these mix use neighborhood in general and certainly more specifically.  At Assembly Road, we\u2019re now 95% leased at the 447 unit Montage significantly ahead of schedule and our net effective rents of nearly $3.40 per foot. And like our residential experience here, the row hotel of which we own 50% of equity stake opened in August at Assembly and simply following the similar track. Rate and occupancy are strong right out of the gate a trend that we hope will continue to the fourth quarter and into 2019. So the market's exuberant acceptance of all things Assembly Row has is accelerating our plans for future development of additional residential and office product at two of the five remaining development parcel there. We\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll able to announce the next large phase development at Assembly in a quarter possibly two. Out west the third quarter saw software giant Splunk sign an amount to lease for the full 300,000 feet of office space at 700 Santana Row with occupancy expected about a year from now. Get a chance to be anywhere near San Jose, be sure to visit Santana Row and feel how the end of the street has been transformed with the construction just gorgeous building and energized Plaza area below us.  We expect to complete this phase of development on or slightly better than budget from a cost perspective and ahead from an income and timing perspective. The enduring strength of Silicon Valley in general and Santana Row specifically not unlike Boston in Assembly Row has us nearing a decision to potentially move forward with additional office development at Santana West, the 12 acre parcel on Winchester Boulevard across some Santana Row that we have controlled for the past several years. Pending invest to say due to its proximity to amenity rich Santana has been very high leading us to accelerate our master planning of that site, stay tuned. And in Miami demolition in CocoWalk is largely complete construction begin in earnest this quarter. You'll note a slight increase and expected cost of the project to reflect in the 8-K, the result of a bit of increased scope in a bit of cost, were not expected to impact projected yields noticeably. Both our retail and office leasing teams are finding strong interest and we expect to start reporting signed deals beginning next quarter. A few miles away at Sunset Place. We received good news in the quarter as voters approved the ballot measure amending the city charter. So there're four out of five vote of the commission rather than a unanimous one would be sufficient to relax the land use code in the district that includes Sunset Place. We\u2019re working through the entitlement process now to increase the density on the site, many obstacles remain in the way of our moving forward with a viable project there, but we'll see. And that\u2019s about it from my prepared remarks for the quarter. It\u2019s a really good one that we hope to follow with another and another. And then I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan for some additional color and then open the lines to your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our $1.58 per share of FFO for the quarter was $0.07 above our expectations and $0.03 above consensus. This outperformance was driven by higher POI through more rent and forecasts and continued expense controls at the property level. Higher term fees than we had forecast as well as lower G&A. But once again offset from the drag of early ramp up at our two new hotels with Pike & Rose and Assembly, the latter of which just opened midway through the quarter. Our comparable POI metric was 3.5%, which bested our forecasts as a result of the items I just mentioned. You probably remember from our last call, we had expected this quarter to be the weakest of the year. Our continued proactive releasing activity this year provided in drag of 110 basis points. Although this was partially offset from the benefit of our 2017 proactive releasing efforts. Our better than expected termination fees enhance the results by roughly 1%.  As a reference, our former metric same-store with re-dev came in at 3.4%. Don discussed in detail our lease roll over number for the quarter 6%. But please note that on a trailing fourth quarter basis our rollover stands at a solid 12%. In double-digits and in line with 2016 and 2017 levels. And to reemphasize, let\u2019s remember this is real estate, where true value creation should be measured over 3 to 5 to 10-year horizon and let\u2019s not get overly focused and any one quarters or even any one year's metrics. With respect to occupancy if a strong momentum in the second quarter. Our overall lease and occupied figures were 94.8 and 93.7 respectively. Essentially flat to down slightly, but consistent with previous comparable quarters. New leases of note includes industry on Third Street in St. Monica, Four Good a show at Pike & Rose in North Bethesda, new openings of note include Uniqlo with its Montgomery county flagship location at Pike & Rose, LA fitness at Del Mar and Boka and TJ Max at West Gate in St. Jose. With departures from our one Toys R Us box which is already released but not open and are one Bon Ton box weighing on the metrics. Also, when you\u2019re next in DC, please check out the new Anthropologie flagship location at the Bethesda Row that opened earlier this month, it\u2019s truly impressive.  With the stronger than expected quarter, we are again in a position to raise our FFO guidance increasing and tightening the range from 613 to 623 to a range of $6.18 to $6.24 per share that represents a $0.03 increase at the midpoint from $6.18 to $6.21, at $6.21 this implies FFO growth for 2018 just above 5%. A testament to the continued consistency that early has demonstrated over its long history even through challenging retail and economic environments. With respect to our comparable PIO metric, we are also revising our outlook higher from about 3% to the mid 3% range driven by another strong quarter of 3.5% to go along with the 3.8% and 3.6% we have in the first two quarters of the year. Now, on to some of preliminary goal posts for 2019. We are still in the midst of our 2019 budgeting process so I\u2019m going to keep this very directional in nature. We expect to grow in 2019, in line with the past of couple of years despite continued industry headwinds to develop a changing consumer and a general oversupply of retail space in the US. We will also face some company specific headwinds next year. First, our G&A will grow into 2019, more detail on that on our next call. And second, we will have drag FFO as we refinance our $275 million term loan which had been locked at 2.62% since its 2011 origination. And lastly, the negative impact from the new lease accounting standard of $0.07 to $0.10 which I mentioned on our last call, which is reflected in these preliminary 2019 numbers. Despite these headwinds, we expect to have a solid base of growth of roughly $0.15 a share which should get us into mid 630s as a lower end of the range. It is still too early in our forecast process to predict how much higher we can push the upper end of the guidance range however.  Given the diversity of our cash flow streams and the number of different avenues that we can grow through, I would expect that an appropriate target for 2019 is to achieve growth consistent with what we have realized in 2017 and 2018, which implies high 640s as an upper end of the range. As I just mentioned, this takes into consideration the negative impact from the new lease accounting standard of $0.07 to $0.10 drag of roughly 1% to 1.5% and that's an estimate that we continue to refine. And note that on an apples-to-apples basis, for 2018 FFO is adjusted for the new lease accounting standard this implies growth in access of roughly 4 to 6%. Again, this is preliminary and as we did last year, we will be providing formal guidance on our fourth quarter call in February, where we will refine these targets and provide details on submissions behind it. Now onto the balance sheet which continues to improve and is very well positioned from a capital perspective as we head into the next phases of new development in the coming years. We continue to make progress on the condos, while already completed 107 market rate units at Assembly Row at Pike and Rose we are roughly 70% complete and close and under contract basis on almost 99 units. With only roughly $20 million left to go.  During the quarter we closed on the sale of a small non-core asset and are under contract and post closing on another before year end for a total of $42 million in gross proceeds and these two sales were executed at a blended mid 5s cap rate. We also closed on a 50% joint venture interest with our JV operating partner for the new Row Hotel at Assembly, generating 38 million of proceeds to us. As a result, our credit metrics continue to improve, our net debt to EBITDA ratio moving lower to 5.4 times for the third quarter, down from 5.9 at the start of 2018, our fixed charge coverage ratio edging higher 4.3 times versus 3.9 at the start of the year.  Weighted average maturity of our debt remains above 10 years and we are on pace to generate roughly $80 million of free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital.  We expect these credit metrics continue to trend in a positive direction through the balance of 2018 and into 2019. As we raise additional capital cost effectively through opportunistic asset sales. We currency have roughly another $125 million of non-core tax efficient sale prospects in the market which we target to close over the coming quarters. With that operator, you can open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : Thank you, good morning. Dan just going back to the goal post for 2019. When you are talking about growth in line with the past several years, are you was that referring to FFO growth or is that also same-store comparable NOI growth? Dan Guglielmone : Yes, generally its FFO, was what the reference was there. We\u2019re not providing any same-store guidance at this point and probably won't until our February call. Similar to what we did last year. Nick Yulico : Okay and second question is just on the releasing spreads and Don, you know you gave a lot of info there. I guess question is, whether you have more those types of leases which those escalations, sounds pretty attractive, that\u2019s one part. And then separately you know maybe we can get a preview of how you expect the releasing spreads for working the next year I know they are been volatile, you highlighted that they would \u2013 they could come down. Any numbers you could share there? Don Wood : Let me frame it Nick this way. First of all, those two leases, I think normally I wouldn\u2019t break out a couple leases and give you that those kind of specifics on it but that is just so economically compelling that I felt the need to do that. Now, are there a lot of big anchor boxes that has those kind of boxes, no, those kind of bumps, I don\u2019t know if any other, to tell you the truth, I mean they are, that\u2019s really unusual, but the only reason that happens is because of productivity of the store and the strength in the market, the strength in the location \u2013 so, what I am \u2013 the reason I do stuff like that \u2013 or talk about stuff like that is you probably get sick of me saying those contracts were business of contracts and those contracts are just critical in terms of what they say to determine the value of the real estate that's underlying it. And when you have deals like that, I\u2019m sure there are other people on this call saying wow, because they don\u2019t have deals like that of that kind of significance.  Now generally, so every quarter there is something that as you know I like to highlight or talk about that kind of builds the case for the value of the real estate. There\u2019s no doubt that overall pushing rents, pushing rents is an issue industry-wide because supply exceeds demand in terms of retail rents it\u2019s key reason that we look hard at office and at residential as a big part of our business plan. Once you create the overall environment on the ground floor, it\u2019s awfully nice to be able to capture real estate value by being able to do the right merchandising downstairs, you\u2019re going to get paid for it upstairs in the form of higher residential or higher office rents up there and how much we believe in that. Alternatively or in addition to that it really does come down to the leverage of each of the individual shopping centers that we have and we own good ones. So do I expect there, the next year or two to be years of 20% and 22% and 24% rent low little bumps? No, I don\u2019t. Do I expect us still to be able to do double-digit rent bumps, yes. I don\u2019t see why not, that doesn\u2019t mean any particular 90 days but certainly when we look at our loss to lease overall on this portfolio and I love this slide that we do in our deck that shows what leases have been done at versus what the in place is, it sure shows you, compared to almost anybody else to look at that there\u2019s a whole lot of upside left there. But that doesn\u2019t mean across the board and everywhere, that gets tougher. I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Alexander Goldfarb : So two questions. First, Dan, you mentioned the 125 million of dispositions that are in the pipeline. So I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s sort of guidance for full year dispositions for \u201919 or not. But can you just sort of give a breakout? How much of that are sort of I\u2019ll call free assets like condos, things like that, that have no NOI impact versus how much of that will there be an NOI impact from? Dan Guglielmone : I mean, I think the 125 is just what we have and probably represents what\u2019s the first half of what we\u2019re targeting the first half of the year for 2019. They are kind of income producing assets, kind of we view them as not non-core that we don\u2019t have to own long-term. And we think we should be able to achieve pricing kind of in the mid-5s on those as well. So that\u2019s a color on those two. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second question is having toward Pike & Rose recently. One, the asset it definitely come down more. But two, just sort of curious you announced the second office there. Don, how do you think about the mix of residential and office as far as driving like restaurants and the other elements of the projects in general? Do you view each item on its own merit meeting which maximizes NOI for that particular land parcel, or is there a view of which what\u2019s the right mix of office residential et cetera that drives the overall NOI of the center? Just trying to figure that out? Don Wood : Yeah, it\u2019s a combination of both. I mean, look, at the end of the day when you\u2019re doing these type of projects but the real trick is the path to maturation. All of these projects, mix use projects take time take years to mature, now do they mature in two or three or do they mature in six or seven or somewhere in between or differently. One of the key ingredients to get that maturation is day time traffic which are trying to get to is a busy place as often in seven days, 24 hours a day as possible. Office is a key user for us. So, that day time traffic coupled with the incredible efficiency that comes from parking that you build for office that\u2019s necessary for office but it's also used by the retail and another uses in the evening is the incredible part of the efficiency of how mix use project works. So, everyone of these and Pike & Rose well because of the time that you\u2019ve spent there and when you look at Pike & Rose you think of what\u2019s coming on from a retail perspective and you see how we\u2019ve does on nice weekends from the residential base that\u2019s there and the retail base that\u2019s there, you can see well yeah there needs to be some day time traffic and that office is a critical component to that. And part of the reason that we continue to invest that way. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. Christy McElroy : Hi. Good morning. Dan, I just wanted to follow up on the $275 million term loan you talked about refine next year. I think that the two swaps on that expired today and now that\u2019s floating. Do you plan to keep that floating through the maturity next November? Or when do you plan to sort of refi that or when can you. And what are your plans for that? Dan Guglielmone : Yeah. It will float at LIBOR plus 90. And I think we\u2019ll look to be opportunistic in terms of refinancing that term loan. I think by extending it into 2019 it avails us to get into a little bit of sweet spot of the market and the bank market to potentially refinance it as another term loan. Or it gives us the optionality to look at it in the bond market. So, I think that we\u2019ll be opportunistic in terms of refinancing that. It will be pretty open to repayment and so we can, there won\u2019t be any access cost that we look to be opportunistic ahead of the November 2019. Christy McElroy : Okay. Don Wood : But likely '19 Christy, not '18. Christy McElroy : Right, right. So, keep it floating for year and then refi to something shift next November? Don Wood : Or before that, but what I\u2019m saying is it won\u2019t be a refi in the fourth quarter of 2018, it will be in 2019 opportunistically. Christy McElroy : Got it. Got it. Okay. And then just with regard to the term fees recognizing that this is a recurring part of your business, but they did seem a little higher in Q3 than you would originally thought. What was those related to you and that speaks that you were proactively trying to get back or do this unexpectedly come back to you? Don Wood : Little of both, this is a good conversation. And listen I absolutely know how you feel about term fees. And I appreciate you're starting out by saying that you do know the recurring part of our business, because it\u2019s, I mean this is a business of contracts and we are like, we want to use those contracts to our best advantage as a tool in a various numbers of ways including the ability that to proactively get tenants out. But also recognizing and this is a big part, there is a changing consumer, we don\u2019t want the same retailers over and over again as you look over out over the next five, seven, nine years we\u2019re probably less than others about simply trying to backfill an existing box with another tenant. Than we all are about having an opportunity to redevelop a shopping center.  So, one of the tools that we use for this stuff is a strong lease and it's just so critical to what it is that we do when you look at this quarter they were higher and it\u2019s a combination of everything that you said, we lost some tenants that didn\u2019t think we were, when we gave a forecast for termination fees but we also went hard after a couple of them to be able to make sure that we were able to redevelop and keep them in pipeline growing.  So, you see in both places, I don\u2019t expect term fees to be low, over the next year or two. I mean if you think about the business there is a changing in the business and a changing of retailers, I don\u2019t know if you have seen the list of retailers that we actively go after who are digitally based retailers who have figured out you know what, we need a bricks and mortar presence. That\u2019s a long list of other tenants, that\u2019s a list of tenancy that particularly for street retail oriented, mix used type of product that\u2019s a tenant base that we\u2019d love to be able to access. Things like parachute home and others that you haven\u2019t heard necessarily a lot about but are part of the future. So, having a contract in place that strong within existing tenant gives us the opportunity to be able to have some leverage to be able to create places for the future and that much more than any other comparison with any other company that\u2019s what drives us, in terms of what we report and what our business plan is.  I know its long winded but it really is, it's important to us to talk like that. Christy McElroy : Go ahead. Dan Guglielmone : Yes, Christy I just wanted to add, of the tenants that terminated in the third quarter over two-thirds of that income has already been replaced with execute leases of tenants who are coming in, so not only did we get those term fees, as outsize term fees, we have already been nimble enough to actually backfill over two-thirds of that space, before we even reporting in the quarter. So I think that\u2019s the testament to how proactive we are in terms of managing the process and limiting kind of cash flow downsize. Christy McElroy : Great, that is exactly what I was looking for, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Hey good morning. Going back to the 2019 guidance at least a rough goal post you laid out there. Could you walk through some of the bigger pieces that could really swing you from one end to the other end to the other end, I know you mentioned the term loan and the G&A, any other bigger pieces there and then maybe how you\u2019re thinking about bad debt in kind of all our relative to this year it sounds like from your comments, and Christy\u2019s question, that you\u2019re more or less expecting a similar level of headwind on that front? Dan Guglielmone : Yes, I think its whole host of things. As I said, this is preliminary, I think how quickly the hotels continue to ramp up at Assembly and Pike & Rose can move things around a little bit. I think kind of where are, where we see our watchlist performing, over the course of 2019. Just going back to the two items, I mean I think even now at LIBOR plus 90, we\u2019re going to have roughly a 100 basis points of drag if we keep it floating, and if based upon where kind of 6 and 12 month LIBOR is projected to be, there will be some drag over the course and that\u2019s looks to be up to roughly $0.03 to $0.04 in the ballpark. And G&A will grow, I\u2019m not going to get too far into the detail there. But G&A will be higher in 2019 and we\u2019ll provide more color on that in our February call. Don Wood : Yes. Jeremy, let me just add two things to that. First of all, welcome to BMO, it\u2019s good to have you back. And secondly it is the developments that that are the single biggest mover, I mean we\u2019re going to deliver to Splunk at some point around a year from now. A month one way or the other or two months one way or the other is important to how that works through. And secondly, I do want to add one thing to the G&A piece. With, while Mr. Enbriggs leaving, it\u2019s an awesome opportunity for the next generation here.  So we\u2019re going to doing a bunch of promotions and that\u2019s why G&A is going up, it\u2019s good stuff. It\u2019s the reason to be able to bet on that Federal Reality 2.0 if you will with respect to the next level management. So we will talk more about that in February. But it\u2019s a critical part to us setting us up for the next 10 years. Jeremy Metz : And then you talked about the ramping dispositions of it as a source of capital. Dan, you mentioned 125 million in the first half of next year. Beyond that, we look at decisions is being more opportunistic or as markets accommodate and equity is attractive you may be pulled back from selling and fine on that, I mean are you baking some equity into the plans at this point? Dan Guglielmone : I mean, as I said, it\u2019s preliminary, I think that will be opportunistic on the equity side as well. I think that it\u2019s a very limited small amount is kind of what\u2019s figured in to our 2019 calculus for providing that those goalpost will have a greater refinement on kind of what that detailed assumption is in February. Don Wood : And let me add one thing, if you don\u2019t mind. In my prepared comments, I think, I led you to a discussion of the next phases of development at Assembly, the next phases of development at Santana. You saw what we\u2019re doing at Bala with respect to the residential project. They\u2019re very strong redevelopment pipeline and core. So as that\u2019s stuff comes to fruition. This company looks at funding it including potential dispositions, but it\u2019s different in other companies and that we don\u2019t have a bunch of shopping centers that we don\u2019t want to own. So it\u2019s a smaller pool effectively to look at. No, we don\u2019t have equity in the numbers in a significant way at this preliminary point, but we might. Again very modestly or modestly as a part of the balance sheet program. But a lot of it is dependent upon whether we go forward and I expect we will on building out some of these big de-risked development projects, de-risk because the places are already there and successful. Dan Guglielmone : From a capital perspective we have multiple arrows in the quiver, in terms of, I mentioned $80 million of free cash flow in 2018. We should expect similar levels in 2019 or from where we sit today. I think also the balance sheet capacity as we're down positively trending from a debt-to-EBITDA perspective. I think that as cash flow continues to grow, as we continue to ramp up at Assembly and Pike & Rose in 2019 and as they further stabilize that will add greater debt capacity just very, very naturally on a leverage neutral basis. And so we\u2019ve got a number of different ways that we can kind of fund the development pipeline and feel really, really good about how well positioned we are heading into the final quarter of 2018. Jeremy Metz : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Your line is open. Samir Khanal : Hi, guys. Good morning. Don, can I ask you to take step back and maybe talk about sort of your watchlist today and compare that to last year. I mean I look at, as we kind of go through your top 20 certainly feels like there is less exposure to the tenants that are will anchor or liquidate which tells me kind of that 2% to 3% of same store probably still is applicable for next year. But then you look at that Bed Bath or you look at Krogers that continue to top down rents. Is there a race that your releasing spreads could kind of start to decelerate a little bit here going into maybe the next 12 months to 24 months? Don Wood : Yeah. Samir, it\u2019s a good question. Look, the -- and I love the way you started it, because that\u2019s exactly how I looked at it. I start out with that list that watch list et cetera and try to predict to the best as we can what would effectively happen. I mean do I worry about Bed Bath Beyond long-term, sure. I mean I absolutely do and do I worry about that Bed Bath Beyond not honoring their commitments and paying rent, no, not at all and somewhere and that\u2019s a great example of an operation where, I don\u2019t know how they will change their business plan, I don\u2019t think anybody does at this point whether how successful they\u2019ll be, what that new prototype will be as they move forward in the coming years. But certainly I want to make sure we have tenants that are at are tenant of the future that we believe in that are there to the extent we\u2019re not part of the plan going forward.  So, certainly with any tenants that\u2019s not performing as well as they were, the rent pressure ramps up. It's an obvious statement, but it's certainly the case throughout a lot of these boxed tenants. The key with us is the balance and I going to start to show you a little bit more of how our residential performs, going to show you how our office performs, we\u2019re going to try to get to this community to understand our company in its broadest \u2013 from a broad real estate perspective, because there are pressures coming in terms of retail lease roll over, certainly there are pressures. Do I see them as oh my god, off single digit lease roll overs or what we roll back \u2013 no I don\u2019t. So, consider this within the context of the whole company in terms of how we\u2019re moving. I think you\u2019re going to feel really good about an investment that is very likely to continue to grow for years simply based on what we have in pipeline today. And I don\u2019t know if there is anybody else that can say that there are very many else that can say that. Samir Khanal : Okay. Thanks. And as we think about next year, I mean what are sort of the drags we need to think about especially from the same store perspective. I mean there is one is certainly Toys right, but I don\u2019t think you had lot of exposure to those and then are there any other tenants that, will the company be kind of moving on to a level where you\u2019ll be proactively maybe taking back space like you did a couple of years ago. So, is that something to think about for 2019? Don Wood : Very much so, very much. I mean you know when you go down the list and you look at what we've got you've got to feel really good about this income stream. Toys might be the best example at all. One, one that was completely released at significant bumps to where Toys was and yes indeedo with you know within an incredibly short amount period of time. That's done. So you know where what happens with respect to Mattress Firm, we got 14 of them. You know when I look at the 14 and you know where most of are there are there on out parcels or in caps in great locations. That's not something I particularly worry about. Doesn\u2019t mean there's not going to be some dislocation depending on what happens with the revolution of the company but we deal with that all the time, always have been. Don't see any amount of those type of income stoppages if you will in a significant way any different than we've managed through in years past certainly. And certainly better than 2016.  So yes you ought to think about proactively leasing to we do constantly. It's not a switch that we turn on and off it is a dial that we turn up when we see opportunities turn down we don't. Yes you could see that turned up a little bit again. Samir Khanal : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Don, I was wonder you give us some description or background on RevUp the third-party platform that Mike Kelleher is setting up? Don Wood : Very good, very good for picking that up, Craig, that\u2019s cool. Not a big deal at this point at all. What that, what that's about is you know when you look at this industry and you think about temporary tenant income, ancillary income, sponsorships, all of the kind of nontraditional leasing revenue generation. I'm really proud of what we built as a company over the last decade or decade and a half. And yeah Mike Kelleher has been a big part of that to be able to grow it. We think we have capacity there and we think we've figured out how to do that maybe better than some other folks have. So we'd like to in the markets where we do significant business already we'd like to pick up some third party work and spread that platform across a bigger base. It's just something that we're rolling out. We probably won't do that service for you know some of our direct public competitors but there's an awful lot of regional real estate companies that really could benefit and we could share the income with them. So that's what we're messing with. I think it's cool. I don't know if it turns into anything or not. If Kelleher were on the phone right now, he\u2019ll be telling you it's the greatest thing you've ever heard of and we're going to do really well with it. We'll see.  But it's I think more importantly Craig it's indicative of the creativity and the way we look at trying to add value in various different ways big and small throughout the company. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then lower G&A I'm sure was helped in some part by Dan and Christian\u2019s exit but it looks to be more significant than that. Can you tell me what to you doing there in terms of maybe getting some more cost savings. Don Wood : Yes, look, it's a big part of one of the things that that I always wonder about I think you can appreciate this is as a company with our longevity. Right. We've been around a long time and we\u2019re relatively powerful in the few markets that we\u2019re in. And then I think vendors and others get comfortable with that in terms of dealing with Federal. I don\u2019t think we use our leverage as much as potentially we could have to be able to renegotiate some of those deals and effectively reexamine scopes, reexamine financial terms with some of our partners. No, when I say partner, I mean vendor, I mean, people necessary to create great shopping centers.  We pushed hard on that in 2018, and we pushed hard on that with some very favorable results. That\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing coming through. And I don\u2019t think those are one-time favorable results. I think those are our benefits that are all about relooking and leveraging the power of Federal Realty and again the five or six critical markets that we do business. And part of it is on a year-over-year basis and we did the prime store acquisition in the third quarter of last year. So there were transactional costs that added to G&A, which we just didn\u2019t have in 2017, and we just didn\u2019t have in the third quarter of this year. So that\u2019s another kind of a driver. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeffrey Donnelly : Don, I think you might have touched on this in the call, but I had heard that concerning Santana West that, that was a site that even Apple might have been looking at perhaps for one of their projects, that maybe market chatter. But I guess my question is, do you think that\u2019s that office opportunity that needs to be a single tenant development opportunity like you had with Splunk or is it possible that could have something that's a little more ground for retail or residential or office on it? Don Wood : Yes. Just going to add, Jeff will add to this just make a comment or two on it. No, this is an office product. It\u2019s an office site. It\u2019s an entitled for office any retail that we do would be relatively insignificant. And this is real simple and this is a 12 acre piece of land directly across from one of the most iconic if you will at this point, mixed use destinations in the country. It happens to be in the middle of Silicon Valley, it\u2019s really valuable. And so whoever the tenant or tenants are, it doesn\u2019t have to be one tenant, it could be can certainly be several.  What we know is we\u2019ve got a piece of real estate there, that is getting an awful lot of interest from some, I will say typical or users that you would think of and some niches certainly would. And it just shows the broad value of the real estate, because of what was created across the street. So there\u2019s all this has to be value a little bit more, but there\u2019s no denying the value of the real estate business, that\u2019s there. Jeff Berkes : Right. So Jeff, I don\u2019t really have anything to add other than if you look at all Silicon Valley right now. There is precious little available office space or office space coming anytime soon just a matter of time. We\u2019ve got Santana was probably one of, only a handful or less than a handful of opportunities for that over the next two or three years. Just given the entitlement cycle and what\u2019s going on and some of the other sub markets around here. So we\u2019re like Don said super bullish on it and there\u2019s a lot of interest in the site right now. Jeffrey Donnelly : Jeff, just I guess speaking with that. I mean, are you seeing some of the bigger employers in that market that are actually trying to tie up office space, even though they might not have an immediate need for the space today, just because of that dearth of space they\u2019re sort of tying it up in anticipation of future growth? Jeff Berkes : Yes and no, but remember growth is a occurring very quickly out here and the lead time on a development, even something that\u2019s entitled ready-to-go is still a couple of years to build a building. So, lot of firms are growing into the requirements by the time the space actually delivers. I mean it\u2019s clearly the case with Apple, their new headquarters building from what we understand that\u2019s full. When we look at market activity, we don\u2019t see them giving back any of their other space. So, if you look at the big users out here, I think that\u2019s true that they have to look out a couple of years and by the time the space is ready, they\u2019ve filled it. Jeffrey Donnelly : And maybe Don just stepping back more broadly on external growth, I mean your perspective on retail seems to have shifted somewhat sharply over the last few years and what the prospects of it hold. Do you think as a company you\u2019re more open to mixed use or a mix of users than you have ever been before? And do you think the market focus -- just the geographic focus of the company maybe has changed with that. Are there some markets that you\u2019re more open to going into? Maybe one last aspect of it is, will you ever do standalone office or residential development away from retail? Don Wood : No to the last question. I mean I\u2019m going to book in you here for a minute because that was a lot. No, we won\u2019t do standalone or non-retail-oriented resi or office as part of our business plan. I\u2019m going to go back to your last thing, I\u2019m going to say one quick thing about your last question and that is please don\u2019t speculate about Apple, don\u2019t speculate that, don\u2019t write that down because that\u2019s probably not the case, okay? Let me be clear.  Now let\u2019s get to what you just asked. Here\u2019s the way I look at it, the more predictable the future is, the more narrow you can target your business plan. The less predictable the future is, the more you want to be able to have to be as flexible and it\u2019s a most important word in our business and as flexible as you possible can. Flexibility with respect to what the future holds simply means to me, I\u2019d like to be able to not rely on any one income stream and if that\u2019s the rolling forward of rents in a basic shopping center, that\u2019s one thing. If it is, do I want to have the ability to create value upstairs on land in the markets that we\u2019re in that are identifying anyway? Of course I do. It\u2019s not -- it really isn\u2019t a battle, liking mixed use or not liking mixed use, or liking a shopping center or not liking a shopping center.  The reality is what our core competency is, is first ring suburbs creating great places for people to go to. That can be a grocery-anchored shopping center, it can be a mixed use, probably can be whatever else it is. Once you have the layer, that\u2019s not necessary and in Manhattan at the corner or 57th and 5th that environment already exists. There you can do an independent any kind of building. The people are already there. That\u2019s not the case in the first ring suburbs where we are doing most of our business. We don\u2019t have to bring people there.  Now once you them, how do you make more monies? And that\u2019s where you have to say whether it\u2019s buying adjacent parcels and growing on them, whether it\u2019s going up in office or retail, I look out at an unpredictable future, I want as many arrows in the quiver as I possibly can have. That's what I think we've done. So I don't see it as a sharp change in believing in retail or not believing in retail. I think it's a evolutionary change in the unpredictability of technology's impacts on the consumer. And so when you're sitting and think about it that way what do you best do about that if you're a real estate company, not a retailer, but a real estate company. You make sure your real estate is valuable in any one of the number of different ways. And I think we've proven pretty well our core competency and the ability to look more broadly as real estate people rather than simply shopping center people. Jeffrey Donnelly : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Hi. A couple of questions. First, Dan, when you\u2019re talking about 2019 you flagged G&A and then lease accounting separately. So is your lease accounting expense, is that going to be in operating expenses? Dan Guglielmone : No. They will be a component of increase in our G&A in 2019. Part of it will be lease accounting related. The lease accounting change geographically will sit up as G&A item. But we will also have a -- in our current level of G&A, there will also be an increase which -- so there\u2019s two pieces to that. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then I guess just thinking about tenant demand and everything on the mall calls, you constantly hear about retailers and demand moving into the malls. I'm just curious about your portfolio, are you seeing that sort of interest as well from those types of tenants? Don Wood : Yes, Mike, this is -- I\u2019ve talked about it earlier in one of the questions. But just think about this for a minute. All of these retailers basically -- or let's start and say online retailers who have started online, these guys, all of them, I didn\u2019t say all, most are struggling and have always struggled with typical things you struggle in a business with number one being, customer acquisition costs. How do I get that customer and what\u2019s it me to get to them? And of course then the delivery system. And those two things have led many of them to the conclusion that you know what, we need a physical presence. And I've got some interesting stuff I\u2019ll share outside as maybe at NAREIT next week, some of the quotes and some of the plans that these guys have, now when you say okay where are they going to go? The chances to me are look awfully good for the type of properties that we own. We're close to a lease for one of those tenants that we're talking about in Bethesda Row right now. We're close on two at Santana Row right now. The streets that we have presence are on like Third Street Promenade. I mean these are -- it's -- I don't know how important a component of the future it is but it's certainly a component of the future. And going back to where I was before, we want to cast the broadest widest funnel to be able to be attractive to the largest possible number of retailers. And where we are suggests to me that we'll have more than our fair share of those tenants who are finding the need for bricks and mortar stores. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open. Haendel St. Juste: Lots of calls, lots of detail, much appreciated. But question for you Don. I guess more of a big picture. We\u2019ve seen a lot of M&A this year in the REITs, but nothing in the shopping centers. Curious why you think that is? And then is there anything you expect over the next year that Federal could participate in? Don Wood : Oh, Haendel, this was -- I mean we\u2019ve been talking about this question for 20 plus years and that\u2019s just what I remember, so I\u2019m sure it goes back before that. Look, the idea of combining platforms has to have a business sense to it that makes all the sense in the world, obviously what you saw with Equity One and Regency was indicative of that. I think you can look at that and say, yes that company is Federal than the two companies separately would have been. But those things are few and far between, they\u2019re hard to do.  As you know, I love to tell the story of -- and I don\u2019t know if [Ernst] really would mad at me for saying it or not, but we had a -- we have a very good relationship and back before they were public, we were trying very hard to put those companies together, didn\u2019t work out, they went public, are doing great. So we\u2019ve come down to the individual business plans, it comes down to the social issues that are part and parcel to it. And when you think about betting on the future, there\u2019s almost always dilution from the buyer side, initially for a period of time. So you have to be comfortable with where that future is going and what it\u2019s going to provide. That\u2019s harder to do today than -- that\u2019s been another period.  So the combination of other things, is Federal involved and anything that\u2019s possible for us? You bet. We talk a lot -- we talk to a lot of people a lot of the time. But we\u2019re not going to do something that doesn\u2019t improve the prospects versus our existing plan. And our existing plan is really good in terms of this real estate. Our real estate clearly will be worth more in the future than it is today. When I see it and I look at the prospects for growth, for domination in certain -- at certain properties, the whole consolidation the properties, et cetera. So, any kind of deals from a merger perspective or anything else has to be incrementally significantly better than that. I haven\u2019t found that. Haendel St. Juste: And just a follow-up on the mid-5 cap rate expectations for the assets under discussion for disposition here. Curious where you think those assets might have traded 12 to 18 months ago? And then how large would you say your bucket of non-core, but tax efficient potential asset sales bucket is? Don Wood : I\u2019m going to jump in before Dan here on a minute because I\u2019m cringed when he said that, when he said mid-5. Because listen, we\u2019ll see based on the marketplace, what those assets will trade at and what they won\u2019t trade at. The answer to your question, how does that compare? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I\u2019d love to see as part of this and it is a small bucket. And I kind of went into that before a little bit, it\u2019s a small bucket, because we sit and we look at the future earnings prospect of the assets and quite far and away most of the assets at this company -- and again, there\u2019s only 104 of them. Most of those assets have really bright futures. To the extend they don\u2019t, we\u2019ll find a way to effectively recycle out of them but that we\u2019re talking about six, seven, eight assets, based on information that we have today in terms of looking at the future, that would fall into that bucket. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Derek Johnson with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Shivani Sood : Hi, this is Shivani Sood on for Derek Johnson. The office aspect of the portfolio has been a large focus of today\u2019s call. So would you mind just speaking to the leasing front there, how the process and the potential CapEx and involve might differ from the retail aspect of the portfolio? And also kind of how you view it from an operating metric perspective? Don Wood : Sure. It\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m not sure that -- well I am sure that we don\u2019t have a view on office product in a national way or in standalone office products. What we do know is, places where we have created an environment with retail on that ground floor that is amenity-rich is more and more and more attractive to office users. And as a result, in places where we have the land -- and again our average shopping center is 20 acres large which is big compared to most shopping centers and we have the opportunity at various places to be able to exploit that retail environment that we\u2019ve created. In some cases, we\u2019ve seen it at Pike & Rose with the first phase; we\u2019ve certainly seen it at Santana Row. Even through there are other opportunities in the marketplace for office, the office user sees those other opportunities as irrelevant and obsolete. And so, we think we have something that\u2019s particularly special, that can drive a premium rent, that can drive premium bumps in those rental deals. And most importantly, it\u2019s so integral to the overall property that we\u2019re developing or building -- or community to that we\u2019re building that it\u2019s really part and parcel of how the retail works, how the resi works, it provides the day time traffic. As I said before, that\u2019s critical, it is immensely efficient in terms of parking. And so, office brokers bring the product to us. And so, these are negotiated similar to any other office deal with the same criteria for capital, the same criteria for rent, et cetera. We just feel like we\u2019re in a stronger position to be able to be at the top of the range of those market conditions on all the economic aspects, because of what we\u2019ve invested down on the ground floor. So, you won\u2019t see us doing separate office buildings across the country to broaden our -- what our basic core competency is, but we certainly will at the properties that we\u2019ve created great places, exploit that. And to me, that office product where we\u2019re building whether it\u2019s Santana or Assembly or Pike & Rose, that office product is de-risked to a huge degree because of the significant investment that has been made in the place previous to that. Shivani Sood : Great. Thanks so much for that color. And then just given the more diverse, full of assets that -- effort -- you have centers, for example, power centers, grocery-anchored, mixed use. Can you just give us an update in terms of retailer demand for the different property types and has that shifted at all over the past year or so? Don Wood : Nope. And I\u2019d tell you what, because I know it's simpler to say power centers perform like this and grocery-anchors perform like this and mixed use perform like that et cetera, It's just not true. It totally depends on physically where that property is in the supply and demand characteristics and at that particular piece of real estate. So I spend bunch of time on that call talking about leases at a power center called East Bay Bridge in Emeryville, California. It's an incredibly powerful supply demand environment for us because there's no other supply of that. So, no, and I could make those same kind of comments for each one. You really got to get into the individual real estate. It's not a compound. I know it sounds like one. But I really fight hard about the characterization of any particular type, even though I understand it's easier for you to categorize. Sorry. Shivani Sood : Thanks. That's it for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. So, already a lot of good questions have been asked by my peers. So just want to ask, one from me. If you could wave a magic wand and get any piece of technology to help your business, what would that be? Don Wood : I'll keep doing the last question and it's the most cerebral here for crying a lot, good for you. There's an interesting thing going on right now and it's obviously all about data and how much data is available and every two person consulting firm who's selling their idea of what data you need and what would really matter, the answer to that question in my mind and I don't think my peers agree with me necessarily around this but the answer to that question has not -- is not clear. There is so much information out there. The one thing that I think we all have to be careful about is running out and investing and pulling in a whole bunch of data that it turns out really isn\u2019t impactful to the lease negotiation or to the deal negotiation in the form of an acquisition et cetera. The obvious pieces of data and information are clear. It's certainly sales of square foot. It's certainly profitability. It's certainly the supply effectively. It\u2019s certainly understanding where your customers are coming from. But when you say what one piece is there, it gets too myopic in my view, I don't think there is one piece.  And so we're dealing with all that. Now we're talking with a lot of vendors. We're talking with potential partners. We're talking with companies that are trying to marry retailers with landlords doing all the right things but really trying to figure out where to invest in information that will make a difference. That's still great. Ki Bin Kim : Yes, I get you're saying. I've seen a few pictures and I know what my problem is. My problem is that everything sounds great. I get you. Thank you. Don Wood : Absolutely, you bet. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Leah Brady for any further remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks for joining us today. We do have a couple of meeting slots left at NAREIT. So please reach out if you are interested in meeting with us. And we look forward to seeing you -- many of you there. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Leah Brady. Ma'am, you may begin. Leah Brady : Thank you, good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.

Given the number of participants on the call, we finally ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to jump back in queue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah and good morning, everyone. We finished our 2018 particularly strong with reported FFO per share in the fourth quarter of $1.57, better than we had expected resulting in a full year 2018 results of $6.23 a share, 6.8% better than last year for the quarter, 5.4% better for the year. Just to have the point out right upfront; this is the ninth year in a row that we have reported FFO increases over the prior year, the only shopping centers read to do so, as the fifteenth year of the past sixteenth that we've done so. We also expect to grow in 2019, please let that sink in in later today's environment. A lot went right this quarter and subsequently through today, that both benefited the fourth quarter operating results, and more importantly, cash flow in the future. Everything from record leasing activity in the quarter to stabilized residential occupancy in our big developments, the powerful office preleasing at both Assembly Row and CocoWalk, all that is contributing to a business plan that more and more seems right for today's demanding and changing consumer. So let me get to some specifics; revenues grew 5.1% quarter-over-quarter and 6.8% year-over-year. Earnings growth at comparable properties was 2% for the quarter, 3.1% for the year. The combo portfolio remains 95% leased to 94% occupied, and our operating expenses including G&A but not including real estate taxes grew at less than 1% for the quarter, and less than 3% for the year; that's a pretty complete formula for largely organic growth. Terms of leasing; we did 107 comparable deals for 574,000 square feet at an average rent of $32.16 a foot, 15% above the $27.96 [ph] that the previous tenant was paying in the last year of their lease. We've never done deals for them at square footage in the quarter before, a record by nearly 10%. For the year, we did 374 comparable deals and 402 total deals for almost 2 million square feet; again, an all-time annual records for us at 12% more rent. So despite this location in the retail real estate business there is plenty of strong retail leasing going on in the dominant quality properties that we know. A few more words on leasing because I don't want to portray it as all rosy. The big difference we see in today's results compared with a few years back is the increased volatility when you look at a large sample size of leases. They grant bumps [ph] and redeveloped and modernized retail destinations are stronger or even stronger than they've ever been. But there is also a number of roll downs on anchor or junior anchor boxes where there are legitimately acceptable alternatives in the market. Now, well that basic supply and demand dynamic have certainly have been around forever, it feels more pronounced today so that the spread between good deals and not so good deals seems to me to be wider. We've talked about for quite some time now the importance of a well-diversified income stream to sustainable growing cash flow, and I couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made in this regard. Our core shopping center portfolio is second to none, and we're looking at harder than ever for densification opportunities in terms of broader real estate uses, retail resin [ph] office, following the successes we've had or having at places like the Point in Elsa Gondo [ph], Tower Shops in Florida, Congressional Plaza in Rockville, and many more, you know the list. We broke ground this quarter on our initial development phase at our Kenwood Shopping Center which includes 87 luxury apartments and expanded planning for the development of the balance of the east end of the site. In the next few months, we're hopeful we'll get investment committee approval to move forward with the redevelopment of the entire western portion of Graham Park Plaza, our long time owned 19-acre shopping center that sits inside the beltway on Route 50 in Fairfax County, Virginia; that plan includes the addition of about 200 apartments and twice making incorporated into a reinvigorated retail shopping destination. And we're getting closer in Darien, Connecticut with negotiation feasibility of a residential over retail mixed used community right at the train station in this New York City suburb. But for a building permit we now have all local and state entitlement to develop 75,000 square feet of new retail space and a 122 rental apartments; diversify and intensify wherever feasible. The big development news over the past few months involved Assembly Row, [indiscernible] and CocoWalk. After achieving stabilization in 2018 as the big residential component of our second phase at assembly row, and higher rents and at a quicker pace than we had expected. We were anxious to capitalize on this -- that success with the start of our next phase. In addition, the menstruation of assembly as a first class office location solidified by partner's healthcare and the active T-stop in bold enough to add more office products, there too. So we're underway, we're driving files. Two high-rise buildings; one directly at the foot of the Tea-stop with 500 rental apartments above ground floor retail, and the second, a $300000 square foot, Class A Office Building, half of which is pleased to German shoe and apparel maker, Puma, for their North American headquarters. I hope you saw the separate announcement on Puma several weeks back. Together a $475 million Phase 3 expansion at one of the country's most successful mature development that we're conservatively underwriting to combine 6% yield with full and infrastructure allocation and near 7% on an incremental cash basis. With the commitment of West Elm [ph] to take the final 12,000 square feet adjacent to pinstripes and Pike & Rose, our retail space has all been leased, at least once. As West Elm [ph] and the remaining tenants open throughout 2019 and the residential units remain 95% occupied, the first two phases of Pike & Rose will be fully stabilized, construction on the 212,000 square foot spec office building, and the 600 parking space parking garage in Phase 3 is now fully under construction for tenant occupancy in 2021. At CocoWalk at Miami, we made very strong progress on both construction and leasing on this 256,000 square foot redevelopment over the past several months with the signing of the 430,000 square foot office lease executed with Regis [ph] for their spaces concept at the project along with an additional 21,000 square feet of new deals, both restaurants and retailers which when combined with existing tenants gets us to well more than 50% release on this important redevelopment. The office demand here in particular is validating our thesis of consumers wanting to be in a monetized [ph] environment close to home. This property is going to be very special when it's completed. No significant development at sunset place over the last few months as we continue to work toward entitlements that would allow greater density, tenants will continue to leave the property as it sits in it's existing condition, and so sunset will be a significant year-over-year earnings drag in 2019. West Coast construction continues on-schedule and on-budget as we prepare to deliver 700 Santana Road at Splunk later this year. Next step should be the first of two 350,000 square foot office building at Santana West, the 12-acre site that we control across Winchester Boulevard from Santana Row. We expect the investment committee consideration of that project in a couple of months with construction start later this year if we get comfortable with the numbers. Also, Jordan Downs, our 113,000 square foot grocery anchored development in Los Angeles with joint venture partner, Prime Store, is well under construction with it's full anchor program on their lease, 30,000 square feet of sign leases in the fourth quarter alone with Nike and Blank Fitness joining grosser smart and final and value retailer Ross to round out the offerings resulting in more than 75% of the GLA leased at this point. Tension now turns to the small shelf space. And finally, a quick shout out to Wendy Seher, to Jan Sweetnam and the other 11 Federal Realty executives that were promoted last week coming out of our board meeting including Investor favorite James Model. There was a separate press release that lays out the details. You know there's very little about running this company that is more satisfying to me than being able to develop and grow human capital from within. It's not always possible but we strive to be able to do so. To me, it's indicative of the depth of our team and pays off in spades in terms of the continuity of our business plan and our ability to not miss a beat. And yet, says Dan Guglielmone, G&A will go up a bunch next year. And that's about it for my prepared remarks for the quarter and for the full year of 2018. It was a really good one. Let me now turn it over to Dan for some additional color and then opened the line to ask your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don and Leah. Hello everyone. We are really pleased with our results for fourth quarter and the full year 2018. With FFO per share growth of 6.8% and 5.4% respectively, versus 4Q and full year of 2017, we'd be consensus for both the quarter and for the year by attending. The numbers in the fourth quarter were driven primarily due to lower net real estate taxes offset by greater net impact from failing tenants than was forecast heading into the fourth quarter as well as higher demo and higher G&A. Our comparable POI metric came in at 2% for the fourth quarter as a result of these drivers. The average comparable POI growth per quarter for the year was 3.2%. A solid result in light of the challenging environment. With respect to our former same-store metrics, the quarterly average for the same-store with read depth with 3.1% and same-store without real depth at 2.7%. We are officially retiring these metrics having provided them over the course of 2018 during our transition to a more relevant comparable POI figure. With respect to asset sale and other activity during 2018, we raised over $200 million of proceeds in the aggregate as we closed on over 85% of the market rate condos at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose raising roughly $130 million in proceeds, sold Chelsea Comments residential and Atlantic Plaza Shopping Center and our Boston region at a blended mid fives cap rate raising $42 million and closed on our 50-50 JV at the Row Hotel at Assembly, bringing in $38 million of gross proceeds. On the acquisition side, our discipline was once again evident in 2018 as we aggressively scoured the market for opportunities but to continue to find better risk adjusted capital allocation alternatives in our own portfolio from a redevelopment and development perspective. However, we do have a pipeline of attractive acquisition targets and are optimistic we can bring a couple of them over the finish line in 2019. Now onto the balance sheet. 2018 was the year where we positioned our capital structure exceptionally well to handle the next wave of value creating development and redevelopment activity for the company. We finished the year with roughly $50 million of excess cash and nothing outstanding on a credit facility. We reduced our overall net debt level by over $100 million. We generated upwards of $90 million of recurring free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital in 2018. As a result, our net debt to EBITDA at year-end is 5.3 times down point from 5.9 times at year-end 2017. Our fixed charge coverage ratio stands at 4.3 times currently versus 3.9 at 4Q 2017. Our weighted average debt maturity remains at the top of the sector at 10 plus years and the weighted average interest rate on our debt stands at 3.88% with over 90% of it fixed. As we push forward with the next wave of development and redevelopment of Federal over the coming years, development which has been significantly de-risked through solid pre-leasing splunk with the 100% of the office leased in 97% of the total building at Santana Row delivery set at the end of the year. Puma with 55% of the office space leased and multiple tenants competing for the balances of the office space as block 5B in Assembly Row delivery slated for late 2021 and registers the IWG spaces concept having pre-leased 50% of the new office space at CocoWalk delivery scheduled for late 2020. Our E-rated balance sheet equipped with a diversity of low-cost funding sources leads us extremely well-positioned to execute our multifaceted business plan and drive sector leading growth through 2019 and into 2020, '21 and beyond. Now, I will turn to 2019 FFO guidance. We are formally providing a range of $6.30 to $6.46 per share. This guidance takes into account the impact of the new lease accounting standard which we estimate at $0.07 to $0.09. While on other items we will be expensing internal leasing and legal costs that were previously capitalized. Please note that on apples to apples basis adjusting for the new accounting standard or FFO growth forecast for 2019 would be roughly 2.5% to 5%. Behind this growth are the underpinnings of a very solid 2019. Occupancy and rental rate gains in our comparable property portfolio will be meaningful. Proactive releasing activity in 2018 will drive growth in 2019 as major tenants like Anthropology in Bethesda, 49ers Fit [ph] and TJ Maxx at Westgate and San Jose, Bob's Furniture at both Lowe's Hardiness and Escondido in Southern California target at Sam's Parkin Shop, NBC among others all contribute more fully over the year. And continued stabilization, our signature, mixed use projects, Assembly Row, Pike $ Rose and Santana Row will all drive meaningful growth to the bottom line in 2019. These items together would drive FFO per share growth into the 6% to 8% range if not for some discreet but somewhat disproportionate headwinds. The leasing impacts and are non-comparable properties, CocoWalk, Grand Park and Sunset Place will weigh on this year's results. Proactive redevelopment and remerchandising activity at some of our dominant regional assets in order to further consolidate their market leading positions, we'll also have an impact. Assets which include Plaza Elsa Gundo in Los Angeles, Huntington Shopping Center on the Island and congressional here in Metro DC. In addition, a recent initiative to establish the next generation of leaders of Federal will meaningfully increase our G&A in 2019 beyond the lease accounting changes. As a result, our guidance underscores a very constructive 2019 for Federal. Now to the detailed assumptions behind our guidance, comparable POI growth of about 2% and total POI growth of 4%. A credit reserve which includes bad debt expense, unexpected vacancy in rent relief of roughly 100 basis points, non-comparable redevelopment, i.e. CocoWalk, Grand Park and Sunset will create about sixth sense of drag relative to 2018 as we work through the continued de-leasing impact of these assets. With respect to G&A, we forecast roughly $10 million to $11 million per quarter. This reflects $0.07 to $0.09 impact from the new lease accounting standard taking effect this year and about $0.05 to $0.06 in higher G&A, primarily relating to the promotions in new additions we mentioned On the capital side we project spending on development and redevelopment of $350 million to $400 million. As is our custom, this guidance as soon as no acquisitions or dispositions. And finally, we are projecting another $70 million to $90 million of free cash flow generation after dividends and maintenance capital. As I close out my comments on guidance, I would like to highlight the Federal diversified business model continues to insistently churn out sector leading FFO growth by a wide margin. When you assess the projected apples to apples FFO growth for 2019, let me have you pause and think about the following statistics. Federal consistently produces outsize bottom line FFO growth relative to our peers, not as adjusted but SEC-endorsed new redefined FFO growth. Over three-year, five-year, ten-year and 15 year-horizons, Federal's FFO growth has outperformed its Bloomberg shopping center peer average by a margin of roughly 8%, 6%, 8% and 7% respectively. That's per annum and that's compounded. With that, we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in few weeks and please be on the lookout for the invitations to our investor day, which will be held on Thursday, May 9 at Assembly Row in Boston. Operator, you can open up the line for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo JeffDonnelly : Good morning guys, and Dan thanks for the call around guidance. The question is the guidance that you provided seems slightly more conservative than earlier commentary you gave in late 2018. Is that small delta the result of the specific change in your outlook you can talk about or is that really just kind of a nonspecific I guess it's a desire to be cautious looking out in 2019? DonWood: Yes, I think it's a little bit of a bolt I think that you know when we put things out there we had a placeholder with regards to D&A. In the incremental D&A outside of the lease accounting and so that ended up being a little bit higher and I think just as we work through, you know we -- you know it was a preliminary guide [ph] post you know guidance back in November and as we work through you know a budgeting process which hadn't really yet started until you know mid November 2018 through the end of the year and wasn't finalized until January. I think you know we'll get 60 basis points \u00a24 revision on a $6 and \u00a240 basis so it's tweaking around the edges. It could give you a little bit more conservatism, yes. JeffDonnelly: And maybe just a second part on the guidance, can you talk about what your assumptions are on cash spreads on renewals for 2019 just because in 2017 they were up 9% and as in 2018 they're up 4%. I guess I'm wondering if there's a trend there if you guys kind of think you saw the bottom here you know maybe that's not so much a trend other than just a mix of lease maturities that you faced? DonWood: Can you repeat the question? I got you Jeff. You know it is -- I don't have much to add to that. It is a mix, it depends on what deals are coming up how it kind of rolls out plays through. There's no doubt, there are pressure on rents and you know I tried to make that point in the -- in the prepared remarks, there -- at least we say, more volatility, you know, great deals are great, not so great deals are not so great and that you know mix between top and bottom is more when it comes down to renewals I mean if I look in -- just look even at the fourth quarter, I can give you a couple of pretty interesting specifics for the years you know CDS deal had a great property that we have in Northern Virginia, that's a big time renewal increase. At the same time, we sit there with an open deal I think recreational Plaza where they had somewhere else to go and we wound up agreeing to reduce rent on that something that wouldn't have happened a few years back. So it really is a bit more volatile I don't know what more to tell you in terms of you know the notion of how those renewals will play out but I can tell you that overall if you'd certainly expect to see continued growing rents from us. I just can't give you the mixes as precisely as maybe you'd like it. Dan Guglielmone : I think you'll see more volatility. I think you saw that this year with regards to some of the rollover you know in the range of 6% one quarter, 22% you know you'll see more of that I think going forward. JeffDonnelly: Just one last question for you, Don. I'm just curious how you guys think about office leasing decisions that you know dissemble you obviously cut the deal with Puma [ph] you know retail brand instead of looking outside of retailing. I'm just curious because for your retail properties you guys have always talked about putting you know thought behind not just economics but how the tenant contributed to the overall merchandizing and other factors. For offices, is it strictly economics is it credit risk is it -- you know what it does to the daytime population? How do you guys kind of think about that? Don Wood : Yes, that's a great question Jeff, It really is. There is you know on the waiting of merchandising versus economics certainly in on the retail side as you know we put a lot of you know there's a higher weight on the merchandising side. On the office side is less; it is more economics but not completely. So at the end of the day, you know again when we're doing office, we're only doing office at our places where we created that environment on the street. So to the extent the company has a workforce that aligns better with the merchandising that we've done on the retail side on the street that is clearly beneficial or you know they get a checkup in that type of environment. Credit is certainly the most important thing as we look at it on the office side but you know that merchandising component is clearly the component in the way we put there. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Christy McElroy of Citigroup Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, this is Katie McConnell [ph] on for Kristy. So if you can talk generally a little bit more about the yields you're able to achieve on larger mixed use development projects and how you're underwriting future phases as well and how you think about it in the context of ultimate value creation and what these assets can be worth upon stabilization? Don Wood : I'd love to deal with that one. I'd love to take that one. Look there is no question I don't think I'm saying anything that everybody doesn't know that construction costs are clearly high end and you know probably will go higher as we go forward and you need premium rents to do that. I can tell you the best thing that we have done in the last decade was to not stop our mixed use development program throughout the last recession. That put us as you know in the place of having the places themselves the street level places created during that period of 2013, 2014, 2015. And so the incremental mix used development stuff that we do at those places Pike & Rose [ph], Assembly rows[ph] and Santana row, are you know are risk mitigated in large measure. I very much believe that mixed use properties are at least the good ones are completely integrated in terms of those uses and have to be viewed as integrated in terms of their Cap rates what they would be sold for what those income streams are valued at? And so when we have a chance to jump on, take assembly. The next big piece for residential and office at a combined 6, on a fully loaded basis and closer to a 7 on a cash on cash basis. There's no doubt in my mind we're creating significant value. And that's in a market where construction costs are about as high as any place that we've seen and given what's happening in and around us with the casino and other things that are taking that construction workforce and employing them. So if you just step back then and say all right, do you view these mixed use properties that we're dealing as sub 5 capital you know assets in total? Absolutely we do. We absolutely look at those things as being 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 4 in terms of office and ready and retail and accordingly to the extent we can put our capital work 6% or better certainly at assets like that. We think we're getting a sufficient premium to our cost of capital plots as has been demonstrated Santana and in Bethesda [ph] as these things are open and yes they take a long time to get up and yes they take a long time to mature but they are the gift that keeps on giving. So the growth rate of those assets we've experienced to be higher than other stuff. So the IRR's are effectively higher than other stuff. So I hope that answers and I hope that puts in context for you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven [ph] of Evercore ISI. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, two questions. I guess Don the follow up on that you know was you think about places like Santana Row in the next days and an office. I mean are you sort of raising the bar at all are you getting a bit more cautious we're getting later in the cycle particularly on the office side as it relates to pre-leasing? Or you know sort of the wiggle room you want on rent? I realize that the apartment side you know is a little bit easier to sort of weather it downturn. So how do you think about the office component this late in the cycle? Don Wood : Yes, it's a very fair question Steven, and look we absolutely look at this market by market property by property and as we make those decisions and I'll give you a great example. You know when we look across the street at Santana Row when you look at those 13 acres; we had a tenant that we could have signed for the entire 350,000 square feet of space to effectively pre-release that one of those buildings. We decided not to do it. We decided not to do it because of the credit of the tenant, because of the viability of the business plan. Even though the rents were strong. So you know, it's important I think that you know that if we're allocating capital and we're allocating the underwriting if you will, the quality of the tenants that we're getting that while they are completely -- while they're very much de-risked because of the environment we've created the not totally de-risked and so we look really closely at the credit, we look really close at diversity of the tenant base, we look very close as to the prospects of you know their impact on the rest of the shopping center as [indiscernible] asked early on. In conjunction -- in total, we feel real strongly about Silicon Valley in terms of those opportunities over the next 2 or 3 or 4 years you know beyond that we'll have to see. It is not as vibrant at all in Montgomery County Maryland and that's why we're doing 1 building relatively small size. We know we want office as part of the overall you know mix of the -- mix used Project those will probably be smaller tenants and more diversified in terms of the business. So the market -- the marketplace will dictate it to some extent but we have no problem saying no to a tenant that doesn't you know meet the underwriting standards that are necessary to make the whole thing work. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then I guess one for Dan, just on the guidance I guess I understand you've got a lot of balance sheet flexibility but is it fair to assume that you've got, you know some equity raised in the model to fund the $350 to $400 on the development spending in 2019? Dan Guglielmone : Yes, that is not a lot and I think that we position the balance sheet and call it $80 million to $90 million of free cash flow. After dividends I mean it's capital you know we positioned the balance sheet to be able to raise leverage neutral incremental debt of $125 million to $150 million. You know we have some dispositions in the market now. We'll see how we'll look to kind of bring those over the finish line but also we've got, you know capacity on our line of credit and you know we'll be opportunistic with regards to use our ATM program to the extent that it's opportunistic. Don Wood : The only thing I'd say is that, Stevens, I mean truly look at our history and in terms of how we do you digitally issue equity. It's you know -- we don't love doing the deals and you don't love it, nobody loves it and so everything balanced and the ATM program has been a good program in terms of matching up with development spend pretty nicely. We're in a bad a position as I think you know where we don't have to do that though and so when you sit back and you look at all the alternatives I think instead we had some properties in the market I think we got a $125 or so million worth of dispositions that are in the market now that hopefully get done we expect them to get done. See how that plays out. So it is all about having more hours in the quiver[ph] and being able to pick and choose them opportunistically, carefully and in no way in a big -- in any one of those arrows being over too big a deal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, good morning. Just got two questions here. First Don just going to the office side, you guys have obviously now done some pretty big deals with Puma and partners health and Splunk. Are you guys thinking that maybe as you look at your pipeline going forward that maybe you want to have more office or do you feel that you guys are still leading with retail and offices -- I don't want to say an [indiscernible] but offices with second component just trying to understand because obviously you've had some pretty big wins here. Don Wood : It's a very good question Alex and please understand, we are a retail company that -- if you just -- the way you build out a large mixed-use project and we have 3 between Santana assembling and Pike & Rose in particular. You have to create a place first. It's -- create that place and we lead as we have and in all 3 with residential overlap, because there's no question having a population that lives there associated with the environment created is a real positive. Now, as those things mature and if you're lucky enough as we have been to have a big piece of the land where there are incremental ways to create value the logical next place to go is with a time population. The thing that we're seeing in the marketplace to me that is just really frankly amazing. It's become almost not optional for a progressive company to have and then who hires younger people or the workforce that it needs to not be in a place with all of the amenities and so we're sitting with this advantage if you will of this many, many year head start if you will of creating places and so now you'll see office that you know that daytime population that fills in and makes the ground out the communities and makes them so strong. I mean I don't know whether Puma would be there without the partners deal and remember partners healthcare we don't own the building. We didn't take the risk we leased [ph] it. So when we are a conservative company in terms of the way we view value creation at these at better assets, we could probably grow faster. If we did absolutely everything ourselves and you know and move forward in that way. We're careful about it and we only do it ourselves in places where we've really already established and know what the environment is. So think about our office as an integrated part of a decade or 2 decades long. You know place making environment community if you will that you know has to have all components of lifestyle including the office environment. Alexander Goldfarb : And then the second question is and maybe my you know with old age maybe I'm forgetting things but I thought previously you guys have spoken about just what the experience of the second phase of Pike & Rose in assembly that the next wave of projects would be sort of smaller in scale but the capital spend for phase 3 of assembly is significantly bigger than either of the other 2 on an individual asset basis. So just sort of curious how you're thinking about it as far as you know the stabilization period the impact it has to earnings? I know you guys are all about growing regardless so just want to understand how this bigger capital spend factors into that and if you expect a longer stabilization period or because it's a lot of offices maybe that's not really as much of a factor because they move in you know sort of quickly. Don Wood : Yes, first of all, you had nothing to worry about with your age or remembering well. Everything seems totally perfect you know you're doing just fine pal. So let's get that out of the way. In terms of -- and so incremental adjustments that add to existing properties are generally smaller than the original first phase -- that we do in the first 2 phases that we do. We saw in opportunity at an assembly and I really hope you'll join us on May 9 for our Investor Day out there. This marketplace -- that marketplace is on fire. What we were able to do with that building -- the residential building which was big 477 units the time it took to fill that up surprised even to us. It was short and very different than almost every other market and it's that good so the ability to jump on that and there were some reasons both from construction cost perspective which continued to go up there as well as the -- some things that we need to get done with the -- on the residential side in terms of you know units that are cheaper effectively to do on balance it made sense to do that right now and jumping on that it's a big building, it's at the base of the take, that residential building we have very strong thoughts on how well that'll do and then when Puma was you know without us putting a shovel in the ground effectively had that deal done there, that convinced us to move forward there. So we decided to do two at the same time. It was a residential building not pre-leased, effectively we view it is that way given the level of success that we've had over the last 18 months. So it's a bit of an anomaly but it's only an anomaly based on the strength of the market the success that we've had in the first 2 phases. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, good morning everyone. So if I think about some of the trouble tenants out there and I'm generalizing here you know obviously you've talked about it but we've seen some that always work with these tenants to restructure releases to keep them viable and often cost rationalize and so forth but it's a little bit more one-off. But my question is, if I were working at the real estate department at TJ Maxx or the gems that are expanding our Palatine and any of the kind of expanding very strong retailers and I see other tenants getting a 30% discount on the rent, I would think and come to you and say, \"You know what? We're bringing customers into your center. There's a lot more value for us to be there. Why are we not getting a discount?\" Now, I will answer my own question and I know it was different by property and quality and all that, but do you see this as a risk and is that increasing? DonWood: I'll keep in. I mean there is no doubt. By the way, if you were hired at any retailer\u2019s real estate department and you did not try to take advantage of an oversupply situation in the country, you probably wouldn't be there that long. So there is no question that every retailer has adopted the position of getting the best deal. That's not different than it's ever been. There is no question that in a more oversupplied environment that they play that card higher. Answer now your own question, when there are no other opportunities, you can play it all out but you don't win. On places where there is more opportunities, you do win. And that goes back to my volatility point from earlier on. I see a bigger spread between good deals and not so good deals from that perspective. I don't think there's a company out there that can say that the retail real estate industry is not in a position of change, does not have a overall over supplied phenomenon associated with it. So you have to look at two things; In your specific real estate what leverage do you have to a deal and at what terms. And then secondly, outside of basic shopping center leasing, where else do you have to grow? What other ways do you have to grow? And if you can't answer those two questions, then you've got a growth problem. We don't have that issue. And that's a big deal. So, the last couple of questions have been about all those. Think about this for a second. We have a 0.5 million square feet of sign off of deal that are going to create over $23 million of NOI over the next couple of years. They're locked. That's a lot of pizza shops and TJ deal, dry cleaners and stuff. That's a pretty good down payment on future growth. And that's because of a vision of the overall importance of place that has been a 20 year or longer on view for us. So what you say it's, of course, it's a risk, it's a risk to the entire industry and you have to look at what you have to negotiate against that. And I think we've done pretty well. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Jeff [ph] of Bank of America, your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Justin [ph] on for Jeff this morning. First is congrats on a good quarter and solid year. One for Dan, we saw portfolio occupancy tick down a little bit in fourth quarter, both sequentially year-over-year. Can you just drill into what happened in the quarter and then second, just from a guidance perspective, where you sit today, how should we expect occupancy to trend over the next four quarters? Dan Guglielmone : Yes, sure. I mean, occupancy, as we reported, December 31 documents of 2017 versus December 31, 2018, overall occupancy was pretty stable over the course of the entire year from an economic perspective. And so while you saw some point in time to point in time demission, I think that that was part of it. I think in the fourth quarter we were hit with a little bit of some bankruptcies on a smaller level that led us down a little bit over the course of the quarter. That's a bit of the color that we could kind of point to. I would say that with regards to some of our small shop, I mean, which trended down a little bit as well, a lot of that is driven by the de-leasing activity we've got going on at Sunset and Coco. Without those two properties, our small shop would be about 150, 160 basis points higher. So, I think it's a little bit specific to kind of some of the redevelopment that we're doing within our portfolio with regards to some of those trends. But I would expect over the course of 2019 occupancy and lease rates will be fairly stable. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks. And then, Don, sorry if I missed this, but any updates on the Primestor JV? I'm curious that these assets are meeting your internal expectations so far. And if there's anything you've learned there from this venture that you might be able to integrate into the overall core portfolio? DonWood: It's very, very good question. And the short answer is, yes. I mean it's been a really good experience all the way through. Jeff's on the phone. Jeff, can you take Primestor on this? JeffBerkes: Yes. We've been up and running for about 18 months now with the Primestor folks and we're meeting our projections on what the property produces in the way of NOI and leasing velocity within the portfolio. And if you look at some of -- we had a small bankruptcy at G stage. We were able to backfill those spaces very quickly at better around. So operationally I think everything is going well with the JV. Jordan Downs, as Don mentioned, is our first new investment with them since formation. Everything there is on track or 75% leased with our boxes in place and focused on leasing are a small shop space right now. So that's on track as expected. So I think everything is going well. In terms of are we learning anything that we can apply to our greater portfolio? I don't know, Don. You might want to chime in on that. I'd say probably not, but again, we haven't been in the JV that long and there was a lot of heavy lifting up front of course, when you form a relationship like that. So, I would expect there'll be some nuggets as the years go on that we're able to extract. But Don, what do you think? DonWood: Yes, I think the word nugget is right. Remember we did this deal with Arturo and Primestor because they did things like us. I mean, if you go to a number of their properties, [indiscernible] is the one that comes to mind most, you'll see a lot of importance on place. A lot of importance on the mix of tenants and that's kind of what got us together in the first place. So, we are aligned in the way we see things. There'll be nuggets that come out going forward that'll go both ways. I'm sure, but not at this point. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from of Vince Tibone of Green Street Advisors. VinceTibone: Good morning. I'd like to drill down a little further on the comparable property NOI growth guidance. I'm just trying to bridge the gap on how to get to the 2%. Because you mentioned occupancies, expected be roughly flat this year. We spread in, contractual rent bumps are, it seems like that would imply something greater than 2%, just hoping you could provide a little clarity there. Dan Guglielmone : Sure, sure. I think that kind of our core portfolio overall, we'll see kind of decent growth along with some of the proactive releasing activity that we had in 2018, kind of really reaping the benefits into 2019, kind of getting us north of 3%. So you're right from that perspective. But there are specific things in the portfolio that will weigh on some of those numbers. One, some of the late year bankruptcies that impacted the fourth quarter. We'll see that carry out through 2019. So that that'll be about a 50 to 60 basis point drag in our forecast for the year in terms of some of those kind of below the radar impact from bankruptcy. And then also I mentioned the redevelopments at [indiscernible] Huntington, Congressional, great pieces of real estate with what we're doing and kind of cash flow over 2019 as we do that, long-term we're creating value and you'll see higher rents and higher property operating income over the long-term there and value creating projects. So again, similar to our proactive releasing activity, this is more of the same but you know just on a larger scale. VinceTibone: One quick follow up there so just -- is the redevelopment contribution going to be negative then just looking, it look like you only have a, you know a few smaller projects that stabilize in 2018 that would contribute to you know comparable property an ally and if you're rolling in 2019 as well. So you know given that 80 basis point drag, is the overall contribution to next year's growth negative from re-dev? Don Wood : Well, we look at kind of re-dev and development kind of in the same thing I think that you'll see some balance there. I think you'll see some small contributions from re-dev perspective in terms of what's on page 16 of our 8K. I think you'll see continued contributions from these 2 roll up of assembly from 2018 to 2019 as well as [cross talk] Yes, so I think you'll see yes, based upon you know that redevelopment you know there will be drag from redevelopment during that -- on our comparable number. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Dan, just hoping to get you know maybe a few of the items how we should think about for the AFFO adjustments there like you know recurring Cap Ex number how that might trend this year versus last year? Dan Guglielmone : I think we expect you know when we look at kind of you know the going from AFFO TO AFFO, it will be pretty consistent I think with 2018 numbers you know after you know our free cash flow which is really AFFO you know less dividends should be pretty consistent. We're still projecting as I mentioned free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital to be pretty consistent get us into that you know call that $80 million plus minus range in terms of -- we expect our AFFO payout ratio to be pretty consistent with what we have in 2018. Nick Yulico : Okay, helpful and then Don I just want to return to Santana Row and the future office development opportunity there you know I mean all the stats on the market out there show and you know shrinks, new supply you know competitive new supply continues to get leased and there's less of it available so I guess I'm just wondering you know do you have a like it does a company have an internal time frame on you know sort of go or no-go on the office there? Since you know and then whether you know we should think about you know the separate you already have this 320,000 you know office versus the million square feet across the street you know whether there's like separate decision making on that or you could just launch you know everything once if the market receives[ph] you think the market strong enough? Don Wood : Yes, let me -- it's a great question. You know I mean cycles, right? So as we sit and we look at Santana we very much would like to make a decision the first half of 2019 as to whether we're going forward with the first 350 that is where the building across the street from Santana that seem to be in the West. That is the next thing up. You know we haven't even delivered Splunk yet and it will be delivered by the end of the year and hopefully this year might even go into next year we'll see how that plays out but other than Splunk we've got you know it'll be the go-no-go on the 350. You'll see that the decision soon this year because the market is as strong as it is. It definitely weighs into our considerations we know the -- you know queries we've been getting about office on that site. We know that they're strong; we know we've kind of proven it with Splunk 1, Splunk 2, AvalonBay chose to bring their offices there with us. Our 1st office building has been a complete 100% lease with great rollups there. So we know we've got an office environment that we've created there that will be successful so you know to the extent that market softens as it surely will at some point over the next 5 or 6 years. We don't want to be in that position then so there is a definitely a desire to get it done and get it going at least part of it in 2019. Operator : Thank you. Our next call comes from the line of Darek [ph] of Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst : Are you seeing an uptick in interest or signing leases or additional leases with online native retailers and are there any examples are you seeing proof of concept regarding long term viability there? Don Wood : That's a great question in terms of long term viability too early to say but I can tell you that we've had some real good meetings and are doing some pretty good deals with digitally native brands. Coming over whether we're talking about Casper, parachute home or all birds or any of those guys. Now you know all that is good and it's you know demand -- an increasing demand in that type of properties that we have that's clearly a positive. Now whether those brands are you know will be great brands for 10 or 20 or 30 years. Time will tell. We'll have to see. Its why the diversity of the income stream is the most important thing in that decision making process but clearly many -- all would be too strong many of those digitally native brands who just 3 and 4 or 5 years ago said I'll never have a brick and mortar place have gone a reversed course that way. And yes that with the type of properties we own where our natural recipients of that demand. Unidentified Analyst : And just switching gears a bit I know there are no dispose provided in the guidance. But you guys are out there in the market. Any idea of how many assets are currently being marketed and you know the demand profile you're seeing in the private markets and how they're performing and basically are Cap rates coming in at your expectations or what's the delta? Dan Guglielmone : If we're in the market as Don mentioned 2 assets you know we expect them to kind of hope to get into that $125 million range in terms of proceeds and you know it's an ongoing process I think we're -- you know I think that right now with regard to those prophecies you know sales prophecies you know coming in at our expectations we'll see whether or not we get them done but yes, no I think for our assets we're seeing relative stability of demand for them and no surprises so far. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Collin [ph] of Raymond James. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks good morning everybody. just in the prepared remarks the tone seemed to be pretty upbeat about maybe getting some acquisition opportunities to the finish line this year anything else you can offer us or expand on those comments at all this point and maybe just generically should we think about that -- those opportunities that your presume maybe having redevelopment component based on some of your prior activity is that a fair way at least to think about that? Don Wood : Let me jump on that for a bit because it's so funny when Dan and I were talking about what to do for you know prepared remarks. You know we want to talk about acquisitions because we do have some things that are close. The bottom line is when we do acquisitions we want to make sure that there's an opportunity to create value. We've never been a volume shop as far as I'm concerned we never will be a volume shop and it's harder to buy today and assume that rents are going up but it's not you know 2006 anymore. So that kind of leads us to say what we do primarily will have some sort of a redevelopment component to it. It's what we do best doesn't mean we're not looking for under market rents. Of course we're looking for under market rents but it's hard to find that. So you know you'll see some acquisition activity from us this year. It'll probably be relatively minor but you know mostly because our best use of capital is in the places that we've already created and we have incremental things to do at them that is the on a risk adjusted basis. Clearly, the best thing for us to be doing which is why you know you see that development pipeline so full but one of the things we never want to be is the one you know one trick pony and so you know on that, on the acquisition side you'll see the occasional acquisition. It will most likely be part of some strategic plan to either add an adjacency or do something to it to be able to create redevelopment value. Unidentified Analyst : And then just going back to Derek's question on disposition activity. Can you guys just touch on the Atlantic [ph] sale on fourth year? Don Wood : Sure, we closed on a $27 million grocery anchored center and you know pricing was kind of in the mid-60's, kind of taking that with a blended basis bar you know. Chelsea Commons residential you know we were in the mid 5's on a blended basis on those 2 you know kind of what we view as non-core at the end of the day just kind of -- and so that's the color on that. I mean I think that.. Dan Guglielmone : The demos are to light there for us and it came as part of a package I know 10 years ago maybe even more now that includes a number of assets and that was one of the lighter demos. It was a good area. It is a good area North [indiscernible] but it is what it was they were light and so when we looked at you know what we'd be able to do there in the future we said nothing. And had the ability to tax shelter which is what we did and that's what it got sold. Operator : I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Leah Brady for closing remarks.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to jump back in queue. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our first quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everybody. Some noise in this quarter supported earnings as the adoption of ASC 842, the new accounting standard on leases, produced FFO per share by $0.02 in the 2019 first quarter to $1.56. More on those impacts in Dan's comments, but let's talk about results before implementation of ASC 842. FFO per share was $1.58, excluding the accounting change, compared favorably with $1.52 recorded in last year's quarter, up 4% and comparable same-store income grew 3.5%. Leasing volume was a little light, as it usually is in the first three months of the year, particularly after our record fourth quarter last year. With 72 comparable deals done, for over 247,000 square feet of space, at an average rent of $45.07 per foot, a solid 10% higher than the $41.03 being paid by the previous tenant. As you might expect we have the most success meaningfully increasing rents of those shopping centers that have been or are well are logged in being redeveloped and repositioned for sustaining their market-leading position. Properties like Brick Plaza where Trader Joe's just signed to backfill an old Ethan Allen furniture store to nearly finish up the complete merchandising of this dominant shopping center. Or EastGate crossing in Chapel Hill, North Caroline were an A1 location, plus a recent renovation creates strong demand and higher rents. Or Bethesda Row, where four more -- four new deals signed during the quarter saw a strong rent increases even with prior rents on those deals that range from $59 to onward now $110 per foot. We got other examples where we will roll back rates but nearly always for the solidification of the merchandising base to create long-term value. Our eyes are on 2025 and relevance at that point in time. Those few examples serve as a pretty good microcosm of the shopping center leasing environment for us today. The bar has been raised on the product and place being offered. And the importance of a strong location has never been more critical to a retailer's decision. We hear that from retailer after retailer. In our experience, it's not about retailers choosing inferior locations with lower rents to grow their businesses, but rather consolidating around the shopping centers that give them the best chance of making money. We're certainly well positioned on that front. In the oversupplied, overall, market condition means using all the tools in our toolbox to consistently and sustainable grow earnings, after all it is about growth. Having lots of tools to generate earnings and value, is a true competitive advantage. Now one such tool is a fairly negotiated lease with a strong landlord dais wherever possible. Those strong contracts are an invaluable tool of value creation particularly when a tenant fails, or an integral -- in our integral part of our business. Economically profitable lease termination fees are a direct result of that. Let's talk about one of those this quarter. In the second half of last year, Lowe\u2019s announced that it was shutting down its 99 Orchard Supply Hardware stores, including our very productive unit in San Ramon, California and Crow Canyon Commons. When we first put in Orchard Supply, we successfully negotiated a full guarantee from parent company Lowe's, unusual at that time, and no sales kick or other way out of the lease given the strength of our real estate. Accordingly we're in an extremely strong position to negotiate a termination fee of nearly 3.5 years of rent or $3.8 million which was paid this quarter and is included in income. We fully expect to have that space re-leased at comparable or better per square foot rent within one year, clearly a strong economic outcome even when considering the capital that will need to be invested. To make a specific point about this fee, because of its size and to reiterate the strength of our leases as an integral part of our business plan, other lease termination fees totaled $1.6 million in the 2019 quarter compared with $1.9 million in last year's quarter. Now, lease termination fees over the past few months have certainly impacted portfolio occupancy as the overall quarter and lease rate fell to 94% from 94.6% at year-end and 94.8% a year ago. Three closures accounted for that decline including the aforementioned Orchard Supply termination at Crow Canyon, the closing of Brightwood Career Institute at Lawrence Park Shopping Center along with the post-holiday closing of Bed Bath & Beyond at Huntington Shopping Center. With the restriction that both Brightwood and Bed Bath had at Lawrence Park and Huntington Shopping Center now gone, redevelopment plans not just re-leasing plans are underway for significant value-add and redevelopment at both of those shopping centers and we have strong tenant interest. It's a real benefit to control real estate in markets where economic redevelopment is a viable strategy, couldn't feel better about the long-term value creation at those three assets. So let's talk a bit about our future growth generators and let's start with CocoWalk in Miami. It's going to be a great project. Construction is on schedule and on budget with delivery about a year from now. Two-thirds of the new office space is now leased as is nearly 75% of the entire project. Uses like a fully renovated Cinepolis Theater, great well-known local restaurants -- restaurant operators and fitness, health and beauty along with apparel round out the merchandising are the perfect amenity for the new Class A office. Desirability of Coconut Grove is a really attractive place for the year-around Miami professionals to live, work and play continues to get better and better. We see it in the local schools, in the hotel, in the housing development and certainly in the traffic counts. You might remember that we've invested in half a dozen individual retail buildings in Coconut Grove that were also re-leasing at a barometer -- as a barometer for demand in rents. When complete, we expect to have roughly $200 million invested throughout Coconut Grove and obviously including CocoWalk, generating over $12 million annually with strong growth prospects about $70 million of value creation. Next, you'll notice that we've added through our 8-K disclosure a new Santana Row office project across the street at Santana West. You can see the renderings on federalrealty.com or santanarow.com. The 360,000 square foot 8-story office building hopefully the first of two or even three on this 12-acre site in total for one million square feet will be built spec with construction to start later this year and deliveries to tenants beginning in 2021 and continuing into late 2022. The decision to move forward spec was not made likely, but it's pretty clear that the floor of the fully amenitized Santana Row community was instrumental in our previous success, attracting office users here and that the unmet demand for big 50,000 square foot floor plates in environments like this continues unabated with very little new supply coming on during our delivery period. Basically, we believe this sites adjacency to Santana Row is a huge-risk mitigator as is our balance sheet and resulting in a lower cost of capital. The initial investment on this site will approximate $300 million, though roughly $50 million of that will support parking and infrastructure for future development. Construction costs are up a bunch since we started 700 Santana Row, so our underwriting -- underwritten stabilized yield is in the 6% to 7% range. We hope to be at the higher end of that range we will see, but in any event creating $75 million to a $100 million in value. Phase three construction projects at both Assembly Row and Pike & Rose continue on schedule and on budget and both communities continue to mature and cement themselves as importance staples in their respective communities. Leasing on the office components of Phase 3s are generating lots of interest at both locations. You will remember that we announced Puma as the anchor tenant at Assembly and that we Federal Realty will be the anchor tenant at Pike & Rose as we consolidate our headquarters there. And we continue to get closer to other deals. We're looking forward to having many of you join us for our Investor Day next week on May 9 in Somerville, Mass, where you can see for yourselves the progress being made in the Assembly. And finally you may have heard that last week, our team working in close conjunction with city officials in South Miami, Florida was successful in securing entitlements at Sunset Place that allow for a significant increased activity -- density on our site there, a unanimous vote in our favor by the city. Those entitlements which contemplate a hotel, residential and commercial GLA with total roughly 900,000 square feet. The new entitlements are just the first step, but an important one in evaluating viability of a meaningful change to the obsolete retail center that stands there today. There are also subject to an immediate 30-day appeal period, but clearly the land under the Sunset Place become a lot more valuable with those developments. At Federal, and at our partners Grass River and the Comras Company, we are extremely grateful to the communities leaders who worked tirelessly with our team to advance their city with this very important first steps. Stay tuned. And that's about it for my prepared remarks for the quarter. Let me now turn it over to Dan for some additional color and then open the line to your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don and good morning. Let's start with a quick review of the numbers for the quarter. The $1.56 of reported FFO per share was a couple pennies above our model and in line with consensus. The numbers in the first quarter were driven primarily due to lower property level expenses and a strong quarter for term fees most of which were already reflected in our guidance. Offset by noise around, the new lease accounting standard and more drag from our redevelopment remerchandising initiatives at properties both in the comparable and non-comparable pools. Adjusting for lease accounting on an apples-to-apples basis, FFO grew 4% for the quarter. Our comparable POI metric came in at 3.5% for the first quarter, ahead of our expectations heading in. Term fees, positive gains from our proactive re-leasing activity and expense savings all contributed to the strong metric. While term fees drove the metric by over 200 basis points, keep in mind the result was accomplished in the face of almost 100 basis points of drag from repositioning programs at some of our larger assets in the comparable pool, like, Plaza El Segundo in L.A. and Huntington in Long Island. Now to the new lease accounting standard ASC 842. Don highlighted in his remarks the new lease accounting standard, which was implemented effective January 1, impacted our results by $0.02 per share. ASC 842 had several aspects, which will impact our earnings moving forward, as well as require modest changes to the presentation of our financials. Let me walk through some of those components which will impact the numbers. The first is the treatment of leasing cost, which we have talked about over the last few quarters where previously we were able to capitalize certain leasing costs, which will now have to be expensed. The second is revenue recognition, including our straight-line accounting policy. Federal has always taken a conservative approach to assessing collectibility of straight-line rents and we will continue to do so moving forward. However, this new standard no longer allows partial reserves and requires revenue to be recognized on a cash basis in certain circumstances. This change resulted in a modest hit to Q1 earnings. And lastly, on our balance sheet with respect to leaseholds, where Federal is the lessee, operating leases will now reside on the balance sheet as operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, effectively increasing the balance sheet by $75 million. Capital leases have been reclassified as finance lease liabilities. Neither of these lease liability changes will have any impact on our income statement. ASC 842 also impacts presentation of our income statement. Those impacts are detailed on Page 11 of our 8-K supplement, as well as in our 10-Q. Speaking of our 8-K financial supplement, you may have noticed a slight increase in the cost of our development project at 700 Santana on our development schedule. The project scope was expanded to include a complete renovation of the Plaza in front of the new building at the end of Santana Row for a total of $5 million. We will receive more rent from the tenants on the Plaza so there is no impact or projected return. We also pushed out the timing of when we will begin to recognize straight-line rent from response at 700 Santana from 4Q of 2019 to 1Q of 2020. However, there will be no delay to build and completion, or to the commencement of CAF rent later in 2020. Now on to the Capital Markets. We closed on 10 additional condos of Pike & Rose during the quarter and have an additional eight condos under contract bringing our total to 88 of 99 units sold are under contract. Almost done, and still ahead of our underwriting. On the non-core disposition front, we are in contract to sell one of our Maryland assets for $72 million, a low-to-mid six cap rate and we expect to close later this quarter. We also had conversations ongoing for an additional $150 million to $200 million of potential assets sales. Initial indications show pricing including the aforementioned Maryland sale at a blended mid-5s cap rate. While we don't expect all of these conversations to open the lid result of the transaction, these active discussions provide further evidence of strength in investor demand for our noncore assets. On the acquisition side, in late February, we closed on a small acquisition in Fairfax County for $23 million. Fairfax Junction an oldie and CBS-anchored assets, which we knew simply as an attractive risk adjusted capital deployment with redevelopment potential down the road. This transaction is a direct result of us opening a regional office in Northern Virginia and adding boots on the ground in the market, a great start to the initiative with more to come. We continue to target additional opportunities in Northern Virginia, as well as in our other core markets and hope to have more to report in the coming quarters. Now onto the balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 5.4 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remains at 4.2 times and our weighted average debt maturity remains near the top of the sector at just over 10 years. During the quarter we raised $69 million of common equity for our ATM program at an average price of $135 per share. Even with our $1 billion plus in process development pipeline, our A-rated balance sheet equipped with the diversity of low-cost funding sources, leaves us extremely well positioned to execute our multi-facetted business plan and continue to drive sector leading FFO growth over the next few years and beyond. Next is guidance. We are leaving the range where it is at $6.30 to $6.46 per share. We're also leaving our annual comparable POI growth estimate at about 2%, despite the good start this quarter as we still have a lot of 2019 left to go. Please be reminded that on a apples-to-apples basis adjusting for the lease accounting standard this guidance range reflects FFO growth of 2.5% to 5% versus 2018. And with that, we look forward to seeing many of you in Boston next Thursday for our Investor Day at Assembly Row where you will have an opportunity to take a deep dive into the components of our diversified business plan as well as see first-hand the breadth of our management team including the next generation of talented Federal Realty. Today's is the last day to register, so please contact Leah if you haven't signed up and would like to attend. With that, operator, you can open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey good morning down there. So two questions. First, can you just talk a little bit more about the office at Santana West? Your thoughts on going spec versus getting an anchor lease and then what you're thinking about as far as the demand mix for type of tenant? Are you looking for one user? Are you looking for maybe just two large-scale users or small users just some sort of thoughts on how the project your envisioning in? Jeff Berkes : Sure Alex. This is Jeff. Thanks a lot for the questions. First off we're very excited about getting going on one Santana West. It's going to be a great building. As John said eight story, it's all concrete which is unique in the valley 13 floor heights, nice big floor plates, great outdoor space, good parking, and you can walk across all in the row right to Santana Row. So, it's going to be really, really cool building very efficient and we're excited to get going on it. As you know the office space at Santana Row has been hugely successful. We leased up 500 and 700 quickly once we started construction. All the rest of the space we have there stays virtually 100% leased. Whenever we lose a tenant, we backfill the space very quickly. So, we're really bullish on the office space in and around Santana. The market is in an interesting place right now. There's still significant job growth in Silicon Valley. The bulk of that job growth as you know is from tech tenants. And obviously most tech tenants are office-using jobs. So, there's a lot of demand. And right now quite frankly there isn't lot of supply. I think the development pipeline under construction right now is six million feet or so in Silicon Valley and 80% of that is pre-leased. And there is not a lot in the pipeline. This will be one of the few buildings that gets delivered in this window and one of the only buildings that has Santana-Row-type amenities to go along with it. And that has really become a requirement for getting office space leased today in the valley. So, I think our timing is very good. Or desire of course is to do a single building user. It's more efficient. Usually end up with quicker lease start -- rent start. So, that's our goal. Once we get the building underway, we'll see how things are going in the market. And if we're not able to achieve that we'll start to break the building later in the construction process. So, I think that covers both parts of your question, but let me know if it doesn't. Thanks again. Alexander Goldfarb : Jeff that was incredibly thorough. And then the second question is just going to the lease term fees north of 200 basis point in the quarter obviously was a lot but maybe I didn't pick up any nervousness in your tone about more credit watch list tenants or more trepidation in the future. So, maybe you could just talk a little bit about with this -- because it sounds like generically across retail land first quarter was a cleanup but most of the companies feel like they are looking at better prospects heading forward in the year. So, maybe just a sense of what you guys are expecting? Or if there's maybe still some residual concern on the part of landlords that maybe things look fine now, but maybe as we progress in the year there is another batch of tenants that are going to experience difficulty later in the year? Don Wood : Yes, Alex look it's a new time. And I think this is frankly the new normal in terms of the next few years. And so you don't have nervousness from my perspective in terms of lease termination fees as you know. What this -- the entire mindset here is to get this portfolio and make sure that this portfolio is relevant and consolidating if you will. Being most important retail sites, we think we got the best real estate in 2025. I am not particularly worried 90 days -- for every 90 days I can't be. Because then I'd be nervous worried about this guy or that guy. But the real estate is really good. And so to the extent we've got in any quarter a lease termination fees that are a big number or a small number -- here again we're laughing. We'll go out on a limb for you. The first quarter of 2020 will probably be weak in terms of comparable same-store growth. How about that right? Because it works both ways. This is part of the business. I would expect this to continue not necessarily in the size of the number. It depends on what we've got. We're certainly trying to get the most when there -- the tenant trying a leave and I think the continuation of this should be what you should expect. To me, the point is economically getting a bunch of money from a tenant because of a strong lease that can't be replaced for incremental cash over that period of time. It should be something that's applauded and that's what we're trying to do. Jeff Berkes : Yeah. Let me just take onto that a bit, Alex. Wendy and I and our leasing teams are aggressive about getting lease term fees, right? I mean, we could have let Lowe sit in the space of Crow Canyon pay the rent. They were good for the rent. But I want to control that space, and I want to put somebody in that I want in the center. And we're confident that we can replace the rent, so why not go after a big lease term fee. And that plays itself out daily when we're talking to leasing people. It's part of our business plan. And we're aggressive about it. So yeah expect to see more. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the comparable NOI growth guidance of 2%. I mean, if you exceeded that in the first quarter and lease term fees helped that, I guess it implies that you could be below 2% for the rest of the year. And so maybe just talk about how we should think about the quarterly moves in comparable NOI growth? And kind of what's driving some of the \u2013 the rest of the years slowing? Dan Guglielmone : Yeah. I think \u2013 we still have three quarters left to go. So there's still lot of 2019 to kind of come across. In terms of where we see trajectory of quarter-by-quarter, we'll be below trend in both the second and third quarter is what our expectation is where we'll probably be in the kind of the 1% range for second quarter 1% range for third quarter and we'll above trend in the fourth quarter. And it's just too so even with good start to the year for us to be kind of changing kind of our expectations for the annual metric. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Just second question is on Bed Bath. Are there any other closings contemplated in the portfolio besides Huntington? And if you just talk about your exposure to expirations over the next few years there? Thoughts on how much of that space Bed Bath might give back? And the type of tenant that you think is looking \u2013 would look to backfill that size space? Dan Guglielmone : Yeah. Let's do this a couple of ways. First of all, don't expect any further closings from them this year and next year. But that company has brought in a firm to negotiate the real estate deals, which to me is always a \u2013 it's just certainly rough on the business plan of the existing team. I'd like to be running real estate when somebody comes in from the outside. So I don't like that. I don't think that's a good thing. Having said that, our leases are strong in the particular place in Huntington, what it affectively does for us in Huntington is a really good thing. I mean that shopping center sits directly next to one of the highest performing malls certainly on the islands and what \u2013 Simon just did a beautiful job renovating. That opens up a site for us. There is one or two others. We'd like to effectively get back because the demand we've got for that space, and I don't really want to talk as we are somewhere relatively advanced with somebody there I don't want to mention it right now. But you can imagine, if you've got that size of piece of land adjacent to one of the mall then you're not particularly worried about creating value at that shopping center over the long term. In terms of some of the other places that we have Bed Baths or the gap for that purpose or anybody else who is trying to figure out how they are going to play in the future. It comes down to the real estate. And for us at least losing a tenant of that size while it hurts in a quarter as it certainly did in this quarter for us don't forget how much it un-restricts the real estate going forward which gives us more options than we would otherwise have. Wendy, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? I am sorry go ahead. Nick Yulico : No, no. Thanks. That's helpful. I guess just to be clear. I mean, how should we think about the expirations that are coming from Bed Bath in your portfolio over the next couple of years? How many expiring leases are going to pop up? Don Wood : You see nothing more in 2019 nothing in 2020, four coming up in 2021 and then a few each year from there. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Don Wood : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. I want to discuss the new office building in Santana Row and the parking ratios. So you have lot 1,750 parking spaces kind of implies if you use it in one in play for parking space, 205 square feet per employee. I know it's not perfect like that. But just how do you think about how much parking to put there? And would that have been different if you built this thing five years ago? Jeff Berkes : Good question Ki Bin. It's Jeff. The 1,750 parking spaces includes a big garage at the back of the side that will support not only one Santana West but two Santana West. So we're building a little bit more parking upfront than we need, because we have to the way the construction works for the second building. The parking ratio in Silicon Valley is driven by the market. And the market is three per thousand. So, when we have both one and two Santana West up, we'll be part of three per thousand. Ki Bin Kim : And is there something different about how you build parking garages today. Just getting ready for a world where there is less kind of own or used cars? And is that change at all how you build those parking structures to give you optionality? Jeff Berkes : Yeah. We're more in favor of flat floors than ramped -- parking on ramps. That's generally what we execute. And these two buildings just dive a little bit further into the weeds. They will have one per thousand parking below the buildings. So, if you're an Executive and higher up in the company, you can pull right under the building get on one elevator and go directly to your space. That's how we parked 700 Santana Row as well. And then, the other two per thousand are in a structure in the back of the site. So, down the road, I don't know, 20, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, whatever it is. If you don't need more than one per 1000, the parking garage could come down and we could put something on the back of the site that's revenue generating. So we think about things like that and flexibility when we're running out our projects but... Dan Guglielmone : Yeah. That's an important point Ki Bin. I mean, it costs more obviously to go on to that building a little bit. It costs more to build a structure, not per se, but it could the way we're laying it out with flat floors to be able to have that flexibility. But the notion of being able to park it solely on the footprint of the building would be a huge advantage. Because if we are able to ultimately take down that garage behind or convert that garage into a moneymaking office building or other use area, it would be hugely beneficial. So, it's smart thinking relative to today with tomorrow on mind. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. And then just going back to the Bed Bath & Beyond question. I noticed that -- obviously last one store, but the rents you're collecting from Bed Bath & Beyond dropped 9%. And similar for Ascena you lost one store, but the rents you're collecting seems to have dropped 8.5%. So is there something else going on in the mix? Don Wood : Well, the Bed Bath & Beyond store that we lost was relative to our other stores of higher rent payer. Dan Guglielmone : And that was certainly the case there with Ascena. Wendy Seher : With Ascena, the location that we lost was -- that we really didn't lose. We negotiated to replace with Lane Bryant and Huntington is a situation when we took a space we split it, and then we leased it to from a merchandising standpoint two strong tenants between Chipotle and America's Best. Don Wood : With the disproportionate rent can you say? Dan Guglielmone : That was driven by northeast where basically we did a short-term hunt to kind of fill -- we've already released that space to another tenant at about the same rent, a better merchandising play. So that was the bigger -- the biggest mover, and that's at one of our centers in Philadelphia. Ki Bin Kim : So, it wasn't like you had to give rent release to five other boxes. Dan Guglielmone : No. Ki Bin Kim : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys. Good morning. Don, in your opening remarks, you talked about retailers' desire to focus on the debt center here. If I look at your leasing stats, your leasing cost in particular, they are basically double what they were for -- what they were almost in all of 2018. I know it's only one quarter and this stuff can be lumpy but, can you just talk about the added cost here to defend and invest in your assets in the current environment we're in. And therefore, should we expect to see a higher level of cost in the near term similar to what we're seeing here? Don Wood : It depends on the quarter Jeremy. You're looking at -- don't extrapolate this over the future in a big way. We did 247,000 feet this quarter and more than double that in the fourth quarter. So first of all, you're talking about a couple of specific deals. And on the couple of specific deals that we did, they are all in the case of reinvesting and repositioning them for the future. So it would be part of not all are in the redevelopment schedule, because the merchandising is not necessarily on our redevelopment schedule. But it's all about getting rid of tenants that we don't think will be around and tenants that and placing them with tenants that we think will be really strong in the 2023, 2024, 2025 time frame. So that's what you're doing there. Again, smaller volumes so bigger impact of just a couple of deals this time. Don't refer there to the math. Jeremy Metz : Okay. And then, just going back to the last question here that was asked. It was asked on a couple of specific tenants, but just generally can you talk about any sort of activity on the modifications from what you're looking at here, as you just looked to reposition to your point on looking further down the road. How active are you on taking some further modifications just to tee those up for bigger repositioning in the next couple of years? Don Wood : Very active. It's our overall perspective of the environment. I mean this -- the last business I ever want to be in is, hey look at me. My rents are the cheapest and I can get another 10% or cheaper rent. I don't want to be in that business. We can't be in that business. We're in the business of consolidating the best properties in the marketplace. And that means, I mean, the last way I want to compete is solely on rent. I don't want to be able to compete on a better place of that tenant to be able to make money. So we go through property by property by property, places we can't figure out how to get that done. It's part of the list that Dan gave you in terms of dispositions. Before luckily, it's not a big part of our company, but there are certainly some and we're working through on that. Any other place Jeremy that we've got an active way to proactively go in and solidify the shopping center for the next five years we're doing. Those opportunities avail themselves along the way as tenants do fail. That's the environment we're in today. That's why you should expect lease termination fees. That's where we are. Take a look at the real estate and figure out whether you believe that real estate is going to be worth more in five years or less in five years. No capital that we're spending that we believe is being flushed down so that the property will be worth less in five years. And that's a fundamental important distinction between this business plans and others. Jeremy Metz : Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. Your line is now open. Samir Khanal : Hey, Don. I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about the kind of the overall leasing environment. Obviously, you had some impact from closures like everybody else in the industry, but sort of -- as you sort of think about the pipeline and the activity level, how would you maybe stack up the pipeline today versus a year ago? And kind of the mix of those tenants? Don Wood : Well you know Samir, this is -- it's funny. I'm always accused of being the most glass half empty guy in the room and I can't help that. It is about making sure that protecting that downside and setting yourself up for the future. There is no doubt in my mind. And I'm looking over Wendy if I finish this because I want her to jump in out here that that there isn't a property that we are spending capital on in the markets that we're in where we don't have significant demand from tenants. Now the clear notion of just trying to backfill a big box with another big box user is not something we really want to do. We don't really see that as the future. And so that's a generalized comment. It doesn't pertain to any particular tenant, but there will be times. We are clearly trying to create boxes or spaces that work for five and seven years and out. That does mean smaller in a lot of markers that we're doing. It does mean capital in terms of splitting or reconfiguring space that there. The way we look at that Samir is to the extent we believe that that will create a growing stream of income. Again with the cost of our capital in their figures in all the way through for the next five years we're going to do it. So it is a disruptive time. I don't know anybody that I talked to on either the retailer side or on the private developer side that doesn't recognize that this retail leasing environment is one that is harder than it's been in prior cycles or prior times. A lot of what I see kind of has leverage on the side of those retailers who certainly will try to renegotiate everything kind of the Bed Bath example is a good one that we talked about before. But what do you have on the landlord side to battle that. And I don't know anything that's more important than the location and the ability for that tenant to create value to create profit in that space. I will take that all day long over my rent is the cheapest as the way to get somebody in. So that's kind of what we see. Samir Khanal : Thanks, Don. And then. I'm sorry? Wendy Seher : I just wanted to add that from a global perspective, as we are in the trenches and kind of having these discussions with retailers it is disruptive, but we're seeing that it provides us opportunities to strengthen the merchandising which again goes hand-in-hand with that number one criteria of location. It seems to be most important. And as I look at it globally, I also I'm looking and listening to deal volume activity, conversation and that is still strong within our properties. So I feel comfortable that we are able to get after these. It might take a little bit more time than we would want to on a -- especially when we are looking at it on a every 90-day basis, but in order to create the merchandising we want we were getting the activity and the categories I think are still strong. Samir Khanal : Okay. Thanks for the color. And then Don I guess just sticking to the subject I mean, we know we've got ICSC a month away and -- I mean kind of what are you thinking about sort of accomplishing there? And is there any kind of initial thoughts and maybe any sort of themes that could emerge this time around? Don Wood : The way we use ICSC, Samir is really to showcase our large developments where we have those big opportunities effectively to do stuff. We will be talking little bit about Sunset. We will be talking about CocoWalk, for example down there in a big way. We will be talking about those shopping centers that we're trying to reposition. So we always kind of, seen it with those big opportunities. And then we have our entire team there and that is all about the blocking and tackling of getting deals done. At that's our focus. That's always our focus underneath the highlighted ones that we like to show and that's where we will be this year. I don't expect that to be different. Samir Khanal : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open. Christy McElroy : Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the lease term fees just some clarification question. So the $5.4 million this year versus the $1.9 million last year is all of that associated with the same-store pool? And then if I think about the 200 basis point or so additive to the Q1 growth rate if that is all associated what's the full year impact expected to be versus the 2% same-store guidance? Because I know that you're also facing some tough comps in Q3 given that you had a lot of lease term last year. Don Wood : Yes. I think most of the term fees are in the comparable pool. There was maybe one small that was maybe $100,000 of it was in the non-comparable pool. And in terms of kind of big picture, look this year is expected to be another year of -- we had $7.7 million in term fees last year. I think we expect this year to have a -- probably a comparable number of term fees. Maybe we'll do more or less. But what's interesting is that as a percentage of the size of the company while this is -- these seem large on a relative basis if you look at it in terms of the size of the company, it's kind of in line with our kind of 10-year and 20-year history in terms of where term fees have been over the last 20 years. The average has been around $4.5 million over the last 10 years kind of in the $5.5 million to $6 million. It's not unusual. We are growing almost $1 billion revenue company. And the term fees represent even with a strong year like we had last year and we expect this year it's still less than 70 basis points to 80 basis points of our revenue base. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then I guess, just for the unconsolidated hotel JVs that sort of lost some partnership line at least from what I can tell that EBITDA component of that is pretty minimal currently. Just maybe bigger picture would you expect this to become more of a positive contributor over time? Dan Guglielmone : Absolutely, Christy. You open up new hotel there is a ramp. And in both cases both performing well relative to expectations, but not performing in any meaningful -- contributing any meaningful cash flow. We certainly expect both of those hotels to be contributing meaningful cash flows as we move forward as they mature. We're going to be talking a lot about that not necessarily the hotel per se because it's small, but in terms of the maturation process of these big projects on Thursday. And I think we'll show you some pretty enlightening stuff of what happens over the periods of time that will give you some confidence that that will continue to grow. Christy McElroy : All right. Thanks. I will see you next week. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Derek Johnston : Hey, good morning. Thank you. You guys have had a good run year-to-date and trading pretty close to NAV. So how do you think about funding development, redevelopment via increased ATM action or even equity issuance given the attractive cost of equity versus further nonsale of noncore assets? Dan Guglielmone : Yes, look we got as we like to say multiple arrows in our quiver of low cost funding sources. The A minus rating that we have gives us the lowest cost to capital from a debt perspective. As we're continuing to grow we grow FFO. We grow EBITDA we are creating leverage-neutral debt capacity. So that's clearly the biggest source of incremental capital that we have. We're generating in the range of $75 million to $100 million given the size of our company, free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital. And I think that the balance between accessing the ATM when our stock is trading at attractive levels like it was this quarter with rates down and balancing that with tax-efficient asset sales where we can redeploy that capital into our business our development and redevelopment is a powerful capability that we have. And we'll continue to have that balanced approach to how we fund our business. But we can fund over the next three years without any need for additional capital just through free cash flow leverage-neutral debt capacity and our asset sale tax-efficient asset sale pool $1 billion plus pipeline over the next three years. Derek Johnston : Okay. Great. And any further color on Sunset in regards to the entitlement win? And definitely congrats, it's a big deal. Given the increased construction cost and delayed timing has your thinking or vision for this site changed as well as development yield expectations? A \u2013 Don Wood : Well yeah. Certainly over -- and I think I'd mentioned this in past calls. Certainly over the three years or three-plus years that we've owned the property, I mean everybody knows what's happened in the retail world. Everybody knows what's happened with structural cost associated with it. So it does make it tougher. On the other hand, my goodness this is a good piece of land. It's a great piece of land actually, and getting these entitlements through to really its hard see that if you're not there and don't kind of see it. I don't know how familiar you are with the site to imagine how transformational this will be to an entire local region effectively between Coral Gables and South Miami and even parts of Miami like Coconut Grove. It truly -- I mean what is designed is really pretty cool. We are tweaking it. There is no doubt that we are tweaking it, because we're not looking at the same type of retail mix. We clearly are changing the mix a little bit in terms of what we see between residential and the hotel and the retail. And maybe even a little bit office as we look at it. So, all of that's in play. But as of last week, it is not just a theoretical exercise anymore. It is something, and so therefore we are down and dirty into trying to figure out how we can really change the environment for those South Miami residents and everybody around it. There is a possibility we can get something good down there. Derek Johnston : All right good stuff. A \u2013 Don Wood : Thanks Derek. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Mike Mueller : Hi. Good morning. You mentioned asset sales of potentially $160 million to $260 million or so. Is there anything reflecting or contemplating that you could take in the back half of the year for acquisitions? A \u2013 Dan Guglielmone : Well, we don't factor in kind of acquisitions or dispositions as we know with regards to our guidance from that perspective. We did acquire an asset during the quarter a small one. We are planning to close kind of towards the end of this quarter with a $72 million disposition. I think we're going to continue to be opportunistic, try in and get some of that $150 million to $200 million of conversations over the finish line, at attractive pricing. And we look to be opportunistic on the acquisition side as well. We'll see what comes down. A \u2013 Don Wood : Yeah. Mike I'd add to that. I mean there are a couple of things we're looking at now. I mean, there are always a couple of things that we're looking at. But there's a couple that we're looking at, and actually have me interested at the moment. So whether we get over the finish line, or actually get stuff done that way. Look when you're sitting you look at all of the economics between acquisitions and development, redevelopment et cetera. Redevelopment is number one. Development is number two, and acquisition is number three. It's how I would rate it today. But that's a global comment. And within that, there are places where that chronology changes a little bit. So, I wouldn't be surprised if you show us some acquisitions. I don't know whether it will be second half of this year or earlier into next year or whatever. But don't think we're blind to it. We're not. Q \u2013 Mike Mueller : Great, okay. That\u2019s it thank you. Operator : Thank you\u2026 A \u2013 Don Wood : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, folks. Two questions, one on the leasing front I think it's about 40% of the leases that have been signed by Federal in the last three years or so or new leases compared to I think it's about just 15% for all your peers. What drives that gap? Is it just presentation? Do you guys exclude option exercises from your activity? Or is it more of a philosophical difference at least you do a preference for churning your tenants more? A \u2013 Don Wood : No. There is no question. And I feel like I have been repeating myself a bunch today. So I'm going to work on my articulation a little bit Jeff. But we are all about creating the right merchandising for the future. It's not just about renewing failed concepts or average concepts. If we got better real estate you should be able to create -- to attract new tenants for a new economy for a new consumer set of behavior. And so, it's been actually a goal effectively of ours. And so it doesn't -- that's -- what you said is true and not surprising at all. In fact I think it does show the differences in how we approach creating value in real estate. I don't know what the option exercise answer is in terms of whether we include them or not to Jeff's point. A \u2013 Wendy Seher : We don't include them. A \u2013 Don Wood : We do not include option exercise. So, I guess that factors in a little bit too but that's the big point Jeff. Q \u2013 Jeff Donnelly : Okay. And just maybe a second question is for you Don is that where are you with your, I think it was Decentralization 2.0 plan? I mean where are you at putting in the place the structure and personnel to achieve I guess that next stage that you're looking for? A \u2013 Don Wood : Just about done, just about done. The Northern Virginia office we're in temporary space now. But we'll be in permanent space in the next couple of months. The other team has moved over there. So from the decentralization of Washington D.C. for example, just about all set up. In terms of New York and Boston completely set up. In terms of the West Coast as you know for a long time completely set up. Our next question will be what are we doing in Miami? And do we want a full-service office there? How do we want to look at that? So that will be one of the things that -- that piece of it is certainly not done. I was very anxious to see what happened down at Sunset. Very anxious in spending some more time in South Florida which we do view as a very attractive market, particularly with some of the tax law changes and the attractiveness of Florida that way as it relates to northeast, so interesting. That's the piece of it that's not done, the rest of it's done and put in place basically. Q \u2013 Jeff Donnelly : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Reuben Treatman : Hi. This is Reuben on for Tayo. Just have two questions. What would be driving comparable POI growth to close to 1% in 2Q and 3Q before it rebound in 4Q as was described earlier in the call? A \u2013 Don Wood : I think it's just going to be kind of timing of anchor box kind of refill and kind of going through some of the churn and some of our anchors over the course of the year, and just tough comps particularly in the third quarter. I mean that will be kind of I think the two of the main drivers of the second and third quarter, but below trend metrics that we expect at this point. Q \u2013 Reuben Treatman : Got you. And then I guess additionally, can you give an update on your tenant watch list? A \u2013 Don Wood : With regards to tenant I mean -- look we keep our eye on. I think a lot of us with the same names, a lot of peers are. And one of the things that is -- the peer ones and models of the world where the kind of the first quarter kind of new names to the list in terms of kind of being -- kind of about the forefront. We don't have a lot of exposure there. We have some. We've got five peer ones, represent about 15 basis points of revenue. We've got four models. They represent about 13 or 14 basis points of revenue. So not a lot of exposure, but it is something we do keep an eye on. I don't know Wendy if you got any others that are kind of bubbling up for the top of the list, but -- yes I think it's the same list that a lot of our peers have just generally. Q \u2013 Reuben Treatman : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Q \u2013 Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I'm returning to shops in the Sunset Place. I notice the occupancy went from 74% to 66%. Is this you preparing the site for the retailers? And maybe could you talk through a little bit about the NOI that may have to come offline as you get more serious about the project? A \u2013 Don Wood : Yes. There is no question about it that obviously this period of stagnation if you will in terms of what was going to happen certainly uncertainty at Sunset over the past three years is not exactly what a retailer wants to hear in terms of his or her ability to get re-up. What I love about Sunset is the anchor system. So when you look at a really strong performing AMC there, when you look at couple of the other entertainment uses that company put games on for one when you look at all these fitness and how well they do their and most importantly the parking garage which is incredibly valuable as you can imagine. They are not only for tenants at Sunset Place, but we actually lease out to medical uses that are in the area. We've got a good basis, but the rest of it is very good. And so Craig, you've seen this way on us over the past three years, we're not -- it's not done well enough. There is no question about it. It will continue to deteriorate until we are able to effectively do the new deals and new merchandising that would be part of a plan. So expect continued deterioration in 2019 and probably '20 over 2019 also. A \u2013 Dan Guglielmone : We did a very good job over the last few years since we've owned it of maintaining reasonable, relative occupancy there. We saw kind of first the floodgates open a little bit in the first quarter particularly on small shop where we left another 30,000 square feet of small shop tenancy there. It has been as Don said, weighing on us over the -- since we bought the asset in terms of occupancy levels. If you back out Sunset from our small shop metrics on the occupancy side, on the lease percentage side, it weighs on us 150 basis points. So we'd be 150 basis points higher on the lease side and a 120 basis points higher on the occupied side on the small shop. It's Sunset but not part of it, so a big big drag to those metrics. Q \u2013 Craig Schmidt : Well with potential entitlements coming that's going to totally change the trajectory I guess of the project. So good luck on that. A \u2013 Don Wood : Thanks Craig. When it absolutely changes, is the value of the piece of land itself obviously which has already happened. Q \u2013 Craig Schmidt : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Leah for any closing remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you in Boston next week. Please reach out any questions you have about registration on Investor Day. Thank you. Bye.

These documents are available on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everybody. Continuing to reliably grow bottom line results, despite headwinds remains our focal point and the second quarter didn\u2019t disappoint. FFO per share of $1.60 compared favorably with our internal expectations, the Street, and $1.55 recorded in last year\u2019s quarter. Growth over last year\u2019s quarter was 3.2%. The 30th consecutive quarter of increased FFO per share, excluding of course, a couple of debt prepayment charges over that time. No excuses, just bottom line growth. Comparable property income grew at 3.5%, largely the result of some big rent starts from proactive re-leasing initiatives like Anthropologie, Bethesda Row, Muji on Third Street Promenade and Bob\u2019s Furniture at Los Jardines with a little help from lease termination fees. Lease termination fees are clearly increasing, if not in number than in amount as numerous retailers are re-evaluating the business plans, and in some cases negotiating out to a plethora of reasons. When it\u2019s economically advantageous for us to engage, we do. When it\u2019s not, we don\u2019t. Lease termination fees were $2.2 million in the second quarter compared with $1.6 million in last year\u2019s second quarter, and contributed 45 basis points to the comparable property income number. Sometimes the comparison, which includes all sources of property level cash flow in all periods presented, is positive, sometimes it\u2019s negative, but it\u2019s always an integral part of our business plan and clear demonstration of the strength of our contracts. Lots of deals done in the second quarter, in fact, at 113 new and renewed leases for comparable space more than we\u2019ve ever done in any three-month period before. There is clearly pressure on pushing rent overall, but overall, we\u2019re having pretty very good success. Those 113 leases represented 379,000 square feet at an average rent of $42.68 a foot, 7% higher than the $39.75 being paid by the previous tenant. As you might expect, it had the most success meaningfully increasing rents as those shopping centers have been or are well along in being redeveloped and repositioned for sustaining their leading market position. Properties like the Assembly Square Power Center, where the success of the adjacent Assembly Row mixed-use community has clearly increased its value. More to come on that power center in the coming quarters by the way. Or Coconut Grove in Miami where the anticipation of a completely new CocoWalk is translating into higher rent, net of capital at both the redeveloped property and in the adjacent neighborhood. We got other examples, where we\u2019ll roll back rates, in fact, more examples than in any time since the 2009, 2010 start timeframe, but always for the solidification of the merchandising base to create long-term value at the shopping center overall. Those examples serve as a pretty good microcosm of the shopping center leasing environment for us today. The bar has been raised on the product and place being offered and the importance of a strong location has never been more critical to a retailer\u2019s decision. We hear that from retailer after retailer. The G&A spike in the quarter is substantial at about $3 million, roughly half of that, $0.02 a share, is due to the accounting change this year effecting the capitalization of leasing cost, while the rest of it is attributable to strategic investments in our people and in better and more efficient computer systems. So let\u2019s talk a bit about future growth generators and a quick update on CocoWalk, Assembly Row Phase III, 700 Santana Row, Santana West and Pike & Rose Phase III. First of all, and importantly, all five remain on budget and on schedule with the possibility of increasing scope and profitability at CocoWalk, if we can find a way to get to the left side of the center earlier than we had anticipated. We\u2019ll know by next quarter. That\u2019s good news there. All five are well underway with Santana West just recently so, and require nearly $1.2 billion in total capital over the next three years. Dan will talk about how well the balance sheet is positioned to handle that in a few minutes. So the initial $80 million-or-so of annual incremental cash flow to come from those investments will break out roughly as $55 million from office tenants, $15 million from residential tenants and $10 million from retail tenants at these already established mixed-use communities. Splunk\u2019s full building deal, PUMA\u2019s North American headquarters, Regus' Space concept, Boyne Capital\u2019s CocoWalk lease and even Federal Realty\u2019s new headquarters serve as a great foundation on the office side. On the retail side, strong pre-leasing at all projects gives us confidence that we\u2019ll be enhancing the places that we\u2019ve created and nurtured and unabated demand for residential product at assembly, all serve as confidence building indications of our continued success at these 5A+ locations. By the way, and certainly worth recognizing that the Boutique Hotel that many of you stayed in during our Investor Day in May, the Row hotel at Assembly Row was just named one of the best hotels in the world by travel and leisure. The ranking was based on the hotel\u2019s location, service, facilities, food and overall value. Pretty cool, and representative of the type of quality that we aspire to. Okay. Well, what else? What\u2019s new? Darien in Connecticut. Our investment committee and Board approved moving forward with $115 million mixed-use redevelopment to our Darien shopping center. The plan calls for a newly merchandised 120,000 square foot ground floor retail environment with 122 rental apartments above. Groundbreaking is expected later this year with stabilization in 2023. We expect to yield at or better than 6% cash on cost and create a hugely upgraded place directly at the Noroton train station in this affluent suburb. As more than a few of you on this call are quite familiar with this location, we expect that you\u2019ll monitor our progress closely. At San Antonio Center in Mountain View California, some of you have seen from public documents that we have an agreement to sell under the threat of condemnation to the Los Altos California school district roughly 11.7 of our 33-acre San Antonio shopping center for $155 million. That 11.7 acres will be the site of a new school that will be financed by the municipality primarily with public bonds. We paid $62 million for the entire 33-acre shopping center at about a six cap four years ago. Please let that sink in, in terms of what that says about the implied land value and tech-centric Silicon Valley. We won\u2019t be able to keep the entire $155 million as it is our responsibility to use a portion to ultimately pay out existing tenants on the site, who will be displaced by the new school. As we\u2019re in active negotiations with those tenants, we won\u2019t estimate that payment at this time, but it will be significant. Closing on the $155 million is expected late this \u2013 late this year. In terms of acquisitions and dispositions, we\u2019re getting more active. During the second quarter, we closed on the sale of both Free State Shopping Center in Bowie, Maryland to a private buyer and a 4-acre portion of Northeast Shopping Center in Philadelphia to Grocer Lidl for combined proceeds of $80 million. We also expect to close in the third quarter on the sales of two California assets for a combined proceeds of nearly $70 million. So all totaled, that\u2019s about $150 million disposition proceeds below a six cap being deployed in identifying acquisitions and developments with far better growth prospects. On the acquisition side, we\u2019ve got a few deals tied up and in due diligence phase, in our existing markets on both the East and West Coast for a combined $250 million, one of which is in the Primestor joint venture. Closings on all are expected later this year when we will be able to go through detail and rationale more completely assuming due diligence goes as expected. We\u2019re very excited about those opportunities. And that\u2019s about it for my prepared remarks today for the quarter. Let me now turn it over to Dan for some additional color and then open the line to your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and good morning. I\u2019m going to change up my usual order of things and start my remarks with Federal\u2019s dividend. At our Board meeting yesterday, we increased our dividend, again, by $0.03 to $1.05 per share per quarter or $4.20 per share annually, roughly a 3% increase. That marks the 52nd consecutive year of increasing dividends at Federal. Let that sink in. Federal has been increasing its dividend every year since 1967, at a compounded annual growth rate in excess of 7% over those 52 years. That\u2019s through economic cycles, the ebbs and flows of retail, recession, hyperinflation, I could keep going. This level of consistency in growth is exceptional and unparalleled in the REIT sector and points to the critical importance of driving bottom line growth year in and year out, no excuses. But now let\u2019s move onto the balance sheet. From a capital structure perspective, we are extremely well positioned to fund our roughly $1.2 billion development pipeline as we move ahead to execute on the growth-focused and diversified business plan that we outlined on our Investor Day in early May. Our credit and liquidity metrics are as strong as they\u2019ve been in years. At quarter end, our net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 5.1 times versus 5.4 at 1Q. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is up to 4.4 times versus 4.2 at 1Q. We\u2019ve extended our weighted average debt maturity to 11 years. We had nothing drawn on our credit facility at quarter end and we had over $100 million of cash on hand. And I would like to note that we achieved these improved leverage levels without raising any common shares during the quarter. As we\u2019ve outlined previously, over the long-term we intend to keep our credit metrics in line with our A-rating with net debt-to-EBITDA below 5.5 times over the long-term and fixed charge coverage about four times. As you can see, we have organically created meaningful excess financial capacity. We managed the balance sheet to position Federal to outperform throughout the cycles we inevitably face in our business. As Dan \u2013 as Don outlined, we successfully executed an $80 million of asset sales during the quarter with another $70 million under contract blended at a cap rate in high fives. Including the expected net proceeds from the San Antonio Center condemnation sale expected by year-end, and the balance of our condo sales at Assembly and Pike & Rose, we have the prospects for roughly another $100 million of net proceeds, which combined with the executed and under contracted positions totaled roughly $250 million in net asset sales for 2019, which would bring that blended cap rate down below 5%. This activity meaningfully enhances our sector-leading cost of capital and materially derisks our roughly $1.2 billion development pipeline. As I just mentioned, we continue to successfully execute on the sale of condos at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose. Of the 221 total units, 210 have closed with another seven under contract, leaving just four units left to sell, further demonstration of the strength of both of these signature mixed-use projects. We\u2019re also active on the debt Capital Markets front recently, opportunistically issuing $300 million of 10-year unsecured notes at 3.22%, paying off our $275 million floating rate term loan that was coming due in November. Further, in July, we recast our unsecured revolving credit facility increasing its size from $800 million to $1 billion, extending its ultimate to maturity with options out until 2025, while also reducing the interest rate spread and lowering the cap rate on our borrowing base. Our capital structure could not be better positioned. A quick review of the numbers for the quarter highlights the record setting $1.60 of reported FFO per share, which was $0.01 above consensus. The numbers in the second quarter were driven primarily by continued benefit from our proactive leasing activity, lower real estate taxes and demo expense and another solid quarter for term fees, offset by higher G&A and continued drag from our redevelopment and remerchandising initiatives of properties both in the comparable and uncomfortable tools. As Don mentioned, our comparable POI metric came in at 3.5% for the second quarter as well as for the entire first half of the year, well ahead of our expectations. Net benefit from proactive leasing activity boosted the result by a 135 basis points versus 2Q 2018, and was better than we had forecast. We had a modest boost from term fees of 45 basis points. We also had a tailwind from Mattress Firm bankruptcy payments of 40 basis points. Although let me highlight that we also, again, faced headwinds of almost 85 basis points of drag from the repositioning programs at some of our larger assets like Plaza El Segundo in L.A. and Huntington on the round. As a result, with another strong quarter, we are increasing our forecast from about 2% to a range of 2% to 3%. With respect to FFO guidance, we\u2019re affirming our range of $6.30 to $6.46 per share. Let me add some commentary here. I just wanted to remind you all that the timing of the start of straight lining rent of 700 Santana has been pushed back into the first quarter of 2020. We discussed this point on the last quarter\u2019s call. However, there is no change in the actual cash rent start, which remains in the third quarter of 2020. Given the additional opportunities on the west side of CocoWalk that Don alluded to, we expect additional drag versus our forecast at CocoWalk for the balance of the year. Plus, we will have some modest dilution from the $80 million of asset sales completed and the $70 million under contract, which we expect will close in 3Q. This will be roughly a $0.01 or $0.02 of dilution, which was not reflected in our initial guidance. Let me comment on G&A, which was up for the \u2013 during the second quarter. However, there were some one-timers in there. We still expect G&A to run at $10 million to $11 million per quarter per our initial guidance in February. Before I turn the call to Q&A, let me build on one of the points I alluded to earlier in the call. The fact that we have grown FFO per share for 30 consecutive quarters, and the fact that our guidance reflects annual growth in FFO once again, which will give us 10 consecutive years of FFO growth, this consecutive consistent focus on bottom line growth by management is what drives Federal\u2019s performance to the top of our sectors, specifically versus our peer group, the Bloomberg Shopping Center Index. Over the last three years, FFO growth per share has exceeded our peers in the index by 8.2% per annum. Over the last few years, that bottom line growth represents 6% per annum outperformance over 10 years of 7.7% higher FFO growth. Over 15 years, the numbers are similar. Other metrics, while instructive, simply shouldn\u2019t matter as much. And with that, operator, you can open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Alexander Goldfarb : Just few questions. First, certainly appreciate the leasing comments that you guys talked about, but maybe you could just address a few of your tenants and how you\u2019re thinking about bad debt to the balance of the year, notably obviously Bed Bath\u2019s been in the news over the past few months. And then iPic has just come in the news recently for potential bankruptcy. So how are you guys thinking about bad debt year-to-date versus budget and what are you thinking of for the balance of the year? Dan Guglielmone : I think bad debt kind of is playing out consistent with what our guidance was at the beginning of the year, Alex. I think that we\u2019re probably getting hit a little bit less than I think that we had forecast. But look, there\u2019s a lot of news out there and we\u2019ve got some caution outlined for the balance of the year just because some of those tenants that you alluded to. But I don\u2019t think we expect any near-term impact from a tenant like Bed Bath & Beyond at this point for the balance of the year and even into next year. Don Wood : I will tell you Alex, though, when you raise iPic, it\u2019s obviously a name that\u2019s been swirling around for months. We have had proactive other companies coming to us for that space. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have any issue there to the extent it does happen, hope it doesn\u2019t, hope they work through it. And also I do think it\u2019s a great product, but again, in that real estate I know you know that well, that won\u2019t be \u2013 if it is vacant from them it won\u2019t be vacant for long. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question, Don, is just on thinking about Fresh Meadows you guys have talked about densifying with mixed-use residential. Clearly, a change of rent regulations here in New York. So just thinking about have you guys are thinking about the residential \u2013 your residential plans if those have changed for that asset? And then just more broadly speaking you highlighted the Santana \u2013 I mean the San Antonio condemnation. Is your view that some of these projects where you had sort of land banked may increasingly others may look at those or your plans may change as municipalities change regulations? Or you guys feel pretty comfortable with residential fresh matters or your longer-term redevelopment plans at San Antonio? Don Wood : Yes. Let\u2019s talk about both those things. They\u2019re very different obviously. First of all, in Fresh Meadow, Queens, we\u2019re not at all developed in terms of a plan, what that plan would be, how it would be priced, how it would be entitled, all of that. The point of all that discussion at \u2013 or that piece of the discussion at the Investor Day was simply to identify something that we have identified and are looking at hard to be able intensify the use on it. Obviously, it\u2019s an amazing piece of land to be able to do that. How specifically that will happen is in the early stages of development. So whatever happens with rent control or anything else in New York, will play into that conversation in the early stages, not something that has to be retrofitted later on. So more to come in time but put in the back of your head, if you wouldn\u2019t mind. In terms of San Antonio Center, look, there are a few areas that this country where economic activity is simply off the charts. Obviously, Silicon Valley is one of them. Obviously, Boston is another. Yes, that\u2019s great that two of our largest investments in total are in those two markets. Things happen on great land in markets where demand exceeds supply. And I\u2019m not trying to give you an economics 101 course, but that\u2019s what that is. And with the amount of people that are moving that need to be educated in the primary school system, look, Los Altos needed a place. They couldn\u2019t find what they wanted. They went through effectively with their neighboring town of Mountain View, a threat of condemnation and that means market value. And market values are a whole lot more than what market value used to be, none of that stuff shows in any of Federal Realty\u2019s financial statements or cost basis company like every other company. But when you\u2019re in places like that, that \u2013 while that particular one is exceptional, the general concept of land being worth a whole lot more than what we paid for is not unusual. And that\u2019s really what I\u2019m pointing to. Whether that happens again or not anywhere else, I don\u2019t know, but it certainly factors into what it is that we \u2013 how it is that we feel about future investment on \u2013 in our properties. Operator : And our next question on the line is going to be from Christy McElroy with Citi. Christy McElroy : Don, just on Darien and I\u2019m obviously one of those people that\u2019s going to be checking on it as the train passes. Will Stop & Shop be part of the new 122,000 square feet of retail? Or what do you envision for the retail there? And maybe you could provide a little bit more color on what makes that redevelopment complex given the location adjacent from the metro stop. I thought I heard something about upgraded fleets? Don Wood : Yes. Let\u2019s \u2013 I cannot tell how excited we are about this, Christy. And particularly because we\u2019re trying to serve you, your neighbors and your community. Basically, what \u2013 Stop & Shop will be not be part of the long-term deal there. We were able to cut a deal with them to have them leave, which obviously causes us dilution as that happens, again, proactively re-leasing. But I know I\u2019ve shown you and walked you through Wildwood Shopping Center at the corner of old Georgetown and Democracy here in Bethesda. And I know I\u2019ve talked to you about the economics, which are tremendous at Wildwood and that\u2019s because it is a community-oriented high-end or higher-end lifestyle, if you will, type center that we see amazing similarities to in terms of demographics and other factors at Darien. So that Equinox at Darien will remain there and it\u2019s in the middle right now being completely redone as part of our deal here. You\u2019ll see a Walgreens here. You\u2019ll see great restaurants here, I hope, you\u2019ll see some cool shops and you might see, we\u2019ll see, if we get there or not, a specialty grocer, just like Wildwood. If that\u2019s the case at a train station directly at Noroton, which by the way, is going to be completely redone and rebuilt by the town of Darien, which is just awesome in conjunction and along the same timing of what is it that we\u2019re doing. If you think about it, your community is going to feel a whole lot different. The 122 apartments above does make that different than a Wildwood, those apartments will all be parked underground on a tray underneath so that the retail and that ground-floor place will be all surface parked, which is just as convenient as it gets and the suburban community like Darien. So I hope that\u2019s enough for now. I\u2019ll absolutely share the plans and some of the pictures of what this is going to look like as we go forward next few weeks, but we\u2019re really excited about getting underway late this year. Christy McElroy : That\u2019s helpful. I look forward to seeing the changes. And then Dan, I think you had originally expected closer to 1% same-store growth in Q2 and Q3 obviously in light of the new range, how are you thinking about Q3? Are you still expecting somewhat of a dip there? And then just a follow-up on Alex\u2019s question with regard to the bankruptcies and credit loss, I think you had originally had an expectation for 50 to 60 basis points of known bankruptcy impact and then another 100 basis points of bad debt reserve. How has that changed with the new guidance? Don Wood : Christy, before Dan talks, I just want to make sure that you\u2019re clear that it\u2019s not same-store growth. But this is comparable POI. That\u2019s a different concept that includes other stuff. I just want you to know that, I know you\u2019d like to make it comparable to everybody else. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s our metric. Dan, please go ahead. A \u2013 Dan Guglielmone : I think, just to give you a little bit of color on some of the components there, I think we did outperform. Some of it is \u2013 was timing bringing forward, some of like demo expense was pushed out a quarter. We had other things that were pushed into the quarter. So you\u2019ll see a little bit of yielding on our same-store growth over the course \u2013 on a quarterly basis of the balance of the year. Probably something with the one handle in the third quarter is what we have \u2013 what I currently have in my model. And something in the kind of the \u2013 with a two handle, maybe a high two handle in the last quarter, fourth quarter of the year in terms of the trajectory for the balance. I don\u2019t see really any difference in terms of the impact, I think on bad debt. Or what we had with regards to unexpected vacancy, rent relief, and so forth, we did have the late impact in fourth quarter of last year from bankruptcies that remains with us. As we\u2019re working to release some of those spaces, making progress, but it\u2019s slow. And we\u2019re also, I think getting hit kind of the way we expected. Bad debt is coming in kind of as we forecast. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see much difference in how we see that playing out for the balance of the year. Operator : And our next question on the line is going to be from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Craig Schmidt : I wonder if you guys have had any conversation with Hudson Bay? And I\u2019m thinking about Bala Cynwyd Lord & Taylor and what is the opportunity if, in fact, the Lord & Taylor division gets set down? Don Wood : Craig, it\u2019s Don. I don\u2019t want to go into the deals that we\u2019re talking about at that \u2013 with Hudson Bay at this point. We are talking. We are working through that deal. It is \u2013 that piece of land certainly is a wonderful place for us to do more than is there. There is no question about it. It\u2019s high up on our list. And we do need to make sure that we are squared away with the leaseholder on that site before we talk about what is that we\u2019re going to do. Rest assured in this portfolio, it is one of the most underutilized pieces of land in the very urban environment, if you will, as it sits right in lower Merion, directly across in City Avenue \u2013 or onto the avenue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisers. Vince Tibone : I\u2019ve a few on the lease termination fees, were you expecting to receive this level of term fees at the beginning of the year or is there some unexpected tenant fall out? And then also to the extent you can discuss, could you provide the retailers, the merchandise categories causing the fees? A \u2013 Dan Guglielmone : Sure, Vince. So let\u2019s talk about this in a couple of ways. First of all, the \u2013 don\u2019t make the direct distinction that a lease termination fee is always a failing tenant. There\u2019s a whole lot of reasons, particularly today. And this is what I do see. More than it used to be. There\u2019s a whole lot of reasons that companies are taking a pile of their money and effectively allocating it to use to reposition the businesses. So I\u2019ve got a \u2013 there\u2019s couple in here from a good size \u2013 from a restaurant company that is getting out of the Washington, D.C. market. And that \u2013 I find that one particularly interesting Vince, because here is the case where a company grew and today it seems to me \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m right or wrong on this, but it seems to me companies are more willing to allocate money and pull the plug out of regions or parts of their business that they want to change. Whereas, maybe a few years ago, they worked through it a little bit more even if it wasn\u2019t working out as well as they can. I \u2013 there seems to be more of a feeling, from my perspective, and that\u2019s really a subjective thought to be able to move some things out. So yes, I do think we\u2019re seeing more of that. Now do we have to deal with them? Depends. Mostly, no. Because mostly, our contracts are really strong. And if you sit and you look, I \u2013 let me give you a statistic that I think you\u2019ll find pretty interesting. Over the last 18 months of all the lease terminations that we\u2019ve agreed to and by the way, there are many that we have not agreed too. So we didn\u2019t do them, right? But of all that we agreed to, we\u2019ve leased up nearly three quarters of them at this point, okay? It\u2019s \u2013 now we\u2019re talking about $9 million of lease termination fees. And effectively, given a pass to $4 million, almost $5 million of rent out of that. Now we\u2019re replacing it with more rent, and those termination fees, therefore, equate to more than 18 months of rent that\u2019s going away, more rent with capital still makes sense incrementally going forward. There are other lease termination fees where that wouldn\u2019t be the case and we won\u2019t engage in those conversations. So I hope that gives you a little more kind of color around what is not just about a failing tenant, it\u2019s really about changes to business plans that almost every retailer and restaurant company is going through today and more \u2013 and in my view at least, more likelihood to be able to throw money at it to get out of contracts. Vince Tibone : That\u2019s really helpful. One follow-up on that is I would just say kind of in general when a tenant requests to leave early, what percentage of the time would you say you work with them and reach an agreement versus forcing them to carry out the lease? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. I don\u2019t have a percentage. I don\u2019t know the answer to that question. We don\u2019t have a policy. We have a how to create value on real estate mantra. So effectively as we look through each one of those, we consider what choices are, where the backfills are, do \u2013 are we able to now get it \u2013 the spot. I mean, Stop & Shop at Darien is really a great example. Certainly, if all we cared about was comparable POI, we certainly wouldn\u2019t be taking out that Stop & Shop before the 2024 lease expiration. We can get at it and do something about it, we\u2019re willing to have that conversation now. So every one of those is different. And I kind of \u2013 when I listen to sometimes the conversation, which makes it all sound simple and straightforward, I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s reality. Vince Tibone : Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jeff Donnelly : Good morning, guys. First question actually on a specific asset, one is, it\u2019s Queen Anne\u2019s Plaza, actually near me. You guys have a chunk of excess land behind that property and I think it\u2019s been marketed for outparcel development, but I\u2019m just wondering is there an opportunity on that site to put residential behind this shopping center or is it really strictly zoned to retail? Don Wood : First of all, Jeff, congratulations. That is absolutely the first question in my 21 years hearing about Queen Anne Plaza. Thank you for asking that. Well it\u2019s funny that you ask it. Because we\u2019re looking and whether the numbers can work or not, we don\u2019t know yet, but there is excess land. And importantly, there is a community \u2013 there is a township there that would be very interested in us to incrementally invest. But again, it\u2019s got to make sense, it\u2019s got to \u2013 from a \u2013 from an IRR perspective, it\u2019s got to work. And I don\u2019t have an answer to you that \u2013 to that yet. But I love that you asked that question. Jeff Donnelly : And maybe as a follow-up, even more broadly, is \u2013 what\u2019s the reaction of municipalities? And I know it\u2019s probably case-by-case, but what\u2019s the reaction of municipalities these days to redevelopment and densification? I know you don\u2019t have many centers facing the same issues that maybe some of your cousins like in the mall factor are facing but nevertheless, you\u2019re probably speaking to the same types of counterparties. Have you found that planning and zoning boards have been more flexible or creative in fee change, as a way to protect and improve their tax base or are you finding that some of these municipalities are somewhat resistant to change? Don Wood : Yes, and yes. When I asked the \u2013 when I answered Vince at Green Street a few minutes ago about the standard answer on lease termination fees and I couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s even harder to give a standard answer with respective to municipalities and how things work out. I mean, I can give you an example that you\u2019re well aware of in Somerville, Massachusetts, where it\u2019s been an incredible partnership. And I can probably give you an example on Rockville, Maryland where it has not been an incredible partnership during the same type of economies, today, years ago, and in between. So it really does depend \u2013 what I will say is it is absolutely critical that \u2013 it was critical for us, I don\u2019t about everybody else, but for us it really was critical for us to decentralize the company to make sure that yes, we maybe paying a little bit more in G&A, but effectively an answer to your question unless you\u2019re local, unless you were right there, unless you got those relationships that you can build on and you\u2019re not some big outside national company that is faceless, it\u2019s really hard, really hard to get what \u2013 the entitlements that you need and the help that\u2019s necessary from the community in which you\u2019re trying to do business in. So I know it sounds like a little bit of a cop out as an answer, but it really is true. It is very dependent. And, all you can do is make sure you\u2019re as close to the real estate as you possibly can be. Jeff Donnelly : Great, thanks guys. Operator : And our next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeremy Metz : Thanks. Don, a big differentiator for the company is obviously the mixed-use centers and the various other sources of revenue you\u2019re driving. As we look at the comp POI, I think those non-retail uses are a little under 10% today. It\u2019s obviously growing the challenges, the average in retail, they\u2019re well understood. You talked about them in your opening remarks. I was hoping you can maybe talk about the growth outlook for those other sources. We\u2019re seeing some solid recovering in residential rent, so as we think about your comp POI this year, the 2% to 3% we think about 2020, it seems like those other revenue drivers can really increase in terms of impact on that comp POI figure. Any color there? Don Wood : Yes. I \u2013 well, first of all, let\u2019s put it this way, Jeremy, the \u2013 we spent a lot of time on exactly this point during Investor Day. I really would love to sit and \u2013 I don\u2019t think you were there, you might have been listening in, but I would love to spend time and get to have you fully understand this. Absolutely, on the big mixed-use projects, we happen to be in the phase, in the decade or a decade and a half long period of time that it does to do this stuff. We absolutely are in the phase where we are \u2013 where we\u2019ve created the place on the ground floor. We\u2019ve often started with residential above that ground floor for the 1st-phase. And now it\u2019s about filling in around the place that we\u2019ve created. And it\u2019s likely that the filling in is in search of daytime population, which means office. And so if you look at Santana Row over the almost two decades, period at Santana Row, where we are today clearly is adding more office particularly in that market. We\u2019re not adding office to run away from retail. We\u2019re adding office to supplement the place, the 24/7 place that we have created. And the same applies to Assembly and the same applies to Pike & Rose. You\u2019ll see \u2013 so sure, there will be more of those uses. Sure, our comparable POI is about the entire company minus things that are in and out \u2013 not as acquisitions and dispositions and things that are specifically being redeveloped. That\u2019s it. It includes all the rest of it. All the company, GAAP, we\u2019re not making selective decisions on what goes into that. So that\u2019ll be what it\u2019ll be, but I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re running away from retail to resi or office solely. That\u2019s \u2013 those are parts of our mixed-use developments and just where they are in the 15-year gestation period of us building them. Jeremy Metz : Appreciate that. Definitely wasn\u2019t suggesting that, just more highlighting I think an important differentiation here for you guys. And so just anyways as the second thought for me San Antonio you did mention having to pay out some tenants. It sounds like that will be going away here. So how should we think about that from an NOI perspective in terms of kind of a lost NOI from that center? Don Wood : Yes, clearly, when we get a term fee we lose the income, so. Dan Guglielmone : San Antonio center. Don Wood : Oh, San Antonio Center, okay. San Antonia Center, we\u2019ll lose income from the tenants on the 11.7 acres. That will be when we sell the asset. Dan Guglielmone : So let\u2019s put it this way, Jeremy. $155 million, the lost income is below a two cap. As we pay out what we think we\u2019ll have to pay out, it\u2019ll still be extremely creative. I don\u2019t want to give you numbers because we are negotiating. And \u2013 but they\u2019ll still be incredibly accretive. So great news in terms of the value. But yes, there\u2019ll be NOI loss there just like there will be for Darien in Stop & Shop and some other things we\u2019re going to tell you about over the next couple of quarters. But to us that\u2019s okay. Jeremy Metz : All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : I was wondering if can you talk a little bit about the dispositions you\u2019ve knocked out so far this year, what may be on the plate and what the interest has been, how big the buyer pools have been, have you been getting multiple offers, just kind of what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re selling the assets? Don Wood : Yes. I\u2019ll give you a basic and Jeff and Dan can just jump in wherever they feel like. Free State, for example, which was the most significant one that we\u2019ve actually closed on and sold. The buyer pool was way shallower than we had hoped. And that\u2019s a giant-anchored shopping center in Bowie, Maryland of some size, but it\u2019s not one of our best shopping centers. And the interest at cap rates, with which we would not sell that asset was very strong. The interest at cap rates that we would sell that asset was very thin. And I do think that\u2019s somewhat of a change over the past couple of years. Similarly, on assets that are extremely well located, boy oh boy, there is not only been no deterioration, I actually think there\u2019s been some coming in a little bit. There\u2019s certainly one that just traded out in Santa Clara County, Campbell that traded at one big old number out there. So it really depends on the asset, the type of assets from my perspective. The smaller assets have some \u2013 have more interest in them, they\u2019re more easily digestible, more easily financeable, et cetera. And so that \u2013 that\u2019s kind of a third bucket, if you will, of differences. Jeff or? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. no, I think like I think, pricing for us though, despite kind of \u2013 each process is very different, but I think, we met our pricing expectations and we feel good about the prices in which we\u2019re executing these dispositions. And relative to our underlying in turn valuations, yes, we feel good about them. We think this is really attractively price capital for us to redeploy into higher-yielding and higher long-term IRR assets. So we\u2019ll take this short-term dilution and look forward to kind of the growth creation that comes out of that. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. Don, I know you quite can\u2019t get into too many specifics, but could you sort of give us a little bit of a flavor for the type of assets that you\u2019re looking at to buy in terms of the upside potential, the redevelopment potential, the densification opportunities that you might have? Don Wood : Yes. They\u2019re all different, Steve. There;s a prime store asset that we\u2019re looking at that\u2019s similar to what we have. More of that strategic plan \u2013 that business plan. Here we have another one under contract that is adjacent to something that we already own that creates a better piece of land, if you will, for redevelopment on it. To the extent we can take that off the \u2013 we can get that one over transit. And we have some street retail stuff that we really like, that can serve as the beginning of what we hope of business development arm in one of our markets that we like a lot. So they\u2019re all three different and they\u2019re all three part of our stated business plan of how we create real estate value. Steve Sakwa : And I guess, just trying to think I mean, obviously these are quite highly sought-after and competitive I mean, does your stock come into play as a currency or what do you think \u2013 I guess I\u2019m trying to figure out how do you look at things differently that ultimately be the winning bidder, but still create value? Are there things that you think you see differently in these assets than others? Don Wood : Well, again, so on the prime store, we see internal growth of that particular asset that, that is within the Latino community that we hope we can get to that beats \u2013 with Arturo and the prime store group running it, that beats the local ownership, if you will, of that one. Of the adjacent property, it free \u2013 it opens up redevelopment that couldn\u2019t happen without it. And on the street retail type of stuff, right, we think we\u2019ve got rent growth there and we\u2019re also hopeful that effectively it turns into more product with IRRs that make some sense because of the rent growth. In terms of paying for all of those, you know us, we use every tool, including assuming debt that\u2019s on some of those assets that is attractive. And we don\u2019t initially see any need to issue equity associated with it. So they\u2019ll row right in. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m not showing any further questions. So I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Ms. Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks for joining us today. Have a great rest of the summer, and we will see you this fall. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great weekend.",

Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit your question to one or two per person during the Q&A portion of our call, and if you have additional questions, please feel free to jump back in the queue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our third quarter results, Don? Don Wood : Don. Thank you, Leah, and good morning, everybody. Well, we are able to accomplish something this quarter that we tried to do unsuccessfully for the better part of the last decade, and that is to acquire the wildly under-market Kmart leased at Assembly Square marketplace for $14.5 million or about $2.4 million an acre. This very important six-acre parcel will allow us to unlock over time. The significant value creation made possible by the success of Assembly Row over the years and allow us to both densify and unify the power center with the mixed-use community. This is a real estate acquisition through and through, a GAAP required that the expense currently in the income statement. Accordingly, reported FFO per share is $1.43, but the $1.59 excluding that charge compared with the $1.58 reported in last year's third quarter. Also remember that this year's number reflects the 2019 accounting change requiring the expensing of previously capitalizable direct leasing cost of about $0.02 a share per quarter. The Kmart lease acquisition is pretty darn representative of the focus and prioritization of our efforts these days. At this point in the cycle and given the oversupply of retail nationally, the dependence on significantly higher rents, significant increases of portfolio occupancy and landlord-friendly lease terms as the only happening for growth is difficult. It's tempting in a retail environment like this to keep that cash flow growing by making inferior short-term decisions with regard to tenant selection, lease terms, redevelopment opportunities. We won't do that. Our focus is on the next bunch of years, not the next bunch of months. Because while the current environment is resulting in slower short-term cash flow growth in earlier in the cycle, it's also creating more opportunities for medium and long-term value creation in great locations that up until now were not possible. As I said, we've been back and forth with Kmart at Assembly for a decade, with no economic deal close. In 2019, an economically viable agreement was reached, and even though we'll lose a $1 million of rent in 2020, the unlock significant value creation potential is obvious. Similar story in Darien, Connecticut, where previously fruitless negotiations with Stop & Shop took a productive turned in 2019 with an economic deal agreed to resulting in the beginning of our planned development next quarter after many years. We bought Darien in 2013. We've been negotiating with Stop & Shop since 2013. Six years later, we have a deal and we'll start construction. Of course, we'll lose $1 million of rent in 2020. But again, the value creation of a redeveloped Darien property will dwarf that. Similar story on Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, where finally we'll be free to redevelop an entire 45,000 square-foot building on the hard corner of Wilshire and Third Street currently occupied by an over-sized Banana Republic that was built for another time and another consumer. We'll lose $2 million of rent in 2020, but because of where it is, we will improve the value of that corner and the value of other buildings we own nearby significantly. You get the idea. I've got another dozen stories like that on a smaller scale that I could bore you with, but suffice to say that we're willing to sacrifice roughly $6 million or $0.08 a share annually in order to create compelling retail and mixed-use neighborhoods that will be worth far more than they are today. The retail real estate environment is more conducive to opportunities like these than at any point since the bottom of the last cycle in 2009 and 2010. The fact that we can do all that and yet still grow overall cash flow, albeit more slowly from year to year, that's the power a great real estate and the deep and diversified skill set. Okay, back to the quarter. We did a lot of leasing, 95 comparable deals and 8 more non-comparable deals, that is new space, for nearly 0.5 million square feet, more than in the last year's quarter. The comparable deals were done at first year cash rent of $38.93 per foot compared with $36.31 per foot in the last year, the previous lease, a 7% increase. Higher rent was achieved overall across the board on anchors, on small shop deals, on both new and renewal leases. Comparable property operating income was 2.1% higher this quarter than last year's third quarter, and lease termination fees had a minimal impact on that metric, as they approximated $2.8 million this quarter versus $2.6 million last year. The overall portfolio remains well leased at 94.2%. We would expect that to be marginally lower in 2020 largely due to repositioning opportunities I discussed early -- earlier as well as tenant failures like Dress Barn and others. In terms of our roughly $350 million plus in annual development spend this year and next, primarily comprised of office development at Santana Row, Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, along with retail development at CocoWalk in Darien, we remain on schedule and on budget. You'll notice in our 8-K an increase in scope at CocoWalk, as we were successful in getting the two-floor GAP space back early on the west side of the project, thereby allowing us to redevelop that side currently in conjunction with the bigger project. Yields remain unchanged. Look at our balance sheet at quarter end, shows nearly $700 million of construction in progress. We have a ton going on at this point in time that will undoubtedly create big new income stands in the future, but obviously not helpful to the P&L this year or much of next. While in uncertain environment like the one we're has created opportunities for us among our existing tenant base, it's also opened up opportunities among potential sellers, some really interesting real estate. To that end, we currently have nearly $300 million in acquisitions tied up under contract with expected closings of most of it in the fourth quarter, subject of course to our completion of due diligence. $30 million in that did close in the third quarter. But even so, I want to take you through those deals at a high level, each one very different from the other and with a very clear value-created common denominator. I also want to take you through the funding sources resulting IRRs. The first and largest is our agreement to form a 90-10 joint venture with a local real estate operator with a 90 for an initial 40-plus individual street retail properties in Hoboken, New Jersey. Our share of the investment approximate $185 million, the properties mostly apartments, over-street retail, a prime retail -- a prime real estate sites on either Washington Street or 14th Street to Hoboken's main commercial thoroughfares. We're very bullish on Hoboken and its access to be increasingly important west side of Manhattan, including the $20 billion-plus Hudson Yards development. That access is easier than in many areas of Manhattan through the path, ferry and the bus through they immediately adjacent link of tunnel, one or more transportation choices of which is walkable from the buildings we're buying. While we loved the potential rent upside in both retail and residential income streams as Hoboken continues to mature and find favor among city commuters, maybe the most important part of this venture is that it creates a far more productive business development arm for us in Hudson, New Jersey. We expect this initial set of assets to be just the beginning. The other two are smaller and very different from the first, a more conventional grocery anchored center in a very densely populated urban neighborhoods with under-market rents, surface parking and potential pad development opportunities, demographics that are both incredibly dense with strong incomes. A surface part site this large in the middle of an urban residential neighborhood like this is unusual. And finally, we have an income-producing retail site in Fairfax, Virginia, under contract that is immediately adjacent to our first quarter 2019 acquisition of Fairfax Junction. Separately, each center is relatively small for us with limited future potential. Early in the year, you may have wondered why we bought the first. But together, the combined 11-acre site at the prominent intersection of Lee Highway and Main Street Fairfax is powerful. Along the way, it will serve as a solid current income producer, but in the future, wonderful raw material for densification and inclusion all it uses. I go through this combined $300 million investment before they're closed for two reasons. First, think of the breadth of the type of property we look at. Everything from urban street retail with the rent and development upside, while effectively acquiring a regional growth partner, to an urban grocery anchored shopping center with rent and pad side, to an effective land assemblage with the current yield income stream in an affluent Washington DC suburbs serving as raw material for the future, the common thread through all this compelling long-term retail-based real estate, relevant real estate both for today and in the future with an obvious path to income and value growth. Now how do we pay for it. The sales of Plaza Pacoima and a single building in for Hermosa Beach, California, two assets, where we could not see a path to growth, got us started, the sale of 12 acres under the threat of condemnation at San Antonio Center, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter by the way, along with some pretty attractive assumed debt on the acquisitions to make up the rest. So here's the overall math. These assets, assuming we closed on all of them, will provide nearly a nickel of initial annual FFO accretion, net of the lost FFO of the sold assets . But that's just a byproduct of the capital allocation rationale. The reality is that we're investing in assets with great mid- and long-term futures and a 10-year IRR in excess of 6.5% and funding that investment with asset sales and assumed debt of properties with few long-term growth prospects and a 10-year cost of 4.5%. More than 2% improvement in the IRR of nearly $300 million of recycled capital. It's an investment approach like this which balance the short-term accretion with long-term value-add that gives us such great confidence in Federal Realty's future through inevitable cycles. All the focus on short-term occupancy, current earnings and lease-up expectations at this uncertain time is understandable, and it's certainly important. What a company's clear path to growth and mid and long term relevancy of its retail real estate long after the current vacancies have been leased up is in our view far more important. Let me turn it over to Dan for addressing your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and good morning. Our reported FFO per share of $1.43 translates to $1.59 per share on adjusting for the one-time charge relating to the purchase of the Kmart leased at Assembly. the $1.59 figure is the appropriate comparison for consensus and year-over-year purposes this quarter. While the solid results was driven primarily by continued benefit from our proactive leasing activity as well as lower property-level expenses, it was offset by the weight of opportunistic capital transactions during the quarter, including both debt and equity issuance as well as asset sale, slightly higher G&A than we had originally forecasted and continued drag from our redevelopment and re-merchandising initiatives of properties in both the comparable and non-comparable pools. Our comparable POI metric came in at 2.1% for the quarter, ahead of our expectations, bringing this metric through the first 9 months this year to 3%. In the third quarter, net benefit from proactive re-leasing activity boosted the result of 175 basis points versus third quarter 2018. While we had another strong quarter from term fees, we received very little boost from them in comparable POI with just 17 basis points of tailwind versus last year. We again faced 70 basis points of drag from repositioning programs at some of our larger assets like Plaza El Segundo, Congressional and Huntington. As a result of the better than expected quarter, we are increasing our forecast for comparable POI in 2019 from a range of 2% to 3% to about 3%. While Don emphasized our focus on positioning our portfolio for the long-term and the potential short-term impact of these repositioning and re-merchandising initiatives, the quality of our real estate is driving a broad upgrade in our tenant base, as evidenced by new leasing activity. A few to note include - a new 40,000 sqft urban target as part of our Hollywood Boulevard redevelopment in LA; a new 38,000 sqft Home Depot design opening at Montrose Crossing, a great add to that center in our home market. We finalized the deal to relocate Walgreens at the Darien redevelopment and significant uptick in rent from the old lease. And we've also been proactive in reducing exposure to struggling retailers. One example is changing out two of our three remaining cost-plus locations to bring in uses, which enhance the merchandising at Escondido and Pentagon Row. Combined with the recent opening of Nordstrom Rack at Plaza El Segundo, in the last 12 months, we've reduced our exposure to cost-plus from four locations down to just one remaining. While our lease percentage ticked up to 94.2%, we expect -- during the quarter, we expect our occupied percentage to begin to feel some impact over the next few quarters, as we get after some of these repositioning opportunities that Don previously highlighted. As Kmart at Assembly, Stop & Shop at Darien, Banana Republic at Third Street are turned over from a relevant tenancy and a full impact of Dress Barn's closure mute our occupancy, as well as our FFO to start the year. With respect to new developments, you may have noticed some updates and new additions for the redevelopment schedule on Page 16 of our 8-K supplement. As Don discussed, we expanded the scope of our redevelopment project at CocoWalk with the early recapture of the GAP space on the west side of the project. It resulted in a modest increase to the budget. However, we are maintaining our targeted development yield on that incremental capital. At Hollywood Boulevard, where we are combining and redemising spaces to bring in previously mentioned new urban target and a collection of QSRs while doing a complete refresh on the west side of that project, of roughly $20 million incremental spend at a targeted 9% incremental return. And at Lawrence Park in Philadelphia, where we locked in long-term and established major medical use in less attractive, lower-level space and created more attractive retail square footage at the front of the property, you will see a complete refresh of that property as well. $10 million of incremental capital at an incremental 8% yield. Now let's discuss some of the capital activity during the quarter. Given the big rally in the treasury market during the third quarter, we're able to be opportunistic by reopening our 10-year notes due 2009 for an additional 100-plus million dollars of proceeds at 2.7%. At the time of issuance, the lowest 10-year bond ever issued by a REIT. We also took advantage of the strength in the equity market by accessing our ATM program for an additional $75 million of proceeds. And lastly, we closed on the remaining $70 million of asset sales we have been working on at the time of our last earnings call, although one closed after the quarter end. Selling two non-core assets on the West Coast for a blended mid-5s cap rate, bringing our total asset sales for the year to just shy of $150 million at a blended upper-5s yield. More importantly, a blended sub-6% unlevered IRR. This activity positions us with higher than normal levels of liquidity with above-average cash on hand at $163 million and nothing drawn on our newly expanded $1 billion credit facility. While this enhanced financial flexibility will weigh on results by a few pennies for the second half of 2019, we couldn't be better positioned to execute on our business plan on both the development as well as the acquisition front. Our credit and liquidity metrics continue to be at extremely comfortable levels for A- rating at quarter end. Our net debt to EBITDA stood at 5.3 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio steady at 4.3 times, and our weighted average debt maturity remains at 11 years. With respect to FFO guidance for the balance of 2019, we're adjusting and tightening our range from $6.30 to $6.46 per share to a new range of $6.32 to $6.38 as adjusted for the acquisition of Kmart. On a NAREIT-defined basis, which includes the Kmart charge, this range of $6.16 to $6.22. The primary driver of this revision is the capital markets activity I just highlighted. As being position with more cash on hand, plus running the impact of our asset sale activity through our model, impacts results and the midpoint by $0.01 this quarter and a forecasted $0.02 next quarter. With increasing macro headwinds of slowing economic growth, trade wars and both global and domestic political uncertainty, running the balance sheet with more conservatism, even though slightly dilutive to current year's earnings, it seems prudent at this time. Now on to some preliminary thoughts on 2020. We are still in the midst of our 2025 budgeting process. I'm going to keep this very directional in nature. Still more wood to chop and finalizing our forecast. And we have alluded to the greater intensity, of which we are going after repositioning and re-merchandising opportunities in our portfolio for the medium- and long-term value creation at the expense of near-term growth over the next several quarters. Roughly $6 million of net drag from this activity driven by the recapture of some larger anchored spaces that we've benchmarked at Assembly Stop & Shop at Darien, Banana Republic at Third Street, as well as a handful of smaller deal roughly in that $0.5 million per year rent range at places like Santana Row and the former cost-plus deals at Escondido and Pentagon Row. We may also get after some more of re-merchandising opportunities, given that we see an environment which is right for upgrading our tenancy. We also have the impact of losing 10 Dress Barn locations, which have $2.5 million run rate of annual rent that is projected to impact all of 2020. While we are active in discussions to backfill 6 of the10 that we've lost, that rent won't begin to come back online until 2021. Despite these headwinds, we still estimate that we have a baseline of net growth of roughly $0.11 to $0.12, which should get us into the mid $6.40s as a low-end of the range. Like with last year's preliminary guidance, it is still too early in our forecast process to predict how much higher we can push the upper end of guidance range. However, given the diversity of growth drivers we have in our arsenal and particular growth outside the comparable pool, 700 Santana coming online, continued maturation of Assembly and Pike & Rose, although redevelopment deliveries such as CocoWalk, Jordan Downs and Bala Cynwyd Residential starting to contribute in 2020, plus the acquisitions we expect to close this quarter with an offset from the aforementioned aggressive proactive releasing initiatives, expected tenant departures just highlighted, as well as a top term fee comparable given a strong 2019 on that front, our preliminary target for the upper end of the range could push up into the low $6.60s. We'll have more for you on this topic in our next call, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in Los Angeles in a couple of weeks. And with that, operator, you can open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg Mcginniss : Hey, good morning. This is Greg on with Nick. I was just to start hoping to get a few more details on Kmart and Assembly Square marketplace. Curious when they start paying rent and then the expectations on backfilling in terms of timing and rent again. And then what else needs to happen at that asset for you can really start considering redeveloping the Atlantis. Don Wood : Sure, Greg. But let's talk about a few things about it. So -- and I assume you're pretty familiar of where it is on the site and how it kind of connects effectively the power center with, the mixed-use property. Assuming you know that, think about that. First of all, the rent will continue through the end of the year, I think, or just about through the end of the year, then early out. We have entitlement to do on that site. That will take a couple of years to effectively get for us to be able to start construction, to be able to put stuff together. We don't expect adjusted on that property for those couple of years. We expect to lease up. There's a couple of ways to do it. It may even not be retail in terms of how it gets leased up, because at the end of the day to day it's a giant 100,000 sqft box ground floor right next to transportation that there is pretty darn significant temporary tenant activity right now. Nothing done, but something that would be really cool and actually accretive to 2020 to the extent we can get it done. Just not done yet. But when we do get that thing re-entitled, which we hope to be able to do, as I say, in a couple of years, the mapping on that site should be in the hundreds of millions of dollar of spend. So big deal, certainly worth waiting for to the extent we get it done. Greg Mcginniss : And just to clarify on that one. So the entitlements that you have at Assembly Square don't transfer over to that area? Don Wood : They're fine for retail for the use that is today, but we have some other ideas for residential and/or office on that site in addition. Greg Mcginniss : Okay, thanks. And then just for a second follow-up here. So based on your earlier comments regarding Banana Republic, are you exclusively looking at redevelopment opportunities there? What might that look like? Or are you still considering retail backfill, traditional retail backfill? Don Wood : Jeff want to take that? Jeff Donnelly : Yeah. Hey, Greg. We've got a number of alternatives we're working through right now. When we say redevelopment, we're not really talking about changing the building envelope, but reworking the interior of the building and reworking some of the uses that could go into the building. Traditional retail is potential for a portion of the backfill, but not all of it. But we're still working through three or four alternatives we have for the building. Right now the response to our leasing and marketing effort there has been great. And hopefully in a quarter or two, we'll be able to give a little bit more definitive idea on forward heading. Dan Guglielmone : You should by the way -- Greg, you should by the way expect more rent than the rent we're getting out today. A lot of times you look back and say, what $2 million bucks coming out of that building, that's a big number and how do you get more rent? When somebody is paying a lot of rent in locations like that, you can be pretty darn comfortable that we will, and even the capital necessary to do that will create an accretive project there. Jeff Donnelly : Yes, like Don said in his prepared remarks, regardless of which direction we go, the uses to go into the building are going to be additive relative to the current tenant to that end of the street and support our other assets on the Promenade. Greg Mcginniss : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Christy McElroy : Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow up on Hoboken. Did you say what the timing was of the closure of the remaining deals? And currently, is all that space owned by a single partner? And sort of what's the benefit of kind of clustering and possibly aggregating more space in that market? Don Wood : Good questions, Christy. Thanks for asking them. First of all, the timing. We closed on the first building in September. Most of the rest of it will be closed in the fourth quarter. Some of it may drag into the first quarter. We're dealing with some different partnerships or different structures and it's a bunch of buildings. So in terms of -- so that's the timing. In terms of what's going on here, one of the things that we have always struggled with in terms of street retail is getting enough of critical mass on the street to effectively be a real player and to influence both the merchandising in the street and influence the economics on the street. We were able to do it in Third Street Promenade years ago. You may remember that we tried to do it on Newbury Street in Boston. We have bought a couple of buildings, but we're never able to get as much as we wanted. So we sold those buildings when we -- when the bigger deal fell through. This is the next -- or latest iteration of that where we do 40 buildings both downtown and uptown in Hoboken. We got some power and I understand this is probably the worst kept secret in RIET-dom. And so we've been doing an awful lot of work with respect to the demand for this -- these buildings and what the rents would be in terms of that demand, and it has been extremely positive. So we're very bullish on what can happen here. The idea of more is exactly as you would expect that the clustering of it more of the retail storefronts here gives us clearly more leverage with tenants who want to come in. Christy McElroy : Thanks. And then just and looking at 2020, thank you for all the detail on the kind of the preliminary range but also a lot of moving parts in terms of space recapture, in terms of what's known at this point. As you kind of look into your budgeting and you think about what's unknown for credit loss and tenant fallout, how are you thinking about next year? Are you looking at it more conservatively than you did in 2019, or is it about the same in terms of kind of the tenant credit environment right now? Don Wood : Yes. At this early stage of the process, I think we're kind of sitting in kind of a similar type of position as last year. I think we would expect kind of that credit loss whether it would be bad debt expense, unexpected vacancy rent relief, kind of in total all of those different components, kind of consistent with kind of how we looked at it over the last year and even the year before. I don't think at this point we're getting more conservative or more aggressive I think where we sit today, kind of keeping it in line with the past history is where we feel most comfortable. Christy McElroy : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Metz : Hey, guys, good morning. Dan, appreciate the direction outlook for 2020. Sticking with that in the revised expectations here in 2019, but also some of the drags you noted, how should we think about the comp POI trajectory from here relative to the 3% you're now expecting in 2019? And then if you have it, how much will be coming into the pool next year in terms of the residential and commercial as those should be pretty additive? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. No, I think that one of the things that we're -- still too early in our process. This was a real -- yeah, we go through a pretty rigorous budgeting process that's very ground up. With only 100 properties, we're able to dig into each and every asset, dig into each and every business plan at each asset and roll everything. We're not at the point where we've got a sense of that. This is very top-down and directional. So I don't really have a sense on where comparable. As I said, a lot of moving parts, a lot of work to do. So I'm not prepared to kind of give a sense of trajectory on the comp POI basis. But, hey look, I think that from a residential and an office perspective within the comparable pool, most of all, a good chunk of our residential outside of the comparable pool, but there is some within it, particularly on the West Coast. That should be additive. That should be beneficial. And that should help the comparable number, but still too early for us to kind of give any kind of direction one way or the other on kind of guidance for next year. Jeremy Metz : Alright. And then, Don, you got a lot in the pipeline here in the acquisition front. You mentioned the pickup in interesting opportunities out there, that conducive environment to go out and capitalize on these. You obviously have the balance sheet to do so. Beyond the $300 million here, how active is the pipeline beyond that? Is there more in the works that we could be hearing about here in short order? Don Wood : There is. Jeremy. It's -- we were asked a lot to kind of smooth out the notion of acquisitions, how much we would do. We were asked to how much proactive releasing where we do. The reality is it's kind of where you start and you're spot on it is you take advantage of opportunities when they avail themselves, and that's not smooth. And so I think about kind of some of the stuff we're doing both on the acquisition side and the proactive side, and I know a lot of this stuff, including acquisitions. We've been trying to get done for a long time. But the market wasn't ready. The economics weren't ready. And it's a -- it's really a very good time. I'm very optimistic on our future on where we're going and why we're doing it, because we're able to do some deals that were high-five in ourselves around here, and that hasn't happened in a while, even though it's your turn dilutive. So, yeah, you very well maybe hearing about more. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Great, thank you. Don, when you introduced to the Hoboken acquisition, you said that it could create business opportunities and development arm in New Jersey. It sounds like that would obviously be beyond Hoboken. But could you describe what you could see happening there? Don Wood : I could, but I'd prefer not to. The -- we're dating. This is an initial partnership with a local company that has done an amazing job, frankly, of accumulating everything that's there. They also have pretty large long tentacles into other properties and other development opportunities there. So the idea of us of saying what we got and being able to do more with them, including potential opportunities in and around Hoboken. So I'm not talking about Morris County or anything far away from this center of gravity, which is where we're going to concentrate. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question Samir Khanal : Dan, just sticking to the comparable POI, the question's here, I just want to make sure for Darien. When you lose that the Stop & Shop, where the $1 million rent goes out there, that -- does that come out of the pool next year? Dan Guglielmone : Darien will come out of the comparable pool basically at the start the year. So that will not have -- that will have drag on FFO, but it will not have drag on next year's comparable POI metric, because... Don Wood : It's not comparable. Dan Guglielmone : It's not comparable, exactly. Don Wood : And then so basically if you wanted to think about it, just to sort of summarize, or it's the Kmart you lose, you lose the Banana Republic and then sort of the Dress Barn and then any sort of unanticipated kind of vacancies for next year is a sort of the headwinds, right. At this point, I think those are main points. Dan Guglielmone : And then also whatever, as Don alluded to and we're going through the process now, whatever other re-merchandising, we can get after. I mean, we've been proactive in, as I mentioned, in the cost-pluses. There is other opportunities that, as Don said, when you can get after stuff, when there is demand to bring in new tenancy and remerchandised, you get after it. So I think that's something we're working through in our budgeting process right now. So but, yes, that's right. Samir Khanal : Okay. And I guess, Dan, one question here. We've noticed the cost on CocoWalk went up a little bit here. I think it was around $10 million. What's the story there? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. A bigger project, and it's really -- so when we laid that out, the west side of the project has a two-level GAP store in it that had term, and we were -- so we -- as we did our development plans, redevelopment plans. we didn't expect to touch that side. Well, it's GAP and it's 2019, not 2016 or ' 15, and so we got a deal. So, to be able to get to that space and therefore access the west wing, if you will, of the project as we're going through construction of the rest of the project was it's clearly a better thing didn't think we could, but the times to allow us to. So you got a bigger project there and you've got nothing that changes with yield. So you're getting paid for the incremental capital on that. I think it's a real positive. Samir Khanal : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with the call Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning, Don, there. So just a few questions. First, Don. I appreciate the -- your comparison of the Hoboken versus your efforts on Newbury Street number of years ago, but just sort of curious how you viewed street retail in Hoboken versus obviously what's going on here in New York or Miami, where street retail has become sort of a bad word. What gave you comfort that in Hoboken it didn't experience the same situation that we sell street retail in other areas? Don Wood : Yes. it's so funny, Alex. And you know me. I am Jersey kid through and through. And it's a whole lot of different than Manhattan, right? And the people that go to -- go to Hoboken are -- even that moved to Hoboken are generally from Jersey who go there. They're not coming from Long Island. They're not coming from Westchester, etc. So it is a completely different market. The in-place rents, Alex, are below $50, okay. So we're not talking about $200 street retail. We're not talking about a numbers that are scary that way. The in-place resi rents are $2.65. So we're not talking about things that have run to the extent of anywhere near the markets that you just made. What has changed -- I'll tell you what has changed is its acceptability and its access to the more important parts of Manhattan now, because Manhattan is changing, right. And so when you sit and you think about getting to that West side from a lot of places in Manhattan, it is not easy. And we're hopeful that Hoboken will see part of the globe, if you will, from all of that investment. And I can tell you the early deals that we're talking about are validating that thesis. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is on 2020. Don, clearly at the Investor Day earlier this year, you guys emphasized repeatedly the focus on dividend growth on the 51-year track record. So going through the pieces, Dan mentioned $0.08 coming out of the retail, the drag from the capital, but it sounded like through the acquisition program, there was a net $0.05 positive from the capital activities with what's going on in the acquisition side, but you still be $0.08 negative on the retail since sort of that net $0.03 down, if my math is right. What are the other factors that are contributing to what would seem an abnormally low earnings growth year for you guys? Are there other things that are going on? Is it other drag? Or is it other potential projects that you may do? Just trying to put the pieces together. Don Wood : Yes. Listen, I feel for you because we are a multi-dimensional company. We have a lot of pieces. it's not -- we're not trying to lease up a bunch of empty boxes from a time when our occupancy was really low that provide some growth. It's not that at all. So when you sit and you think of things like the space on hopefully on February 1 being turned over to Splunk at 700 Santana Row and that income starting on February 1, that's a pretty good thing that that adds to that. But take a look at the balance sheet, Alex. There $700 million of construction in progress, producing exactly zero from that. Money's out. Cost of money is out, but income has not effectively started on that. So that in and of itself is a current earnings drag, if you will, to some extent. So sort of say in there. Other things are, guys, I think we went through -- I think Danny did a pretty good job a through most of the big ones that we can think through, not with the specificity of month-by-month in rent starts and rent dilutions. But from my perspective, if we can make this portfolio stronger and better for the future and still grow even if it's smaller, to me that says everything about the quality of the assets. Because we haven't -- we didn't get beat up 2 years ago, 1 year ago. 3 years ago, 4 years ago with earnings, as you know, we grown every single year. Alexander Goldfarb : You do, and you've obviously done a good job managing the develop -- the massive development you've delivered over the past few years, which is why I asked the question, because the past few years we were able to manage through that development track. That's why I was just wondering if there were any one specific item that was impacting the 2020. But I appreciate your comments, Don. Don Wood : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. So, Don, I guess just, not to beating the dead horse, but the acquisitions, certainly a sense and excitement in your voice that I haven't heard an acquisitions in a long time. So I guess I'm curious what you're getting from the seller side. Are they more willing to be engaged? Are the pricing expectations changing? Is your cost of capital making some of these deals a bit more easy to underwrite? Just curious on what's sort of driving some of that enthusiasm. Thanks. Don Wood : A lot of human things. I think there is absolutely the overall notion that the economy isn't going to stay strong forever. That -- there is a recession coming someday. Whenever that's going to be, that time today is such where the assets are -- yes, especially when we're talking about really, really good assets, right. We're not talking about sellers who are looking at dumping properties and having their cap rates go up and be able to get paid, because there is the only time they can get paid, but we are talking about sellers who know when they have a good thing generally -- and this is just my gut, worried about the future in terms of the economy. And no, they can get paid pretty well today and that wasn't obvious a couple of years ago. So that's on the acquisition side. On the proactive re-leasing side, I think there has been a major shift in not only retailers, but in most businesses in the country of it's better to rip the band aid off rather than work through problems long term. And I think we see that in a number of different places. When we had a restaurant company, who was not doing well in the DC area but doing well in other places, I think the old days, they would have kind of not wanted to close their stores, let's say, in the DC area. They work through it. Today, they're more willing to rip it off and move forward. So there is that psyche that's out there today both on the sellers of property side and the business -- people are doing business in retail today, that in my view is fundamentally different than it was a few years back. Does it impact pricing? Not significantly. If a couple of these deals we're really happy with what we're doing, how we're getting them, but they're still really expensive, because they're great real estate. So I hope that helps. Haendel St. Juste: That does. And I guess I'm curious on the thinking here and the willingness to take that some of the incremental dilution and drag. Clearly, the market is reacting to bit negatively. I think there are higher expectations for growth. And so fully appreciating your big thing. You have a great portfolio and you're building for the long term. Just curious how you factored all that into a thinking, why now. I understand some of that may be entitlement related, but just curious -- just how all that. Don Wood : No, no. It's a very -- it's an important question I thought what I covered in my earlier stuff, but let me make you crystal clear now. Because you do it when you can and it's not always available, and it kind of goes to your previous question, on the psyche, if companies are willing to make change to deal economically, not have silly expectations for which there is no economic deal, a lot of people - it's always for sale, are not practically speaking it's not. And so today there is no way, no way we wouldn't do the Kmart deal to save $1 billion next year. There is no way we wouldn't do the Darien deal to effect -- to save that $1 million next year. And if there is four more of those? No, we'll do those too, because they're available today. We're working on this stuff for years. There is a fundamental difference in the psyche of people in our business, willing to be reasonable with respect to economics today, I believe. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Thank you. Just back to Kmart and Assembly briefly, are you concerned about the entitlement process for residential there coupled with low development yields and the probable inclusion of a percentage of affordable housing? Would in office mixed use make more sense, given that Puma will fully be moved in? Don Wood : I'm concerned about everything all the time on development and the processes and how we get through, but none of that changes the real estate fact that when there is an opportunity, you jump on it. Because truly I think any decent real estate guy can sit back, grab a cup of coffee, sit on that site and look at the traffic and look at the way things go between two things and say there is an economically viable way to create significant value here. Exactly what that might be? Who knows at this point. And I know that we know isn't something you can put in the model and factor in to 2020 or 2021 for that matter. But the jump to can they do something better accretively in a both an income perspective, in a value perspective on that 6 acres, that's not a long leap most people I think can get there. Derek Johnston : Yes, that's a great property and I completely understand. And just shifting gears. We haven't really had an update on Primestor JV in the West Coast in quite a while, and just any thoughts on further projects with them? Or could we see this relationship develop or grow over the next few years? And are there any other opportunities within the portfolio and other metros, such as Miami, to kind of replicate the success there? Don Wood : Yeah. Jeff, can you take Primestor? Jeff Donnelly : Yeah, sure. So we are operationally doing great right on top of what we underwrote a couple of years ago in terms of the capital that we've invested and the NOI or POI that we expected. So everything from that standpoint is going as planned. We would love to grow the footprint. And we're doing that maybe a little bit slower than I wouldn't liked, but we're doing that business. We have Jordan Downs under construction, delivering into next year. We were able to acquire the Toys \"R\" Us box adjacent to our Los Jardines property in Bell Gardens late last year. And we've got a couple of other things on the acquisition pipeline that we're working on as we speak that will hopefully come to fruition early next year. That said, I mean, you've heard this from us before. The acquisitions market is competitive and difficult particularly in LA, all California quite frankly, and we're disciplined about how we go about that part of our business as is Primestore. So to the extent we can shake stuff loose where we think we can make money, we will and we won't do a deal just to do a deal, which is probably why haven't seen us grow from an acquisition perspective significantly with that platform yet. But it's definitely something we want to do and it's definitely something we work hard on every day. Now I'll let you take the second half of the question on other metros, if you don't mind. Don Wood : Yes, no. Not at all. I mean, conceptually there is something there. I mean, even with respect to what we're doing in Hoboken and around Hoboken, and as we think that through, that's a potential other market that we can look in. But we want to make sure we have the experts in those markets before we jump in. So stay tuned. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. I guess on the Hoboken transaction, what's the rough split between residential and retail in terms of NOI? Don Wood : 70-30, right? Yeah, roughly 70% retail -- 70% commercial, retail and a little bit of office, and about 30% residential Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then, Dan, you mentioned some lease term income in the quarter, can you just quantify what that was? Dan Guglielmone : Yeah, yeah. We had a strong quarter in 2018, and so last year of $2.6 million, and $2.8 million this quarter. So a modest boost to the comparable, but it wasn't a big driver of our outperformance on the comparable basis. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. That was it. Thanks you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hey, good morning. Could you elaborate on your plans at Third Street Promenade and also talk a little bit about the overall health of the retail area there? Because there are some vacancies on Third Street and Santa Monica Place, so just wondering how that is impacting the rents you're expecting at the Banana Republic re-dev. Don Wood : Again, Jeff. Jeff Donnelly : Yeah. No, there is some turnover on the Promenade right now. That's definitely true. And as you go south on the street in the Santa Monica Place, and I know your local, you can see that. We're very pleasantly surprised at what we have going on in Banana Republic. And like I said a few minutes ago, we've got 3, 4 alternatives that we're working through. There is competition toward the building for the space of the building. As Don said, the rent, whichever direction we choose to go, we're going to collect materially more rent than we're currently collecting. So because we are in kind of a leasing, marketing, negotiating mode right now, I really can't say a lot more about it than that. But we, like I said, pleasantly surprised and it's going to be an accretive deal for us. Don Wood : And the only thing I would add to that JV, and Vince, just to think about and everybody should think about this for us, one of the cool things you get here is that we don't just -- we evaluate for highest and best use of the real estate. And so to the extent there is a better use in retail for all our part, of a building or a shopping center, or whatever, we can do that. And so, obviously, I think about it as you sit and talk about Third Street or any other market, where the success of that street has absolutely brought demand from other users who pay pretty darn at good economic numbers to be in there. We got the ability to look at it that way and therefore to execute it that way, and I think that's an advantage. Vince Tibone : Interesting, but the Third Street, the entitlements you have in place now are just retail or there's something you're exploring potentially changing the use or adding additional height, which I know there are restrictions in Santa Monica to that spot. Don Wood : Yeah, we won't be adding additional height. Yeah, in my previous comment, we're going to be working within the existing building envelope, and depending on the use, there may be some work we have to do with the city, but we're not -- we're confident that we would get through that, so. Vince Tibone : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris Van Dijkum : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A question -- a follow-up question on the street retail. Your urban street retail you found on two deals, Primestor and the Hoboken transaction. As you think about that, first how much would you need to be able to invest to be able to consider an opportunity like that? And also how many other markets around the country do you think could meet your criteria? Dan Guglielmone : It's a good question, but a difficult one. We don't go out and look for street retail. We don't go out and look for grocery-anchored shopping centers. We don't go out and look for land assemblage is to put things together. Basically what we are doing is trying to find places for which demand exceeds supply. And when you have a place like that, like Hoboken for example, the notion there is, can you get enough? And I don't know what the number is, Floris, but if you look at our history, you get a pretty good idea. We spent like $40 million, $50 million or so, something like that on Newbury a few years ago, and then we're talking about a $200 million-plus deal that we were unable to get. So when we were stuck in with just $40 million or so or, whatever the number was at that point, we said, no, we can't impact change. So we sold it. Similarly, you see that we just sold Hermosa, which was one building in a great area. That I mean if we controlled Hermosa Beach, California, I'd love to own and continue to own in Hermosa Beach, California. We didn't. So we look at it -- looked at it there through the [indiscernible] guys, if you will, of one building and what we can do with that one building, the -- when we talk to Arturo at Primestor about that rationale, he fully agrees and understands that with us. So there is the symbiosis in terms of what it is that we're trying to do there. I expect to have that same type of symbiosis in Hoboken, with our partner there. And as I think I've said in the past, we've been unable to get it done well in Miami. And then it depends on each particular site that we see, and whether we're confident that the rents can be rolled up, whether we're confident that we could build more if that's the case there, etcetera. So I don't have a good answer for you, other than to really reinforce that we are not a street retail company, we're not a grocery-anchored shopping center company, we're not a mixed-use company. We are a real estate company that basis ourselves in retail-based properties and whatever that could mean from it. So it's a nuance, but I -- and I know it's important or it's easier to categorize, but I can't really help you as much as I'd like to with that because we look at it from a real estate point of view. Floris Van Dijkum : Fair enough. Don, maybe just -- it might be early, but can you make any comments as to return expectations> Or will you be introducing the JV partner at a later point? Don Wood : I will be at a latter point. Let us get through the rest of the same get a closed up, and I'll talk more about this thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi, thanks for taking my question. You already discussed Banana Republic. But for Stop & Shop in Kmart, would your replacement rents look like there? And then how are you thinking about the population of the 10 Dress Barns in the level of replacement rents or types of redevelopment opportunity? Don Wood : You bet. Let me take the first two and then Danny take it from there. The Kmart site is more complex. So any short-term replacement rent, I would expect to more than cover the Kmart rent on a per-foot basis. I don't know whether we get the whole 100,000 or whatever it is done, but I think you'll be happy with that in the short term. In the longer term, it's obviously a much better thing from a great perspective, because it's so much bigger. At Stop & Shop, and you kind of -- you see it in the go to our redevelopment schedule on the overall project of Darien and redeveloping Darien, which will include residential, which will include boutique retail, which will include, well, we'll see what else it includes, as we go through. What certainly accretive to the brand we lost. Dan Guglielmone : And then with regards to the Dress Barnes, I think it's a case-by-case basis. One of the things with Dress Barn is they did pay market rent. So we expect to kind of really see the upside with our Dress Barnes is really just kind of putting in merchandising in tenancy that enhances the broader center and enhances the long-term value of the real estate, I don't think I think you'll see some roll-ups and I think you'll see some kind of staying flat and kind of a little bit of a mix, but there's not a whole a ton of rent upside on Dress Barn. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman with Christy. Don, a quick question for you. Back in May, at the Investor Day, we should have dropped in your opening comments, but thought about selling an interest in your asset base, in certain projects that would raise substantial sums. And when I pushed you on it in the follow-up, you said there was nothing planned today. I guess now that your acquisition pipeline seems to be growing, the $200 million deal at Hoboken, it sounds like you got a lot of other irons in the fire, would you give that more consideration today to bring in capital into some of your deals rather than issuing equity on your ATM. Don Wood : Yes. And Mike, it's a very fair question and every -- I won't say every deal, I would say every 6 months, certainly more than our annual budget process, we guard this balance sheet like in Fort Knox. And so there is never a conversation of what happens on the left side of the balance sheet that is not shared even equal time for what happens on the right side of the balance sheet. So even when you sit and you think about where we are today, we did think prudent use of the ATM was the best solution. I always want to have as few competing goals on the common shareholders' money, and so joint ventures selling pieces of things do complicate that. And so generally I have a bias to not do that, which is what I was saying in May, and that still applies today. Having said that, to the extent there are opportunities that overall make an awful lot of sense for the long-term value of this company, but we'll never -- we're never going to do big equity issuances. Whenever you do big anything on the right-size of balance sheet, we want all those arrows in our quiver to be available to us. To the extent bigger ones hit, then sure we would open up that spicket. So it's a balance. I know it's a complicated answer, but if you were working with me on this side, I think you'd agree that every 6 months or so, you do have to take a real look at that, make sure you understand what irons in the fire actually going to close, how are you going to get them all done and paid for, and so far, I think we've done -- and I think it's, we're really good at that. Michael Bilerman : All right. But at least an example of Primestore on this Hoboken deal, you have a partner that staying in from a capital and also providing some operating level. I would say, a joint venture with a capital partner is the lease complex in terms of a relationship because you're just taking their money rather than taking... Don Wood : ...it's all the least value add, it's also the least value-add. Dan Guglielmone : Right. I mean, because, yes, it's more complex bringing -- taking in a partner, but we're getting something strategically to create real estate value for those things. And that trumps just money, because at the end it's just money... Michael Bilerman : Right. Well, like money. I think you do too. So how big is this pipeline? I mean how big could acquisitions get this next year? You're talking about a $1 billion? Are you talking $500 million? Dan Guglielmone : I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. If you look at what we've done over our history, the one thing I like about us a lot is balancing moderation. So you're not talking about $1 billion in acquisitions, you're probably not talking about $0.5 billion of acquisitions, but I would put that at the upper end at the upper limb. Michael Bilerman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Just bigger picture, Don. Has your real view on the health of retail changed at all in the past year for your tenants, and I am not looking to answer for those, but what do you think is mispriced in this business? And maybe the simplest answer is no test the value per pound for different types of shopping centers versus maybe even certain retailers that are proceed that's really healthy that people are going to go achieve faster with more money. Don Wood : Yes, that second part of that question, I'd love to have a beer with you and sit and talk it through. It's a whole lot more complex than the 30 second thing to be able to answer the question on. And so I'm going to give you an a bigger picture point on the first question part of the question that you asked. Yes, I think there is a healthier, frankly, retailer mindset out. It's healthier. And it's not always better for the landlord, right? Here is some, there is tough negotiations, there is the, as I said before the preponderance of the ability to rip the band-aid off and move forward, I view those things as healthy, because it does suggest that there is a plan for them to move forward. I like that. I hate and we do see this in some grocery operators today, where there is still at the real estate level there is -- maybe we'll consider, maybe we'll consider that, not really sure how that works all the way up top to the boards and the CEO's office to those companies, that stuff I don't like. So the more I do overall see more definitiveness, if you will, in business plans that, well, not always good for us, or everybody in this business is far better than uncertainty Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Leah Brady for closing comments. Leah Brady : Thanks for joining us today, and we will see many of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Leah Brady. Thank you. You may begin. Leah Brady : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker, and Melissa Solis. They\u2019ll be available to take your questions at conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These documents are available on our website. Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have additional questions, please feel free to jump back in the queue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thank you, Leah, and good morning, everyone. So, for the 10th year in a row, FFO per share was higher than the previous year, excluding of course last quarter\u2019s Kmart real estate acquisition charge to the income statement for accounting purposes. And barring some unforeseen collapse, 2020 will be the 11th year in a row, as Dan will talk about in a few minutes. Please let that sink in. We've grown earnings, bottom line earnings, every single year over this past decade and expect to do so again next year. Yes, growth has slowed as the industry continues to morph into something different. But it's still growth and there's not a single other publicly traded strip here that can make that claim. In fact, of nearly 200 US equity REITs in every sector, less than 5% were able to grow FFO per share each year. Not surprisingly those companies have a combined average multiple of nearly 21 times. One of the things that differentiated Federal a decade ago when growth slowed following the 2008 recession, with the way we relied on our balance sheet strength and broad skill sets to move forward with initiatives that would power us in the years that followed, but which were not helpful with generating immediate earnings. We aggressively move forward with master plans for Pike & Rose, Assembly Row, other long-term initiatives despite the challenging environment. And as a result, we were able to outperform a sentiment change because we were that far ahead. This feels like that to me. This time, rather than dealing with a broader recession and planning large decade long mixed use projects, we're dealing with oversupply and changing consumer preferences. But we're doing equally forward thinking things. Things like doubling down on already successful mixed use communities with less risky and mostly non-retail additional phases that capitalize on the communities we've already established. We'll construct a new midsized projects like CocoWalk in Miami and Darien Shopping Center at Connecticut and listening to what retailers, restaurants and the communities they serve tell us about what's important to them. By the way, if you look at our year-end balance sheet, you'll note $760 million of construction and process, more than we've ever had in our long history. We're aggressively moving forward with solidifying our core portfolio by proactively acknowledging the haves and have nots among retailers and shopping center environments. We're beefing up incredibly well-located high quality centers for the next decade with better tenancy, with alternative and additional uses, and with attractive place making using sustainable methods and environments. For recycling assets with little opportunity for future growth, nearly $300 million worth at that Plaza Pacoima, Free State Shopping Center, the office of our retail building in Hermosa Beach, California, and the Kohls portion of San Antonio Center. And we're reinvesting those proceeds in far better opportunities in Hoboken, New Jersey; Brooklyn, New York; Fairfax, Virginia. In other words, in a naturally cyclical business, we're always focused on growing long-term FFO per share no matter what the current environment looks like. So, let's talk about the transactions that closed in the fourth quarter to demonstrate the point. We did what we said we would do. First, we received the full $155 million in December from the Los Altos, California School District for the 12-acre portion of San Antonio Center through the condemnation process we've been discussing for months now. The elevated cash position on our year-end balance sheet reflects this. And while we have the obligation to use a portion of those proceeds to pay existing tenants on the site, the timing and amount of those payments is uncertain at this time, but the net value to us is more than a little impressive. We also closed on [indiscernible] anchored plaza deployment in Los Angeles in the quarter for $51 million. When these fourth quarter dispositions are combined with the sales of Hermosa, Free State and a couple of smaller parcels earlier in the year, $300 million of capital was raised at a mid-4 cap rate based on expected 2020 cash flows. And when we recycle that capital into Hoboken, New Jersey where 37 of the 39 buildings we bought in our new partnership closed in the fourth quarter. The other two buildings have closed this month -- closed in the fourth quarter. The other two buildings are closed this month. We also closed on Georgetowne Shopping Center in Brooklyn and in January, the retail strip adjacent to our previous holdings, in Fairfax, Virginia. Basically $300 million invested in properties, which generate a going in yield modestly in excess of the assets that were sold, with an IRR that's 200 basis points higher. And we expect to be able to expand further given that hope of a partnership and the opportunities we're seeing. Transactionally, the fourth quarter was extremely active, operationally, it was two. We ended 2019 having signed 457 retail and office leases for nearly 1.9 million square feet and average rents of $41 a foot. And we signed more than 2,300 residential leases at average rents of $2.82 per foot, $34 per foot per year. Just the retail and office leases combined created $77 million of growing annual contractual rent obligations for the next seven-plus years. Our rental stream comes from an incredibly diverse set of retail, office and residential tenants. On the development side, we\u2019re incredibly active with 700 Santana Row complete and just turned over to Splunk last week. $210 million, which is on budget, and yielding 7.5%. This building is a homerun at the end of the street and including Santana Row and really something you should check out on your next trip to North \u2013 Northern California. It\u2019s impressive. Across the street, at Santana West, construction is well underway, roughly $100 million of spend in 2020, $150 million of spend in 2021 with no income until 2022. Strong interest in the building at this very early stage was encouraging. Full blown construction at Assembly, on both the residential and the office building, continues unabated. Both projects are on schedule and on budget, roughly $200 million of spending 2020, $100 million in 2021 with no significant income contribution until late 2021. This is one big development phase that will really change the feel of Assembly Row. PUMA\u2019s North American headquarters as the office anchor there. Construction of 909 Rose, the flagship office building at Pike & Rose that will house Federal\u2019s new headquarters in August of this year is on budget, is on schedule with roughly $50 million in spend expected in 2020. We're currently trading paper with other tenants for more than 40,000 square feet in line with our underwriting. CocoWalk is moving along beautifully with 87% of the retail space and 57% of the office space spoken for under signed lease or fully executed LOI. Another $30 million of capital is programmed there for 2020, and they will begin to be generated here later this year. And finally, we can now say that demolition and construction are underway at Darien where we will completely change the character of the grocery anchored shopping center where we will add 75,000 square feet of new lifestyle oriented retail space to complement our strong equinox asset banker, 122 apartments and 720 parking spaces directly adjacent to the Noroton train station in Darien. $120 million and an incremental 6% yield with $25 million spend in 2020 and most of the balance beyond that. No incremental income here this year or next. I\u2019d go to the status of just those large development projects for obvious reasons. Our balance sheet at year-end shows $760 million of construction in progress. And while the Splunk building at Santana delivers this year and will reduce that number, an additional $400 million or so will be added in 2020 and $300 million in 2021 before these projects are turned over to rent-paying tenants after that. Back to the remarks I made initially, we're doing a ton of investing in leading edge real estate projects in markets as we look toward a very bright but different future with changing consumer demands and retailer business plans. We expect to be at the forefront of that change, all while continuing to grow FFO per share, albeit, more slowly in the near term. So, that's about it from my prepared remarks. All the focus on short-term occupancy, current earnings, and list of expectations at this uncertain time is understandable and it's certainly important. But the company's clear path to growth and mid- and long-term relevancy of its real estate long after the current vacancies have been leased up is in our view far more important. Let me turn it over to Dan before addressing the questions. Dan? Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Another record year of FFO per share as we posted $1.58 for the fourth quarter with the full year for 2019 at $6.33, as adjusted for the acquisition of the Kmart Assembly. An uptick in FFO versus the same period in 2018, and remember, in 2019, we faced an increase in G&A of roughly $0.02 per quarter from the new lease accounting standard. The numbers in the fourth quarter were driven primarily due to higher term fees and higher rental income than last year offset by a shift in timing on property level expenses, both from real estate taxes were a meaningful forecasted tax refund was pushed into 2020 and non-recoverable property level expenses which were pulled forward from 2020. Both of these are primarily timing issues that should come back to us positively in 2020, but represented roughly $0.02 of drag in the quarter versus forecast. While this quarterly FFO results may seem muted, this was driven primarily by timing and we had a really successful quarter in terms of all the positive activity Don highlighted in his comments. Our comparable POI metric came it at 2.4% for the fourth quarter and 2.9% for the year basically in line with our previously increased annual guidance. With respect to retail space rollover, the 99% comparable retail leases during the fourth quarter were 462,000 square feet were written at an average rent of $37.87 per foot, 7% higher than the prior rent. Those results closely track the 379 full year 2019 comparable deals which were written at $40.48 on average or 8% higher than the deals they replaced. Our portfolio remains well leased at 94.2% though we do expect that to move lower than the first half of 2020. While we don\u2019t typically provide guidance on our occupancy metrics, given the aggressive level of proactively leasing and some of the recent retailer fall out, we expect our occupancy metrics will trough in the first half of 2020 to the mid 93% level for least and the mid 91% range for occupied. However, we should see a steady rebound back up to historic levels over the latter half of 2020 and into 2021 given our strong pipeline of leasing activity. A few additional comments I'd like to highlight in our disclosure this quarter that further demonstrate the strength in our business that is not directly reflected in the quarter numbers. On our development schedules in the Form 8-K, please note on page 17, we closed out another $50 million in projects and four of them on time and on budget. And on page 18, we raised our projected yield on $0.01 NOS to 7% reflecting continued strength in rental growth that add sub-market for the amenitized office product we offer there. Now why do I mention this? It\u2019s because the redevelopment and mixed use development we do is challenging and it's really difficult to execute effectively through Federal\u2019s experience and 20-year track record, we have meaningfully de-risked these parts of our business model. Now, we'll turn to 2020 guidance. We have formally provided a range of $6.40 cents to $6.58 per share. This formal guidance takes into consideration some of the projected tenant failures that have occurred since late October 3Q call; A.C. Moore, Pier 1 and Fairway the most prominent. We felt it prudent to take a more conservative posture as these restructurings play out. This range represents 2.5% growth in 2020 FFO at the midpoint. While this guidance range reflects some discrete headwinds facing us in 2020, which I will get to shortly, our diversified platform is executing on all cylinders, as evidenced by delivering 700 Santana Row to Splunk last week get returned in the mid 70s. The stabilization of the phase 2s at assembly in Pike & Rose, delivery of smaller projects over the course of 2020 including the Primestor JVs Freedom Plaza, aka Jordan Downs, beginning delivery to start this year. Bala Cynwyd Residential opening in Q2 and a newly renovated CocoWalk expected to start delivering to tenants in the second half of the year. While none of these smaller projects will meaningfully add to 2020, they will be additive in 2021. We also have the stabilization of the $50 million of redevelopment at a blended incremental yield averaging 9%, and we also have a core portfolio excluding headwinds caused by term fees, repositioning and recent tenant failures which otherwise would deliver comparable growth in the 2.5% to 3% range. Also note that we executed on roughly $300 million of new investments and over $300 million of non-core asset dispositions during 2019 which will be a couple cents accretive in 2020. But provide more meaningful value creation and growth over the longer-term. Whether other retail REIT can tell an asset recycling program that's accretive to FFO in year one. These items together would drive FFO per share growth into the 6% to 7% range if not for some discrete but somewhat disproportionate headwinds. Let me give some additional color. First, term fees, we had a record year in 2019, earning over $14 million in gross fees. Whether it provides headwinds or tailwinds, we include term fees in our metrics because it is part of our business and the overall strength of our lease contracts provide us with a competitive advantage we can leverage over time. While we expect a strong year again in 2020, we do not forecast getting back to 2019\u2019s levels and therefore forecast a meaningful drag here. A second headwind. Late last year, we identified several attractive, proactive remerchandising and repositioning opportunities across our portfolio. And continue to evaluate additional opportunities, which will drive significant longer-term value creation, but at the expense of 2020 FFO. Changing out struggling retailers, we have limited runway in terms of long-term relevancy and replacing them with tenants who we project to be thriving in 2030 and beyond will be another source of 2020 drag. Add in the forecast that impact the more recently announced retail failures on top of those previously identified such as Dress Barn. And collectively these items get us to a range of 1% to 4% FFO growth in 2020. With respect to other assumptions behind our guidance, comparable POI growth is expected to be at 0% to 2%, which reflects the headwinds we just highlighted. The first and second quarters of 2020 will be the weakest and may even be negative due to term fee drag. We assume roughly 100 basis points of credit reserve comprised the bad debt expense, unexpected vacancy, and rent relief. This is roughly in line with past years\u2019 projected reserves and actuals. Please note that projected lost revenues from the recently announced tenant failures previously mentioned have been incorporated into our guidance and are not part of this reserve. With respect to G&A, we forecast roughly $11 million per quarter, up modestly from 2019\u2019s run rate. On the capital side, we project spend on development and redevelopment of roughly $450 million to $500 million. As is our custom, this guidance assumes no acquisitions or dispositions over the course of the year. We will adjust guidance for those as we go. And finally, we\u2019re projecting roughly $60 million to $80 million of free cash flow generation after dividends and maintenance capital. Now, onto the balance sheet, as is become a Federal Realty custom, we have positioned our capital structure exceptionally well to handle the current wave of value creating development or redevelopment activity at the company. We finished the year with over $100 million of excess cash and nothing outstanding on our newly expanded and extended $1 billion credit facility. As a result, our net debt to EBITDA now runs at 5.5 times, our fixed charge coverage ratio hold steady at 4.2 times, our weighted average debt maturity remains near the top of the sector at 10-plus years, and the weighted average interest rate on our debt stands at 3.8%, with all of it effectively fixed. Our A-rated balance sheet equipped with a diversity of low cost funding sources allows us to execute our diversified business plan with a meaningful \u2013 meaningfully lower cost of capital than anyone in the sector which is another way we derisk the development activities we have underway. Our game plan for 2020 has all the components in place to position Federal for sustainable outperformance in both FFO and NAV growth over the next decade. That's all I have for my prepared remarks and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in a few weeks. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Just first question on the guidance. If you look at the FFO range you put out versus the goal post you talk about on the last call, you mentioned that you see more fairway and some others, I think, affected things. Was there also a decision to start more redevelopment? Is that also causing any additional drag versus what you expected last quarter? Dan Guglielmone : No. No. I think -- by the way. Good morning. Yeah. We \u2013 the re \u2013 additional redevelopments really didn't come into, it was really just taking a more conservative posture as we look at some of the news that has come out since late October 3.5 months ago. Really that's \u2013 that was the primary driver. Nick Yulico : Okay. That's helpful, Dan. And then I guess just the second question is as we think about this year and you talked about the earnings growth being affected by a few significant move outs that are unrelated to tenant bankruptcies. You\u2019ve always been, sort of, ahead of the curve in terms of remerchandising boxes, but this year is clearly a more impacted year than most. So, what I'm wondering is, is this a function of the retail environment and is it going to be a new theme in the federal portfolio? How should we think about our risk of there being a similar type of downturn \u2013 downtime vacancy impact in 2021? Don Wood : Yeah, Nick. Well, let me start on that. We've taken a very holistic approach to all of our centers and really trying to take a look at where we believe these things will be more powerful in 2025 and 2026. And that means the notion of place and place making is a much \u2013 it's always been an important part of what we do but it's a \u2013 it's a more important \u2013 it's a bigger focus in terms of what we're creating including the type of co-tenancy that is happening there. Clearly, less clothing, if you will, more experiential type of stuff including health and beauty; including food and different food sources. So, we look at this holistically as a major change in how retail and centers including mixed use Centers serve their communities over the next 10 years. And as you know, our staff is not in the middle of the country generally. It's sitting in the coast and in populated areas with lots of money and lots of people around. And so, we are forward thinking, if you will, in terms of that. And it's not just about backfill and space. So, does this continue? Yeah, I do think it continues because I think this is a major change in how people are going about their lives when it comes to interacting with retail. But we do it on a balanced basis and there's nothing more important than that to us to know that as a public company we can't tell you, well, our earnings are going down but it's going to be great in the future. We need to balance both of those things, current earnings along with the sustainability of great real estate. And that's the needle that we thread. Nick Yulico : All right, Don, that make makes sense. Just last question is on the re-leasing progress on the spaces that are a drag on 2020, NOI, for example, Kmart, Assembly, Stop & Shop, Darien, and Banana Republic at Third Street in Santa Monica. Don Wood : Yeah. Let me go through those because those are big ones. The Kmart at Assembly we may temporary lease up the space. But the purpose of that was that\u2019s an acquisition to be developed and that will be a continuation of Assembly Row. Now, we've got entitlements to do. That takes couple of years. The timing and the planning is necessary so we'll certainly look for some kind of mitigation, if you will, of the lost Kmart rent. But it's not the driver. The driver is the value that will be created on that 6 acres which is why I still don't understand the accounting that has to go through the P&L, frankly. That is an acquisition all day long. Come up to Darien, we are now under construction. That Stop & Shop is not going away. And so as a result that will be a completely different use on that parcel. And so you won't see income contributed there. We're not trying to backfill the Stop & Shop. We'll knock it down. And so the whole notion there is how to create a whole bunch of value on a piece of land that was obsolete. That shopping center wasn't needed as another grocery and acreage shopping center with that train station. So, look forward to that in the coming years. In terms of Banana, Jeff, I don't know how much you want to say at this point, but we're making some real progress on backfilling that at an incremental rate. Jeff Berkes : Yeah. Thanks, Don. And, Nick, we can tell you more hopefully next quarter. We're down the road but not to the point where we can really give a lot of detail on the leasing part of us there because we're in negotiations. So, more to come on that one, but trending in the right direction. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Christy McElroy : Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for the call out on our conference for promoting it. In terms of \u2013 Don, you talked about $400 million of additional spend in 2020, $300 million in 2021. I know you have many options for capital raising to fund that, but just sort of generally how should we think about the mix. Dan, you said free cash flow this year is $60 million to $80 million, you've also got equity issuance as an option, but how should we think about the potential for additional dispositions as well? Dan Guglielmone : You know that will always be part of our plan, Christy. So, first of all, let's start with the balance sheet that you're looking at which adds over $120 million of cash on it. So, starting out with a balance sheet that, as you know, is about as strong as can be, including a completely unutilized billion-dollar credit line. So, that's not a bad start. On top of that, there's no doubt we will continue to recycle the portfolio that you should still assume and I can\u2019t \u2013 I'd love to say $150 million or $200 million of dispositions, but the reality is that's very opportunistic and it depends. We just did $300 million last year. We did much less than that the year before. I don't know exactly where that will be is 2020, but it's part of the program, it's part of the capitalization if you will of the company, and we're comfortable in doing that because of the uses of capital that we have to reinvest. So, between the existing balance sheet capability along with asset sales, along with cash flow generated by the business, we're more than covered I think as kind of we've shown you in the past 10 years. Christy McElroy : Okay. And then Dan thanks for all the color on sort of the drivers behind the comp POI range. I'm wondering if there's any properties that are sort of entering the pool in 2020 that have sort of an impact there. And then in regard to the term fees, it sounds like they'll be relatively backend loaded through the year. I'm wondering if you could say how the 2020 absolute amount is supposed to come out in FFO relative to the $14 million in 2019. Dan Guglielmone : Okay. Well, maybe I'll start with the term fee question. $14 million is significantly in excess of our 20-year average which typically is about $5 million per year, per annum, and over the last 10 years, it's been about $6 million per annum. Maybe a better way to look at it because we've grown over time is it's roughly 80, 90 basis points of total revenues. So that creates a bookend of maybe $5 million to $8 million of term fees which is kind of what we have currently in the range. We don't expect to get back to the $14 million level. I wouldn't say necessarily it's backend weighted. We'll probably have a little bit of a tougher headwind in the first quarter from term fees because we had such a big one in the first quarter of 2019\u2026 Christy McElroy : Got it, Dan. Dan Guglielmone : \u2026with the lowest term fee at supply. And then with regard to your first question, could you just repeat it? Christy McElroy : Yes, sir. Just what\u2019s entering the pool in 2020 that might have an impact there? Dan Guglielmone : There will be some things moving around. I mean, I think that we're \u2013 but there won't be materially kind of moving things. We are going to move the residential assembly at Assembly Row into the pool. We're going to be moving phase one of Pike & Rose roads as well as the residential and phase two into the comparable pool, and we'll probably also be moving Towson Residential. But all of those have stabilized. And so, there won't be a material boost that you'll see from those entering the pool. They've stabilized in kind of one year seasoning we do as part of that methodology for comparable. But you won't see a big boost there. Operator : Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Samir Khanal : Hey. Good morning, guys. I guess just shifting subjects a little bit here on the acquisition front. You guys were pretty active in 2019 kind of wondering what's in the pipeline at this time. Dan Guglielmone : Samir, you don't want me to give you the LOIs that we\u2019ve got, right? I mean at the end of the day, the \u2013 our pipeline for acquisitions does change all the time. There is no question that we were heavily focused on the New York Metropolitan Area in 2019 and that will stay. So, we will continue to try to increase our holdings in those in those markets where we've just entered. But that doesn't mean that that \u2013 and by the way, the same thing for the Northern Virginia market. That doesn't mean something else won't pop up. One of the things that we are noticing right now are clearly more sellers who are who are looking to get out for all the reasons you would assume. The trick for us is making sure that we're picking up assets that we believe in the long term for. That could even be a box center in the appropriate place \u2013 in a place or two, but it's it really depends on the metrics. So there isn't anything that is imminent at this point but you should see us active, if you will, throughout 2020 particularly in the areas that we targeted for future growth. Samir Khanal : And what about on the disposition side? I know you guys you kind of had the strategy to sort of dispose someone non-core assets. Yeah. You were a little bit active last year. I mean what we \u2013 how should we be thinking about that sort of disposition volume possibly in 2020 from the modeling perspective? Dan Guglielmone : Yeah I don't know how to say too much more than I did on the first question, Nick. Weather \u2013 I don't know the number is $150 million or $200 million or what it should be. I will tell you we've identified assets that we would like to dispose of because we have things to spend that capital on. But in the preparation for the \u2013 those packages and figuring out what the market \u2013 what makes sense in the marketplace, we do that very opportunistically. And so there is not a budgeted number, if you will, that you can just put in the model of how much dispositions we would have. You should assume that anywhere from 0 to $200 million or $250 million dollars is what we have historically done and will approach it the same way in 2020 as we have over that period of time. Samir Khanal : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, we're going urban. So, Hoboken and now Brooklyn. Can you go through the near-term opportunity at Georgetowne Shopping Center? Mark-to-market opportunities, merchandising improvements, your planning, I mean, they have a Fairway, they had a Dress Barn and a GameStop, a buffet, to be fair, some stronger retailers, Starbucks, Carter's, Five Below, Chipotle. So, the question is, what's the near term plan? And where are you actually going with this longer-term? It's a 9-acre parcel and there\u2019s 575 parking spaces. Dan Guglielmone : So, Derek, let me just start something and then I\u2019ll ask Wendy to jump in there after that. But, we\u2019re going urban, I mean we build around the density and the population centers. So, I don't think there\u2019s any change in Brooklyn, New York then there is of \u2013 or Bethesda, Maryland or Santa Monica, California or Fairfax County, Virginia. That is what we are, we\u2019re those close in suburbs, if you will, of major CBDs. And so, I think, frankly, a grocery-anchored shopping center with the density that Brooklyn has at the price that we got at that was hard to pass up, to tell you the truth. And, obviously, we underwrote the weakness in Fairway as the \u2013 as part of that underwriting process, didn't know and still don't know, the timing, in particular, of what we can do there. But we know that demand for grocery there is ridiculously strong. And so, you should assume that that will be a grocery-anchored shopping center in the middle of a very densely populated area, with rate upside based on how it was previously managed and run compared with how we will prospectively run that shopping center. So, you shouldn't expect it to be torn down and something else happening there. You should expect that they are really in my view, hopefully better run, higher rent, better acre park, open parking lot in the middle of Brooklyn. Derek Johnston : Okay. And then San Antonio Center. Certainly, you've seems to have worked out fine. I think you guys paid around $62 million in 2015. So, it was sold under a combination for the $155 million. When will you have to pay out the tenant award portion from the proceeds? And can you share how that's determined and how that works? Don Wood : Jeff, you want to take it carefully? Jeff Berkes : Yeah. It's going to play out over the next couple of years. And we've been able to work things out with most of the tenants but not all the tenants, so still on that. The process is relatively straightforward and mechanical but going to start- not going to start for a couple of years. So, Don, I don\u2019t know if there's much more than that that we would want to add. Don Wood : Well, the only thing I would point you to \u2013 maybe point you to is financial statements where there is a recorded gain and obviously, inherent in that gain is an estimation of the expenses that are that have to be paid out, so I hope that\u2019s helpful. And you should know that that is by design very conservative. Derek Johnston : Thank you, everyone. Don Wood : It's very conservative but it's actually in excess of what we expected. And we had kind of guided folks to kind of net proceeds after those payments of $90 million to $100 million. And net-net, we're closer to $110 million. So \u2013 and that\u2019s where the conservative estimate. So, obviously, a good result and better than we had we had hoped. Derek Johnston : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. On page 17, you break out the delivered projects which are recurring at 9% and then the active redevelopment projects which are delivering at 6%. I wonder if the 6% is the new norm or is this just a temporary mix issue. Dan Guglielmone : Yeah. Well, a little bit of both, Craig. I think it's a great question. The result is \u2013 the reality is the construction costs are high, and they are significantly higher than they were a couple of years ago as we started these other projects. So there are steps that certainly part of it. Call it, I don't know whether it's half of the difference or whatever else. The other half is certainly mix, certainly mix. And you can see that Darien has a disproportionate piece in that. That's a complete redevelopment of a shopping center. And one of the reasons we're willing to do at Darien or something like that at an incremental 6% is because of the nature of the project and where we believe the future in that asset goes. This is the same as putting a pad out on a \u2013 out in front of a shopping center where the new income is the new income, and that\u2019s where it will be for 10 years. At something like Darien with a big residential component, too, you should say, Darien too, and we\u2019ll do Darien at 6% because of the incremental rent increases we expect to get, not on the residential side but in terms of the lifestyle part of the center as it gains traction. So you\u2019ve got a big mix component in that but also, as I\u2019ve said, construction costs are up. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then in terms of re-leasing like A.C. Moore or Pier 1, can any of that occur before the end of 2020 or is that all a 2021 event? Dan Guglielmone : There's nothing better than me looking at Wendy Seher right now and because I love that you asked that question. Wendy? Wendy Seher : Thank you, Craig. I do think that we will be able to do some other re-leasing and get those documents signed in 2020. In terms of them opening, I think you'll see that more in 2021, but we do have some strong activity in the pipeline right now which gives me encouragement that we will get a fair amount of it done in 2020. Craig Schmidt : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital. Please proceed with your question. Jeremy Metz : Hey. Good morning. Don, Dan, I just want to go back to the growth topic again. You guys mentioned growth this year, growth next year, and obviously appreciating you're in this for the long game also specifically detailed a number of projects in your opening remarks which is clearly helpful. But sounds like income will be a little more phased and possibly backend loaded through 2021. So, just broadly thinking about a bridge, is it a fair for us to be thinking we should have some temporary expectations at this point for any sort of big reacceleration or any reacceleration of growth next year? Obviously, recognizing those number of the moving pieces in the pipeline and the repositioning as you guys have talked about? Dan Guglielmone : Yeah. Jeremy, you understand it well and you\u2019ve kind of laid it out really well there. There's a lot \u2013 there's clearly uncertainty in our business. I\u2019d love what we\u2019re doing in terms of what we\u2019re \u2013 what the capital that we\u2019re putting to work, its contribution as you said will be later in 2021. The big question and answer to your question is how many holds are there at the bottom of the bucket. And that\u2019s what is for anybody in this space \u2013 in retail space the big unknown. And so, it does make us \u2013 it does make it harder to predict. It does make it harder to say, okay, growth will go back to this number on May 6, 2022 or something like that. But all we think we should be able \u2013 should be doing is looking toward making sure this stuff, all of this portfolio is extremely relevant and as good as it's ever been and better as we go through the 2020s. And so balancing it to keep that growth \u2013 to keep growth in place but not knowing when we're able to really accelerate to another level is just the facts today and I would tell you it\u2019s the facts with everybody no matter what they tell you. The difference is we got $1 billion of incremental capital that will create that incremental growth going forward. But what\u2019s the negative coming out of the bottom end of the bucket definitely unknown. Jeremy Metz : Yeah, that\u2019s fair. Dan, just a quick one. You mentioned that 100 basis points of credit reserve. You also mentioned the AC Moore. Just wondering are those baked into that 100 basis points that you're giving yourself or are those on top of the 100 basis points and that\u2019s separate? Thanks. Dan Guglielmone : Yeah. Our guidance reflects a projection of what lost revenue we should achieve or what we\u2019ll be hit with in 2020. So that\u2019s reflected in our guidance. If we deviate and it gets more negative then that\u2019s covered in the reserve. But kind of an expectation of how things will play out with regards to those recently announced retail failures is reflected in the guidance and then a reserve on top of that if it\u2019s worse than we project. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey. Good morning. Just got two questions from our end. First, Dawn, you\u2019ve spoken before that you guys are First, Don, you\u2019ve spoken before that you guys are a retail company, you do office, you do apartments but at your core you're a retail company. That said, office has definitely been a bright spot this cycle. So, as you guys think about where you're going to spend on development pipeline or the assets that you're looking at. Are you having your team focus more on assets or opportunities that could involve more office or your view is look we\u2019re a retail company focused on retail, if it has office, if it has residential great, but retail is our core. Dan Guglielmone : I guess, Alex, the best way for me to say is we are real estate people. And the best thing that we can do with real estate is huge retail to be able to get people to come to that piece of property that we have. So, there is always a how do we get people to come to our real estate as the primary driver. Now, what can we do with it? Absolutely involves other real estate uses. I think we've proven that. I think what you've seen in the past number of years for us is actually just the natural evolution of mixed use properties where you create that retail environment and then add residential or office or hotel or incremental uses that play off that retail. That will continue. And so when you when you -- it doesn't mean we won't do a pure retail play like and answer to the previous question, we did in Brooklyn when we have our bread and butter and we know how to create value from increasing rents in a not tense environment. But when you have other uses that include Hoboken which has a large residential component to it or as you see what it is that we're doing obviously Friend Center or Darien or CocoWalk, we're going take \u2013 we're going to look at it with a broader view I think, than other folks in the shopping center world. And we don't do that for just one or two projects. We do that with every possible piece of real estate that we own or are looking at, but it's certainly back for a long time with us. Alexander Goldfarb : I realize that it's just \u2013 it's funny this cycle office seems to be the golden child. So, you have the positive yield revision at 1 Santana. So, I don't know if that was leading you to try and push your team more to office. But the second question is\u2026 Dan Guglielmone : Let me say one thing to you there, Alex. It's important that we don't do this for cycles. We don't invest to time cycles. This is \u2013 there will be a time when office is no good and retail is back better, and we are building long-term sustainable real estate destinations. And so, no, we don't move along with \u2013 you're not going to see us buying industrial properties because it's hot right now, for example. And I just always want to make sure we are a long-term focused company and we act that way. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is with all the retailer closings that are announced, some are obviously full liquidations but some are retailers parent stores, in general, as I\u2019ve looked at your portfolio and troubled retailers, are you generally pretty good about calling which of your tenants is going to close, or do you feel like some of these retail closings are sort of haphazard, or wouldn't necessarily follow productivity logic that you would otherwise could take meaning? Are you caught offside by some of these closing announcements, or all the ones that have happened pretty much apart from a full liquidation you're pretty much like, yeah, we had a feeling they were going to close this one or that one. Dan Guglielmone : Well, that's a good question, and I would \u2013 I'm putting a percentage on this not for exactness, but to be illustrative. I would say 75% or 80% of the deal, so we need kind of have a real good idea as to what's going on and why logically a tenant would close the store or to renegotiate a store or do whatever obviously. But there is, to your point here, 8 percentage, 20%, some percentage, if you will, of decisions that are being made today that are not as obvious as they used to be and some of that is because there are broader market decisions that are being made, so what good performing stores can be closing too because they don't fit in a business plan of a company going forward. There are other reasons that that sure, they do take us by surprise occasionally. You see it certainly in some of the categories you know like restaurants for example where you can have a decent performing restaurant but because of that ownership structure, we get surprised with a closed door. But, overall, the point here is really to make sure whether surprised or not, we've got backfills and we've got alternatives to be able to fill that. And I don't know how you better mitigate that risk more than with great real estate. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. to go back to the kind of bigger picture and the growth rate that we can expect from Federal. So, maybe you can \u2013 is there any way you can give to some color on how much NOI you expect from redevelopment and development from the just from the known projects that you have on the ground today that we should expect in 2020 and how that looks like in 2021? Don Wood : Well, I mean let's do it \u2013 let's do it this way. When you go to page 17 and 18 of our 8-K that does a pretty good job, I think, of laying out capital and laying out the returns. You can get a pretty good idea of what ultimately those projects and new ones coming up are going to contribute. Now, on the timing there's no doubt that that much of the big numbers on those two pages will not be producing income until starting later in 2021 and then forward. They\u2019re big projects. And by the way, that construction does have certainly in the case of Pike & Rose or in Assembly, it does have an impact slight but it's got an impact on the rest of the project because there's more stuff happening with dump trucks and that kind of stuff. So, you should assume later in 2021 is when you're going to \u2013 is when the big stuff on pages 17 and 18 starts producing. And as Dan went through, you'll get some of that in 2020 including, by the way, a big one in 700 Santana Row in Splunk, but there's a lot more coming. So, you'll have to back-weigh that. So, we're still growing, Ki Bin, we're still growing. Ki Bin Kim : Yeah. I mean the reason I asked that is that we've had a couple of years of low growth and I know you're investing for the future and it's all the right decisions, but at least in the near or medium term, the market is trying to figure out when we get back to that 4% or 5% FFO growth on trajectory. That's why I asked those questions. Don Wood : No. And as\u2026 Ki Bin Kim : And just\u2026 Don Wood : Go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : And are you working on anything to perhaps try to decrease that downtime when you already have a leaf on hand and when you have a tenant moving out which I\u2019m trying to know that gap of that downtime? Don Wood : Absolutely yes. In fact, if you could read our goals and objectives for the company, it is the single biggest thing, not from the first leasing person\u2019s discussion with a tenant to the first dollar of rent that gets recorded in the P&L all along that process, major initiative to reduce that time. And it includes some things that you would assume, like a simpler lease, it assumes some things you might not assume, like how tenant coordination happens and who does the work and how it gets priced out and things like that. It assume some changes in terms of the marketing materials that leasing agents use and how they use them. And all the way through, it is a primary focus of this and I would suspect most companies in this space in 2020. Ki Bin Kim : All right. Thanks, Don. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Yeah. Hi. A few things. First, I was wondering, can you talk about the timing and the magnitude of the recently that were \u2013 the recent unanticipated bankruptcies that you've been talking about? Don Wood : Yeah. I think we've taken a, kind of, an holistic and \u2013 a view of \u2013 look, there\u2019s uncertainty in these restructuring processes. And we've taken an estimate of how we anticipate getting potential stores back, what stores will stay in place and so forth and we made that estimate. I don't think that there's a, like a, kind of, a good answer for you in terms of helping you with your \u2013 with kind of specificity like Pier 1. I mean I think we're in pretty good shape at Pier 1, where we're, basically, released on one of them. Another one is going to stay because it's one of their top performing stores in the region and the remaining two out of three were trading paper and should have them leased up probably by end of the year. But it's tough to, kind of, go through each one of them and the bankruptcy process is an unpredictable and so we'll see how it plays out. Michael Mueller : Got it. And maybe a couple other numbers questions here. What was the lease term come in the fourth quarter? Don Wood : Lease term income was gross fees of about $3.8 million in the quarter and that was roughly in line with kind of what we had expected. Michael Mueller : Got it. Don Wood : Got it. Okay. Thanks. And last question, with no dispositions in the guidance and 450 \u2013 I think it was $400 million to $450 million of spend, of investment spend. What's the equity assumption baked into 2020 FFO guidance? Dan Guglielmone : Yeah. Over the course of the year, what\u2019s reflected in our guidance is about $125 million of incremental equity, consistent with what we have done over the years in that range and it would be kind of played out over the year in terms of your models. But we've got the balance sheet that we don't have to use that. We've got other sources that will fill the gap whether it be incremental leverage, leverage neutral, leverage asset sales, cash on hand, free cash flow. We've got a lot of tools in the tool box in addition to kind of the opportunistic equity insurance that we've been fortunate to be able to issue over the years. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi. Good morning. I'm just curious, when you lose a grocer such as Fairway, how does it impact the adjacent small shop tenants? Are there other typically co-tenancy clauses that allow them to immediately pay lower rent once the grocer closes? Dan Guglielmone : No, there are not, Vince, particularly in any strong located place like that. It wouldn't be \u2013 certainly wouldn't be in our lease. And while we didn't write that lease that was before that there is no such impact there. So, just the grocery, just that box. But on the other side of that, can you imagine putting a better grocer in that box and what the impact that would have in terms of traffic to the balance of the \u2013 the balance of the space, something that we're counting on. Vince Tibone : Right. Makes sense. Let me just kind of [indiscernible] that, just how surprised were you by the Fairway bankruptcy? And just in general, like how worried are you about some of the smaller regional grocers out there? Are you expecting more bankruptcies to occur over the next five years, let's say as the grocery industry is kind of evolving here? Don Wood : Well, let me answer that question in two ways. One, not surprised at all with respect to Fairway bankruptcy. Frankly, it was one of the most \u2013 one of the most important parts of our due diligence on buying the asset, and if you knew what we did for due diligence, much of our time was spent figuring out how much demand there was for that space and at what rent they would pay. So no, no surprise there at all. In terms of the bigger question, I don't \u2013 new grocery is very different than any other category, and this kind of goes back to the two \u2013 the beginning part of what we were talking about here. I \u2013 we\u2019re not just about filling boxes up. We really are about bringing these retail products to places, shopping centers, and mix of these properties to places that will be the best five years from now. And so, to the extent, more groceries go out, smaller grocers \u2013 less well-capitalized grocers, which if they don't have a particular niche, sure. They're under margin pressure all the way through. Completely agree with that. But again, so what to the extent you've got backfill opportunities that are more sustainable to what that shopping center should be in any particular neighborhood or community. And our stuff as you know\\ is a lot bigger on average and a lot more regional on average than a traditional grocery anchored shopping center in a lot of markets. It's more than doubled the size on average in GLA, for example, and land. So, it's all about from a landlord\u2019s perspective, options, alternatives and it's hard to imagine there isn't more disruption in the grocery business. Of course, there will be. Just as there will be in every other sector as we move forward. But I think we're well prepared to use that to create better retail destinations. Vince Tibone : Thanks, Don. Very interesting color. Operator : Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi. In terms of occupancy troughing to mid-93% leased and mid-91% occupied. But then getting stronger in the second half of 2020 and to 2021, where are you hoping to end the year in terms for occupancy or 2020? Don Wood : I would say that kind of back at kind of current levels. We expect kind of a dip over the course of the year and targeting getting back to kind of what our year-end levels were in 2019. But over the course of that, obviously, we'll work our way through kind of that trough\u2026 Linda Tsai : And then\u2026 Don Wood : \u2026and still grow bottom line. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then do reimbursement see more of an impact this year given lower occupancy? Don Wood : Sure. I mean, absolutely with \u2013 and we don't talk about that enough right. With triple-net leases effectively losing any tenant in that space, somebody\u2019s got to pay those bills. And it\u2019s us. So, there's no doubt that hurts earnings, too. I think the point that's really important understand here though is with reduced occupancy as expected, we are projecting FFO growth. That's pretty, pretty incredible actually. And that speaks to the balance of the project \u2013 the balance of the portfolio, I think. Linda Tsai : Agree. And then do you have any Lucky's or Earth Fare to some topic of grocers? Don Wood : No. We have neither. Linda Tsai : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed you\u2019re your question. Floris van Dijkum : Great. Thanks, guys. A quick question. The 1% credit reserve percent credit reserve that you have baked in, how does that compare to your five-year historical realized credit losses? Don Wood : It's actually very much in line with our five-year history and actually where we come out in terms of actual. There's not a material difference but 100 basis points has been pretty consistent at least since I've been here. And the actual results are kind of in line roughly with the \u2013 with those reserves. Floris van Dijkum : Okay. And then maybe a quick question on the residential rents. What has your experience been on the rental increases after the first year\u2019s rents on newly-developed departments? What kind of increases have you seen at Assembly or at Santana? And how should we think about Pike & Rose in terms of increases for residential? Or do you think that market is different than you think is going to be a little softer than Boston and San Jose? Don Wood : Yeah. Floris, it's a great question. I mean, obviously, our best population from which to get that information is Santana because we\u2019ve been open as long as we have and I can tell you that the annual CAGR for those residential rents has been about 3.8%, almost 4% over that period of time, not every year during it but strong. Now, come over to Assembly, Assembly is really interesting because it \u2013 if you remember, we started out with AvalonBay during the first phases of residential. We then added [indiscernible] which is a big good 500-unit building. And now, we are adding more supply. And even with all that happening, we've seen rental growth that's \u2013 and again, it's only a couple of years in excess of 4%. So that's real strong. In terms of Montgomery County, it\u2019s clearly been weaker. Montgomery County and therefore for Pike & Rose on the residential rents side over the past three or four \u2013 the first three or four years was essentially flat. We are now in the last 12 to 15 months seeing the first signs of real strength from that perspective. And by the way, not surprisingly, that is very much in line with the strength that we're seeing on traffic counts and sales on the retail piece. So as these communities become more mature, there is no doubt that that ignores to the residential up top. So, very hopeful to see sustainable, call it, 3% at these properties over the long term. Floris van Dijkum : Great. Thanks, Dan. Don Wood : You bet. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Leah Brady for closing comments. Leah Brady : Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you in the next couple of weeks. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Leah Brady. Please go ahead. Leah Brady : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker, and Melissa Solis. They\u2019ll be available to take your questions at conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty\u2019s future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from information in our forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday are in a report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have also posted on the website a slide deck that has more detailed information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business to-date and various actions we have taken in response to COVID-19. These documents are available on our website. Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person during the Q&A portion and you should feel free to jump back in the queue if you have any additional questions. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our first quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thank you, Leah, and good morning, everyone. There's a certain comfort in the familiarity of the well-worn quarterly routine of the earnings call with each of you that's oddly reassuring to me as we battle through this mess each day and preparation for advantageous positioning coming out the other side. First, my heartfelt thoughts and prayers for good health to each of you and your families and friends in this crazy time, particularly those of you holed up in small spaces in my favorite city, home to the 27-time World Champion, New York Yankees. Next, a shout out of immense respect and appreciation for the unity and the work ethic of the Federal Realty team on the front lines over these past six to eight weeks, including our property management team, who is taking care of our assets so that essential businesses could provide those services to the community, and also to those team members whose jobs weren't full time anymore and who volunteered for the numerous new areas where their help was needed. Top to bottom, everything in between, thank you. This is one dedicated and talented team. Let me start with a few comments about the first quarter, and then move on to today's situation where and we are headed from here. As you saw in our press release last night, we reported FFO of $1.50 a share in the first quarter compared with $1.56 in last year's first quarter. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, we were going to have a tough year-over-year comp because of the $5.4 million in lease termination fees in last year's quarter compared with $2.7 million this quarter or a difference of roughly $0.03 a share. But we were having a great start of the year up until the last two weeks in March, and we were on track to grow FFO per share ex termination fees by 2% to 3%. That changed in a blink with mandated shutdowns and fear of the uncertain future. The states that we do business in were among the first to close. And by the second half of March, we were really feeling the heavy drop-off in activity. Rent payment deficiencies and increased bad debt provisions, among other items, directly attributed to COVID-19, totaled $4 million or $0.06 per share in the first quarter. Still a pretty solid quarter, which also included over 80 leases executed for nearly 0.5 million square feet. So we went into this whole mess in a strong position from both an operational and, most certainly, a balance sheet perspective. So I guess, the real question is, will we make it through? And what will we look like on the other side? First things first. Yes, we will make it through. Dan will spend considerable time going through our current cash position, cash flow projections, our development spending flexibility and plans for additional financing. One comment from me in that regard. History and track record really matters at a time like this. A reminder that in 2009, in the depths of the recession when markets were closed to many, many borrowers, we accessed the unsecured market. We accessed the we secured bank debt from a consortium of lenders. We upsized our line of credit. We even issued a small amount of common equity. The point is that all of those markets were open to us then, and our balance sheet and competitive position is even stronger today. Again, Dan G. on our plans in a bit. Our development spend, which approximated $35 million a month coming into April, has been pared to about $10 million a month, with the Massachusetts and California shutdowns at Assembly Row and Santana West and a few other smaller projects saving cash currently. Construction at CocoWalk in Florida and 909 Rose at Pike & Rose in Maryland continue, as both are nearly complete and, in fact, will be over the next few months. We have every intention to complete all of our development projects that are partially constructed. The start of construction on all new development projects are, however, on hold until we have some better visibility on the length of the pandemic's effects. Okay, rent collection. It's obviously impossible for a simple tell-all statistic or metric to try to explain such a multifaceted and complicated phenomena as the virtual shutdown of the entire U.S. economy by a pandemic, and April rent collections certainly are not that metric. But they're a relevant piece of data. They're easy to understand. They fit neatly on a matrix of comparative companies. But like same-store NOI, it's just not that simple and is such a small part of the company's post-COVID viability and growth prospects. More on that in a minute. For the record, we collected 53% of our contractual rent in April, which we expect to be better than the mall sector and a little bit less than the grocery-anchored shopping centers who have a tenant base more highly geared to essentials. Our portfolio is far more diversified, which we see as a major strength, not a weakness, for any period in history and any economy in history other than in the quarter or two that a global pandemic literally shuts down the world. All 104 of our shopping centers are open and operating with about 47% of the tenants open and trying to do some level of business. About 1/4 of our rent comes from essential services, grocery, drug, banks, etc., and that was largely paid in April. Another 20% comes from our residential and office tenants, largely in our mixed-use communities. 95% of our resi rent for April was collected, as was 87% of office rent. Restaurants make up 15% of our rental base, about 1/2 full-service and 1/2 QSRs and fast food. About 1/4 of that rent was paid in April. Fitness and experiential tenants, like theaters and bowling concepts, comprise another 6%, and very little April rent was collected in that category. Payment was sporadic on the balance of the portfolio. So our first response for non-payers was, of course, to communicate with clarity that we expect existing contracts to be honored, and in many cases, they were. Others did not pay, have been put on default and no active conversations are under way between the parties for a whole host of reasons. These are largely small tenants who were struggling pre-COVID-19 and will have a hard time reemerging on the other side. Vacancy will clearly be higher on the other side of this crisis, no good prediction on how much higher at this point. The remainder are those tenants who have the wherewithal to pay but who are looking for deferrals for the periods that they are closed and some for a couple of months after. These negotiations are complex and consider many factors, including the easing of lease restrictions that may impair our ability to redevelop down the road. We don't have a blanket policy for handling these negotiations. This is a really important point. One of the many advantages of our platform is that we're small enough to have senior level experienced executives handle each of these conversations on a one-off individual basis. We believe that, that individualized approach will lead to the best result for Federal as a whole as we look to the coming years and not just months. So I think all of that is a pretty good summary of what's happening right now. You can find additional information in a presentation available on our investor website. Check it out, it's thorough, if you haven't already. Let me move on to give you a few thoughts about where we see ourselves on the other side of this. And as you would expect from me, let me start with the short-term negatives. First, geography. No surprise here. The states we do business in will largely be the last to reopen and likely with the most stringent conditions, California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, etc. the list, clearly a negative relative to the middle of the country in terms of the second quarter and probably third quarter activity. Second, our tenant makeup. More lifestyle and entertainment-oriented restaurants and retailers that are not essential for consumers during a pandemic, as I laid out in the percentages above. So those two things, geography and tenant mix, are not conducive to outperformance or accurately predicting performance at all in the second or third quarters of 2020, perhaps longer. Accordingly, we're in no position to offer earnings guidance for any period at this point. What we can do, however, is share our thoughts as to a pretty compelling plan and vision for our properties, enhance growth on the other side of this. First, from the demand side. We see the geography negative in the short term as a huge positive on the other side of this. At the end of the day, real estate needs to be near high-paying job centers to be able to grow and value, ours are. They're in densely populated and affluent first-tier suburbs to major coastal cities, but not in the central business districts of those cities. Plus, they're open air. Think Bethesda and North Bethesda, Maryland, relative to Downtown D.C.; Coconut Grove to downtown Miami; Hoboken to Manhattan; San Jose to San Francisco; El Segundo to Downtown Los Angeles; Summerville, Massachusetts, to downtown Boston; Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, to downtown Philly; you get the idea. Open-air places, not enclosed buildings, that are easily accessible by car with convenient parking, close enough to high-wage job centers that are able to take to attract the latest tenants and, and this is really important, provide a full array of services. The luxuries and conveniences that both city and suburban people have grown accustomed to and, in fact, demand aren't likely to be given up on easily. It's kind of a Goldilocks scenario here, not too close, not too far, just right in terms of those locations. Might what we've always believed to be the sweet spot, those close in first-tier suburbs, be even sweeter in a post COVID-19 world? We think so. Second, landlord organized and integrated curbside delivery programs. That's landlord organized and integrated curbside delivery programs at shopping centers and mixed-use communities in densely populated first-tier suburbs need to be, in our view, a permanent component of a property's toolkit for attracting customers, and not just for food. Face it, delivering goods and services to the end user profitably has not been broadly solved. Customer pickup in an attractive, convenient, safe environment is the most important piece to economically delivering goods that last mile. We'll be a leader in landlord-integrated curbside delivery on the other side of this. And third, it's not hard to see how the steady drumbeat of enclosed mall tenants who have been moving at least partly to open-air shopping centers over the past several years doesn't accelerate meaningfully in the wake of COVID-19. When you think about which open-air properties are most likely to garner a disproportionate share of that movement, Federal formats, tenant mix and locations are pretty darn well positioned. We think this is one of the most important sources of where new tenant demand comes from that's necessary to replace the COVID-19 retail failures. There's also a fourth and a fifth and a sixth set of initiatives that we're working on that are too premature to talk about at this point, but they all relate directly to why all of us at Federal are, while patiently working through this awful pandemic today, extremely excited about what awaits as we work into the other side later this year and next and for many years after that. So as you sit back and take a break from compiling April rent collection stats and think about the future of the 25 or so publicly traded retail-oriented real estate companies and business today, I think you'd agree with me that our locations, our formats, our diversity and innovative team should put us at the top of that list. Let me now turn it over to Dan before addressing your questions. Dan? Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. FFO of $1.50 per share represented a largely intact first quarter. As Don mentioned, prior to the March impact of COVID-19 on our numbers, we were on pace to outperform our internal forecast by about $0.03 or $0.04 per share, with COVID-19 impacts representing roughly $0.06 of negative drag. Overall, the numbers in the first quarter were driven primarily by Splunk taking position possession on time at 700 Santana Row on February 1, lower property-level expenses and lower G&A offset by the aforementioned COVID-19-related impacts in the last three weeks of March, which included higher bad debt expense than we had forecast, lower contribution from our hotel JVs than forecast, lower parking revenue and higher interest expense, given the cash position we built. Our comparable POI metric came in at a negative 2.5% for the first quarter, but don't be alarmed. Excluding term fee headwinds, which were expected, of a negative 1.8% and COVID-19-related POI impacts in the same-store pool of a negative 1.7%, comparable POI would have been a positive 1%, a result which would have also exceeded our internal expectations. Through March 15, we were also having a solid first quarter on the leasing front with almost 500,000 square feet of activity. Leases of note where merchandising was meaningfully enhanced and our rents increased include T.J. Maxx replacing Staples at Andorra in Philly; Burlington taking the Bon-Ton box at Brick in New Jersey; Old Navy at the old Pier one in Mount Vernon, Virginia; a renowned South Miami restaurant group signing on with a new concept of the former Gap ground floor space at CocoWalk; and converting retail space to creative office space for a cutting-edge cosmetic line at the collection at Plaza Segundo in LA; all examples of our ability to drive demand from best-in-class tenants across property types due to the strength of our real estate locations. This has continued into the second quarter with deals signed over the last 30 days with two top grocers as well as a major office tenant. Plus, we have seen real estate committees at these retailers open up in recent weeks with site approvals coming in at several additional locations. Add in a bidding war for our Fairway grocer location in our recently acquired Brooklyn asset, and you see demand for our real estate from top tenant continues, albeit at lower volume, even in the midst of a global pandemic. Let me take a step back and take a few moments to comment on the overall profitability of Federal from a fundamental perspective. We have a high-margin business at the property level with PO margins just under 70%. Breakeven cash collection for POI at the property level is right around 30%. Breakeven cash collection after G&A, after interest expense, after maintenance and leasing capital is roughly 60%. While our second quarter and the balance of 2020 will be challenging, no doubt, our cash burn rate from operations even in the second quarter should be minimal. Let me take a moment to highlight our updated disclosure. Both Leah and Don highlighted our COVID-19 business update and its availability on the front page of our Investors section of our website. Additionally, in our 8-K supplement, you may have noticed an office tenant. Splunk is now our top tenant, albeit at a very manageable exposure of 3.4% of revenues. For those unfamiliar, Splunk is a leader in data software analytics, security and operations. A public company since 2012, Splunk has a market capitalization in excess of $20 billion, roughly $2.4 billion of revenue last year and has a leading industry position in all things data. Lastly, in March, we posted on our newly designed Federal 1962 branded website, our inaugural ESG-focused corporate responsibility report entitled A Sustainable Mindset. It is a comprehensive overview of our long-standing commitment to ESG throughout all aspects of our business. Now on to the balance sheet and liquidity. In mid-March, we drew down close to our entire $1 billion credit facility given concerns over the stability of the financial markets. At quarter end, we continued to have that $1 billion of cash on hand. PAUSE that time, we have raised an additional $400 million in an unsecured term loan. The term loan has a 1-year maturity with a 1-year extension option and an interest rate set at LIBOR plus 135 given our A- rating. These moves provide us with substantial pro forma liquidity of $1.4 billion in cash on hand and available credit capacity as we navigate through these uncertain times. Our credit metrics remain strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.7 times, fixed charge coverage at four times and a weighted average debt maturity of 10 years. We remain well positioned to manage through the challenging environment we currently face, like we have done time and time again over our 58-year history and our 52-year track record of cash flow stability and increasing dividends. Our A-, A3 ratings from S&P and Moody's, respectively, should provide us with continued access to the unsecured bond market at attractive interest rate levels. We expect to refinance our manageable debt maturities, $340 million, through the year-end 2021, primarily in this market. Our diversity of other attractively priced funding sources continues to be a differentiating factor for Federal. The quality of our real estate still commands premium pricing in the institutional sales market, as evident by our most recent asset sale last week in Pasadena at a 4.5% cap rate. And the ability to partner with attractively priced passive joint venture capital remains high. Now let me provide you with a more fulsome update on our development pipeline. At 3/31, roughly $675 million is remaining to be spent on our in-process pipeline. That pipeline is disclosed in our 8-K on pages 17 16 and 17 and outlines our redevelopment and development, respectively. Updated timing given the government-mandated shutdowns at our two largest projects. Assembly Row and at Santana Row, push out the time line somewhat. $250 million to $275 million is estimated to be spent for the balance of 2020, with most of our projected second quarter spend being pushed out at least a month or two on average. $250 million is now projected to be spent in 2021, with the balance $150 million to $175 million in 2022 and into 2023. Over 80% of that pipeline is nonretail, with 55-plus percent amenitized office and 25-plus percent residential, all of which are located in first-tier suburbs. And note that 50% of the commercial, office and retail, is pre-leased. Also note that we have the ability to hit the pause button on roughly $280 million of this existing pipeline, which would reduce the in-process pipeline's remaining spend to less than $400 million. To clarify, at the current time, hitting the pause button is not our objective nor our current plan. But as is our hallmark, we will maintain discipline in those capital allocation decisions as we move forward. As you saw yesterday, we declared a regular cash dividend of $1.05 per share payable in July. Given the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position, our goal is to maintain a cash dividend and push our 52-year record of increasing dividends to 53. However, again, the management team and our Board of Directors will be extremely disciplined in setting our dividend policy as we navigate moving forward. Lastly, FFO guidance for 2020 was withdrawn back in March. We hope to reintroduce guidance when we have a better visibility on the impact of COVID-19 on our business over the coming quarters. And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Craig Schmidt : Good morning. Don Wood : Good morning, Craig. Craig Schmidt : Yes, In talking about the expanding and enhancement of the curbside service and delivery, is any of that going to require any zoning differences that you might need to have to accommodate that? Or are you well within the bounds of staying within your current zoning? Don Wood : Craig, we've got a lot of different property types in a lot of different places, and we don't expect zoning to be an issue. There are clearly certain things that need to be done. For example, at Pike & Rose, we needed to get the county to give up some parking spaces that they get paid on that they were able to do, which I just loved. At most of our shopping centers, that's not a problem, but we do have fire lanes and other reasons things that we need to work through. So what the most important thing, I think, to understand about this is that the evolution of curbside pickup and the integration of it from the landlord's perspective with multiple tenants I really think is something that we are just starting but over the next quarters and years will become such an integral part of what we do that we'll solve the inherent issues that are bound to come up with 100 properties and implementing this along the way. But zoning should not be the primary concern. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And then just real quick, are you having any discussions with retailers who are looking to move to an all-percentage rent as opposed to fixed minimum rents? Don Wood : Sure. Let me put it to you this way. Every tenant is trying to somehow renegotiate the contract. And all kinds of ideas are coming through what they would what it is that they would like to do. And I this cannot be I cannot state this enough. The beauty of this place is that we do not have a policy on how we're going to handle certain types of tenants. Because of our size, which is relatively small and manageable, we can take a senior executive, whether it's me or Wendy Seher or Jeff Berkes or Jan Sweetnam or Lance Billingsley, there are 10 of us at a senior level that can have each of these conversations with each different business, each different retailer, specifically to come up with the best solution. All kinds of things are being asked, as you can imagine. But at the other side of this, retailers need to be in productive shopping centers. They need to be in places where they're going to be able to make money. We're at the top of those lists. So our negotiating ability, while certainly not perfect, and our contracts, while certainly not perfect, are pretty darn advantageous to be able to allow us to get to an economic solution on the other side of this. Do I expect some percentage rent deals? Of course, I expect some percentage rent deals. But I also expect different conditions under which you operate, including some easing of restrictions that were hard for us to redevelop, for example, along the way. So there's a lot there's a long way to play this stuff all out yet over the next six months or so. We're not rushing. We're going to have one by one conversations to get them right. Craig Schmidt : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Don, I know it's early, but how have rent collections trended so far in May? Do you have any rough estimates or expectations for final collections relative to April? And then I'm sure you're spending a lot of time thinking about the financial solvency of your tenants, and we're just curious what percent you think might not be recoverable in terms of rents. Or maybe another way to think about that is what percent of leases do you expect to switch to cash accounting? Don Wood : Gosh, Greg, you had so much in there. I'm going to go through the first part and see if Melissa and Dan want to add anything to it. I suspect the answer is going to be no. But I could look, I could tell you that May has started out, we're ahead of April. I don't even know why we're ahead of April, but where we were in terms of at this point in April, and that's an important point to make. For the first few days that we've collected more than we did in April at that point. Whether that's sustainable or not, I don't know. Well, obviously, we'll have to see what happens all the way through. And in terms of the I'll make one point on cash versus accrual and the accounting part of this, where my focus is, is really not so much on where yours is in terms of those focuses. Mine is all about how on the other side of this we've got a growth plan with new tenants and different places to get those new tenants, as I laid that out.  And those places those tenants that really have a business plan going forward, I'm not really all that about taking tenants that had a hard time coming in here and doing whatever we can to keep them in the shopping center. I don't think that's necessarily the best way to move forward. And so all the focus here, while the day to day of negotiation is on 2021, 2022 where effectively will not only maintain but expand our leadership position. I don't know, you guys, if you want to add anything to that at all, but I guess. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. No, look, it's a moving target with regards to kind of what we see as collectability from our tenants, and we'll make assessments as we move forward. So there's not much we can add there, except to concur with what Don highlighted. Unidentified Analyst : All right. That's fair. And then could you just dig into the restaurant rent collections a little bit more? What were the collections like on quick service versus full service? And then what gives you confidence that full-service tenants can survive this or be able to pay back deferred rent given what's likely to be a diminished business for a while? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. No, look, there was a differentiation between what was collected with regards to we had quick service we have essentially 27%. Don mentioned a 1/ 4, about 27% total in restaurants. Roughly 37% would be QSRs and the fast food, and then less than 20% from full service. Don Wood : And Greg, let me jump on the point about what makes us think we can go forward with respect to that because that's a real important one. We have circled about 35 tenants, restaurant tenants, that were incredibly strong that we want to make sure open back up quickly. And when they do, they're such an important part of the shopping center? So we've circled we've actually authorized a $10 million fund that is available for tenants to effectively reopen, only select restaurant tenants that we've designated to effectively go there. That we are in the early stages of that because that's not PPP money that we're talking about. It's not specifically tied to the employees of those restaurants. It's about getting them back open and the working capital necessary to get them back open. We're not going to do that with failing restaurants. We're only doing that with our strong restaurants who've come in but are challenged today financially to be able to get that initial start going back. So it's an important part of what we do in terms of our merchandising of a shopping center and mixed-use property, but it's one that we're highly focused on to make sure we're investing in the best ones. Unidentified Analyst : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Christy McElroy : Hi, good morning. Thank you, Don. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you made in the opening remarks about your markets and demographics. And so on one hand, you're in coastal market, but it seems like things are shut down longer, but you also have higher-income demographics that may not be as impacted in terms of job losses. But you also have a longer-term trend here of potentially greater work-from-home trends that could result in more people moving to lower cost of living markets that could impact that historical high wage job centers that you discussed. How are you thinking about all these factors today, not just from a retail perspective but office and [resi] as well? Don Wood : Yes. Christy, first of all, who knows, right? It's this is really it's really hard to predict where we're going to go other than to say, I believe think about yourself, think how and your team and how comfortable you've gotten with services, the level of services that you've had over the past five or six or seven years. I don't believe that those urban and you're not as urban as some of the folks in your spot, but those urban folks are going to move out to second- and third-tier suburbs. It's just too it's too much of a drop-off in what was available to them. But I do believe in those first-tier suburbs, which where we are, the ability to have it all. I do think there's this is going to be a resurgence for cars and your own personal transportation device as opposed to mass transit for a while and maybe longer in a while. I don't know. We'll see how that plays out, but I think that's critical. The other thing, and I don't know if this if, I don't whether we disclosed this or not, but I find this interesting. In our big 3, the Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row, all of whom are in those that first-tier suburban area, right, while we absolutely did not collect a lot of the lifestyle rent on the retail side, overall, we collected 2/3 of the rent due in those properties because of the residential, because of the office component to it. So the notion of those places as kind of centers of jobs, those places the centers of living and the new style for doing, it. I think we're right in the middle of it. Right where we belong. So the specifics to your question, right, we'll have to see. Let's see how it plays out. But at the end of the day, the real estate is sure conducive to where the jobs are, whether they're at home or in the existing place that they're at or and certainly for the retailers to be able to create sales and value there. So I'm feeling pretty good about the position. Christy McElroy : Okay. I agree. I'm probably an anomaly in terms of where I live. I understand your dividend payment track record and the importance of that, but the dividend can be an annual payment. Just you're doing a lot to shore up liquidity in terms of including the new term loan. Can you discuss the Board's decision not to just sort of suspend the payment for now given the current environment and sort of take a more of a wait-and-see approach? Don Wood : Very, very much so. Listen, a lot of people are would say, and I've seen it in some of the notes, \"Well, Federal is very proud of their long-term dividend record, and that's why they keep making their payments or that's why they made their payment.\" That's not true. Well, it is true that we're proud. But the reason the biggest single reason to continue our dividend payment to the extent we can, and as Dan said, we'll evaluate it every three months, and I'll get to your annual question in a minute, is because on the other side of this, down the road, there's going to have to be equity issued. And the ability to effectively look back at 2020 and say, the company was able effectively to maintain that very important part of total return for a shareholder is really important in our view. And so today, as we as we understand where our ability to access capital is, how that is going, and I think, as Dan alluded to, we'll have more to say about that in the next couple of weeks or whatever with additional financing, then we think it's important to, at this point, declare July. We'll absolutely reassess that come August with respect to the next payment. But the difference between simply annual and quarterly in the whole scheme of what is now today $1.4 billion worth of capacity is made sense for us to make an $80 million dividend declaration. Christy McElroy : Okay, thank Don. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Good morning. Hopefully, Lebanese Taverna is one of your restaurants that you're looking that's on that 25 to 35 list. So two questions from us. The first one, Don, is how do you when you're working with tenants, how do you make them realize that rents are contractual? That this is not some new era where suddenly tenants, I mean, we've even seen some big tenants take a loss where they suddenly can arbitrarily get this right to not pay? How do you enforce and make clear that tenants have to absolutely honor these contractual obligations and that this is not some new right that they now can use whenever they get into a distressed situation? Don Wood : Boy, Alex, first of all, I don't know how to answer that question. I mean they understand that. It is a negotiation. There is there are businesses trying to take advantage of a situation to effectively void a contract. That's on I don't know why anybody would be surprised at that in a time like this. And so you take your legal rights, your contractual rights, you put them up against the viability of the company that you're talking about, your alternatives and where you think you can go and where you're going to be on the other side of this, and you see what you get, what you can get or what you need because, by the way, we want some stuff out of that contract, too. And so the negotiation starts. It's not about explaining to them their legal obligations. They understand their legal obligations. And the default rates default notices that we're sending make that very clear behind it. So yes, I don't know really how much more to add to that, that I could. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Don, that's helpful. And then the second question is you mentioned the value and the benefit of the office and the residential for your mixed-use as far as powering through the overall centers' rent collection. As you look at your portfolio across your lifestyle projects, your row projects and your traditional shopping center projects, are you noticing better trends with the mixed use because of that commercial element? Or is it really coming down to the particular tenant mix in that one center just by nature of the tenant mix they had was really the overall driver of why that center did better? I'm sort of curious if basically, if having the office and the residential provides more stability or if it really comes down to the tenant mix, in which case, a shopping center with a lot of essentials will maybe do better. And therefore, as you guys think about how you're going to tenant projects, tenant mix as you've always said, tenant mix becomes even more important. Don Wood : Let's put it this way. First of all, we do believe that the residents, in particular in our mixed-use projects, because of the rents are generally and where we are, more affluent and, at least so far, have maintained their jobs more so than rental tenants in kind of a traditional use for an apartment where you're in an apartment because you can't afford a house. We don't generally have those type of tenants in the mixed-use places we have. So generally, I'm not surprised that we're collecting as well as we're collecting throughout those uses. They're there for a reason. They're there because of that amenitized base. And so if most of them have the wherewithal to pay and they've got the amenitized base down below, even though the amenitized base is less essential, if you will, as defined by grocer and drug in April and May, believe me, the stuff that's down there on the retail side of those mixed-use projects is essential on a longer-term basis because that's their life. That includes the right food. That includes the right shopping. That all of those pieces are critical to why they chose to live there in the first place. We're in the first two months of a global shutdown. Making long-term predictions about the collectability overall, whether it's those particular tenants or future tenants, is you can't take April rents to make that decision about going forward there. I feel the mix that we have moving toward urban mixed-use and even our grocery-anchored infill locations are all the trends that were there before will only be solidified on the other side of this pandemic. So that's how I view it. Alexander Goldfarb : Don, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Don Wood : Shivani? Leah Brady : Operator, let's move to the next question. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Jeremy Metz : Just following up, Don, on that last question and going back to your comments in the opening about the curbside and being a leader there, just given all the projects under way in planning, the big developments, the redevelopments, the box repositioning, you're looking at some of these industries being impacted, some down in May, potentially worse off or just even with just different future expansion plans. Is there any additional color here on just how you and the team are maybe shifting your plans around, if at all, as you envision curating some of these or any additional on the design or redesign at this point beyond just the curbside piece of it? Is it just on the margin? Or is there any wholesale rethinking in some cases here? Don Wood : Yes. That's a good question, Jeremy. It's no, there has been no wholesale rethinking. I mean, effectively, and it does go back to what I was saying before, we if you think about physically where our places are and what advantages we have coming out of the recession based on those locations, then we want to exploit, as best we can, the advantages we see. Those advantages include, obviously, an enhanced level of service. Curbside is a big piece of it. But it will be the way we do curbside going forward that's the real differentiator. Think about how comfortable it is if you live in a community to use your shopping center for all if you could, for all purposes, for all services that you use. Sometimes you feel like strolling, sometimes you got 20 minutes and you got to pick something up and move along and everything in between. So we want to take advantage of our position that way. Certainly, open air versus enclosed, hard to imagine that's not an advantage. And so we want to take advantage of the formats that we have. Now coming out on the other side, to the extent we're looking at new projects, to your point, we will look at it with the best information we have at the time. But as I sit here on May seven or whatever day it is today in the middle of the crisis, I kind of like where we are and how we set this up despite what will clearly be a much tougher environment to produce results for the next quarter or two. Jeremy Metz : Yes. I think that's fair. And then second one for me. Just a quick one here on Hoboken. I think you and your partner, they had some additional assets on the contract. Just wondering what the latest status is of those and possibly timing? And then if that's part of the capital plan Dan G. laid out building up some liquidity for? And then maybe on top of that, how should we think about executing the additional asset sales you had originally planned as the transaction markets open back up here? Don Wood : Sure. The first of all, with respect to Hoboken, everything we thought going into Hoboken, we continue to think today. But as you would expect, the deals that were not done yet, we continue to look with our partner for other deals and have made some pretty good progress in moving some deals along. We're not going to close them right now. We're going to sit back. We're going to see how this all plays out. I believe, on the other side, we'll wind up picking that stuff back up, but let's see where we are at that point. So that's -- and that's the Hoboken piece to it. What's the second part of your question? I hate to do it again. Leah Brady : Property sales? Don Wood : Wait what? Leah Brady : Property sales that are in the pipeline. Don Wood : Yes. Property sales in the pipeline. Again, it's yes, I got you. Look, we're just going to take a pause on that right now. Hard to tell where those markets would be. You did see that we did close on Pasadena in the quarter, by the way, and at a sub-5% cap, which says something. But obviously, that deal was negotiated before. Unidentified Company Representative : But they had the ability with full visibility of COVID to back out of the deal, and they didn't. And you're priced at a 4.5% cap, I think, says a lot about real estate quality even in this environment. Don Wood : In terms of future asset sales that are on hold right now. We'll reevaluate later in the year. Jeremy Metz : Yes thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Tenant fallout and run rate NOI erosion, do you think this is better, worse or the same as the GFC? Don Wood : Gosh, Mike, so different, so, so different. I don't know the answer to your question. I really don't know whether it's not the same as the big recession. Obviously, it is a I mean, the globe has been closed down economically. There's I don't think anything that's been like that. And so as things start loosening up, I do think, as I said, we'll be one of the last to effectively have people have those jurisdictions restrictions come off. But I can also I also think it's less about having the restrictions come off and more about the populace getting comfortable and feeling safe in coming back out to the community, and that's going to happen that's already happening in the markets we're in today. I know I come to work every day, and I know that I've seen traffic in the states I'm in, Virginia and Maryland, that has continued to build, as I'm sure most of you have seen, and nothing has changed with respect to the restrictions, specifically, where we are. So as that builds back, the question is, how can we get these businesses back up? And effectively, how soon will the market accept them? I'm optimistic, but I do think we're talking about 2021 where we see some any kind of level of normalcy in activity. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then the press release, you talked about slower construction pace because of safety protocols. And I guess, do you see that as something that's just a temporary phenomenon or something along the lines of more of a new norm? And what are some examples of what's changed on the ground for the projects? Dan Guglielmone : Like everything else, I think you'll see a slow comeback to \"normalcy\". But I do what those safety protocols are right now are specific distancing, specific rules with respect to cleanliness and masks and how many people can be working in a particular area. I do think that will for the projects that are closed down, as they come back up, I do believe those protocols will be in place. Whether they're in place forever or not remains to be seen. But it's stuff like that, which is, frankly, the same protocols that you see in a grocery store or anywhere else during the crisis, a lot of consistency. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. That is it, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Vince Tibone : Hey, good morning. Given your ability to access debt capital, would you consider levering up to go on offense on the acquisitions front over the next, say, year or so, if you think there are unique distressed investment opportunities out there? Don Wood : We're going to talk about that, Vince, later in the year. It's a good question. Now, look, remember, everybody is levering up, whether they like it or not. Every retailer, every real estate company, etc.. From our perspective, I love that we came in here so well capitalized so that incremental levering up is not a strain on the business. So we will be able to talk about that and think about that. There may be distressed opportunities going forward. But as with everything, looking at those carefully and really deciding that that's where you're going to allocate your capital rather to kind of what you got, and as you know, we got a lot of stuff in the works and opportunities within the portfolio, personally, that's going to take precedent because we know what is it we're getting, and you never know what you're getting when you go after a distressed asset that way. So too early to say, but certainly something that will be on the radar later in the year. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. I think the way to think about that, the way we think about that is balance, and clearly, kind of maintaining balance through that. And look, while we're not raising equity at the stock level, we have the ability to kind of tap our assets and raise equity at the asset level very cost effectively, particularly even in this environment. So I think there's going to be balance from that perspective. And look, we do hope to be able to play a little offense, but we'll see and we'll know more as things unfold. Vince Tibone : That's helpful color. One more, just switching gears a bit. I'm curious, how do you see second quarter rent payment disputes between tenants and landlords being resolved if you don't reach an agreement on rent deferral or rent abatement? If a tenant just says, I don't feel like I need to pay, but you have a legal contract, I mean, how does this get settled? Alexander Goldfarb : Hey Mike, how are you. Not much, I'm on the Federal call. Something -- Leah Brady : Alex, can you please? I'm not sure, he's still in there. Vince, go ahead. Don Wood : I'm sorry, Vince. I did hear your question. Vince Tibone : Sorry, did you guys hear my question? Don Wood : We did hear it. Somehow Goldfarb I don't know how he does this stuff. It's amazing. Alexander Goldfarb : Sorry about that, Don. Don Wood : Okay, Alex. Help me again, Vince, where are we going? Leah Brady : Disputes with tenants who don't pay and we don't reach an agreement. Don Wood : Look, at the end of the day, there has not been a rent nonpayment of rent so far, and we don't expect there to be, for which we have given up our rights. This is not unilateral. And so we've preserved our rights, either through default or effectively through the contract itself. And so it has to be resolved. It'll either be resolved I mean, the likelihood is that individual negotiations will resolve the vast majority of those contracts. For those companies that, frankly, can't pay because they'll wind up filing. We've seen a bunch already, we'll continue to see that. And the courts will effectively vet that out. Those are the two ways that effectively it happens. And so you should continue to see that through May and June, frankly. Vince Tibone : Okay. Fair enough. If I could just sneak one more quick one in. Do you have any exposure to co-working operators in your office portfolio? Don Wood : We do. We've got a Regus deal. That is signed down at CocoWalk for 40,000 feet or so. Every indication is that, that deal continues to go through. And then we have a small deal with them also, I think, at Pike & Rose on a floor, and they're under contract there. So that's it's limited, but that's what we got. Vince Tibone : So and just to clarify, the one at Pike & Rose, that's they're already in place? Or that's a new lease? Don Wood : That's been in place for years. No, that's been in place for years. It's a small lease. And then the big one is down in CocoWalk that has not that's still under construction being built out. And that's all we got. Vince Tibone : Perfect, thank you. Thank you for the time. Don Wood : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Chris Lucas : Dan, on the credit facility balance, I guess, the question for me would be is there any plans to think about maybe locking that in longer-term with some long-term debt? And if you did, what sort of pricing would you get right now in the marketplace? Dan Guglielmone : Interesting. Yes, our credit facility has a 2024 maturity. We have the right to extend it to 2025. So it's actually pretty well out there, and it's actually very, very attractively priced. So we have maximum flexibility there. Clearly, we are going to avail ourselves as an A-, A3-rated company. You've seen a lot of access a lot of peer companies in that credit rating access the market on a relative basis very, very attractively. We'll monitor the market and look to be opportunistic and nimble, kind of in, I think, the same range that you've seen Realty Income, Boston Properties, some of the other blue chip A-rated companies access the market and do it at the in an opportunistic way. So clearly, that's something that I think you've seen some data points out there, and we would expect to kind of be in that in and around that range. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then my other question, Don, this may be a dumb question, but I'm going to ask it anyways, which is when you put a tenant into default, what are the consequences of that to the tenant? And how does that help or hurt your ability to sort of get them to where you want them to from a deal perspective? Don Wood : No. It's a great question, Chris. That's not a dumb question at all. And the answer is it varies. The single biggest thing you got to think about is most companies, retailers and other companies, have in their credit agreements, in their financing somewhere the covenant that they got to be up and fully paid on their rental obligations. And so what we saw in early April was when we would threaten or go to default, we get paid. Now those same companies are trying to negotiate with their lenders to effectively get relief from that. So that particular provision, to the extent they're successful, will become the ability to default will be less impactful. But the bigger thing, especially for Federal, is on the other side of this. They need us in a lot of these productive locations. And the big R word, the relationship word, can't go one way. And so the notion of being able to work something through to be able to get paid and work has been extremely successful, frankly, in a number of the negotiations that we've got. But defaulting on an obligation, even under this big giant catch-all thing called COVID-19, which generally, you think, \"Well, I can do anything I want because the whole world is shut down.\u201d There's another -- there's coming out the other side of this. And coming out the other side is there's got to be business happening. And that stuff is not paying a rental obligation and defaulting somebody and not having that be honored without negotiating it through is a pretty big black eye in terms of a negotiation. A - Wendy Seher It\u2019s one of the things that, it's Wendy, I just wanted to jump in and stress is that while there are certain outliers certainly in the negotiations that we're having day-to-day which are numerous, as Don mentioned, the retailer's want productive locations, they need them, they want to work themselves out of this.  We want to work out of this. So, there is a -- what I found and again there are outliers. There is a balance in the approach that we're seeing in the negotiation. So again everybody's trying to work out of this and gain production and I'm seeing that in our day-to-day conversations. The other thing that I want to point out, one more thing is what we're learning about the retailers has been beneficial to us because we're all in a time that we haven't been in before. So, we're learning things about the retailer. They're sharing more than they would share before and it's helping us as we think about how we want to move forward with our business plans. Q - Chris Lucas Thank you, for that. Operator : Your next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : When you look at the low collection categories, which are about 1/3 of your ABR, what's the breakdown between national chains versus more local operators, and then maybe investment grade versus noninvestment grade? Dan Guglielmone : Just looking through reams of data to see if we carved that up with respect to some of that specificity. Dan Guglielmone : Maybe we just take it offline, Don? Don Wood : Yes. We could probably take it offline, Linda. I don't think we've got that sliced and diced in that way with regards to just our the lower quality I mean, the kind of the lower collection peers. I mean if you look at page three on our portfolio composition and our COVID business update, that gives you kind of the overall portfolio, but we don't have it necessarily carved up. So let's follow up offline. Linda Tsai : Okay. And then as the states are concentrated and start to open up, it seems like restaurants would see their businesses recover faster since a lot of them are already open. But any sense of the pace of top line how the pace of the top line would recover for the other low collectors? Or what these tenants are saying in your conversations with them? Don Wood : Yes. I just think it's different by jurisdiction by jurisdiction. It's just too early to tell kind of how that top line is going to come out of it. I think it's too we'll see. Wendy Seher : Yes. It's ultimately based on what the consumer how the consumer feels about coming out and reengaging. So that's why it's so important from an operational standpoint that we're taking all the steps with the curbside pickup and all the operational initiatives that we're taking so that, that customer can feel comfortable and safe and reengage as soon as possible. Linda Tsai : And just one final one. What's your longer-term perspective on fitness tenants? I know it's only 4% of ABR and you have a mix of traditional and boutique fitness chains, but what's the right mix in your view as it relates to customer demand? And then also the creditworthiness of these tenants? Dan Guglielmone : Linda, it depends in Life Time Fitness is a good example of a company that paid their obligations. We don't have any Life Time Fitness, but they paid their obligations in April. They're very optimistic about where they're going to come out on the other side. When I look at fitness, I think it's a critically important category in the type of shopping centers and mixed-use properties that we have. Do I think that people are getting used to exercising at home? Will that stay there? I'm a big social guy, so I very much believe in the re-socialization, if you will, and the importance of health clubs. Now when they open up, obviously, they're going to open up with restrictions in terms of the capacities and the number of people that can be in there and the space between them. How that plays out over time? I don't know. Is there a place for fitness in the long-term future? Absolutely, from my perspective. Your next question is from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Floris van Dijkum : A question I had on the PPP funds, and particularly regarding your restaurant business. The fact that you're setting up your own $10 million funds, presumably, those are loans or grants that you're going to give to the to your restaurant tenants. Does that how what percentage of your restaurants have applied for PPP loans? Do you have any insight into that? And then what they've been granted as well? And is this to replace the, or to augment, the PPP funds potentially? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. No, I understand your question. And these are completely separate. So I don't have an answer to the applications, I don't think we do, of how many of our restaurants have applied or received. Dan Guglielmone : Most or all have applied. Leah Brady : Yes. Most of them have. Floris van Dijkum : But received? Dan Guglielmone : We don\u2019t know. Don Wood : I mean we don't know, right? Leah Brady : At least half. Don Wood : Really? Leah Brady : Yes. Don Wood : I just got some good news here. Half of our restaurants have received PPP loans. But what we see in our what we're doing, it's a different purpose. First of all, they are loans, not grants, under our program. And what they're about the PPP money is in order for it to be forgiven, has to be used largely for retaining employees. In our jurisdictions, they're not open yet. And so one of the things we saw as a problem with the way PPP was working was a timing issue. The difference between when that money would be available, what it could be used for versus what we're trying to do is pick our best players not it's not available to everybody, just our best players, and effectively make sure that we can shorten the time by giving them loaning them those proceeds for equipment start-up, restocking, inventories, things like that, so that they can get open sooner. So it's a very different purpose, and obviously, it's very limited relative, obviously, to the PPP program. Floris van Dijkum : Got it. One other question maybe for me. I note that J. Crew has crept into your top 25. Can you maybe comment generally on your what you deem to be your at-risk tenants? Whether on average, they have rents that are above or below market? And what kind of potential impact it would be to re-tenant some of those? And maybe and how many of the J. Crew locations do you expect to retain following the bankruptcy?\\ Don Wood : Still early to tell, but we've got about 11. We've got five J. Crews and six Madewells. When I look down the list, they are all productive places. And so I would expect I don't know for sure yet, but I would expect J. Crew to want to restructure those deals and not reject those deals, which really makes them just like everybody else out there who's entering the negotiation phase. So I don't know. But when you look at where ours are, we've got both a Madewell and a J. Crew at The Grove in Shrewsbury at Barracks Road in Charlottesville and Third Street Promenade, and then another at Santana, another at The Point. These are they're at really good locations. And so in terms of being able to either cut a deal with them or backfill them, I feel pretty darn good. They're in our best places. Floris van Dijkum : Great. And in terms of your other at risk, do you feel as comfortable about those? Or -- Don Wood : No, no. I mean, of course, I don't feel comfortable about anything. We're in the middle of a pandemic here for Pete's sake. And so we've got tenants that haven't paid, and we're working through the negotiations. So no, look, I can't on the call go through the top 25, one through 25 with you. Dan can do that with you separately. But at the end of the day, I got to look at the real estate, and I feel pretty darn good about the real estate. I hope that helps. Floris van Dijkum : Yes, that's great. Thanks, Don. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Leah Brady. Leah Brady : Thanks everyone for your time today. I hope everyone stays safe. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and exit you now, disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Mike Ennes, Senior Vice President. Thank you. You may begin. Mike Ennes : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker, and Melissa Solis. They\u2019ll be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty\u2019s future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from information in our forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have also posted on the website a slide deck that has more detailed information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business to-date and various actions we have taken in response to COVID-19. These documents are available on our website. Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have additional questions please feel free to jump back in the queue.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Dan G to begin the discussion of our second quarter results. Dan? Dan G : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We're going to change things up for this quarter's call and I will kick things off before handing it off to Don. There's a first for everything. I will take you through the results for the quarter with an initial focus on the major impact facing Federal and every company in the retail sector, collectability of rental income and the reserves we are taking due to the impact of COVID-19. Our approach at Federal to collectability and revenue recognition has historically and consistently been more conservative than the balance of the retail sector. To provide clarity on that point let me refer you to our most recent 10-Q which includes our disclosed policies around revenue recognition and accounts receivable on pages eight and nine.  And I'm reading when collection of substantially all lease statements during the lease term is not considered probable, total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash receipt.  If leases currently classified as probable or subsequently reclassified as not probable any outstanding lease receivables, including straight-line rent receivables would be written off with our corresponding decrease in rental income. Now, what that means from a practical perspective is when we move a tenant from accrual accounting to cash accounting, we do not view the rent owed to us as necessarily uncollectable. It just means that the probability of collection of the contractual revenues under the entire term of the lease is below the threshold of what we deem is probable. We will continue to fight to collect every penny of rent due from that particular tenant, for that particular space, it is simply based on our judgment, the decision to recognize revenue for those tenants when the cash is actually received in accordance with the relevant accounting standard, as opposed to recognizing the revenue on an accrual basis when the cash has yet to be received. So for the second quarter, our FFO was $0.77 per share was meaningfully impacted by collectability adjustments for the quarter of $55.2 million or $0.73 per share. This collectability adjustment can be broken down into two components, the first component $45.8 million for uncollected rents from tenants that one we already have on a cash basis, primarily most of our restaurants and two, tenants that we switched from accrual to cash accounting over the course of the second quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 on their business. The majority of that second group is comprised of tenants in the fitness and entertainment category, but also includes tenants who declared bankruptcy during the quarter, or others we deemed to be below the probable threshold. Additionally, there was a $9.4 million write-off of the straight line, rent receivable, essentially associated with tenants in that second group I just mentioned. Other drivers which impacted the quarter include $0.08 of drag due to the impact of COVID-19 on our hotel joint ventures, parking revenues and percentage rent and $0.07 of drag due to the higher interest expense given the incremental liquidity and balance sheet strength we are carrying during the pandemic. This was offset by $0.05 of positives from lower expenses at both the property and corporate level. As a result, including the collectability adjustments this totals a net $0.83 of COVID-19 related impacts for the quarter. I'm going to stop here and hand the reins over to Don for his remarks. I will be back however, to close things out before Q&A. Don Wood : Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everybody. I certainly hope all of you and your families are doing well this crazy times. I do hope that Dan's remarks were helpful in understanding the accounting conventions that we applied this quarter on a tenant by tenant and a category by category basis, as well as the in-depth and detailed supplemental statistical disclosures that we made in our 8-K on our website.  Dan said, you just have to keep in mind no matter what the accounting, nothing changes with respect or vigor that will go after the rent, that's due to us by right. I don't envy the job that investment analyst community in parsing through the many judgmental decisions that every company needs to make about their future income stream during this pandemic. Frankly, it all comes down to the estimated probability of a tenant being able and willing to honor its lease commitment, over its medium term, which often spans 5, 7 even 10 years. I mean, think about that.  Making the judgment today that it is probable that a fitness tenant, big or small, will fulfill its obligations for the next 10 years, probable 75%, 80%, that's a high bar. Obviously, those judgments are made with the best information available today, which as you all know, could not be more cloudy at this stage of the pandemic. But what I want to talk to you about this morning is the future. And what we see happening today and what we're betting on happening tomorrow. And let's start with liquidity and reiterate what we said on the May call, and at the NAREIT Investor Conference in June. We remain confident in our ability to weather this pandemic and come out the other side an even stronger and further differentiating company. That is the key premise to every decision we're making. We project having approximately $1.3 billion in cash and unused credit line available to us six months from now on February 1st, 2021, even when and assuming that the declaration payment of our next two full quarterly dividends, which could be declared in August and November and paid in October and January, even assuming that continued and unabated construction at the partially completed projects at Santana West, Assembly Row, Pike and Rose and CocoWalk. Even assuming the collection of rents only marginally better than the 76% plus that we collect in the last month in July and assuming no asset sales or equity issuance during that period. With all of those assumptions, we still wind up with $1.3 billion worth of cash on February 1st, 2021. And obviously we're going to look at these and other ways to improve on that liquidity position in the second half of this year. But the point is simply that you have great flexibility, even if we can't. Let me move to our construction process where the completed lease up timing of the office portion of the large mix use development is less clear than the retail for residential components because of the pandemic. While the 375,000 square foot Santana West office building is in the early stages of construction and won't be ready for occupation until 2022, the 212,000 square foot Pike and Rose office building is nearly complete today. 40,000 square feet all serve as Federal Realty\u2019s new headquarters, beginning next Monday and benefits advisor One Digital took most of another floor with a lease signed in March as did a couple of smaller tenants. We still have 150,000 feet to be leased there.  And the Assembly Row where Puma will anchor that 275,000 square foot office building beginning in late 2021, a 125,000 square feet remains to be leased. The long term impacts of the pandemics work from home mandates have created uncertainty in office leasing. And so timing is hard to predict. Having said that it's our view it's the best and most desirable product on the market. All three of these buildings are state of the art new construction with enhanced clean air systems in affluent suburban communities, close to job centers and most importantly are integrated into the fully amenitized mix use environments that business leaders say is essential.  And by the way, during this incredibly uncertain time, we signed nearly a 100,000 square feet of new and renewed office deals in the second quarter. That's an addition to the 277,000 retail deals that I'll talk about in a bit. Okay, well, at Willow Lawn shopping center in Richmond where security company Simply Safe took all of the 58,000 feet of available office space that Virginia Commonwealth University previously vacated at 28% more rent.  At CocoWalk where our office component is now 84% leased with the latest signing for 13,000 square feet by Florida law firm Weinberg, Wheeler, Hudgins at pro forma rents. And at Avedro where our company has a retail amenity base assures a historically low office turnover rate in that community for us. Basically we think that our office offerings all of which are an integral part of our mix use communities have been and will be the product of choice among business leaders on the other side of this pandemic. So what else gives us the confidence to continue to operate as we have, frankly, it all comes down to our conviction. Not only that first ring in that first ring suburban location of our real estate, the sweet spot in our view, but also in the dominant open air heavily amenitized product site and environments that we created in these locations over the last decade or more. Consider that during the most disruptive quarter in this country's history, we still signed 47 leases for 277,000 square feet of space for 11% more rent than the previous tenant was paying in the same space. And three of those deals were for strong credit grocers at really well located non grocery anchored shopping centers. Lidl for Stein Mart at 29th Place in Charlottesville, Virginia, Whole Foods for Bed Bath and Beyond and buybuy BABY at Huntington shopping center in Long Island. And the third a great credit grocer for Barnes and Noble, at Willow Grove in suburban Philly. Consider further that there have been 15 notable chapter 11 bankruptcy filings between April and July of the pandemic that have affected us. They are J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, True Religion, Creative Hairdressers, it's hair cutter related brands. Tuesday Morning, Lapanga Titian, 24 Hour Fitness, GMC, Chucky Cheese, Lucky, Brooks Brothers, Serla Tab, Muji, Ascena and Taylor Brands Men's Wearhouse. Combined, they represent nearly 650,000 square feet of space and 110 locations.  Yet only 110,000 square feet and 28 of those locations have been identified by those firms for closure on their initial list. That means that 83% of that square footage, and 75% of those stores are at this point, expected to remain open by those merchants on the other side of bankruptcy. 10 of the 11 J. Crew concepts that we have in our portfolio, none were on a closure list, none. Now, who knows how that all ultimately turns out, and under what terms, but it sure is a pretty strong indicator of the obvious desirability of a real estate. Since then Lord and Taylor filed, and as many of you know, occupies the east side of our Balkin Wood shopping center in suburban Philadelphia, getting this store back on last one of the best 6 acre future development sites in our entire portfolio.  And you know, future desirability of retail space is really the most pertinent question that needs to be asked and analyzed today. Demand simply has to exceed supply to create value in this business. And yet we entered this country crisis as a country in an over retail position. And we're definitely exacerbating that oversupply position because of the pandemic. Obviously, not everybody can come out a winner here. Vacancy is going up and I expect it to peak in the first half of next year. We're likely to be in the 80s by then. And yet, of all the things that worry me as a result of this pandemic, and there are plenty, filling that space with great retailers and restaurants and good economics is not one of them. I know that our property's positioning in those first ring suburbs of major metropolitan areas will be more desirable post COVID. I know that the decades of focus on creating comfortable and attractive open air places at those centers will further enhance their desirability. Consider that nearly every discussion we had or are having, with brokers and prospective tenants in every major market we do business in. The perspective deal is premised around the tenant improving their real estate locations, improving not only the location, but their co-tenancies, improving their environment, and most importantly in some respects, improving their landlord. Tenants want to be with landlords that have money, investible, financial wherewithal, vision, execution prowess, and a pedigree of partnership with them. Long term customer friendly service improvements like a coordinated customer pickup program matters today. They matter a lot. All of these considerations are more important now and will certainly be on the other side of this than ever before. And we're set up for it. So that's all I have for my prepared remarks. Let me turn it back over to Dan for some final remarks, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don. Just jumping back into details from the quarter with respect to our tenant activity across the portfolio, we made great progress in light of the fact that most of markets in which we operate were the first to shut down and effectively the last to begin reopening. Due to this fact, the percentage of tenants that were open as a percentage of ADR was only 47% at May 1 and 54% at June 1st, as reopenings accelerated in June and July as of July 31, 92% of our retail tenants are now open.  As a result our cash collection has shown strong momentum tracking those reopenings, cash collection for the second quarter finished at 68% as we made continued progress with our tenants on unpaid rent. Collected rent for April ended up at 65% up from 53% at May 1, May was 66% up from 54% at June 1 and June was 72% for a blended collection rate of 68% for the quarter.  July collections further accelerated to stand at 76% at July 31st and August collections are off to a promising start while only one day of collections August 1st, 2020 collection where roughly 85% of August 1st, 2019 levels. And we're 60% higher than July 1st, 2020 levels. Of the 32% of uncollected rents for the second quarter, roughly $68 million, our $46 million collectability adjustments accounted for two thirds of that amount. With respect to executed deferral agreements, we've taken a very tactical approach with a portfolio of only roughly a 100 properties we're able to treat every negotiation on a tenant by tenant and a space by space basis. $21 million of rent has been deferred for the second quarter under executed agreements with our tenants. This represents 31% of uncollected second quarter rent and 10% of total bills 2Q rent. Of that amount almost two thirds or 13 million is with accrual based or probable tenants and negotiations continue.  As we did last quarter, we have provided new and additional disclosure relating to the impact of COVID-19. A summary of collectability and accounts receivable is provided on page 10 of our 8-K financial supplement and a new investor presentation, which incorporates an update for COVID-19 can be found through a link on our investor website. Now just to revisit the balance sheet and liquidity. During last quarter's call, in May, we have just closed on a $400 million unsecured term loan with a one year maturity and a one year extension option into 2022. This provides us with pro forma liquidity of 1.4, this provided us with a pro forma liquidity of $1.4 billion in cash on hand and available credit capacity at that moment. Following the May call, we immediately raised an additional $700 million in the bond market in two tranches, with seven plus years of blended maturity, and a 3.3% effective yield.  As a result at June 30, we have over $2 billion in liquidity with $980 million of available cash and an undrawn $1 billion credit facility. We remain well positioned to manage through the challenging environment we currently face like we have done time and time again, over our 58 year history.  Deleveraging the balance sheet will continue to be a priority as we look to opportunistically issue equity, as well as sell assets and/or raise joint venture capital leveraging the quality of our best in class asset base.  As you saw yesterday, our Board made the decision to declare a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share payable on October 15th. Given decades of maintaining a fortress balance sheet and having the ability to build significant liquidity and significant liquidity positions and having, even in the most challenging of capital markets, we felt it was appropriate to lean into this strength in capital position, and declaring modestly increased dividend this quarter, and extend our increasing annual dividend record for a consecutive 53rd year.  Given our high margins at the property level, cash collections and store openings showing great momentum and collections comfortably in excess of our breakeven collection levels coupled with the quality and productivity of current leasing discussions with our tenants, and the implicit demand for our real estate that that provides all drive, build both the competence and the strength of our portfolio performance coming out of this environment. As a result, based on the information we have today, we believe we should be able to support an annualized $4.24 dividend from adjusted FFO on an ongoing basis post COVID. However, as we stated previously, that perspective could change in the coming quarters as the length and the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our business and our tenants\u2019 business become more visible. And know that the management team and our Board of Directors will be extremely disciplined in setting our dividend policy moving forward.  And with that operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Craig Schmidt : My question, I just wondering what Federal can do in the short-term to increase traffic and sort of relieve the costs in some shoppers. It seems like your centers were places that people wanted to congregate, and now you have to play the game. I'm just wondering, in terms of a new service or anything structural marketing that you can do to get people to be more comfortable shopping at centers? Don Wood : I'll tell you Craig, I appreciate that question a lot because if you could be around and there's certainly the mix use centers and even the more lifestyle other centers that we have, you would be blown away by the traffic and because they are open air because they are part of the community in which people already are living in. And frankly, because of the markets that we're in, you see mass everywhere, people being extremely diligent with what they're doing. And, specifically in the markets that we're in, which were closed first and opened up really very recently in terms of that, what I'm most thrilled about is that their comfort with our places.  Now, we were also, I think really early in putting out almost completely across the portfolio, the pickup, which allowed for a landlord coordinated effort for tenants to effectively, for consumers to pick up goods from merchants, that landlord coordinated piece goes right to the heart of your question. That's what's necessary. And I can tell you no matter how much it's being used or not being used based on any particular shopping center, you know what really helps? It really helps prospective tenants because those tenants say this landlord gives a crap and is in it with us. And that notion of partnership throughout this, I honestly think is going to be one of the most critical parts of who wins if you will, on the other side of this. And that's what we're executing on. Craig Schmidt : Great, and then just on may be on that longer term, what are some of the tenants you would like to add that are new to the merchandize mix that you have at your center. Don Wood : Well, that's a TBD, you know, one of the things that I think as you kind of think about longer term here, you know, and I made a point about the tenants who are really struggling in the fact that they want to stay in our centers generally, and that's the case. And then the short term, we're going to want them to stay in our centers. What failing tenants are, not who we want over the long term they create value in our shopping centers. We do want to see who emerges here. And I can't give you specific names. If I gave you the specific names, it would sound very much like the lifestyle type of tenants that the war bees in the world that we've been talking about in the past. It's not about that. It's about over the next year or two, the opportunistic money that gets behind new concepts or reinvigorates old concepts that choose the best real estate in the marketplace.  That's what we're seeing Craig, that the conversations that Wendy Sear or that Berkus, and Sweetman along the West Coast, or Stobel here on the East coast are having are all about how do we get better real estate? And who's going to be in there with us. And what do you guys do to make this all work together, frankly, they're playing right to our strengths. And so the combination of all those things, not one piece of it is what in our view gives us the competence that where we will be a more differentiated company, not less differentiated on the other side of this. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Santos with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question Daniel Santos : My first one is on the dividend. How does the increased dividend align with taxable income for the year? Don Wood : So it is, I\u2019ll let Melissa add to this or Dan add to this if they want but the notion and I'd like you to think about this first is our dividend, okay, that, this was the last dividend for 2020 that counts in taxable income 2020. Our November dividend will be paid in January, so that'll be the first one for 2021. And that's a little bit different than other companies. So I want to give you that that perspective. Certainly, with respect therefore to the roughly $320 million of dividends that were paid this year. In fiscal 2020 that is in excess by something like $40 million of our taxable income and what that would be okay. Now, first of all, it's August 5th, and a lot has to happen between now and the end of the year from a taxable income perspective. Some of it could be surprising good, some of it surprising bad, but we got a lot of flexibility there. So, did we pay more than we had to pay in 2020? Sure, we did. And the reason for that, and I'm glad you asked, because I really want to get into this a little bit is that we built this company to be able to power through recessions. And when I say the company, not just the balance sheet, the quality of the assets the diversity is a real estate. This is a recession. Albeit a very unusual one. I got it. We went into this with one of the lowest payout ratios, a dividend payout ratios going in. So certainly we can pay it, then you got to ask well, why would we pay it if we don't have to. And in the end, at the end of the day, it's all about our belief in the outlook, and where we're going. It's all about our belief and effectively not only being able to get getting back to not paying more than we have to, as we did in 2020, but more importantly, growing and creating value.  And so there is, I would have to be a whole lot more pessimistic about the future than I am today for us to have cut that dividend. And, everybody always says their long term and focus. Let me tell you, we\u2019re long term in focus. We know what has to happen on the other side of this. And so sorry to be a little long winded about that Dan, but I'm pretty darn passionate about this company's ability to come out of this crisis really strong. So that's why and it's a little more in your text link of questions, but it all ties together. Q \u2013 Daniel Santos : I appreciate the answer, the passionate answer. My second question is, I was wondering if you could give some color on leasing demand and pace of reopening and some of your traditional suburban shopping centers versus your more sort of in-sell assets? A \u2013 Dan G : Let me give you two people. Let's have Wendy talk about that, for more of our traditional shopping centers and focus maybe on the West Coast, in terms of some of the street retail stuff. A \u2013 Wendy Seher : Thank you, Dan. As I look at our kind of our pipeline that we have, going I look at a couple different things. And one of the things we're focused on obviously is what are the deals that were pre-COVID that we still have that are now picking up momentum and we see them coming to fruition through executed leases. So that seems very strong. What I'm also looking at, and this is what I'm encouraged by is that we have a lot more deals in the pipeline and deals are going to lease negotiations that were during COVID and now post COVID. So that makes me feel very good about our pipeline and what I look at the diversity of the deals and the properties that we have specifically on the East coast. It's fairly limited well between our traditional grocery anchors to our lifestyle and to our mixed used. A \u2013 Don Wood : Dan, I will echo that, on the West coast, very impressed by kind of how tenants have behaved since getting through April and May, when a lot of them are really trying to figure out where their business was headed. It seemed like a little bit of a corner was turned in June and the volume of serious discussions picked up and activity on LOI and lease negotiations picked up. As Wendy said, we have a pretty robust pipeline of those discussions and negotiations going on right now. It is broad based, not only in our more traditional community centers, but also in our mixed use and lifestyle properties.  And what we're seeing in the latter really is two things. One, continued interest to expand their fleet within our portfolio from tenants that we've done deals with before, as well as a lot of new conversations from tenants that don't have a lot of legacy issues but understand that if they are going to open a handful of stores, opening them in the best possible locations is critical. And discussions with those tenants in both groups have picked up and are progressing well over the last couple of months. So too soon to tell, obviously if all the deals that are in the pipeline get done and sure a few will drop out, but we're pretty impressed with it, with the discussion so far. And hopefully that shows up in the results in a couple of quarters. A \u2013 Dan G : I want to add one thing to both of those comments. You know, I don't want you to, and maybe I'll throw a little cold water on it. I don't want you to think we are Pollyannish and don't understand the severity of what's going on in the country. Of course we do. Of course we don't have great predictability of when things turn and really what that means. Obviously the timing of the vaccine, all this stuff that obviously we don't know, so all we can do is make business decisions today based on what it is that we know and Wendy's conversation just, conversation and ours has been about is we see a path. We see a path forward. We know what to do to try to be able to execute, to get there there's enough raw material that suggests that there's a good probability that that can happen. Again, who knows, but today, which is why you see the results you see in the second quarter. You bookkeep based on what you know today and then you work for tomorrow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Handel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question. Q \u2013Handel St. Juste: I wanted to follow up on that a little bit, that the last question by Daniel here, want to get a bit more color on the conversation with the tenants you\u2019re having today, how they compare pre versus pre pandemic on the demand willing to sign deals and deal terms perspective? And then what you hearing in the conversations with tenants as they make space with this. Are they seeking value are they more biased to the location the first ring separately you talking about asset type? What are the things that seem to matter most as they think about spaces in a post COVID world? A \u2013 Wendy Seher : I think that what we're hearing a lot of is that retailers, some retailers are going to make fewer new openings, right. So they're going to make shorter, they're going to make decisions based on a, in my view, a criteria that has just doubled. So in every box is going to have to be checked. So when we're thinking about, so when they're thinking about, would they, do they need to be in strong centers that have great landlords that invest in their properties that have co-tenants that are, who their customers are, and then when they can ensure the ability to do stronger sales, that is going to be a must. And with that criteria, we feel like we're very well positioned because of the ability to have strong occupancies, strong sales and a landlord that has a strong balance sheet that's going to continue to invest and look towards the future. So that has been sort of the, we're not having as many discussions as I would like to have, but the ones that we are they want to upgrade their real estate. Q \u2013Handel St. Juste: Are you getting the sense that you're losing any leases due to price to rent, or perhaps there is a search for value that may be making certain tenants more inclined to seek secondary location that they think about the cost variable? Wendy Seher : It's a good question. I think based on what I had, what we just talked about, which is that it's so important that these locations come out strong that what we've seen is that tenants are willing to pay more to have that insurance that they need that the location that they either relocate or they open, hit the gates strong, right, from opening. So we found that they will pay more to be in the right location. Don Wood : Imagine this. And now just think about this for a second, right. If you're looking to do deals right now, you're certainly looking for value right for deals, that's, frankly, not much different than it's ever been. But the big thing, when you\u2019re talking about, that's so critical, if you don't really know who your potency is going to be, you really don't know today, if you're getting a cheap deal, who you're going to be doing business next to? What that shopping center is going to feel like look, there is a big risk to signing for any mini, for any anchor or even mini anchor. A 15 year deal, when you don't have that visibility. The additional rent to be in the dominant centers seems to pale in comparison to the sales, being able to underwrite what you think you're going to do in business. Q \u2013Handel St. Juste: And my second questions on the leasing spread, the new leasing spreads have been consistently the 10% ratio. I'm curious if your view is that would clearly a lagging indicator, but what bottoms first occupancy or new leasing spreads? Don Wood : I don't know. I think they kind of go together, with us at least, and you were certainly a smaller company than some of the big guys in terms of GLA. And so, a few deals, make those leasing spreads be what they are. And so, you'll see volatility in that the strength in the second quarter was a couple of deals and the single biggest one was taking very old Bed Bath and beyond Buybuy Baby space at Huntington, which is a great shopping center in terms of location and trading up for Whole Foods, at a big rent. So I mean, that, that moved the needle in this quarter, hopefully every quarter, bears a few of those, sometimes there are, sometimes there's not, but what we're working hard to do is to maintain occupancy and that does mean we'll defer or abate or change contracts more readily, certainly on the restaurant side, the idea of a restaurant where you're going to defer your money and they're going to have to pay it back next year.  I mean, that's a fool\u2019s errand in most situations except for a large well capitalized company, right? I mean, if you were running a restaurant, would you take your last few hundred thousand dollars in a savings and try to open back up only to know you're going to pay it all to your landlord in next year? No, I mean, there has to be a realization, an honesty about assessing the current situation and then know that you'll make your money with that occupancy with the deal that give you a chance to make it back and with new deals, because tenants are looking at well occupied shopping centers, that's our MO in terms of how we're approaching this. So you're certainly going to see lower vacancy or higher vacancy rather, a lower number there and you're certainly going to see pressure on rents in certain places, but overall, you got to feel really good about the demand drivers of a portfolio like this. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Christy McElroy : Thanks. Good morning. Don, just a follow up on those comments, you talked about their willingness to defer or be and the potential pressure on rents. If I think about the categories where you\u2019re seeing below 50% collection models that you talked about, fitness, experiential, restaurants, full price apparels, these categories comprise a good portion of your write off. How should we think about sort of rent level that many of those tenants can now pay given their reduced revenues, it seems like a lot of those problems aren\u2019t going away until we have our vaccine, how do you collections rebound for their tenants without some sort of reset to their rental levels currently, is it a matter of releasing that space? Or is it working with them to get to the right rent level given that restaurants and experiential are part of what makes your centers, what they are today? A \u2013 Don Wood : No question about it, Christy. It's interesting. I'm going to start with the more obvious ones. Restaurants are not so obvious, restaurants I\u2019m pretty darn positive, feeling pretty good about frankly, in terms of not only their importance to our centers, their ability to generate business and pay us rent on a percentage basis will be number of them but going forward. But again, in our places, I think we can make money that way. I do think the harder ones are theaters and fitness centers. I do think that, and the reason I think that in fact, I'm actually going to take a little tangent as you would expect me to Christy, but everybody keeps saying our second quarter was conservative. Even Dan said, and his remarks were conservative. I got to tell you, I don't see it that way. And let me tell you why. I mean, first of all the punch in the gut, what have we book kept in the period that has been incurred? That's the second quarter. And so if you sit there and say, today that that theaters or fitness operators have figured out what their business plan is on the other side of it and what rent they can pay us, I would tell you a really, to your point, I'm not sure what a movie theaters ability to pay the rents that are in place or a fitness centers ability to pay the rents that are in place over the next decade, which is what you're being asked to say, in accounting by streamlining that stuff. I don\u2019t think you can. I don't think that's conservative. I think that's realism.  And so, sitting and saying, okay, that piece of our income which is a few percent, right, I know what theaters and, fitness is 4, experiential is 2. So there's 6% there that I agree with you. We do not have the visibility. Restaurants are so different in terms of each one of them what they are, what their owners financial position looks like, what they're willing to do, et cetera. And frankly, so critical to how the entire place works, that we are absolutely working with those important restaurants. And we identified this on March 18th, that was going to be a critical group for us to effectively go.  So those are more individual answers to your questions. I'm sorry to tell you I'm not sure the answer on the theatres and on fitness. But I think that's the only honest answer that's possible today. Christy McElroy : Thank you. And then, Dan, you talked about the drag associated with the liquidity that you're maintaining right now, given with that raises that you did last quarter. Don, you talked about the 1.3 billion in cash, the importance of having that liquidity, by February, I know that you don't know what will happen, right, the collections and occupancy. But as all that plays out sort of over the next six, twelve and longer months, how do you think about the balance sheet management aspect of that on a go forward basis and maintaining that level of liquidity? Don Wood : Look, I think we've spent years and years of building the credibility we have, and I think it's evident that we were able to on, in the midst of all the uncertainty of early May, and was able to raise the capital that we did over a billion dollars from our banks. And so our access to capital continues. I think that we will, we've done in the past show balance. And then as I think we are going to be opportunistic with regards to keeping leverage, kind of inline with kind of our long-term goals, our long-term metrics. Our metrics are going to be impacted our net debt to EBITDA will go up, our coverage ratios will go down as we work through over the next few quarters. But we will be opportunistic, whether it be through asset sales or joint venture capital, or even issuing equity, when we see opportunities in the market, we will keep a diversified source, the spectrum of capital sources available to us. And as we work through it, we'll avail ourselves to kind of the all of those sources as we move forward. But our intention is to kind of take advantage of the market as it's available, while keeping our long-term focus on leverage profile in line with historic levels. Don Wood : I'll say one more thing to you, Christy, on this, you know, long term problem that we always have to deal with is with asset sales is covering the tax gain. And we have to 1031 everything and it's hard. And the idea of looking at that as a potential source of a piece of our capital is on the table for us right now, which I think is an interesting, additional tool in the toolbox that we didn't have as easily before. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : What types of joint venture structures could you see most probable to the source of capital? I mean, trying to get out of how would you weigh selling an interest in an individual component of one of the big three projects where maybe you can get stronger pricing today in retail versus having interests aligned in the entire mixed use property. A \u2013 Dan G : So I don't know, that's a hard one to answer because it depends on a specific deal and the specific circumstance. I mean, you know, how much, I think, you know, how strongly I believe in the integration of those uses at big mixed use properties. It's important now, is that different for a standalone office building across the street from Santana Row, maybe right? I mean, it's just, it's not as integrated as the office buildings that have retail under them and are part of it. So we could look at that differently for example, I'm not saying we will not saying we are, but I'm trying to give you the level of detail in the considerations that have to be thought through, because there's not a direct answer to your JV questions.  I would really have a hard time at Assembly Row effectively selling off an office building or a residential building that was part and parcel of our product project. I would much rather if it, you need to look at it, we would look at it as a passive partner that that border percentage of the whole thing. So it depends on, I don't know, JB if you want to add anything more to that, that's kind of how I see it though. Jeff Berkes : I don\u2019t think there is too much to add. Just one of the things obviously would be looking at a portfolio of more stable lower growth, non mixed use assets. And it doesn't make sense to bring somebody into that and some sort of way, all things we\u2019re thinking about like Don said not really to talk about this at this juncture and haven\u2019t made any decision or quite frankly, any real progress other than kicking around internally here. Vince Tibone : And then shifting gears a little bit, I'm curious, dynamic leasing, negotiations shifted in recent months with e-commerce getting another leg up COVID, how much overall occupancy cost ratio matter anymore, given the benefits of having a brick and mortar store on online sales. A \u2013 Don Wood : You\u2019re right on it, man, I\u2019ve been preaching on this for a while, the total occupancy cost matters. Of course it matters. Does it matter to the level that it used to in a lot of businesses uh, uh. So when you sit and think about it, all the stuff that Wendy talked about earlier on this call and Jeff talked about earlier on this call, in terms of the considerations of what makes a business profitable is obviously including the online business, the ability to pick up goods in the store. I'm telling you man, this notion of what we're doing with respect to the pickup having a landlord coordinated effort here is really big, and it's big in what you're asking about, and that is, what are the tenants asking about in these negotiations? What are the differentiators that matter? We always knew it was the location, obviously. But more and more, it's about the co-tenancy, it's about those other services, it's about that tenants being comfortable that the landlord is working part and parcel with them to make them successful in total for the businesses. It's a more holistic approach. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Greg Mcginniss : Hi, this is Greg Mcginniss on with Nick. I just had a few questions on the tenant bankruptcies. Now I understand the expectation is for the majority of those stores remain open, I'm just curious with total exposure to those 15 bankrupt tenants, if they've all been taken to a cash basis, and then also curious on how much of an impact those tenants had on Q2 collectability? A \u2013 Dan G : Yeah, roughly the exposure its total exposure to all 15 names that we had on that list was roughly in the 3% little over 3% of our total revenues. So not a huge number. All of the tenants on that list have been taken to cash basis with the exception of one because this happened right at the end. And that's Men's Warehouse or Taylor Brands. Greg Mcginniss : And then what was the impact on the collectability for tissue from those tenants? Dan G : We don't know right here, we get back. Greg Mcginniss : Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up question on kind of restaurants. Don, I appreciate comments you gave, I can't really predict the percent rent trends. But I believe that you previously mentioned abating rents for your best restaurants can use the top 60 if I recall correctly. We were just wondering how that abatement program may have evolved since you last spoke about it. What that impact was on Q2? And if all those tenants are on a percent rent basis now? Don Wood : No, certainly not all those tenants are on a percentage rent basis, that still -- still exception rather than the rule, Greg. I don't have a number for you all the way through here, I, as you correctly point out the 60 tenants that as the 60 restaurants that we had identified initially as critical to the property we worked with early that has continued and grown through the portfolio as in certain other situations, it's useless and so, we're not working with them, we're simply holding a line and trying to get paid contractually with whatever they've got left because they're not going to make it. So it really gets down to a one by one, on a one by one basis and next time you can travel and we can be around. Let me walk you through a Pike and Rose or Befesa Row or Santana Row certainly and trying to show you the broader issue in terms of how this stuff works. I know you're trying to put numbers in a modeling, make percentages work, and somehow tied to something in the second quarter. Then I could care less about any longer, but, but nonetheless, the real key is kind of understanding how those deals are going to financially work going forward. And more importantly, what they're going to do for other tenants in that shopping center going forward. I don't know Dan, if you've done anything specific for this question. Dan G : I think you answered that. Just to get back to your previous question, roughly of the $55 million adjustment, roughly about 10%, you know, $5 million or $6 million was associated with the bankrupt tenants. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : I guess where tenants haven\u2019t paid rents and we don't have deferral agreements in place. Which portion are you backing for discussions with versus really having no clarity on a resolution? Don Wood : I think call it 30% of our unpaid rent, we have deferral agreements with, we probably have another 20% kind of in conversations and a handshake agreements on, even more with that. So yeah, we're making progress. Negotiations are ongoing. We're trying to be really, really tactical and strategic with regards to those conversations. And so it's a bit of a moving target, but we feel good about the progress we're making and kind of resolving, some of the unpaid rent and coming up with solutions and in some situations, we're kind of viewing it as, hey look, you have a contract, you need to pay it. And so, we'll find that out. But that's I think in process at the moment, Mike. Michael Mueller : How is parking and hotel income trending in the third quarter compared to the second. Don Wood : Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know the answer to that might be the hotels, the two hotels were closed for most of the second quarter, obviously have opened up now are still trending something like 20% occupancy, 30% so certainly not making any money that's for sure. And parking revenue, interestingly is coming back, and I'm using that based on what I know and visually see at Pike and Rose at Santana Row, et cetera, because the traffic is up. So back to where it was of course not but we\u2019re trending in the right direction. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bi Kim : Good morning. Reverse to the 21% of the reserves that you took, I\u2019m sure there is quite a different range of that 75% threshold on that. What percent do you think roughly were tenants that were already living on the ledge or kind of the substantial decline pre COVID that no matter how many accruals have woken up, and then I guess what the remaining bucket of tenants that were probably pretty good were not paying rent for few months. Really help some and they can come out of okay, okay. Dan G : Well, I don't think we have answers specific answers where we bifurcated kind of into those kinds of buckets. There's a bunch that won\u2019t make it, there's a bunch that we think we can work with to get them through it. But I don't have a percentage, specific percentage of what fall into each of those buckets, I think\u2026 Don Wood : But Ki Bin you know, I mean, the bottom line is, this was from the beginning. We are not negotiating with tenants that we don't believe will make it, right. If we don't think, we're looking at our best chance for success, and sometimes the best chance is to simply default the tenants pay very quit, try to evict, I mean, sometimes those are the best answers. And so we're using, generally when you're talking about a tenant, the 15 tenants that filed bankruptcy, there wasn\u2019t one surprise of those 15 tenants that filed for bankruptcy. So we didn't sit there and abate or defer rent with those tenants in any meaningful way. Why? Cause it wouldn't help with respect to what they're going to do. And the same applies to smaller tenants. So I, obviously, I don't know that percentage differences, but I can tell you philosophically how we approach each of those guys, so I don't know if that's helpful to not. Ki Bin Kim : And how would you describe how private operators are behaving around your market? You can be very disciplined you have great assets and you have a great operating platform. But if the surrounding private operators aren't behaving rationally and undercutting rents or getting more KIs, getting something out of your control, so how do you think about that? A \u2013 Wendy Seher : Are you talking about the small shop tenants and how they're behaving? Ki Bin Kim : Around that private owners? Wendy Seher : Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. I think as we get post COVID, we've always been, we were under over retail before. And we are definitely going to be more over retail now. So there's going to be a lot of low cost options out there. But again, as to my prior point, I think you'll have a very small subset of tenants that just go for a low cost option. And that majority of the tenants who really need to be opening stores that are productive and robust in terms of sales are going to the critical factors of creating that successful operation is going to be what we have to offer in terms of occupancy in terms of co-tenancies, in terms of convenience, in terms of the locations and are investing in the property. So, I think that there will be, there's always been lower cost options, but I don't see that as a determinant in our going forward. Dan G : The one thing I would say to you, I'm sorry, man. The one thing I would say to you Ki Bin is you know, it's hard to imagine from my perspective that that was not comprised in the stock. We're up 40% right from six months ago. And if you go, if you look going forward, will there be rent pressures? Of course there will be rent pressures. We're up 40%. Do you think these properties are worth 40% less than they were six months ago? Where the billion dollar Assembly Row be sold for 600 million today because of those concerns? Not at all. It's been over, it's been overpriced. I get it. I understand the uncertainty and why but I got to think that's priced in even if there is and there will be pricing pressure from lower cost operators going forward. Operator : Your next question comes in a line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : The 3% revenue impact from the 15 bankruptcies, what would be occupancy impact from that? Don Wood : We don't think that we're going to lose that many of them candidly. So it's probably 1%, from the closures that we kind of expect. But most of that haven\u2019t happened yet. Linda Tsai : And to the comment of the first half of 2020 may reach high 80% occupancy, you know, the merchandising categories that end up going away would you look to back fill with retail uses or look to pivot and diverse away in kind of some of the spaces are flexible enough to do so. Don Wood : Linda, one of the things I think that's one of our strengths is that we really look at sell from a real estate perspective. And so having the expertise to be able to convert and redevelop and repurpose is something that I think is a real benefit to us. So we don't look at it. We look at it economically and try to figure out what the highest and best uses of that piece of real estate is. So whether it's a second floor of the floor, the amount of the amount of fitness and second floor, second floor space that we've already taken out and created high value office in is pretty interesting certainly at Santana and with respect to the ability to have properties that now with more vacancy can be turned into residential and retail, more mixed use properties. We look at that stuff that way. So it very much depends on the property, but we can do all of those things. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris Van Dijkum : Good morning, guys, actually Compass Point. But just wanted one question I guess, some of the opportunities that you're going to get as a result of bankruptcy. So you mentioned this Dawn, I think early in your comments about Lord and Taylor at Balkin Wood, how will you balance incremental capital spend, that that will require with the potential to create value and to grow NOI going forward. Do think about that differently today than you would six months ago? Don Wood : Yes. That's a very good question, Floris. I mean, look, the uncertainty of capital means that the bar is higher, you happen to pick one in Lord and Taylor at Balla where, I mean, I've been dying to do something on that piece of land for the better part of 15 years. There it's just an underutilized great piece of land. Now, what COVID just did was made lower Merion township more important than lower Merion township was pre COVID. So, so the answer is always going to start with the real estate, and it's always going to start with the, the ability to create value on that real estate, that's an easier one. For some of them that are less easier yet they have a higher hurdle that they got to fight for, but for us, it's not only that initial ability to redevelop it\u2019s what is it that we see from the long-term growth. And I think I know you're familiar with Gary and I think you'll see like what we're doing at Gary and there has been enhanced by COVID, not hurt by COVID because of where we are. So I think we start with a leg up on that stuff. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : On the restaurant front, certainly Lebanese Taverna is one of the restaurants that survives, that place is great. So, Don, just a question on the dividend how you think about it? And you answering a bunch of the questions. There's obviously a lot of unknowns, you guys have a lot of capital that you want to spend on projects. Like Merion or like various places that you think will really reward investors. So the decision to increase the dividend was that based more on just the strength of Federal\u2019s balance sheet or the real time improvements that you're seeing, or is it just your general belief that, there will be a vaccine that 2021 will be a much better year and therefore, don't look at this year and what's happening look forward and with all that said, you guys feel comfortable that you can maintain that above taxable income pay off? Don Wood : Well, first of all, Alex, I'm so glad you got a question in as the last question, because I was worried that before this call, I was missing you greatly, so it's good to talk to you. With respect to and I don't have an answer on Lebanese Taverna, exactly expect we've gotten to the concepts from them that had just opened, so that's good. Getting that aside. I kind of, I spent a lot of time on the dividend because it's not just one or two or three things. It really is a myriad of everything. And so, when the question came down about capital raising a little bit I mean or and Dan was answering what, how we look at the balance sheet going forward and how we're going to effectively finance. There is, I'd be lying to you, if I didn't say to you that we have a level of confidence in our ability to raise money from a wide variety of sources, whether that's equity or debt or joint ventures or asset sales or whatever, because they all comes not only from our history of being able to do that, but they, at the end of the day, the condition that this real estate is the best real estate out there is it's just real. So we're going to have in our view more opportunities than most to be able to raise capital. That's an important component of what's happened here.  Also, there's no doubt as I talked about, at the property level, if you were with us and you were working in Federal and we were meaning as I do with Wendy every day or every other day, at least. And with Jeff and with Don, you would have a good hands on sense for the desirability of that real estate and the deals that are coming through and can come through to on a long-term basis to be able to get that done. And that would give you another the level of confidence.  So, there will be equity raises on the other side of this. This company has effectively been built to be able to provide an equity investor or return that comes from appreciation, as well as the dividends. And it's a critical component, so in our estimation for the type of investors that we want, because those are long term investors. And so the combination of those and five or six or seven other things suggest to us that at this point in time, we should continue the dividend. Now the raise, the $3 million incremental costs that it costs us by going up a penny that's everything, it sets the record, we're going to pay $80 million, the notion of and ruining the record. We shouldn't do that. So the incremental three that's based on our history, it's just three in terms of the raise, the natural payments, it's on everything I was talking about previously. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, and then the second question Don, next year the point in El Secundo VXP announced a JV for that triangle. Was that something that you had considered that may be something that you would consider? I don't know if you were involved in that at all, but was that something that you guys ever looked at, or given everything else that was on your plate? You're like, look it's across the train tracks, it's separated, whatever. And it just, we have more that we don't need to get involved in that. Don Wood : Yeah. It's a real complicated one and Jeff is on the phone. He can certainly answer, but we've talked about that. I don't know, at least I half a dozen times with Berkes we'd sit there he said, how are we going to figure out what to do on that? And every time we looked at it, the costs and moving tracks and time and all that is just, more. Jeff Berkes : Actually just the way more than quickly, Don and Alex had saw me product site, which is just East of the point on Rose Crowns, where all the tanks used to be when we originally opened the point. So we talked a lot to continental development about, you know, doing stuff with them, that project when it's built and they're not ready to build it yet, given what's going on in the market but when it's built it will integrate very nicely with the point. And actually we think drive a lot of daytime demand for our restaurants and shops and services at the point. So we're happy to see them do but it is 100% office. And I think there is, alluded to a little bit in the release longer term bigger view from both of those parties on how they work together, that we just didn't really fit into. So, great relationship with them, great developer, really happy to see what they're doing, but just not no fit for Federal. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Ennes for any closing remarks. Mike Ennes : Thank you for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

A question and answer will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Leah Brady. You may begin. Leah Brady : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker, and Melissa Solis. They\u2019ll be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.

Given the number of participants on the call, we do kindly ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have an additional questions, feel free to jump back in the queue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our third quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everyone. FFO per share of $1.12 in the quarter was right about where we thought it would be. And we're pretty miserable compared to the pre-COVID task. Pretty good when you consider the progress we made over the second quarter. And this important that our full third of our tenants are now on a cash base, and therefore get no benefit from unpaid accrued rent or straight-line rents. As an interesting point to reference, the last time Federal Realty was routinely putting up quarterly FFO in the dollar teams was back in 2013 when the stock was trading at or above $100 a share. And while our two and three-year growth prospects back then were pretty good, they were no where near as good as they are from today's quarterly level moving forward. Let me explain why I think that's the case. Firstly, we solidify the monthly collection rent as a percentage of the total rent. Collected 84% of July billings, 85% of August, 86% of September, and so far 85% of October. November has started off solid too. Later, in all months we had expected at this point. And importantly, we're fast approaching sufficient cash generation under our dividend completely out of operating cash flow. Secondly, we're tracking lots of leasing interest in our properties as exemplified by the volume that we did in the quarter and even more so, based on the high volume of tenant conversation we're having that will likely result in deals to come on occupancy troughs. We believe we'll be in the first half of 2021. And thirdly, the lease up of our development pipeline in five major markets will be added fuel to the core portfolio lease up for which we're already seeing strong demand. Of course, there's plenty of uncertainty that remains. There's a lot of wood left to chop in the execution of this growth plan, especially in new development lease up. But the initial sign toward successful path are clear. That's a 50,000 [Indiscernible]. Let's give a bit more granular. So, the hard the operational stress in our tenant base lies with the futures of few business categories. As we all know, the theatre and gym business remain question marks as we do some percentages sit down restaurants and full price apparel. Everyone of these companies management teams are searching and modifying their business plans to some extend as final way to survey, thrive and not only today's but in tomorrow's world, whatever the maybe. Obviously, the Jury is still left. But in our case most of our tenants in these categories at our locations where strong performance coming into COVID. Therefore, on some percentage of these business inevitably fail on the coming months, then previously profitable and proven locations or either be in demand to successfully restructured by them or will be in demand by subsequent owners as they transition. The power of strong real estate and that's we're seeing already. Short term disruption per sure, but proven desirable real estate nonetheless. Let me give you a couple of examples. No fewer than seven, COVID restaurant deals from well-known Downtown Washington D.C. restaurants tours has been signed or a far down the roads either move or at another location in the Bethesda Row, Rose at Shirlington, Pike & Rose or Pentagon Row. And in several health club locations in places like Hoboken and New Jersey and others we've received unsolicited offers from healthy arrivals; Arlington, the real estate location. These are interesting times for sure and we're encouraged by the demand we're seeing from our space. Let's talk about that. I hope that the volume of new and renewed leases that we did in the quarter is encouraging to you that to us. 98 comparable deals was more than double the second quarter, and that took a normal quarterly run rate. 472,000 square feet was more than 70% higher than the second quarter. But you say, the new rent on those deals was basically flat with the old rent, actually down 1%. Well, of course it was. As a function of our negotiating and leasing philosophy and leverage in the middle of COVID. But note the average term, 5.6 years versus the normal average of roughly eight years or 30% shorter on average. Basically, we're trying to lock in strong financially desirable deals for longer term than usual, and limiting term on deals where we're trying to bridge a tenant to the other side of COVID to two or three years. But in all cases, we want the most desirable retailers and restaurants at our shopping destinations. The right tenancy is the single most important factor in attracting new class leading retailers and restaurants to fill inevitable vacancy. Why? Because retailers and restaurants considering new locations today, wants to know who their neighboring tenants will be, and how well leased up the center will be over the term of their lease. Providing clarity relating to that tendency is paramount. Here's the big point. COVID has accelerated everything. The consolidation of retail to the best centers in the trade area that began pre-COVID as and will continue to accelerate during and after COVID. If you believe that as I do, then you know how important it is to have the best-in-class tenants and not just any tenant in those centers. Accordingly, as we've said, since our first quarter call, we're willing to structure deals with those successful and important retailers and restaurants, allowing them contractual flexibility so that they remain the attraction for new class leading tenancy on the other side of COVID. That means, some deferrals, some abatements, some percentage rent deals that convert to the old rent with time or unnatural break points, et cetera. All negotiated one-on-one based on a tenant importance to the center and their financial viability. Dan will provide more details on this in a few minutes. So let me move to our construction in progress where the completed lease up timing of the office portion of our large mixed use developments is less clear than the retail or residential components because of the pandemic. While the 375,000 square foot Santana West office building is in the earlier stages of construction, and won't be ready for occupancy until 2022. The 212,000 square foot Pike and Rose office building is complete today. 45,000 square feet serves as Federal Realty's new headquarters, Benefits Advisor one digital took most of another floor and moves in next week. We just signed a deal with co-working leader industrious [ph] for two full floors or 40,000 square feet, leaving about 110,000 square feet released. And Assembly Row where PUMA will anchor that 275,000 square foot office building beginning in late 2021, 110,000 remains the business. And while the long term impact of the pandemic's work from home mandates present uncertainly in office leasing, and so timing, it's hard to predict. There's clearly a growing sentiment as the necessity of in-office collaboration for most business plans. And our view we have the best and most desirable product in the market. Come see for yourself at our new headquarters at Pike and Rose. All of these new buildings are expected to achieve legal status. Their state-of-the-art buildings with enhanced clean air system in affluent suburban communities, most the job centers and have both access to public transportation, but are also drivable with convenient parking. Most importantly, they're integrated in only magnetize mixed use environments that business leaders say is essential. So what else gives us confidence to continue to operate as we have? Frankly, it all comes down to our convictions, not only in that first ring suburban location of our real estate, the sweet spot in our view, but also in the dominant open air heavily amenitized product type and environment that we've created in those locations over the last decade or more. Evidence of the desirability of those first ring suburbs comes not only from our leasing volumes and relocation and expansion of downtown central business district retailers and restaurants or properties, but also from single family home sales data. In the third quarter, U.S. home sales volume was up 12% were in the Repin's residential database, yet the number of homes sold in Bethesda, Maryland were up 26%. Falls Church, Virginia, up 18%, Falconwood, Pennsylvania up 38%, Downers Grove Illinois up 39%, Los Gatos, California up 60%. All first tier suburbs that are home to big Federal properties. It really feels like this migratory trend from downtown CBDs to first year suburbs is going to stick for one. Of all the things that worry me as a result of this pandemic and there are plenty, filling that space with great retailers and restaurants and good economics that provide future growth is not one of them. I know that our properties positioning in those first ring suburbs major metropolitan areas will be more desirable post-COVID. I know that the decades of focus on creating comfortable and attractive open air places at those centers will further enhance their ability. Consider that nearly every discussion we've had or are having with brokers and prospective tenants in every major market that we do business, the prospective deal is premised around tenants proving the real estate, they are location, they're co tenants, their environment, and importantly, they are landlord. Tenants want to be with landlords that have money, investable, financial wherewithal, vision, execution privies and a pedigree of partnership with. Long term customer friendly service improvements, like a coordinated customer pickup program matter today a lot. All of these considerations are more important now and will certainly be on the other side of this than ever before. And we're set up for that. And before I turn it over to Dan, let me address onset place impairment loss that we recorded this quarter. It's no secret that we've struggled realizing our vision of a redeveloped mixed use community as we bought it back in 2015. First, the fits and starts with the entitlement process with city resulted in precious time loss securing existing tenants and setting up new ones in a strong retail market of 2015, 2016 and 2017. By the time those entitlements received we'll received box rents where under more pressure, construction costs continue to rise, skidding down value creation estimates. But even with all that, we were hopeful that we had a viable project with some reconfiguration of the masterplan. Then came COVID. The previous strength of the anchor system, a full size gym and LA Fitness, a big AMC theater, and to large entertainment tenants name Splitsville and game time, along with the required hotel component, as part of the intensified site became obvious weaknesses that are likely to continue to remain so for some time. Accordingly, our partnership didn't pay at maturity our $60 million non recourse note in September, and the lender has declared default. Given the other opportunities within our existing portfolio to invest capital, we've decided not to pursue redevelopment any longer there. Accordingly, we're evaluating all of our disposition options. Okay. That's about all I have for my prepared comments. Let me turn it over to Dan, for some final remarks. And we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that. Dan G : Thank you, Don. Morning, everyone. We are very encouraged by the progress and constructiveness we saw on our business over the course of the third. All of our centers remain open. They have throughout pandemic and over 97% of our tenants are open and operating. FFO per share per for the quarter through eight sequential progress over second quarters number of 45% to $1.12 per year. I'll still welcome 2019 third quarter levels, you're encouraged by the progress as our collectability adjustment was almost cut in half from $55 million in 2Q to $29 million in the third quarter. Other drivers which impacted the quarter include $0.07 of drag due to the higher interest expense given the incremental liquidity and balance sheet strength we are carrying during the pandemic. On the other side of the pandemic, we expect this drag to be non-recurring. Collections of drag due to the impact of COVID-19 on our hotel joint ventures, parking revenues and percentage rent. And this was offset by $0.03 of upside from lower expenses at the corporate level. As a result, this totals a net $0.48 of COVID-19 related negative impacts of the third quarter, a meaningful improvement over 2Qs negative COVID impact of $0.83. Collections continue to improve from the 68% level recorded on our second quarter call, up to 85% for this call for the third quarter as of October 30. I think our uncollected rent by more than half. Progress continues in October, with 80% already collected. But ahead of the September collection page and September 30. Please note that the denominator for our collection metric includes all monthly recurring rent bills and base rent charges for cam and real estate taxes and is not adjusted for deferrals and abatements. As it relates to the numerator, all deferrals and abatements are classified as uncollected. Also knows that the denominator has remained fairly consistent throughout the first nine months of the year at roughly $70 million to $71 million per month. We have continued to take a tactical approach as we negotiate and work with our tenants through this challenging period $34 million of referrals were executed in total for the second quarter and third quarter combined, of that amount, almost two-thirds or $22 million with higher credit pool basis tenants. With selected agreements, and through our anchor restaurant program, we also upgraded $21 million of second and third quarter rents. In conjunction with all of these negotiations, we have restructured many of these deals to often include one or more of the following; enhanced credits of the guarantors backing the leases, incremental percentage rent upside where we have abated rent, removal of development, parking and use restrictions and other tenant approval rights. Eliminating or pushing out tenants lease termination and co-tenancy rights, reduction or deletion of below market tenant extension options. And we were even able to finalize some agreements to open new stores at Federal centers. All of which enhances the long term value or assets in exchange for these near term concessions. As we did last quarter, we have provided disclosure relating to the impact of COVID-19 and a summary of collectability and accounts receivable which is provided on page 10 of our 8-K financial supplements, and an updated investor presentation which incorporates an update for COVID-19 that can be found for link on our investor website. As Don mentioned, leasing volume was back in full swing with over 480,000 square feet of retail deals in total, then in over 60,000 square feet of office leasing, bringing a total of almost 545,000 square feet of deals sign, our highest combined quarterly volumes since 2018. We are also encouraged by the level of activity in our leasing pipeline. This activity buttressed our leased percentage occupancy metric, which stood at 92.2% at quarter end. However, we still expect continued pressure on our occupancy metrics over the next several quarters and expect to dip into the mid to upper 80s at the trough as we talked about on our second quarter call. We do expect to see meaningful growth from those levels starting late in 2021 given current and projected demand. We are seeing three very specific leasing demand drivers of portfolio. First, in the category of urban to suburban, specifically, the restaurant deals in D.C. that Don mentioned, that are in the works at Bethesda Row, Pentagon Row, Pike and Rose and Village at Shirlington, two best-in-class restaurants and two primarily urban/mall retailers planning openings at Hoboken, as well as numerous concepts in downtown Boston in discussions of both Assembly Row and Linden Square. Seconds, upgrading real estate to best-in-market open air locations, including a Marshalls, where they are moving from a second tier lower rent location next one failing Vmall [ph] to our Gaithersburg Square asset, main and main location in that sub market, replacing a bed bath and beyond a better economic terms to us and higher rent than they were paying. Several additional deals involving other best-in-class discount apparel, mass merchandisers and grocers are in the pipeline along that same vein. And third new to market lifestyle and digitally native tenants targeting our best-in-class, open air, mixed use and lifestyle location. Santana Row attracting Nike Live, Vuori, Arcteryx, Faherty, Ugg and new restaurant concept Chika. Assembly Row landing new deals with Sephora and Shake Shack, in addition to the CVS as soon to be delivered PUMA building with several other deals in the pipeline. Pike and Rose attracting a new concept from the founders of Cava, also with more deals in the pipeline. Overall, this activity is diverse and very encouraging. Now to a discussion of the balance sheet in our further enhanced liquidity position. As you saw in early October, we raised $400 million of unsecured notes due 2026 at a 1.38% yield bringing our total pro forma liquidity at September 30 to over $2.25 billion comprised of 1.25 billion of cash, plus our undrawn $1 billion credit facility. We did this as a green bond, which I will discuss in more detail a bit later on. With our $1.2 billion in process development pipeline continuing to be executed on, we have only $500 million left to spend against this roughly $2 plus billion of dry powder. Note that this pipeline is forecasted to deliver $70 million to $80 million of POI, when it fully stabilized -- stabilizes at 2023 instead of 2024 timeframe. As evidenced by our decision to not move forward on the Sunset Place redevelopment, rest assured that we will continue to demonstrate discipline with respect to all capital and resource allocation decisions moving forward. As it relates to managing the balance sheet, we will continue to be opportunistic and pursuing equalization for asset sales, with over $200 million deals under active discussion at blended yields and the fives. We'll see how those progressed. As we discussed in the last call, we will remain -- we remain well positioned to manage through the challenging environment. The leveraging the balance sheet will continue to be a priority as we look to opportunistically bring down leverage levels over time to our historical levels. As you saw yesterday, our board made the decision to declare a regular cash dividend of $1.6 per share payable on January 15, our first dividends of 2021. Now before I hand over to Q&A, let me talk briefly about the Federal's commitment to ESG. Our ESG has always been a key part of our business strategy for more than a decade. Until 2020, we've never prioritized communicating the breadth and depth of this commitment to our stakeholders. Our inaugural corporate responsibility report was issued in late March 2020. Unfortunate timing with the pandemic. For publication we're extremely proud of [Indiscernible]. Our green bonds in October further demonstrates that commitment to form of green building design and construction with a commitment to spend $400 million on lead, silver, gold and platinum building. And we have a pipeline of comparable lead development projects, which positions us to potentially issue more green bonds in the future. Furthermore, as you've may have seen from Navy, we ranked fourth of roughly 100 real estate companies with on site solar capacity in the solar energy industry associations sees annual list of top U.S. businesses utilizing solar energy. Our accomplishments and color to come on the ESG front and kudos to Dawn Becker and Emily Gagliardi will lead this effort. With that operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Well, thank you. Federal's second quarter -- third quarter same property NOY was down 18.1%. That compares to our average for scripts at about 12 point -- down 12.7%. What's responsible for the somewhat lower same property revenue versus some of your script peers? Don Wood : Let me start with that actually, Dan, and then you go. You know, Craig, Dan is going to follow. But I don't know. And I almost don't care. And I don't mean that tongue in cheek. What we are trying to do is not to kind of get back to where we were. But to effectively in an over retailed environment, make sure that on the other side of this we have better shopping. In order to do that, we're effectively cutting the deals that we need to cut with tenants that we think will be critically important on the other side. We are actively, frankly, not helping out the tenants that won't make it and will produce more vacancy. And so there is very little focus in this company right now on comparable POI. Because in our view, it's not relevant. It's relevant from the standpoint of overall cash flow to make sure we can pay our bills, we can pay our dividend and set ourselves up for the future. But that's it. So from a comparative perspective, I know I have no answer to your question in terms of us versus the peers. Maybe Dan does. But I wanted to get that out first. Dan G : Yes. Just from a kind of a mathematical perspective, like the big driver is obviously the collectability adjustment. And look, our approach, I mean, the fact that we have more the highest percentage of tenants on a cash basis and take what we feel is a very prudent approach and an appropriate approach. But that drives our collectability adjustments as a percentage of build revenues to be one of the highest in the sector. And that's the biggest driver. Look, I think it's going to allow us to probably have less, more transparency during this during this period, and less impact going forward. Craig Schmidt : Thanks. And then just as a follow up. How is the leasing activity surrounding Third Street Promenade? And have the leasing efforts been hindered by LA County's conservative real stance? Jeff Berkes : Hey, Craig, it's Jeff Berkes. And yes. I think that's absolutely true. We obviously have some space on Third Street that we need to deal with and we are. But until things are open up and we can kind of see a little bit clearer to the other side of the pandemic, I don't expect to see a ton of leasing activity on Third Street Promenade, whether it's our buildings or anybody's buildings. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good morning. So if we put aside FFO and things NOY for a moment. If we had a chance to be [Indiscernible] some of your meetings and what you're seeing on the ground. What do you think is the most underappreciated aspect of what's happening with your tenancy and your portfolio today? Don Wood : Yes. That's a good question Ki Bin. You know, the -- if you're thinking late 202, 2022, 2023, and you put yourself in the kind of position of a retail or trying to do a deal today. If you imagine them, we're asking them to commit to a series of payments for seven years, 10 years, et cetera, where they have less visibility today of who their co tenancy is going to be, probably than they've ever had. And so the notion of the work that we're doing today to make sure the right tenants are there in that center to effectively give them confidence to be able to enter into an economically strong deal is something that you can't see in the results. And philosophically, it's something in my view, that's very different to the extent we do it, because we're doing that everywhere. Every shopping center is about how to make sure the inevitable additional vacancy, which by the way we've never had. So this will be the first time where the ability to get into a Federal Center is actually practical. If you're 93% leased, and you're trying to lease up to 95% or so you have -- we have 23 million square feet, so every point of occupancy, its roughly 230,000 square feet of space. And you do that on shopping, a lot of deals, et cetera. If you're down at 88% leased, and you're going to get back to 95% over a period of time. Then for the first time, we've got the ability to put tenants in that have tried to move up to a Federal Center, but have been unable to. For that to be successful, we better have the right tenants as the foundation in each of those shopping centers. And that's effectively where we spend all of our time. And I truly, I wasn't being snooty with respect to Craig, the first question, trying to compare that to what other people are doing and how they're doing it is not something we're focused on. So that I think is a truly. I think it's the secret if you will to value creation, you're on the other side of this. We don't tend to be a $7 stock on the other side and not -- if we don't see back where we were, it tend to be more and better. So it's not about a percentage of where we were, the percentage of where we're going. And that is a fundamental way of management throughout this building that everybody is focusing on and think that's a little different. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. That's helpful. And the second question. I've heard of tenants. I think it was mostly a restaurant that you had belief and that was going really well before COVID and you're providing some facts to support. I know, it's a very short timeframe to gauge any results or activity. But how does that feel right now? You feel like you've made the right investments? And are those tenants starting to show signs of life where they're going to come out the other end? Don Wood : Yes. Very much so. Now look, the big question there is will we feel the same way through January and February and March? Right. I mean, that is still whether anybody wants to talk about it or not, that is certainly with respect to that category, the period of time that'll we'd see whether the prudence if you will of keeping them strong with smart or not. But it's been an amazing weather here on both of those frankly. The production of our restaurant product has been ridiculously strong. At Assembly Row, they're operating 80% change, 85% of where they were. At Santana Row numbers are more than 100% of where they were, because we've done so much outside seating and expanded their capacity, et cetera. So, has it worked so far? Sure. But the real test will come in the next few months. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Katy McConnell with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Katy McConnell : Great. Thanks and good morning. So assuming you no longer building for Sunset redevelopment. Do you have any other plans for that capital? Or is it just reinvesting and leasing CapEx at this stage? Or are you seeing any interesting opportunities in the market right now for other investments, given all the disruption that's going on? Don Wood : Yes, it's a good question. First of all, we have a lot of development in progress. And so certainly, we have used to that capital that are certainly identified for. Do I expect over the next year or two for there to be opportunities with assets that we'd love to own? You bet. I do, I really hope we see that. We're starting to -- it'd be interesting even with our on the other side of that with our assets sales to see what the market value of them are as we sell a couple of them. None of which have obviously closed yet, at this point. So we'll see how that plays out. But yes, we do see opportunities that way. And we're judicious users of capital. I mean, there's nothing more embarrassing to me then the Sunset Place failure. There's a lot of good reasons for the failure, but still a failure. So we take very seriously where we allocate capital, why we think the dividend is so important from that perspective. And to the extent, we find as we expect to additional opportunities with great real estate going forward, you'll see exactly. Katy McConnell : Okay, great. Then, since the tenant base, people are waiting to walk away from that. I'm curious if you're thinking about your exposure to fitness, or other experiential tenant categories differently today. Those are going to be targeted asset sales going forward? Don Wood : Yes, no. I don't -- so there's a couple of things about that in the fitness category and in the theater category. So I believe both categories will exist. Do I believe both categories are important for communities going forward? You bet I do. But certainly the jury's out on what their business models will be able to be. What they will need to be profitable? How they will be able to? What levels of rent they'll be able to pay. So you bet that's what I worry about. It's one thing when you're talking about an established retail center, that's got a place and is important to a community to have a tenant like that where you can backfill, you can do another use in our case, in other ways, it's completely different than starting afresh and building a new one. And the -- obviously the Sunset investment would be putting a lot of faith on those users in terms of what they can pay and what their job is going to be in the future while there's from a completely new investment and that was just a bridge too far for us to take. Katy McConnell : Okay. Thank you. Don Wood : Thanks Katy. Operator : And our next question is from [Indiscernible]. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning out there? Don Wood : Hi. Unidentified Analyst : Dan, I guess, on your comments on the dividend intriguing, I believe you said you're fast approaching sufficient cash flow to fully cover the dividend. So, I guess I was hoping to expand upon that a bit more on how you and the board is thinking about the dividend here? Obviously, you don't want to cut it like most of your peers have. But 3Q gap episode, the $1.12 implies a mid $4 share-ish outlook for next year, which pretty comparable to this year. So flat earnings. And you're sitting here without coverage already above 110%. So I guess I'm curious if you guys, even the board think maintaining the dividend yield is the right move, even if you can afford to give them a strong liquidity you outlined before and how long you might be willing to overpay it? Thanks. Dan G : Yes. We talk so much about this over the past six months, but the there has to be a guiding philosophy. And ours may be a little different than yours. We believe that dividends at that bargain that's been put out there for investors is a key portion of their total return. And the idea on the other side of this, and as I say we certainly see a path to getting back to an 80% payout ratio or something like that. The idea of giving up on that, as you say when you can afford to do so on balance seems premature. Now -- and that is exactly how the board and we talk about it, we think about it. It's clearly an important part of total returns. So nobody knows how long COVID will go and what story is. And at some point we may not be able to do that. But certainly in November of 2020, which is as I think you know, the first quarter dividend for 2021, paying $80 million in the form of a dividend, we'll certainly have to ultimately pay that anyway. Because it will certainly have more than $80 million of taxable income next year. And that probably applies to February too. Now, by that point, we're going to have a whole lot more visibility as to whether we're able to get out of that, get out of that hole into later in 202, 2022, et cetera. And we'll make decisions at that point, as we do, frankly, every three months, but to me the November one in particular was a pretty -- that's helpful. Unidentified Analyst : It is. Thanks. And also you mentioned [Indiscernible]. I'm curious if there's any commonality, the geographic focus or product speculative sell here. And what you're seeing in the market today in terms of buyer demand? And any insight into the cap rate and what level of NOY the buyers are underwriting? Thanks. Dan G : Yes. Jenny. Jeff Berkes : Yes. I'll handle. Its Jeff. Maybe the best way to say assessing the market on a few assets right now. They're all very different in terms of what they are and where they are. So of course, we're seeing different responses from the market. And I don't want to talk too much about pricing, because we're in the middle of negotiations on all of them. But I will tell you, assets that you think would trade at high prices. We are seeing prices that we think are strong. What more to talk about on it on a topic hopefully next quarter, but there are buyers out there, just like there are tenants that don't have legacy issues and have capital and they're doing leases. There are buyers without legacy issues that have capital and they're going to be buying real estate. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Anything other NOY? Jeff Berkes : I'm not going to comment on that. No. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning down there. Don, overall, as you look at your tenant base. One, your restaurant comments are definitely super helpful and impressive that experiential tenants have really rebounded that way. But overall, as you look at your tenant base, how much of a shift you think that you'll expect going forward meaning, do you think that maybe it's just a little bit of a trim where maybe you want to dial back exposure to some of these areas boosted in these areas? Or do you think that your exposure that you had before really will continue to take hold on a go forward? Don Wood : Yes. It's a great question, Alex. And when you kind of think about those decisions and what you're doing, obviously you're making decisions for a decade or more and then in that regard. The answer is not holistic as you might like it to be. It might be easier, understandable or holistic, but it's not. It really comes down to the individual shopping center, the individual mixed use, project, and what it needs for that community. And what is interesting to me as well, I'm sure, for a number of years, there will be far less restaurants, effectively doing this and making money doing business. Where will those restaurants go? And where will they be? It is in the process of being figured out now, all over the country. And I do think D.C. is a little ahead of that. Because of the geography of D.C., what was downtown? What is in these first tier suburbs? You know, there is really good product in the first year suburb. Frankly, I think we've had a lot to do with that over the last 40 years. And so the ability of a restaurant tour who is really hot downtown, but whose customers are not coming there anymore, either because their offices are closed or because they're in the suburbs, and they're choices there that they feel better about are causing these restaurants to come and look at us. And frankly, in numbers that have surprised us. ___ is our key leasing person on that. And they certainly don't surprise him and tell me this was going to happen all the way along, but surprise me a little bit. And so overall, when you go kind of market-by-market and what product we have in each market, I think it's likely that we'll have a similar diverse, certainly diversified income stream five and 10 years from now, might that change on the gym side or the theater side? Potentially, because I think those are the ones -- those are the businesses that are less predictable in terms of what the profitable business model is going to be. But in terms of food, so it's going to be an important part of what Federal does. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. I remember a decade ago you out of the credit crisis, you've made the comment that food is a is part of the debt, he said necessity, but retail is not a luxury, but restaurants are a part of feeding people. Well, a lot of people they spend money to have gorgeous kitchens. But keep them pristine? Don't use them go out. So second question is on. I think, Dan, you said that a 30-year tenants are now cash renting? And if that's correct. So big picture, you've collected 85% of rents overall, presumably that actually pays tenants. But if you think about the outlook and the trough occupancy that you spoke about in the first half of next year, what do you think is the take out between the remaining 15% attendance where you haven't collected friends? And that third of tenants for pain patch, collectively out? How do you think that will all shake out? Dan G : I think it really, well, we're fighting for every dollar from every tenant, whether they're a cash basis tenant, or an accrual basis tenant. And yet we have more folks on a cash basis in terms of from an accounting perspective, because I think we view them as is not probable, to be able to pay for their entire lease. But we're going to fight aggressively to make sure that we get back as much of that rent possible. I think it remains to be seen there will be some shakeout, I think that we will see some shakeout in our local small shop through the pandemic, I think that we'll see continued pressure on some of the weaker retailers across the different categories into 2021 the first half. And then I think we'll continue to -- we'll see how things play out with regards to the theater and fitness stance. Alexander Goldfarb : But do you think Dan, is it reasonable if we say, half of each of those things goes away or is that not a reasonable supposition? Dan G : I think it's really tough for, yes. Some portion of that we'll be looking to backfill. I can't give you a number now, Alex. But I think we're pretty well positioned that even if they do go away, it's not permanent. And we'll have demand to backfill and backfill it in practice economics. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinnis : Hi, good morning. This is Greg McGinnis on with Nick. Could you just walk us through the impact that tenant bankruptcies have had on portfolio occupancy and APR this year? And then kind of what's still left outstanding in regards to tenants still navigating the bankruptcy process? Also, any additional near term risk on your watch list? Or has that tree been shaken hard enough already? Dan G : Now bankruptcy on, pull it on our occupancy rates roughly about 80 basis points impact. So far, we've got probably exposure to about 4% of our revenues, as it relates to all tenant to a file this year. If you back out those tenants who have emerged from bankruptcy, and stayed open in our centers, it's probably total exposure of about three and a quarter percent. And of those do we expect to close ultimately, it's probably in the one and a quarter to one and half range in terms of as a percentage of our total revenue. Greg McGinnis : Okay. Thanks. And then on that. Yes, definitely. And then on the watch list, do you think more fallout this year, early next year? Do we shake tree hard enough during the pandemic that most of the things is already sell out at this point? Dan G : Look, I look, I think that the worst of 2020 has hit us. But I think we'll see another wave, certainly in the first half of 2021 of more pains to kind of hit. And that's why we've forecasted that our occupancy will go down below the 90% level certainly in the first half of 2021. Greg McGinnis : Okay. Thanks for that. I guess just the other question I had was on -- you've had fairly stable rent collection numbers for the last few months here. Are you expecting much turned up in the next few months into the year end? Or how should we be thinking about that? Jeff Berkes : No, I think it I think, the high 80s is where we'll probably be, if you're going to continue calculated the same way as it's been. And I think that's because there'll be some additional Fallout, as I, as Dan and I both said, that we believe will happen this winter. And yes, there'll be deferrals that are paid back that goes the other way. So, effectively, a balance about where we are probably a little bit better than where we are is what we're looking at right now. Greg McGinnis : All right. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Vince Tibone : Hi, good morning. Dan G : Hi, Vince. Vince Tibone : How do you think increased working from home across the country has impacted foot traffic Shopping Center. In longer term, do you think more of this permanently could change the demand profile for the urban centers or the ideal merchandise unit? Love to get your thoughts on that? Don Wood : It's so interesting to me. And I'll just give you one example, that kind of goes right to the point of your question. When we're underwriting Hoboken investment last year, which is a lot of street retail and residential apartments on top of it. We said, the downfall of Hoboken is that there isn't a lot of office in Hoboken. And so daytime traffic is always the thing that that we worry about there, because it needs nights and weekends are where they make they make their money. Well, it's one of our better performing asset. And it's one of our better performing assets because people are home. And so traffic during the day and during the street -- on the street and around is strong. Our collections are strong, our tenants are relatively strong. Yes, there were tenants that are going away like everywhere else and we'll be able to backfill. But that kind of combination of being on that side of the river from New York and having people home has been a real benefit. Now, can you take that and extrapolate that all over the country to all kinds of centers? I don't know. I think that's a bit of a stretch. But there is no doubt that that some of the benefits of working for home are helping the community centers. Do I think it'll stay at the level that it is? No, I do not. And as I was saying before I -- as another example, we are in our offices now for 90 days. We're not fully in, but we've got about 50 or 60 people that come in each day for an offset is normally 150 or 160 people each day. The experience here, the ability to effectively walk around what it's done outside and how people feel in here has been ridiculously encouraging. I didn't expect this much of a boost to morale, this much of a -- kind of a good feel from coming into a new office. So that doesn't mean that decision makers are deciding today to enter new office leases. But we do see everywhere, the sentiment that a growing percentage of people want to be back and a growing percentage of employers are embracing that. So I think it'll be a balance, as with most things between where we used to be and where we will be. And I think that diversity of opportunity is what protects the income stream. Vince Tibone : Yes. Thank you for that color and thoughts. One more for me. Can you discuss just the expected CapEx, the meeting economics that have to return it a former theater with another use? Don Wood : Yes. It's a good point. It's hard to deploy profitably if it's not enough of theater. And the exception to that, maybe were kind of going back to our last question. Theaters on the second floor and things like that, that are retentive, depending on how they were built, whether the stadium seating is structural, whether it's -- there's a lot of detail, obviously, into how a building is built and how it needs to be reconfigured. But to the extent you've got high rents in the area where we're talking about high office rents, or otherwise, you can make the economics work. It's really tough, because construction costs are construction costs that have low rents, and to effectively -- yes, you can get a bump up in rent. But pretty hard to get a bump up netted the capital. So high rents to your friends, if you're in markets, that can support that when you do have to reconfigure a space, any space, frankly. Vince Tibone : Thanks. Is there any rule of thumb just for like the CapEx per theater? Or just it's too hard to generalize doing all this kind of specs and in the detail you meet him? Don Wood : I can't get you there. I know that in a number of places, whether we're looking at it, and it's still being built out by the theater operator in new development down in CocoWalk. That's one particular set of economics. Here at Pike and Rose with an IPIC and the way that is built out, that would be a completely different set of economics. I'm not sure I can get you. I know I can't give you a number that you're asking for, because they are very different. Vince Tibone : Make sense. Thank you for the time. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jeffries. Please proceed with your questions. Linda Tsai : Hi. thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on Alex's cash basis question. How much revenue did you collect from cash basis tenants in 3Q? Dan G : Roughly about 60% collections from cash basis in third quarter. Linda Tsai : And then how does it compare to 2Q? Dan G : Significantly increase. It was about 40% collection for cash basis tenants in the second quarter. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then just more. How do you think the passage of additional PPP loans positively impact some of your tenants on the bubble and get some to the other side? Or do the pressures facing them in the current environment extend beyond what these loans can provide? Dan G : It remains to be seen Linda. But PPP loans were important. They were certainly important in this first phase. I think you'll see -- I'm sure, you'll see more now in the second phase, probably in the January February timeframe. I think they're very important. I think particularly because of the timing here. And I think if you had sit back and you kind of think about it, this will be a really interesting year. You know how you and me and all of us feel coming out of winter, into a spring normally. And normally, there's a there's a pickup in consumer spending. Normally there's a pickup and what's happening. This year has the potential to be a really good one. Because in addition to that normal feeling coming out of the winter into the spring, I do believe there'll be VPP money or something like that, that'll be a pretty critically important. I do believe there'll be a vaccine, which even if it's not delivered or completely total efficacy, et cetera, will still be very important. And I do believe that it'll be a tougher winner than it normally is anyway, because of the situation we're in. So PPP is just one piece of I think of number of catalysts that could really make that spring and summer of 2021 better than anything. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Lucas : Hey, good morning, guys. Dan, just on the cash position, I guess just kind of curious. Should we be thinking about utilization event for the upcoming bond maturity and then the term loan into next year? Or will you be tapping the markets again, to maintain your cash position as you kind of face those maturities? Dan G : I think we're certainly going to use the cash we have to repay the bonds that come due in January. Look, we've got the flexibility to extend the term loan for another year from March. And so we're going to maintain maximum flexibility based upon the -- flexibility based upon the visibility we see as we go through and work our way through. And so, won't be judicious in terms of managing our cash balances. But we're going to we're going to keep a cash in place for as long as we feel like we need it. Chris Lucas : And then I guess just on the transaction side you had gone under contract with a parcel at Grand Park earlier. Remember if it's earlier this year or last year. But is that transaction still proceeding or this sort of close either later this year into next quarter next year? Dan G : Yes. We're still on track. It's probably going to push into kind of next year, with the first half of next year, but it's on track. And we feel reasonably good that that's [Indiscernible]. It will happen in March of 2021. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then in the pricing is kind of held up. Nothing's changed on that? Dan G : Exactly where we connect. Chris Lucas : And then, Don, I'm sorry, if I missed this in your earlier comments. Relates to Sunset, have you guys stopped negotiating with the lender at this point? Don Wood : We have not yet at this point. We'll see where we go, though. Chris Lucas : Okay, super. That's all I had this morning. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about apparel collections. I mean, obviously, fitness and restaurants and everything comes up frequently to slow collection rates. But when you have apparel that's been open, generally, since the spring and collection rates during the 70s to 80s. I Guess, how broad based? Is the collection rate low? Or is it really just dragged down by a small subset of those tenants? Don Wood : Yes. It is. You're on it. I mean, that is absolutely another category. The thing is it really depends. So there is more variability in what happens there. We're collecting in the mid 70s, or something of the of the apparel tenant, department stores. And so it's -- it's certainly not bringing up the overall collection. Mike Mueller : Yes. And then last question on that, anecdotally, what are you hearing in terms of sales, though, in terms of sales conversions there? Don Wood : Very much depends on the particular store. The small shop full price. Apparel stores are probably struggling the most. Mike Mueller : Okay. Thank you. Don Wood : Thanks. Operator : And we have reached the end of our question and answer session. And I'll now turn the call over to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks everyone for joining us today. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. And you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Leah, please go ahead. Leah Brady : Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for Federal Realty's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker, and Melissa Solis. They'll be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results.

The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. We do ask that given the number of participants that you limit your questions to one or two per person during the Q&A portion of the call, feel free to jump back in the queue, if you have additional questions. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah, and good evening, everyone. We closed out 2020 just about as we thought we would, with fourth quarter FFO per share of $1.14 and the total year at $4.52 or roughly 29% off 2019's record results. The fourth quarter and total year numbers exclude the debt prepayment charge that we took when early retiring our 22 bonds and as miserable as 2020 was, and it was pretty miserable we're very clear as to our priorities and can see our path forward. There is no doubt that the second wave of government shutdowns in our coastal markets that ramped up around Thanksgiving last year and largely continues through today, though there are at least some encouraging signs of some loosening of late, have and continue to hurt us in terms of rent collection and the likely business failures that will come from them. Yet despite that, our growth prospects are really strong when the following three things happen : one, vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets; number two, our coastal markets actually reopen; and number three, the consumer behavior reverts to uninhibited freedom and the spending that goes with it, behavior that we are supremely confident will happen. And while that's certainly not the environment that we're living through or operating in yet, the sheer volume of leasing and other transactions that we executed at the end of last year, 103 retail deals for 469,000 square feet, coupled with the strong leasing demand environment that is evident by the many substantive discussions we're having today and some very important management promotions and alignments that we'd just announced set us up extremely well for a strong post-COVID recovery as those conditions prevail. All right. So where do we go from here? Well, as previously announced the sale of Sunset Place and two other shopping centers in December effectively generated $170 million of proceeds in debt relief. We put out a press release in January that you should check out for more detail if you haven't seen it. Using that capital along with cash on the balance sheet, we repaid $500 million of senior unsecured notes, half of which were retired early, the result of which means that we have no public bonds maturing until June of 2023. So with little debt due in the next 2.5 years, along with nearly $800 million in cash remaining on the balance sheet and a completely untapped $1 billion credit facility, we've got something of a war chest on hand, should we find retail opportunities that fit our business model in 2021 and 2022. And make no mistake, we're actively looking, including in markets with hot job and income growth where we haven't looked before. A little more geographic diversity in our income stream carefully considered is an objective of ours. But today, with the trader's day \u2013 with a day trader's mentality rather, so prevalent in so many corners of the investor and analyst worlds, it's hard to look past short-term results, particularly those at higher multiple companies who are far from immune from the economically devastating effects of government imposed shutdowns, most notably seen in the heavily populated coastal markets. Heck, 85% of Federal's property operating income comes from California, Massachusetts, particularly Somerville, New York, New Jersey, metropolitan Philadelphia, Maryland, and Northern Virginia. These markets have the most restrictive government-imposed COVID laws in the country by far. And they make 2021 more uncertain than at some of our peers, nothing we can do about that. Serenity Prayer comes to mind every day that I grapple with that. But those restrictions sure don't diminish the quality of the real estate that we own in these first-ring suburbs of major metropolitan areas, nor the tenant demand for a spot in these properties in the future as evidenced by the leasing volume we're doing, along with the conversations we're having with many retailers about their future real estate plans. So here's an interesting fact, when you bifurcate our entire portfolio between the 75% or so of essential service type shopping centers that we own and the retail component of the 25% or so of our properties that are mixed use or lifestyle oriented, performance varies greatly as far as percentage of rent collected or percentage of operating income diminution from last year pre-COVID. Predictably, it's what you would think. The mixed use and lifestyle tenancy, heavy in restaurants, theaters, gyms, and the like has been disproportionately hurt by the shutdowns. There is no real news there. You all know that. But the irony is that those assets represent not only some of the best real estate that Federal Realty owns, but arguably some of the best, most desirable retail real estate in the country, that's not changing. So in a nutshell, 75% of our properties, the necessity based ones, are performing in line or arguably better than other necessity based REITS despite being in government restricted coastal markets. Think about that. In and of itself that's pretty impressive to us. The remaining 25% of our properties, the mixed-use and lifestyle ones have been disproportionately hurt because of their merchandise mix but represent our best most desirable real estate and therefore naturally have superior growth prospects, particularly from the beaten down levels they're currently performing at. That cash growth \u2013 cash flow growth formula feels like a winning one to us when vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets, when our coastal markets reopen and when consumer behavior reverts uninhibited freedom and the spending that goes with it. Everything we see suggests that it should be a strong 2022. We'll talk more about that in Dan's comments. And on a celebratory note, I hope you'll join me in congratulating Jeff Berkes and our other executives, who have been promoted effective with our Board meeting earlier this week. I hope you saw the press release that we just put out. Many of you have gotten to know Jeff over the years, and I'm sure he share my appreciation for his intelligence, for his real estate savvy without question for his unimpeachable integrity. Jeff and I have been close partners for over 20 years now. And this elevation in responsibility comes at a crucial time given the expected post-COVID retail real estate environment. We need to be as tight and productive as humanly possible. Now to head off the inevitable speculation, let me get it out there by saying that forming the position of Company President and Chief Operating Officer, shouldn't be construed to mean that I have plans of going anywhere anytime soon. I don't. But as I've continually talked about and acted upon, career development and succession planning are always top of mind at every level in our company. This new position is a great training ground. I'm sure there will be lots of questions following our prepared remarks. So I'll cut it short today, end mine there and turn it over to Dan for his comments on the quarter before we open the lines to your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. We are generally pleased with the progress we see in our portfolio as we closed out a difficult year. While all of our centers remain open, with 98% of our retail tenants open and operating in some capacity as of February 1. COVID-19 induced government restrictions continues to provide challenges to their businesses. We reported FFO per share of $1.14, up a couple of cents from third quarter. Now trying to assess what specifically is the direct negative impact of COVID-19 is difficult, but let me walk you through some of the drivers of our results during the quarter. On the positive side, we continue to see and be encouraged by the resiliency of our tenant base overall as collectability adjustments continued to shrink from $55 million in the second quarter to $29 million in the third quarter to just $19 million in the most recent. From a sequential perspective, this progress was offset by a number of items, many of which were one timers : $0.04 of impact from several non-recurring items hitting G&A, $0.03 of drag from higher property level expenses that were primarily seasonal in nature as well as $0.03 of headwinds due to the timing of fourth quarter debt capital transactions that we executed. As a result, headline progress versus the third quarter was muted. Year-over-year relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, we saw a direct negative net impact of COVID-19 for the quarter of $0.37 per share. Continued improvement over the second and third quarter's direct negative COVID impact of $0.83 and $0.48 respectively. Collections continue to improve on the 72% and 85% levels, previously reported for 2Q and 3Q respectively, and are now up to 89% for the fourth quarter, solid progress despite weakness in December and January due to the second wave of government mandated restrictions in place in the majority of our markets. As a reminder, our approach to reporting collections is very transparent, and in our view the appropriate approach. The denominator is comprised of all monthly billed base rent plus charges for CAM and real estate taxes and is not adjusted for deferrals and abatements. In our numerator, all deferrals and abatements are classified as uncollected. Also note that our denominator remained fairly consistent throughout 2020 at roughly $70 million to $71 million per month. During the fourth quarter, we continue to take a tactical approach as we negotiate and work with our tenants through this unprecedented impact on our businesses. $36 million of deferrals were executed in total for 2020. Of that amount, $22 million is with higher credit accrual basis tenants. Abatement agreements now totaled $37 million as additional rent concessions were provided as government restrictions impacted our tenants' ability to operate at full capacity. Abatements will continue in 2021, primarily the result of temporary percentage rent arrangements as we have made the decision to partner with many of our tenants to get to the other side of the pandemic together with the objective of longer-term benefits and stronger sustainable growth. As we did in the first six months of the pandemic, we took advantage of these negotiations to improve many qualitative lease provisions and exchange for that rent flexibility. Incremental percentage rent upside where we have abated rent, removal of development, parking and use restrictions, eliminating tenant lease termination and cotenancy right and the deletion of below market, tenant extension options all enhance the long-term value of our assets and exchange for these near-term concessions. Now following the surge of productivity during the third quarter, we had another solid quarter of leasing with almost 470,000 square feet of total retail deals and then add in 33,000 square feet of office leasing, bringing our total to over 0.5 million square feet of fourth quarter deals signed, combined with the third quarter that's over 1 million square feet of leasing to close out the second half of the year. We are also very encouraged by the level of activity in the leasing pipeline. As a result, our occupancy metrics have demonstrated surprising resiliency with our leased metrics standing at 92.2% at year end, flat versus the third quarter statistic, and our occupied metric remaining in the 90s at 90.2%. These levels are off 200 basis points and 230 basis points respectively versus year end 2019 levels. While we still expect continued pressure on our occupancy over the next few quarters and expect to dip into the upper 80s at the trough, as we have previously discussed, continued leasing activity at the volumes we achieved in the second half of 2020 will set us up for more pronounced growth in 2022. We continue to see strength from the same leasing demand drivers we've talked about on prior calls : first, urban and CBD tenants migrating to top-tier first-ring suburban assets; top-tier tenants upgrading their real estate to the best in market open-air locations; and third, new to market lifestyle and digitally native tenants targeting our best-in-class, open-air, mixed-use and lifestyle properties. As Don highlighted, while our lifestyle and mixed-use oriented assets have underperformed in the COVID environment, new demand from these best-in-class lifestyle tenants has been strong. As evidenced by lease yields and openings during the pandemic with brands such as Nike Live, Athleta, Sephora, Warby Parker, Room & Board, Serena & Lily Arc'teryx, Vuori, Lovesac, Faherty, Bluemercury, NIC and ZOE, Shake Shack, Sweetgreen, Levain Bakery, Salt & Straw and anchor restaurants such as Teleferic Barcelona, Nighthawk Pizza, Chika, Stellina, Spanish Diner and Planta with two openings, to name more than just a few, plus many more under negotiation. Needless to say, our best-in-class mixed-use and lifestyle real estate is poised for a significant rebound in 2022. Our residential portfolio has held up reasonably well during the pandemic with collection levels up towards 98%, the only exception being our 450 units at Assembly Row where the Montaje's felt some weakness as expected. Average comparable leased occupancy for our 2,700 comparable residential units stood at 95.1%, down only 60 basis points from year-end 2019. Our existing office portfolio has performed solidly during the pandemic as well with collections averaging 97% and occupancy remaining stable. As we've discussed previously, however, lease-up of office space in our development pipeline will be slower than we had expected pre-COVID as corporate decision-makers postpone space planning needs by at least a year to 18 months. That being said, preleasing at CocoWalk stands at 75%, with South Florida office demand remaining strong. At Assembly, PUMA is building out its new headquarters space in 55% of Block 5B on Grand Union Boulevard. And PUMA, at this point, plans to move all of their employees in this summer. Pike & Rose has 63% of 909 Rose Avenue is spoken for. One Santana West lease-up remains speculative, however, openings are not expected until 2022. Now to a quick discussion of the balance sheet and an update on our further enhanced liquidity position. The fourth quarter was an active one on the capital markets front. In early October, we raised $400 million of unsecured notes in a green bond. The second half of December, we repaid $500 million of unsecured notes. In December, we sold $170 million in assets that at a blended in-place yield inside of 4%. This left us with $800 million of cash available and an undrawn $1 billion credit facility, providing $1.8 billion of total liquidity at year-end with no bonds maturing until 2023. With our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline continuing to be executed upon, we have just over $400 million left of that to spend.  As Don mentioned, we find ourselves today sitting with significant dry powder. And with Don's and my remarks today, we hope we have conveyed to you the optimism that we have for the future of our business and the strength of our portfolio to truly thrive on the other side of the pandemic. Our ability to generate outsized cash flow growth is fairly clear when, as Don said, vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets, those coastal markets reopen and consumer behavior reverts to uninhibited freedom and the spending. But the timing for those three things to occur is from clear and certainly not clear in 2021. As a result, for 2021, we are not providing formal guidance at this time. The best we can do for you, if you need a stake in the ground, is that it's roughly going to be flat to 2020 with the first quarter of 2021 at roughly $1 per share and build each quarter from there. We do ironically feel significantly more confident in providing an outlook for 2022 than we do for the current year. Based upon the leasing activity and demand we see for our real estate, the strength of our essential retail portfolio, the significant upside in our mixed-use and lifestyle retail assets, the resiliency and stability of our existing residential and office and the phasing in of POI from our $1.2 billion development pipeline in 2022, 2023 and into 2024, we expect 2022 FFO per share will be in the low $5 range, representing double-digit FFO growth year-over-year. So stay tuned. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will be coming from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey good evening. First, Jeff, congratulations. So awesome for you to get the new title, business cards and all the fun stuff. And then congrats to Barry and the rest of the folks who have gotten promotions. So two questions here. Don, just thinking big picture, you're not alone in traditional coastal REITs who are now exploring other markets, presumably down South, the Sun Belt. But it's interesting because, for the past two decades, there's been this whole coastal, coastal, coastal, and then suddenly with COVID, everyone's looking elsewhere. So my question is, is it really COVID or you guys have been thinking for several years now about expanding to new markets? Maybe they are down at the Sun Belt, but the COVID and what's happened was just sort of the catalyst, the expeditor. Don Wood : Yes. Alex, that's a great question. It really is. The \u2013 first of all, I don't want to \u2013 my comments to be construed as not being positive with respect to the coastal markets. At the end of the day, it's jobs and good paying jobs at that. And when you sit and you think about kind of where we are in those markets, in those first-tier suburbs, that looks really strong. Now when you go forward and you say, okay, where would you like to put incremental capital, it doesn't mean we still won't look in the markets that we're in that we know, but it does mean that, through COVID, it's pretty darn clear that there will be other job center growth places that were starting pre-COVID but, like almost everything, have accelerated as a result of it. So when you think about markets like Phoenix, when you think about markets more like Florida and what's happening in South Florida and a couple of others, I do think it would be wrong of us to not effectively understand the dynamics in them and to be able to act on it to the extent we get comfortable with the highest-quality stuff in those markets. You'll never see us going down quality, Alex, and that's a really important point. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, it also seems like, recently, there's a lot of demand from entrepreneurs, people starting up, whether it's new restaurants or new concepts. And yet, at the same time, there's still tenants who are struggling, and I don't just mean like movie theater or gym but some others. So can you just sort of walk through what's happening? Why is it \u2013 or how is it that we're seeing these spurts of new tenants forming at the same time that you're still seeing a bunch of people struggle? It just seems to be this odd paradox. I just want to better understand it. Is it purely just the categories themselves, and that's it? Or are there other dynamics at work that are driving some of these new leases that you're seeing? Don Wood : Well, first of all, there are certainly lots of dynamics. But one of the single most important things to remember is companies that are struggling at this point and continue to struggle on here, I cannot say enough about the impact of the government restrictions. I mean we're a business of contracts, and when the government steps in and effectively doesn't allow the contract to be performed \u2013 it's the weirdest time I've ever been involved in. So absent that, you do have new businesses being formed with new bases. So legacy costs of old businesses and having to be able to figure out how they're going to make money going forward with all those legacy costs is sometimes much harder than a new business coming in. If you take a look at what some \u2013 what's happening in the gym space, for example, you'll see new purchases of gyms \u2013 with packages of gyms at a fraction of the cost that you thought that, that gym company was worth 12 months ago. Now when you come in with a new low basis, you've got a completely different P&L, you've got a completely different business plan, different balance sheet and the ability to afford and to pay what you need to do to get in some of that high-quality real estate. So it's a natural cleansing that won't just be in 2021. This is a phenomenon that will take a number of years to work through. What you will see, the single biggest thing from my perspective, is businesses coming in with a lower cost basis to start versus their existing legacy competitors. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you, Don. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Don, I guess on the leasing, I was just wondering, if you could provide a little bit more color. I appreciate what you and Dan talked about in terms of the activity in Q3 and Q4. And I'm just curious, if the strength is concentrated by region, if it's concentrated more by product type or price point within the portfolio. Just trying to get a sense for maybe where you're seeing the greatest and then areas where you may be seeing less demand. Don Wood : Well, let me start out this way, so on the call, Steve, Wendy Seher, who as you know, has the biggest part of our portfolio and a lot of that is essential based assets unless in some boxes and let her to speak to that. And then Berkes is also on the call. That can give you a much better idea on the mixed-use kind of stop, if you will in that. So, listen to those two and then I'll try to put it all together. Wendy? Wendy Seher : Steve, thank you. On the Eastern Region, I've been looking at \u2013 as I've been looking at our pipeline, and if you look at our pipeline in January of this year versus January of last year before the pandemic happened we actually have more activity on the East and more in our pipeline and when I say pipeline, I mean, new deals. So, I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing. I talk to retailers all the time and I continue to see interest in a flight to quality, they are \u2013 so when you think about it, it\u2019s very logical, right? So, a lot of the retailers coming into 2021 maybe end of 2022, maybe they're going to make less new deals than they made before. So, the deals that they make are important from risk mitigation standpoint that they go for properties that they know and have a history of strong sales whether they're highly amenitized, whether the general essential properties, because I have both on the East Coast. They want to mitigate that risk. They want to make the right choice and where we're going to have the advantage is the history pre-COVID of a very strong sales, high quality real estate and people believe that, that high-quality real estate is not forever changed because of COVID. So I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing. Jeff Berkes : Yes, and Steve, I'd add on to that by saying it's really no different here on the West Coast, the demand is very broad-based, whether it'd be in our more traditional essential centers, including the Primestor portfolio, or Santana Row, or quite frankly, our other lifestyle mixed-use projects on the East Coast, which I've had some involvement in over the last couple of years as well. The list of tenants that Dan read off, that's from our entire lifestyle mixed-use portfolio, and all of those properties have active leasing and active negotiations going on right now. We've got two retailers under construction at Santana, third to start shortly, three restaurants under construction at the moment, we're about to sign a lease with a noteworthy operator out of San Francisco, that's doing their first restaurant outside of San Francisco. So, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. And to key a little bit off of Alex's prior question, and thank you, Alex by the way for the congratulations. We're not necessarily in a financial crisis this time around. So there seems to be plenty of capital for some of these newer concepts to get capitalized. We're seeing that very specifically in the restaurant business right now. So there doesn't seem to be a shortage of capital. And like Wendy you said, everybody wants best real estate. So whether you're kind of new and somewhat starting up or you've been around for a while and you can open fewer stores now than you could a few years ago, a lot of focus on our real estate and it is very broad based. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. Good color. Maybe second question, Don. Just in terms of \u2013 it sounds like you've got a lot of capacity on the balance sheet. Just what are you seeing in the transaction market, what's happening in terms of distress? And how are you sort of weighing that against potential developments down the road when you're mixed-use assets that you've got Phase IIIs and IVs? Don Wood : Yes, well, listen, first of all, the last part of your question first Steve. We got plenty of development to do. And so, first of all, Europe, you are years away in terms of development product coming online. Let me now take it to the acquisition side, so we learned a real good lesson in 2008, 2009, 2010. And Jeff and I were just talking about and lamenting about it last time. And that was, how is it, in the end of the great financial crisis or they are not going to be a ton of distressed assets for us to acquire? And there weren't. There weren't at all because great assets are often not distressed and not distressed in terms of price. And so it wasn't about us going down quality and earning a lot, getting a lot of stuff, which is kind of why at this point in time, we're looking for the best stuff around. There are people willing to talk to us about that, prices do seem to be firm but a little bit better than they were certainly a pre-COVID, but those prices are not cap rate prices, because what NOI are you capping as you look at it. They're really great real estate prices. And that's kind of how we're looking at potentially using some of that. I mean, the cash is on our balance sheet is insurance. The reason there's so much of it is insurance. That's why we did it that way. We believe going forward given what we just told you we need less insurance. And so accordingly, I don't have a day treasure trove of transactional information on deals that have just happened that we can really talk to you about in terms of where we're trying to go, but suffice it to say, we do believe we will find some opportunities in the markets we want to begin including our existing markets and one or two new ones that effectively let us get deals done in a way that will be accretive now and certainly accretive the value with more development opportunities associated with them going forward. Steve Sakwa : Great. Thanks. That's it for me. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Good evening. Thank you. How have development yield expectations changed for the current projects or even the entitled projects? Can we get an update on some of the key inputs like land prices, maybe construction, labor, materials and of course, importantly rents? So, do you expect a compression in yield, if 100 to 125 basis points possibly? Don Wood : Derek, we don't see it as that much. There will be some compression. And I think if you look at the 8-K that we put out. We did get more conservative on a couple of those assumptions. There's still a lot to figure out yet. And again, it depends on the product. It's certainly hard to figure out on the office side today, but it's not in construction costs. It's certainly in holding period, so your carry \u2013 you can certainly expect it to add to a longer period of time. It's most likely in build out costs, from a TI perspective, if you will, for more office space there. And then in terms of rents, man, I got to tell you, it's \u2013 it's anybody's guess to some extent, but our office and residential development, which is most of what our development is, our all-in mixed-use properties that are well established and effectively are the best product that is available coming out of COVID. So you shouldn't expect us drop in rents in any significant way because I don't think we'll need to do that. There may be some \u2013 there'll be some extra carry cost associated with it maybe a little bit more TI, but everything we still see, it says that the developments that we are completing will be accretive to value and accretive to earnings. Derek Johnston : Okay. Thank you. That's pretty helpful. Just I guess changing from office over to maybe the watch list, like how does it stand today post the pandemic, to me. I mean, it seems like a lot of companies previously on watch list have gone dark. So the question is, is the watch list pretty washed out at this point? And if so, are we \u2013 a couple of quarters away maybe third or fourth quarter of this year of trough occupancy and then of course, growing albeit from a lower base? Don Wood : Let me go first then anybody else who has got a perspective please add into this here. But I do think there is truth to the way you phrase that question, with a couple of exceptions. And the biggest exception really is, in terms of small business and when you look at small shop and small business and I could not tell you, you'll never talk to anybody more frustrated than I am, with respect to some of the restrictions that are extremely severe on our properties, it's not only restaurants, it's other users also from government entities. And so to the extent that I don't know when they'll be lifted. I don't know when \u2013 how long those businesses can last, I suspect stimulus is coming soon, but it's February, whatever it is 11 or something. And we've been talking about it for months and months and months. So on the small business side, those are the people who are being hurt the most and that's different than the big companies that are national chains. But frankly, we make our money on the small businesses that effectively turnover become successful and can pay more rent. So I do see that being a very positive catalyst as we looked out going forward. I just don't think it's right now. And that's where, maybe it's a good time for me to say what I say the silly thing that we put out there today and that is, in all my years I've never been able to say that I'm more comfortable with a forecast, with a view to the future, one year out, then I am today. But I'm which is why we're not giving 2021 guidance, which is why we're effectively talking about 2022 with more specificity. That's kind of crazy in my history of kind of doing this job, but it is the way it is today. And so we thought we'd get out there and try to get both the sell-side and the buy side to realistically start looking at least from Federal Realty's perspective as it \u2013 at our growth profile, which \u2013 so us inside to our Board of Directors looks extremely positive but certainly not in February of 2021. Don Wood : Good start, Don. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : Hi. This is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Dan, I just wanted to confirm your comment on the \u2013 not actually guidance numbers. Did you say around $1 flat for Q1 2021. It seems like a fairly significant drop versus Q4. So just wanted to get some clarity there? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. No, I think that's fair. You heard me right, roughly $1. I think that, look, the government restrictions that second wave that came on in December is impacted kind of our momentum on collections and so forth. And we expect to impact our business of our tenants in the first quarter. Don Wood : Heck, Nick, I just gave this whole big impassioned speech about 2022, and you took me back to February of 2021. Go ahead. Dan Guglielmone : But yes, so I think we will likely take a bit of a step backwards, but I think you can build off of that and get back to where we. Look, we don't have a lot of visibility and that's why we're not providing guidance on 2021. Greg McGinniss : Okay. That's fair. I'll let you be a little more impassioned about 2022 here on the next question. So rent collection right now is trending near the bottom of the peer group, which as you mentioned, it's kind of a product of portfolio geography. But as we have the vaccine gets disseminated and restrictions are lifted. Is there any reason that by the end of the year rent collection shouldn't be in line with everyone else? Don Wood : Assuming those three things that I talked about, no, but again, if you kind of go back to the conversation, right, 75% of the company's right there now, right. Go back to the comments I'm making, so understand that. Certainly, the same thing or better with respect to the residential and the office, so it leaves the retail of 25% of the company, which is the mixed-use and lifestyle stuff, that is really dependent upon stuff that is out of our control. And so as an investor, and investor is going to decide whether you believe in that real estate that growth is coming or not, dependent not on me, but depending on what he believes about vaccinations, what he believes about opening from government restrictions and what he believe about the consumer. So that's kind of where I would leave it. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Our essential-based assets basically, are at or better than our peers, 92% collection levels, only down \u2013 basically at about 92%, 93% of last year's numbers, they have performed as well in worse and more restricted markets. So we feel as though their performance is at or as good as anyone out there and it's really the lifestyle mixed use where we were felt that impact. Greg McGinniss : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Michael Bilerman : Hi. It's me. I want to come back to the guidance as much as you don't want to talk about guidance. Don Wood : Who is this? Michael Bilerman : Who is this? This is Mike Bilerman, Don Wood. Don Wood : Who says, it's me? It's \u2013 I mean, we're not on Zoom. Dan Guglielmone : Hi, Michael. Michael Bilerman : Well, he said my name. I guess, I'm having a real hard time trying to put your pieces together because you sound, Don confident and you can make assumptions for what things could be this year. You don't have that much of a complicated business, your balance sheet is in good shape. You've locked all these things the way you have confidence on the leasing front. I guess, I'd like you guys to be a little bit more specific, you have almost $11 million FFO drop that you're communicating between the quarter that just ended, and we're a month and a half into the first quarter. Can you detail if there were things in the fourth quarter that are not recurring that would cause that variance. What else is happening to drop from $1.14 to $1? And then I get it, what you're saying, Don, like you have more confidence in 2022, a lot of 2022 is the \u2013 there is where you're coming from in 2021. And you're embarking on a $5 number that's almost $40 million of NOI of FFO. What are the components of that? How much of it is NOI? How much of it\u2019s investment? How much is development? How much is the G&A? How much of it\u2019s interest expense? Give us the pieces that give you the confidence to get there? Dan Guglielmone : Michael, Michael. Michael Bilerman : Yes. Dan Guglielmone : Michael, we're not providing formal guidance, okay. We provided \u2013 typically on our November call, we provide preliminary goalposts, okay, where we don't provide any assumptions behind it. Even today, we have provided a goalpost, okay, for 2021, that's what we provided to you, we're not providing assumptions. I think in light of COVID, I think that we're comfortable providing what we are providing and the assumptions will hopefully come at some point, later this year in 2021, when we have better clarity on kind of the environment and when those things are going to happen that will allow us to have the visibility to provide the level of detail and assumptions that you're asking for. Don Wood : You know Mike, it\u2019s \u2013 let me just add \u2013 just say something to Dan, when you \u2013 what I don't want to do is go down the rabbit hole, you want me to go. And let me be very specific about that, when you go line item by line item, as you do you put a specific amount of exactness or credibility or false understanding. That's actually what's going to happen. We don't know that, Mike. When you break \u2013 you know the components of this business, you know the development that is under way that we give updates on every single call. The amount of rent that we're collecting effectively we just broke it out between 75% of the company, the essential component and the lifestyle component of the company. The notion of how we grow earnings and what we've been able to do, it's definitely a question for an investor to decide, do you believe in this business plan to be able to get there. But if I do it your way, Mike. What I'm winding up with are billions of questions on individual line by line item that suggests that they are more accurate than we are able to provide at this point. So we're not going to do that. Michael Bilerman : I respect that, Don, but at the same time, every one of your competitors is taking their best shot at numbers. And the reality if I feel like... Don Wood : That's up to them, Mike. That's up to them. Michael Bilerman : But you put out like my view is, you just \u2013 you teased people by saying we're going to get to $5 in 2022 and it's going to be a $1 in the first quarter 2021 without giving the contact of how you get there, right. I rather talk about how you're going to get there, then... Don Wood : I disagree. I think we've been giving you tons of context on it, Mike. I think we've given you tons of context, to the extent, it's not enough, then certainly by another stock or recommend another stock. It's what's been happening anyway. But when you sit and you think about the quality of this real estate and where it's going, I think our investors understand, how we're going to get there because everybody including you has a model and can certainly figure out and make assumptions in that model, in terms of how that would happen, it's not so crazy to do, take some work, but it's not so crazy to do. Michael Bilerman : We can and we know where The Street is. The Street's at $1.14 for the first quarter, you did $1.14 this quarter. And you're saying it\u2019s $1. All I'm asking is that in a narrowly focused way. Dan Guglielmone : Michael, on that, the assumptions \u2013 broad assumptions behind the $1 relative to the $1.14 in the fourth quarter, we've started collections in January are down and behind December's collections. December collections were a little bit weaker. We have $3.5 million of term fees in the fourth quarter, another strong year of term fees, we're not projecting that. Our occupancy is projected to go down in the first quarter. Like I had indicated, we expected to head into the 80s. Percentage rent is down and plus we sold a number of assets and we're sitting with significant cash on the balance sheet, relative to where we're putting those proceeds to work immediately. We're building capacity and financial capacity and flexibility when it will be dilutive in the quarter, before we deploy that cash. That is the rough roadmap from $1.14 for roughly a $1. Michael Bilerman : That's what I'd like, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Thanks for the time. I enjoyed listening to that prior exchange. Just on the acquisition front, I was curious on the target of assets you're looking at, if it's more the essential grocery anchored type of assets or more the lifestyle mixed-use type of assets and if those assets that you're looking at to acquire are more stabilized, or maybe redevelopment opportunities where you could see some value. So just curious on kind of the target of what you're looking at and maybe any sense of how you're looking to remix or reshape the portfolio as part of that discussion? Don Wood : Yes, that's a fair question. We \u2013 I hope with a little bit of luck, you see both and because to us and this is kind of the way it's \u2013 we really believe it's not about a particular format or a particular type of shopping center. It's about the growth prospects. And if we think the growth prospects are in a more stabilized asset that has rent upside because it should be remerchandised and kind of \u2013 I don't want to say federalized, but federalized effectively then we like that a lot. If it's one that's been mishandled, mismanaged and could be redeveloped and maybe there's some vertical investment there, we like that too, it depends. So the first thing we're aiming for is the right markets with the right barriers to entry with the right demographics, so that we can get comfortable and job growth, so that we can get comfortable that we've got a pretty good chance with doing what we do of creating overall higher sales from the tenants and higher rents therefore. So you will see, I hope you'll see, I mean, who knows what gets done, what can't get done. But we're looking at both opportunities for mixed-use development with some kind of stabilize piece there first and then a development down the road and a more stabilized asset where we think there is some rent growth possibilities and other ways to create value. I hope that's helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Great. First, I just want to congratulate Jeff and Jan and the others that got promotions. So congratulations. Jeff Berkes : Thanks. Craig Schmidt : I wanted to discuss \u2013 talk about occupancy and where it might trough. I'm assuming that the fourth to first quarter includes the seasonality that would usually come with a lower occupancy number. But it seems like there may be an impact from the second wave of government-mandated closings which could also weigh on the occupancy number maybe extending into the second quarter. I just wondered if you had any thoughts on that. Don Wood : Craig, it's \u2013 that's right. And first of all, the first point is exactly right. The first quarter is seasonally always the toughest for our business. But the other point, again, kind of back to the small business comment. And yes, the longer the government closures are mandated, the harder it is for those small businesses to continue because they're depleting resources day by day as it goes through here. So while I don't have an exact number, I cannot give you a line for the model with respect to how many businesses go out and what that means to the overall occupancy perspective. It is reasonable to assume that there'll be a hit. I don't think you want to put a number out there at all of what it is, but we always thought, frankly for a year now, which I think is pretty cool \u2013 we thought that our first quarter and maybe into the second quarter, we'll see, we'll be in the high 80s. Certainly on the small shop space, it will be. The anchors are hanging real tough. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then I just \u2013 what are the retailers telling you about your assets? I mean they're definitely unique. What are the ones saying to you that are kind of struggling to get by and get to the other side of COVID? And what are the new tenants saying about your properties? Don Wood : Wendy, can I hand that to you? Wendy Seher : Yes. I think that, in terms of the existing tenants that we have there in our centers, what they love about the \u2013 so two things. Let me back up. When we have restaurants, for example, that have multiple locations, what we're seeing is, because of our highly amenitized projects and our focus on not only the curbside pickup and outdoor dining and a controlled environment that we can help with, we are \u2013 they are focusing more on getting up and operating in our centers versus other choices that they may have. So from the existing tenant standpoint, we were seeing, frankly, a big uptick in the restaurant until we had that second wave of shutdowns again. So our highly amenitized projects where we can influence what's happening to help their businesses has been critical. On new tenants coming in, what we're seeing \u2013 and one of the things that I want to mention is we have ability to have like a reset button, right? So the retailers are going, hey, I have the ability to look potentially at some other opportunities that I never could get into before because, historically, we've never had the vacancy where now we have some opportunities. On the flip side, and I don't want to lose this point, is that we're \u2013 Federal Realty having the ability to reset as well and look at how we want to upgrade our real estate. So we're \u2013 when I was saying that we have a \u2013 we have a disproportionate activity on those higher-end lifestyle projects from a new deal standpoint, which shows the strength of, oh my gosh, we now have vacancy in these centers that we never had vacancy in before, and we have a host of relevant tenants that want to get in an opportunity in these centers. So it's been positive. Jeff Berkes : Yes. I'd tag onto that, Craig, by saying I think this is true coming out of the GFC as well. It's never been more important to be a good landlord, and the good tenants know that. And by that, I mean somebody that's going to invest in the property, somebody that's going to be there to pay the leasing commission and the tenant improvement, check when it's due, somebody that is going to continue to operate and invest in the asset and merchandise it the way that particular retailer needs it to be merchandised and managed to maximize their business. That's never been more important. And not having a secured loan or lender to deal with dictates some of those decisions. The savvy tenants are very aware of all that, and I think all of that plays to our strength. Craig Schmidt : Great. Thank you for that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. First of all, quick clarification, when you talked about occupancy going into the high '80s, were you talking about the 92% lease level or the 90% occupied level? Don Wood : The 90% occupied level. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then for the new restaurant deals we're talking about is a primarily sitdown full service? And I guess, where do you see the dining mix going a couple of years down the road versus where it was pre-pandemic? Don Wood : Yes. It's interesting. So we are doing, we're all over the place on the restaurant alternatives that we like to offer in any particular property. One of the things that we're really doing a bunch of is trying to reconfigure outdoor space and create more of it. We're using as part of our property improvement plans as part of the stuff that we're doing, we're using more pergola. We're using more furniture in areas and landscaping to create those places, which restaurants are asking for. And what \u2013 maybe we put you in touch, Mike, it's a long complicated answer actually, to kind of the business plans of new food uses \u2013 but put you in touch with like Stu Biel in our shop, who has got the \u2013 has got a lot of these type of properties. And so while the quick service stuff that we're still doing and we'll continue to do is pretty much as it was. But again, even there looking for outside seating wherever possible, any other common areas are specific to them. It is also the sitdown restaurants. And the sitdown restaurants that have the ability to be inside, outside. I see that not to the extent it is today, but some piece of that is that comfort with eating outside to continue. That was happening in a bigger way for us pre-COVID and like everything else was accelerated through the COVID process. So big variety, in terms of what's going on, but definitely more of a focus on outside. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Don Wood : You bet, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Lucas : Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Hey, Don. Just a simple question, Board has been committed to the dividend through this whole process looks like so they're going to continue to be \u2013 do you have a sense as to when you might be able to cover the dividend with just pure operating cash flow? Don Wood : Yes. Hopefully by the second part of 2022 we'd be there and then all of 2023. Chris Lucas : Okay. Thank you. That's all I had. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Linda Tsai : Hi. For these younger retailers seeking space what parameters do they have in terms of occupancy costs? Is it different from legacy retailers and what flexibility do you provide to help them in their path to sustainable growth? Don Wood : Well, what we're doing Linda to start is a lot of these deals have a low fixed rent and a hard percentage to effectively figure out the question, that you're asking because, while there are lower bases going in, the question of how much volume they're going to be able to do and where their price points are going to be able to be two years from now are different than what they will be in the first 12 months when they open up. So I love your question and I spend a lot of time thinking about them, talking about how those business models are going to work. And the bottom line is, there is uncertainty with it. And so in sharing that risk with them from a percentage rent basis, but to the extent they work being able to actually earn more rent than we used to earn is our objective. Whether we get there or not will depend upon the first 12 months to 18 months of the openings of our restaurant like that. Linda Tsai : That makes sense. And then, the 4Q blended leasing spread of plus 1% versus minus 1% in 3Q is an improvement, but not where you want to be. In the vein of expecting clarity next year, what sort of average blended leasing spreads are possible in 2022? Don Wood : Yes. That's a good question. I hope to be in the high-single digits at that point. And again with us always it will depend upon the mix of a big deal here versus smaller deals, etc. But \u2013 and that's where I hope to be. Also the one thing about what I did you say on the restaurant side, every deal we do, there is a landlord right to terminate after two or three years depending on sales level. So we're kind of going in this with you, but you don't have 10 years to figure it out, you know what I mean. So it's a pretty good balance, if you will, of sharing the risk. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paulina Rojas-Schmidt with Green Street. Please proceed with your questions. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: Hello. And as you think about expanding your geographic footprint, how would you describe your appetite for lifestyle centers, community centers or even power centers? I think you have mostly talked about lifestyle centers, but I wanted to have a general idea if you have at all thought of all the other property types. Don Wood : Yes. Well, what we should do and I think you're new to the retail side of Green Street is covering or no? But I'd like to spend more time with you offline to kind of go through what our business plan, because we are pretty agnostic, if you will, in terms of the retail format for everything from community-based, grocery-anchored shopping centers to more of a power center, to more of the lifestyle center and obviously the mixed-use component. So really what we're open to, is and we're real estate people first and foremost. And so looking at the format of the center is not the first thing we're looking at because we're open to all of it. The first thing we're looking at is the ability with that piece of land and that shopping environment that they have for us to be able to create value, either through raising rents or through redevelopment or even then further going vertical. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: That makes sense. And then, do you give any credit at all to the idea that the rise of work from home will facilitate Americans migration from expensive cities to more affordable cities, potentially harming the margin, cities like San Jose in California, and some of their assets? Or do you think that you will not \u2013 suffer at all from these potential trend? Don Wood : No. I very much believe in those trends, we will change the office environment dramatically in the country. I do \u2013 I think the most important thing is the product you have wherever that product is, is the best in the market. There is always going to be demand in the market that which we do business and certainly or all this, it\u2019s just better be what employers want and if you kind of look at where our office product is in terms of the mixed-use community that we are in with being fully amenitized, with being brand-new buildings, which is really important with respect to air and HVAC movement, etc. I think we're in the right places with the right product; and so office is not generic and that's what has to be viewed very carefully post-COVID. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: Okay. So you believe in the trend, but your assets will be okay? Don Wood : Yes. That's our \u2013 yes, that's our business plan because that's what we believe. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your questions. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks for taking the questions. And I'll be brief, by the way, Jeff, congrats on the promotion. It's great. Yes. Don, I know I sense a little bit of frustration on your part about these questions about guidance, et cetera and you do have a pretty big development pipeline that should produce, I'll call it $60 million of NOI over the next couple of years, have you, I mean you have done it in the past but how about putting out an NOI bridge three years, hence or something like that to get people more comfortable? Is that something that you would consider doing? Don Wood : Certainly, take it under consideration Floris. And just to respond to the frustration. The frustration is with the bullying of the line-by-line, this is what you should do, you're right. I don't take that well at all. Because we're running the company, the best way we can communicating the best way that we can and certainly, we'll take suggestions, but we won't be bullying. Floris Van Dijkum : And then maybe a follow-up, a little bit about some of the newer markets, I mean aren't you already in one of those markets that is seeing some heady growth as people go to warmer climates? I'm particularly referring to Miami, and do you see \u2013 I know you just walk away from an asset there or you sold an asset, but do you see yourself reupping in that markets over the next 12 months to 24 months? Don Wood : Very possibly, Floris. Yes. No, look, we made a bad deal with that one. But that doesn't change the fact that job growth, migration, business friendly, environment could be good for us going forward. I think you're going to love CocoWalk when you see that completed. I know you love Tower Shops which is completed. Those are going to be two of our best assets in the company. So, yes, you bet you we're open to more. Floris Van Dijkum : Great. Thanks. That's it for me, guys. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Now, I'll turn the call over to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you over the coming weeks. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Leah Brady. Leah Brady : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood; Dan G.; Jeff Berkes; Wendy Seher; Dawn Becker; and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be achieved. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. We've also provided some additional information for you in our investor presentation, which is available on our website. Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit your questions to one or two per person, and feel free to jump back in the queue if you have additional questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our first quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah. Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning. What a difference a couple of months makes. The natural positive annual sentiment of spring, fall and winter, coupled with the productive team rolled out, stimulus money and end-in-sight mentality, it's really got a long way in validating our optimism for a strong 2022 and 2023. First quarter FFO per share of $1.17 was sequentially better than the 2020 fourth quarter of $1.14, a positive surprise for us and the result of far fewer tenant failure than anticipated during the quarter and far better cash recoveries than anticipated. As a result, we're confident enough to update our 2022 earnings guidance and provide some clarity on the next three quarters of 2021. Dan will cover that in a few minutes. Pent-up consumer demand is real. We see it in virtually all of our properties in all of our markets despite government-imposed restrictions that still persist in our market. And when coupled with government stimulus cash, it's really powerful. PPP and other COVID-related programs that many of our tenants have taken advantage of has served an important role in buying time and getting both current and deferred rent paid. The $29 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund, earmarked specifically for restaurants and similar places of business, as part of the massive COVID relief build will undoubtedly also create a strong tailwind for that retail category. So with the GYMS Act that, if authorized, will allow the Small Business Administration to make COVID-related grants to privately owned fitness facilities. These programs, among others, are particularly good news for Federal's lifestyle-oriented properties, which are recovering very nicely. It's quickly become a very optimistic time in our business. Now as you would expect from me, a warning about over exuberance this year is in order as many retailers, particularly small owners, along with theaters and gyms are in a weakened state. And while buoyed by temporary stimulus, need more growth in their sales than they're currently generating to be viable long-term businesses. Having said that, they'll certainly get the opportunity to succeed because traffic is back in large numbers across the board. Perhaps the greatest indication of a bright future is the continuation of exceptionally strong leasing volumes, including first quarter deals for over 0.5 million square feet of comparable space, 35% more deals than last year's largely pre-COVID first quarter for 9% more GLA, actually 24% more GLA than the average of our first quarter production over the last five years. By any measure, we're doing a lot of leases. The fact that it was also done at 9% higher rents than the previous tenants were paying for the same space bodes extremely well for 2022 and beyond when those deals are earnings contributors. The rate and volume of new deals as opposed to renewals was particularly impressive. 54 new deals for more than 220,000 square feet at 18% more rent than the previous tenant would pay. What's particularly encouraging to me is how broad-based our leasing continues to be. In the first quarter, we did grocery and drugstore deals with Giant, Whole Foods and CVS. We did box deals with Dick's and Bed, Bath. We did fitness deals with Crunch and Planet Fitness. We did lifestyle deals with CB2, American Eagle, Madewell, Athleta, Blue Bottle Cafe Coffee and a couple of dozen restaurant specialty service-oriented retailers. Strong demand all across the board, particularly in California. In fact, let me take some time today to focus in on California because it really is a microcosm of our portfolio, particularly our nonessential lifestyle product and, in my opinion, a leading indicator into the future of the Bethesda Rows, the Pike & Roses, the Assembly Rows in our portfolio. Whether good or bad, things always seem to come first to this huge and complex market. First, the governor there has previously announced that all COVID restrictions will be removed next month. This is great news. We did 50% more new deals in California in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter, which itself was strong. As you know, we're heavily invested in and around Silicon Valley in the north and in the Greater Los Angeles area in the south and are fully committed to investing in California in the future. Tenant demand and consumer traffic are among the highest anywhere in our portfolio, and 2021 should be an all-time record for us in terms of the number of new retail leases we expect to do there. It's really hard to short great real estate in California despite the headwinds. Let me start with San Jose and Silicon Valley, which has become a beneficiary of urban and suburban migration in San Francisco to the north. Santana Row car traffic, as measured by our parking systems, rose 69% in April compared with January and is fast approaching pre-COVID levels. Residential occupancy is back up over 95% after dipping to a COVID low point of 91% in the middle of last year. And as you may have seen late last month, Santana Row was the recipient of the first large Silicon Valley COVID era office lease site as Fortune 500 cloud-led software company, NetApp, decided to relocate their headquarters to Santana Row in 700 Santana Row, the 300,000 square foot building not yet populated but previously leased to Splunk. The stated reason : to better facilitate a winning employee experience in a more connected space. In other words, state-of-the-art facilities in a fully amenitized environment that makes retaining employees and hiring great talent easier. No lost economics to us versus the Splunk deal, but two more years of term and a better diversified tenant base. And by the way, another candidate for additional office space at Santana as their Silicon Valley footprint grows. Splunk, of course, remains fully committed to Santana Row at 500 Santana Row. Now across the street at Santana West, our 375,000 square foot spec office building under construction, remains unleased -- leased and has certainly been set back in terms of timing of lease-up with the pause in overall office leasing during COVID. But we remain, and in fact, are more optimistic about its leasing prospects than we've been since COVID hit and are encouraged by the office-centric back-to-work comments made by the Silicon Valley tone setters like Google, Amazon, Apple, Netflix there. These and others are all hiring in the South Bay and are showing a heightened desire for newly constructed office space with walkable amenities and ample park. In Southern California, our Primestor portfolio, which caters to a largely Latino population in Los Angeles, remains among the top-performing group of shopping centers among all Federal centers nationwide in terms of rent collection and property operating income compared with pre-COVID levels. Big assets like Plaza El Segundo and The Point are recovering nicely and serve the beach cities of Manhattan, Formosa and Redondo Beaches, places which are even more attractive to live in than they were pre-COVID. So I guess a somewhat obvious conclusion here is that California is as big and complex an economy as any region can be, actually bigger and more complex than most countries. And as with every major market, varies greatly within the submarkets where the supply and demand characteristics of the specific real estate dictate performance. We've got some great real estate sale there. All right. A few other proactive comments before turning it over to Dan. While always a key part of our business plan, we've turned up the heat on the number and the scope of shopping center redevelopments and repositionings that are or about to be underway. A combined capital budget in excess of $75 million over 17 projects aimed at ensuring relevant best-in-class community-centric centers in a post-COVID environment. More gathering areas, more outdoor seating, more designated curbside pickup spots, better landscaping, covered walkways, you get the idea. Everything aimed at ensuring our properties are the consolidators in their given submarket. In terms of our developments, we're really looking forward to showing off the new CocoWalk when investors are back to traveling regularly. Today, tenants continue to open where the retail space is 98% and office space 82%, underleased or executed LOI. The initial market acceptance of this revitalized center at Coconut Grove has been phenomenal and should only get better over the next 12 months as more and more retailers open their doors. Heading north to Darien, Connecticut, we're very bullish about our mixed-use neighborhood that's well under construction here, especially given its perfect location for a hybrid New York City work model. For those of you who live near or are familiar with our project, you should start to be able to get a sense of what that mixed-use development is going to feel like as construction and leasing move forward as anticipated. Office leasing activity has picked up markedly this past quarter at 909 Rose -- Pike & Rose, where 75% of both POI and GLA at a 219,000 square foot office building is either under lease or executed LOI. Not only activity, but deal-making feels so much more productive than it did just a few weeks ago. In Assembly Row, PUMA is just a couple of months away from opening their new U.S. headquarters and welcoming employees back to work. And we'll begin to market our -- and separately, we'll begin to market our residential project there in earnest this month. Like the CocoWalk Pike & Rose, office leasing activity has picked up here, too, but not to the same extent. The Boston Metropolitan area is poised for recovery, but clearly lagged behind the others by what feels like several weeks or a month. Okay. From developments and redevelopments to acquisitions. We closed on our first acquisition in 2021 last week in the form of Chesterbrook Shopping Center in the affluent first ring DC suburb of McLean, Virginia. We paid $26 million in initial five cap for an 80% controlling interest in this 83% leased Safeway-anchored center and with a market repositioning plan and up under market in-place rents, we expect strong short-term growth and significant value add. We're also under contract and in our due diligence period for several other acquisitions that, absent negative surprises, will close later in the year. I'm not ready to talk further about them at this point, but more to come here over the next few months. Okay. That's about all I have for my prepared remarks today. Let me turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and good morning -- good afternoon, everyone. Good evening. To echo Don's initial comments, we have been the beneficiary of the broad-based recovery that the entire open-air retail real estate industry has experienced in the first quarter. We significantly outperformed the quarter, reporting FFO per share of $1.17, up 3% sequentially from 4Q and well ahead of our internal expectations. We went from the dark days of December and January, where government-mandated shutdowns in our markets impacted over 90% of Federal's assets and we experienced weaker consumer traffic and collections than prior months, to 90 days later, where, after another round of PPP supporting our tenants, successful vaccine rollout and a reopening of our markets, all make things seem somewhat sustainable. Given this increased stability, we were able to beat our internal forecast by higher revenues and POI, broadly from higher collections than forecast both in the current period and from prior periods as well; less fallout from small shop tenants than expected; higher term fees and percentage rent and forecast, offset by higher property level expenses, primarily due to snow. Positive trend in COVID-19 collectability reserves continues as we had just $14.8 million in the quarter, down 20% sequentially versus 4Q. We expect that progress to continue over the course of the year. $10 million of that amount is driven by our strategic decision to be more accommodative with our tenants. More on that in a moment. We continue to improve on collections, achieving 90% for the quarter, steady progress despite weakness in January due to the aforementioned shutdowns. Our strategic decision to be more accommodative to our tenants differentiates us from many of our peers. In our disclosure, you'll see negotiated abatements in the form of temporary percentage rent and other arrangements, totaling $10 million or about 5% of billed rent for the quarter. That accounts for roughly 50% of our uncollected rent. Those agreements are scheduled to burn off over the balance of the year and into 2022. Combined collections, deferrals and abatements totaled 96%, leaving about 4% of our billed monthly rents unresolved relative to the steady-state pre-COVID 1% to 2% low. Another area where we outperformed our forecast is occupancy. Our tenants have demonstrated surprising resiliency for a combination of better-than-expected renewal activity and fewer tenant failures. Our leased occupancy metric stands at 91.8% at quarter end, and our occupied metric dipped below 90% to 89.5%, both stronger levels than we predicted to start the year. Our leased-to-occupied spread has increased 230 basis points and represents roughly $20 million of PR upside in the future. But given the strong pace of leasing activity, my gut tells me that spread should grow in the coming quarters. While we still expect continued pressure on our occupancy over the next quarter or 2, we do not expect the trough to be as deep as previously feared as continued leasing activity and volumes we have achieved over the last three quarters, plus our strong forward leasing pipeline should set us up for a more pronounced growth in '22. Now to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of total available capital comprised of $780 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion revolver. We amended our term loan in April, pushing the maturity out to 2024 with the option to extend through 2026. We reduced the spread from 135 to 80 basis points over LIBOR and paid down the loan balance to leave $300 million outstanding. We completed the sale for $20 million of our Grand Park Plaza land parcel to a regionally based townhome developer. Please note that we do have a participation interest here, which could provide some additional upside given the strength in the suburban DC housing market. We have further solidified our well-laddered maturity schedule with only $125 million of debt maturing between now and mid-2023, all which is secured and is earmarked for repayment from cash on hand. This will increase our unencumbered pool to 92% of EBITDA. And lastly, as we have done programmatically every year since 2011, we sold common equity through our ATM program, $124 million at a blended share price of $105 in start of the year. Our remaining to spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline stands at just over $360 million. As we have throughout the past year, we sit with significant dry powder. Now on to guidance for '21 and '22. Now please keep in mind before I start that there is still a high degree of uncertainty in our forecast given the continued impact of the pandemic on our business. But with that being said, we are providing 2021 guidance in a range of $4.54 to $4.70 per share. Despite a strong first quarter, some of that outperformance is not expected to be recurring. Let me be a bit more helpful. Think of 2Q roughly flat to 1Q at $1.15 to $1.20 per share. Now the second half of the year will be negatively impacted primarily from the delivery of our large residential project at Assembly Row due to the negative POI during lease-up as well as reduced capitalized interest. As a result, figure the third quarter at roughly $1.10 to $1.15, and the fourth quarter back towards the first half's run rate of $1.15 to $1.20, which gets you to the midpoint of our range at $4.62 per share, a $0.10 increase from the 2021 guidepost we provided on last quarter's call. Assumptions behind this guidance. Comparable growth of roughly 2% as we expect some choppiness over the next quarter or 2, and we do not expect to have term fees in 2021 at the same levels of 2020 or 2019, which were both north of $14 million. Please note that comparable growth as a metric continues to have limited utility in this environment. Collectability metrics should improve over the course of the year, but will not return to pre-COVID levels until sometime in '22. As discussed, we expect lower occupancy levels in the next quarter or two before stabilizing later in the year, but remain optimistic that it will not be as bad as previously viewed. Targeting a trough at 88% range for occupied percentage with a leased percentage remaining above 90%. G&A will average roughly $11 million to $12 million in the quarter. On the capital side, we project spend on development and redevelopment of roughly $350 million to $400 million. The contributions from our large development projects will be modestly negative in 2021 as POI from CocoWalk's lease-up will be more than offset by bringing online the Phase IIIs for both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, including the aforementioned resi building, which, as I mentioned, are initially dilutive during lease-up. We project another $150 million of opportunistic equity issuance on our ATM over the course of the year, and as our custom, this guidance assumes no acquisitions or dispositions over the balance of '21. We will adjust those as we go. However, our recently acquired Chesterbrook shopping center, demographically strong McLean, Virginia is included in these numbers. For 2022, we are providing a range of $5.05 to $5.25, which represents close to double-digit FFO growth in 2022. This is being driven by lower COVID-19 collection challenges as deferrals are repaid and abatement agreements earn off, the expectation of growing occupancy levels back into the low 90s and stronger contributions from our development pipeline as leasing activity more meaningfully translates to POI. More detail on 2022 as we get further into the year. And with that, operator, Please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with Sameer Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Sameer Khanal : Hey, good afternoon everyone. Don, can you provide some color on the guidance for the year? Mainly, what are you assuming to get to the low end here the 450? Don Wood : Well, I think there's a fair amount of uncertainty still as we're, I think, relying upon, I think, better performance for PPP money and so forth. Let's wait and see how well our tenants do when -- later in the year to see how well they perform without PPP money and so forth. I think that the expectations that, that cash collects generally kind of are consistent with where we are. We have more weakness or weakness in occupancy where we're probably at the lower end of the range, closer to the 88% is a driver there. And then it's also how does continued lease-up perform over the course of the year. Sameer Khanal : Okay. Got it. And then I guess, Don, for my second question is on transaction. I mean, how do you think about your acquisition strategy today sort of on the other side of COVID? I mean do you find yourself targeting kind of non-gateway markets given the migration trends we've been seeing? Or it's sort of the same as what you've done, kind of are you targeting sort of close to markets at this point? Don Wood : Yes. No, Samir, it's a great question. It's -- there's a number of things that have become really clear [indiscernible] COVID, from my perspective. And that is the migration that is so talked about is largely from the city to the first ring suburbs. And so when I sit, I see what is happening in the places that we're at, I know that we're going to continue to invest in those places for all the reasons that we felt good about them for all those years. So the first thing is, you should feel -- you should understand that Federal is very committed to the markets that we're in for future acquisitions. The second is -- it's an interesting concept. I've talked in the past about Arizona. I've talked in the past about south and west acquisitions. But you know what that's mostly about is the reality that for stuff that we want, and that will not change, it is the high-quality stuff that has for leasing and redevelopment potential. We need a few more ponds to fish in, if you will, because we all are in just seven or eight markets. And it is pretty clear that markets like Phoenix and Scottsdale, markets potentially like Dallas, maybe Atlanta, we'll see, certainly, South Florida have the similar characteristics to those markets that have worked real well for us. So the stuff that we've got tied up that I can't give you too much on, I can tell you one of those assets are in the existing markets that we're in, one of those markets is a new one in terms of the Southwest, as you might imagine. So I hope we get both of them over the transom there. But really what that's about is when you invested in Federal, You invest in Federal to look for those markets with high barriers to entry, lots of jobs, great education that includes the ones we're in. And yes, it includes a few new ones, potentially over the next several years. So try and think about it that way. Sameer Khanal : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is with Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Okay, it's no secret that you have the highest ABR among your property type of peers. Would rent slowing a bit lower actually be that bad of a thing given the significant spread of peers and, of course, acknowledging the quality? So I guess the question is, how do you look at balancing occupancy and rent growth in this emerging post-COVID environment? Don Wood : Well, it's a great question, Derek. And as you think about it, the conversations about rents has to be talked about in the same conversation as productivity. When you think about what the occupancy cost is for a particular retailer, that retailer is looking to make money and create value. And that's going to be very dependent upon what it is that they do in top line, either on-site or in their total business as well as the cost structure throughout the whole business. So I know what I just said is obvious, but it feels like we sometimes so focused on the absolute rent number, we don't focus on the business that effectively is there that is creating value for that particular company, owners and shareholders. So from a rent perspective, I can tell you, I feel pretty darn good that we will actually have enhanced demand. We have seen enhanced demand at our properties. Now that doesn't mean you won't make accommodations, if you will, during COVID. We certainly will and have demonstrated that we'll do that probably to a greater extent than others are willing to do that. But that's only because we have great faith in our properties going forward. So we're always going to try to get the best economic deal that we can that works for that particular tenant. The key is to find the right tenants, to find those tenants that are those that can do the volumes and those that cannot just pay the highest rents, that can do the volumes to create the synergies within a shopping center that make the whole effectively impacted by each of the parks. So that's not a -- I don't know how to answer your question in terms of is it so bad if rents rolled out. I don't think about it that way. We think about it as from a shopping center perspective, how do we make the overall total sales of that shopping center go up. And -- because if that happens, whether, again, it's online or a combination of online or in-store, if that happens, rent is a byproduct of that. It's not the leading indicator. So when you go for a lead indicator, it feels to me like you're competing in a business based on being the cheapest guy. That's not a business I want to have anything to do with running. That's no fun. I've got to be able to be the guy that you want to come to because you can make the most money. And if all you're looking at is cheap rents to be able to do that, I think it's pretty myopic. Derek Johnston : Thanks, Don. Very helpful. Hey, I'll pass the baton. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good evening. So two questions. First, Don, there've been a number of stories, articles, etc., on labor shortages caused by basically people who would, I guess, back restaurants are paid more to sit at home with the extended unemployment than actually taking jobs. Across your portfolio, are any of your sort of lifestyle tenants, your experience with tenants who would -- are heavy on the labor front as part of their offering. Are any of those tenants expressing to you an issue with the ability to hire labor or, across your tenants, they're not having -- they're not seeing that impact? Don Wood : Oh, no. Well, first of all, there's two questions there, Alex. First, are they expressing it to us? No, not particularly, but I don't know why they would. And that's not the same question. Are they experiencing problems in getting labor? And the answer to that is obviously yes. But I don't need to know that as a landlord because it's not particularly germane to me as a landlord in the short period during COVID. But it's absolutely impacting. I bet you, most people who have either been to a restaurants, not even restaurants, to a store, and kind of seen the understaffing that persists right now and the quality of the labor force, it's a problem. I would not candy coat that one bit. Now it's good to be the landlord effectively because we're talking about commitments for the long term, and I do not expect this to be a persistent in terms of being able to find it. But right now, with unemployment where it is, with the state of mind that kind of -- the country has been in during this, I absolutely believe that there are numerous businesses, not just restaurants that are struggling to find qualified help. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is, you laid out guidance for this year and guidance next year. So I don't think we are expecting the 2022. But Don, knowing you over the years, you don't lay out anything unless you're absolutely certain that you could achieve it, which then suggests that your real 2022 number is above the 525 that you laid out at the top end. So just help us walk through why we shouldn't believe the real number is better than the range that you laid out. Don Wood : Well, I guess the basic reason is your logic is flawed. I mean, number one, I'm certainly not laying something out because whatever your words where they are absolutely positive, I seriously do. I mean, here's where we are. We've got lots of accommodative deals that we'll be burning off. We know that when they burn off, they will return to rent. Now hopefully, those tenants will be able to pay that full rent and continue to do that. We know that certainly, we've got development projects that are being delivered. Of course, when you deliver a big residential building there's dilution associated with it. I mean we all know that. That's how it works on your way to creating a bunch of value there. We know that the volume of leasing that we've already done and rolling into what income stream that's going to produce is pretty predictable. And so kind of like I said on the last call, Alex, '22 for us is, in many respects, more predictable than it is in '21 for any particular period. And I think that's still hangs out there. Now to the -- again, here comes the bridge from those comments to -- and therefore, we need to flow through the numbers of 2022 that we've laid out, I don't know how to get there. I mean, there is -- we tried to put out a range there as best we see it today based on those things going away, the accommodations going away, the developments coming on, their impact, positive or negative, associated with it and the leasing that is being done, those three primary things. And we get comfortable that for that period of time, we should be in that range. Lots of things can go wrong from there, and a few things could go right. So you're right. I mean, let me tell you, we're going to do all we can to blow through those numbers. But please don't take that as a de facto given that, that can happen because I don't have that much of a crystal ball. And I don't know if that's helpful or not, but just the way you characterized it didn't suggest the way I feel. Alexander Goldfarb : Well, no. I mean, it's a positive for you, right? You guys had in pre-COVID had tended [ph] raise, and that was the hallmark for you guys. And it's based over time of your track record, which is kudos to you, right? Don Wood : Look, I appreciate that. And you can bet that that's what we will try to do all the way through. But it is -- I just didn't want you to take it as far as it did with respect to the undoubtedly, this is what's going to happen because you'd be a whole lot better than I am or any of us are if you'd be able to be that precise. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you. Don Wood : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Katy McConnell from Citi. Please proceed with the question. Katy McConnell : Great, thank you. Well, first of all, we really appreciate the added disclosure on both 2021 and 2022 guidance. So just digging into the drivers a little more, can you provide some goalposts around how much development completion and lease up is contributing to the range each year? And I assume you got one of the main drivers of the wider range in 2022, in particular. Don Wood : We focused on 2022 or 2021? 2021, the contributions to -- from development are going to be actually negative as we at Highland. It's actually going to be -- what we're focused on is on '22, we've got primary drivers being the two big buildings at Assembly. They will begin to contribute in 2022, but will not fully contribute until 2023. Cocowalk should begin to stabilize in 2022. And we did a fully -- a full run rate at some point over the course of the year, as should, at some point, the building here at Pike & Rose. I think that there should be probably contribution in and around, an additional 10 million of additional incremental relative to '21 contribution over the course of the year. But Katy, your question is dead right. The -- if you think about us delivering -- Assembly is an easy one to understand, right? We're going to deliver this year a big residential building. The pace of lease-up, how you get through 500 units is going to determine, in some respects, how quickly the dilution burns off when you start being accretive, what kind of rents we're getting, etcetera. And there's a lot of question around how that's going to work. I don't know that we're going to be doing 20 to 30 units, say, a month or we're going to be able to do 40 or 45 units a month and at what rent. So if you kind of roll that through a model, you've got a -- just from that big project, you've certainly got range. But our range for 2022 is way beyond that. It really has to include some basic assumptions on lease-up of the portfolio. As you know, as Dan said, we'll be at 88% or 89% later this year. We've got to get that back up to 92% or 93%. The pace by which that happens is going to very much determine that. But I do feel great, frankly, about the -- not only the direction that we're headed but because of the volume that we're doing and the rate of the progress we're making on the development that while we can't be precise with respect to exactly how that income stream is going to come on, we certainly know what the direction of it is. And within a range that I actually think is pretty tight, given the fact that we're nine to 20 -- 18 months out, I think it's pretty tight. And so all of those things considering, I think we got a pretty good -- can give you more visibility than we've been able to give you since the beginning of the pandemic. Michael Bilerman : Don, it's Michael Bilerman. I too wanted to thank you for giving us a lot of the details on the guidance and the actual numbers. Is it -- you can jump down my throat if I ask you to put that in the supplemental each quarter? Don Wood : Michael, that's a bait and switch. You had Katy start and ask a question. And then you jumped right in there. If I knew that, we would have put you at the end of the line for Pete's sake. Michael Bilerman : Oh, geez. I thought we were friends. Don Wood : I'm just kidding, for Pete's sake. No, you can certainly ask that. And that is certainly something that Dan G and Melissa Solis and the financial side of this company will certainly come to a conclusion with the help of our general counsel as to what should go in there. So I don't have anything to say with respect to that today, Michael. Michael Bilerman : Well, it would be great. That way, there's no confusion over the numbers. These conference calls could take 10, could quickly be heard of as a 15 or something. But my question was, you talked on the call earlier, and you focused on California. You spent a lot of time talking about Santana Row and Prime store. Was the focus more so on what you have today? Or do you want to highlight California as an area of the country that you wanted to deploy incremental capital outside of Santana Row and Prime store? I just wanted to know sort of the background to it. Don Wood : No, that's very fair. And the answer is -- the short answer is both. And so I hope we are making incrementally new investments in California. But you know why we brought that up, and I spent so much time on that? So Berkes and I have been going back and forth on -- I'll send out an article to him that I read. He'll say it's only telling half the story and yell at me. We would -- we sit there and debate how important California is as a market today and where it's going to be tomorrow. What are we really seeing with respect to leasing demand? Is that changing? Is the state -- is everybody moving to Texas? How is this all really playing out. And we really came down to this very good understanding that the headlines are far more exaggerated than effectively the supply and demand characteristics of the markets that we're in that we can certainly talk about with knowledge because we're out there doing those leases. And as a result, the ability to find other places where we would like to continue to invest. We do have another one that we're looking at really, really closely in Southern California that I hope we can get over to pull over the transom because I think the long-term opportunity is amazing. So I wanted to go through that really as a headline buster, if you will. And I do think it's a great microcosm of -- and a predictor of what you will see as the Massachusetts economy opens back up. It is interesting, if you look at weather. So as you head north, you can say, okay, Pike & Rose is behind Florida, but ahead of Boston. Austin is behind Pike & Rose, and we can see where it's going relative to California. The warmer it gets, the nicer the weather, by far, seems to be the biggest predictor of traffic levels and sales. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thanks for the color, Don. Don Wood : Thank you, Michael, and we are friends. Michael Bilerman : I know. Take care. Operator : Our next question is with Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good evening. First, Don, on development, maybe residential more specifically. I understand there's some uncertainties on the speed of residential lease-up at Assembly Row. Just curious what the expected stabilized yield is there. And then also, how do you feel about starting additional residential development at this time? And when might you break ground on future development phases? Don Wood : So Greg, that's fair. The stabilized yield, I don't feel differently about. It might take another year to get there? Sure. I mean, the greatest -- the best part of residential, and I'm sure you hear it on every residential call, is the same thing as the worst part of residential for 1-year leases. A little bit less, a little bit more. So it's not like you build something in a great market, but at the long time and you're stuck in purgatory forever, as happens on the retail side and certainly happens in the office side. And so I know today, it is, as we've talked about as you've indicated here, it is our toughest market from a residential perspective, to be able to make progress. And that is where we're opening up a new project. So there is less predictability in terms of that timing and where we go. I do believe we'll be where we said we'd be as upon stabilization, even if that stabilization is later than obviously, than it would have been pre-COVID. We'll have to see, we'll have to play that out. In terms of investing in residential in other places. Sure, we will. I still feel -- I feel very good about that at our mixed-use properties. Again, not stand-alone, but where they are at our mixed-use properties. The real question there is what are we going to do -- are we going to be able to make the number of work with construction prices, which are absolutely, at this point in time, out of control. And whether that is a long-term phenomenon or a short-term phenomenon is to be seen. Clearly, supply chain of materials has been completely disrupted in the last year globally, and that impacts prices. So we have to see where that will go. But at Bala Cynwyd, for example, in our shopping center there outside of Philadelphia and Lower Merion Township, we're leasing up our small project, and we really want to do a small project there as a precursor to see what kind of demand we would have for a larger project that would include residential on the Lord & Taylor site that is there. One of the best pieces of the land in all -- in the whole Federal portfolio. And I am extremely bullish on what has the initial demand on -- even during COVID of the small project that we did there. And on the township and the design process of what we're building. So it comes at -- we're an economic company. It comes down to can we make money? And can we add value to the extent we can with residential in our existing properties, we will still do that. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And one for Dan here. On the accommodative tenant agreements that you were talking about, Just curious what the total magnitude and cadence of those agreements are going to be as they burn off, I guess, later this year and into '22? And what types of tenants were those provided to? Don Wood : Primarily, we've talked about this on calls before. I mean, we've made accommodative with a fair amount of restaurants operating during COVID, tying kind of doing a greater of fixed rent that's less than their contractual rent for a temporary period of time or a percentage of sales. But we'll see how well they burn off in particular because it depends on how -- whether or not we get the upside of the percentage rent. And then it should burn off over time ratably. It's not -- those accommodative agreements are not all $10 million of abatements that we had during the quarter. But that should burn off ratably probably over the next, I would say, 12 to 18 months. Greg McGinniss : Okay. So these are not new agreements. It's just continuation of ones that were already in place? Dan Guglielmone : Yes, correct. Greg McGinniss : Okay, thank you. Thanks for the time. Operator : Our next question is with Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time. I just hoping to -- if you could give us a little color on the leased versus occupancy spread. You kind of talked about a $20 million number. And how much of that is truly additive versus kind of musical chairs in between tenants or space? And how you think the timing of that in terms of coming online? Don Wood : That's primarily -- is additive. Not a lot of musical chairs, not a lot of moving around the tenants; it's additive [ph]. Juan Sanabria : Could you say that one more time? Sorry. Don Wood : Juan, I was just -- you'll see that starting in the second half of '21 and '22 in terms of the timing. Juan Sanabria : Great, thank you. And then on the leasing side, you had a huge number on the leasing spread for new deals, 18%. Anything unusual in the numbers in the quarter that kind of skewed that? Or Is that kind of how you're thinking about future volumes for the balance of the year maybe? Don Wood : No, I don't know how it will come out from the rest of the year, but I can tell you, there's always a few deals in there that are especially good, including a couple that we had this time up at Assembly Row. But I think that's kind of what you see with us. There's always a couple of good ones in there. And just -- and there might be a -- there's a quarter where we got a couple of bad ones in there. But overall, I kind of like the trajectory that you see. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Yeah, thank you. I wanted to talk -- I mean, the increase in the leasing volume, I know you talked a lot of new lease, but are they more essential? Are they more discretionary? And are you seeing new names to your portfolio? Or are these people that have properties and are looking to expand in your portfolio? Don Wood : Yes. Let me start on that. I'd love either Jeff or Wendy to add on to my point, but -- to my comments. But a couple of things, Craig. The thing that keeps striking me throughout this process is how broad-based the leasing has been. I've been looking for places to say, okay, here's a category that is very active right now. And this other category is not doing deals. I'm not seeing that. I'm seeing this broad-based. Now what I know is the number of deals that you're seeing at some of like the essential -- sorry, the nonessential, the lifestyle type projects are particularly good. And I think that's a factor or a notion of, there's a -- I believe there is a groundswell that is becoming more and more accepted that these first-tier suburbs with places that are -- that can be more than just your shopping center that are effectively an integral part of your life are a place to be. So what we're really trying to do and seen some really good success there is for getting new leases from tenants that have been not -- are new to market and we've seen that in a large way at Santana, I know Jeff can talk more about that. We've seen that in a huge way on the Pike & Rose, Village at Sherlington, First Row suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. for new food concepts. Certainly, for some gym concepts that have been newly capitalized along the way and even apparel. So this is about as broad as it's been. We certainly have grocery deals in there, a CVS deal in there along the way. But it's -- I'm most excited to tell you the truth, not about the boxes. The boxes are fine, and they've got a lot of leverage and they're the national companies that will pay the rent and isn't that exciting? It's really exciting when you're killed by COVID, not particularly exciting going forward. And there's not a lot of growth in it. It is kind of what it is. I'm excited by the small shop potentials at consolidating places that are either mixed use or dominant in the dominant shopping centers in their markets because that's where I think there'll be value to add significantly over the next few years. Jeff or Wendy? Craig always asks the best questions. Wendy Seher : I know. And Craig, I appreciate the question because truth be told, with the amount of activity that we've had this quarter and what's bubbling up, I was a little eager to jump in, in terms of leasing. So I appreciate it. Very true, broad-based is what certainly we're seeing all over the East not just at lifestyle centers, certainly, but our community centers, our neighborhood centers, our power centers. As Don said, we maintain a strong, steady and healthy level of anchor activity, which has been very good and supportive and kind of continuous. The spike had been on the smaller shops, all the way from the mom-and-pops from Taco Bambas which is a coveted taco player in Northern Virginia that just signed a deal with us in Congressional in Rockville, to Athleta, to Room & Board, to American Eagle to Gregory's Coffee who's joining us in Long Island. So new names. In addition, where we had strong tenants like a Starbucks, we're doing several deals with them where they're taking their focus on these first-ring suburbs and they're investing and we're investing in creating some opportunities for them that would also maintain and provide a drive-through. So that's kind of what we've done for the quarter. In conjunction with that, what I'm also pretty excited about is what I see in the pipeline. And that is, again, broad-based all the way across our property formats and robust. So not just in renewals, but in net new deals. So I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing lately. Jeff Berkes : Yes. And Craig, really same on the West Coast, whether it's up at Santana within the prime store portfolio or some of our other Southern California properties, both on the new deal and renewal side. And then both in, let's call it, the more traditional neighborhood and community center-type small shop like Wendy's talking about or the more, let's call it, lifestyle-oriented tenant like we'll see it at The Point where we did an every deal or up at Santana where we've done a number of new market clothing retailer deals, which we've mentioned on prior calls. And restaurants. We have a restaurant under construction, first unit out of San Francisco. We have another restaurant under construction that's new to market. Notable chef, it's the fourth restaurant that he's opening. First one in California. So really encouraged not only by what we've accomplished so far in, let's call it, the last three quarters or so coming -- as we started to come out of COVID. But if you look at the pipeline of deals that are being negotiated right now, that's very strong. I couldn't be happier about that. Craig Schmidt : Great. Thanks for the detail in that. And then I guess just one other thing. The big difference for me between fourth quarter and first quarter has been the change on the impact from government restrictions. I think January was described earlier in the call, the dark day. And then we look at your ADR, open at 98% in April 30th. How much of February and March were closer to that April performance versus the January performance? Don Wood : That's a great question. And overall, I -- it's a pretty straight line. And again, I kind of think the straight line that took you from January to April, it's heavily weather-dependent, too. I mean, look, the issue is if you say, what do I worry about? I mean, the government stimulus has clearly been helpful. There will be more to come. That's clearly helpful. But for businesses to be long term viable, those government restrictions have to go away and those businesses have to see if they can survive long term. That, to me, is still a question mark, right? You can't have a business that's 25% open, paying rent because the stimulus is allowing them to pay rent. But the stimulus goes away, you've got -- you can't make any money at 25% or 50%. So it's really -- that's what is yet to be seen. The encouraging side of that drag, and it's happened all the way through. It's the traffic that has come out has been impressive. And so these people have the opportunity to buy and to eat and to spend, I believe they will. At least those retailers will not have much of an excuse if those folks are there and the government restrictions were gone to be able to make money in their businesses. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And just one quick one. Just given the acceleration of the business, when might Federal be able to cover their dividend with operating cash flow? Don Wood : You should expect 2022. I'm not sure which quarter yet in 2022, the third or the fourth quarter. But later in 2022 is where we hope to be there. Craig Schmidt : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Okay, thank you. Good evening out there. So first, a little bit of a follow-up on question on leasing. The blended rents in the quarter were up 9%. I'm curious how that compares to your mixed use versus more anchors. And also what is your sense of how that plays out, that dynamic, that spread perhaps, given the demand and pricing trend you're seeing in the mixed-use and gross rented portfolios? Thanks. Don Wood : Haendel, you may have to do the second part first. So in the first part of your question, We did better in the mixed-use properties in terms of the new deals moving forward than we did in the more basic shopping centers, the essential stuff. And that's kind of in line with what I was talking about a few minutes ago. But the second part of your question, I just didn't get. I don't think Dan did either. Haendel St. Juste: Sure. No, I was getting at sort of what you were seeing within those two segments today, comparatively to the 9% overall for the portfolio. Then what's your sense of how that plays out over the near term, given the demand and pricing trends you're seeing at in each piece of the portfolio. Don Wood : I do have a point of view on that. The -- when you say near term, I'm not sure if we're talking about the next three quarters or so because the answer from my perspective then is I don't know. You'll see -- it will depend, as I said earlier on the call, to the deals that got -- the particular deals that got done in a particular quarter as it kind of always does. But longer term, I would expect to see better growth from the 25% nonessential part of the company than I would the 75%. But the 75% is critical to not only the stability of the company, but some level of growth so that the remaining 25 kind of takes that and builds on. That's how we look at it and see it over the next, let's say, three years. I don't know, Jeff or Wendy, if you want to add anything to that. Jeff Berkes : No, I think you've got it, Don. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. A question then maybe for you, Dan. Can you talk about the restaurant and movie theater rents, how they trended in April and what that implies for your full year '21 guide? And then maybe also remind us what percent of the outstanding reserves are tied to those two industries. Thanks. Dan Guglielmone : I didn't quite get your question, Haendel. You're a little low. Haendel St. Juste: I asked if you could talk about restaurant and movie theater trends, how they trended in April and what that implies for the full year '21 guide. And then also, if you could remind us what percent of the outstanding reserves are tied to those two industries. Dan Guglielmone : I would say our reserves, probably about 40% of the reserves. I'm just getting -- it is a specific number. I don't have it in my pink slips. Don Wood : You may want to do that offline. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. We need to take this offline. I'm happy to answer it following the phone call, Haendel. That's a detail we didn't prepare for. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Maybe I can substitute a different second question. I don't know if I missed it, but did you guys disclose the cap rate on the gross percent you acquired in Virginia and maybe some thoughts on the long-term opportunity and returns there? Don Wood : Five going in. You should expect that to be at least a six and three quarters and maybe a 7% within just a few years. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Is that from occupancy or occupancy plus rents? Don Wood : Yes and yes. Primarily rent. To the extent we get to remerchandise the shopping center, which we very much expect to do just to be able to provide McLean, Virginia with the kind of product that we'd like it to, it should be a great addition. You've been in a Wildwood in Bethesda, right? McLean needs one. Haendel St. Juste: Yeah. Got it, all right. That was all for me, thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yeah, hi. Few of them here. First, Dan, I think you talked about prior period rent collections that were in the number of benefit this quarter. Can you throw out what that number was? And then also, I know you don't put acquisitions in guidance for '21 or '22, but can you help us think about the cash on hand? You're raising incremental equity. You talked about $350 million to $400 million development spend this year. How significant could acquisitions be? And to the extent they're not, I mean, what development spend looks like in 2022 just thinking about burning through the cash? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Sure, I'll do the two questions together. I'll take the first one quickly. We had about $8 million of prior period rent. We had projected some prior period rents to be paid. That was a bit more than we expected. We've had prior period rents in the second quarter and the third quarter. The third quarter and fourth quarter of last year and so forth, it's hard to predict kind of what that level will be on a go-forward basis this year. So that's a little bit also some of the variability what we're expecting, not much prior period rent we had to do collecting. And on the second piece with regards to the cash. Look, we're trying to keep a -- we've got spend that we're expecting this year. We've got some opportunities from an acquisition perspective in the quarter. We had $800 million and an undrawn line of credit. I mean, we have plenty of dry powder. And I think we really can be pretty tactical with regards to how we deploy that capital. And we've got -- that's not a concern for us at the moment in terms of how we pay for the opportunities that we'll see over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Don Wood : Like we got about $170 million left after this year on the existing developments that are underway now. And I think that -- I don't know it's about $250 million or so left for this year on our existing, maybe $300 million. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Don Wood : So if you think about $450 million or some kind of number like that to finish up the existing developments that we have, again, the $800 million on the -- of cash on the balance sheet. And so the acquisitions that we're looking at, I don't -- I'm not ducking this. I simply don't really want to give you a size of that right now because I don't want to -- I don't want people to know what assets we're looking at right now. So the -- effectively in two different markets, nothing crazy big. So don't think that certainly enough that the -- plenty that the cash could handle. So let me leave it there, if I can, so I don't get in trouble with Dan for purpose. Mike Mueller : Got it. Yeah, no. That's good. That's helpful. Thanks. Don Wood : Yup. Operator : Our next question is with Ki Bin Kim. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. You already discussed some of the tenant demand you're seeing in the house broad-based. But I'm just curious, like high level, are you getting the types of tenants that you want, the credit quality that you want? And how high on the pedestal is merchandising mix in an environment like this when you have inventory to sell? Don Wood : Ki Bin, it's -- I mean, that is the secret sauce of a business, right, our business, how we balance occupancy with merchandising mix with the credit of that particular tenant. So the way we look at it, first of all, gosh, you're never going to convince me that merchandising is not among the most important things to do in a retail environment. We all know that even after the pandemic, there's too much -- there' too many choices for places to shop out there. We've got to be the one of choice if we're going to have any possibility of pushing rents, which we want to do. And so what we're -- so just like the $75 million that we're spending on redevelopment projects, which are all about much more than new rooms and parking lots. These are about places to hang so that you can be there in the morning, at night or long-term periods or short-term periods to use this as part of your life. If you do that, then we -- the biggest part of that is getting the right tenants that let you have that type of lifestyle. What we've seen is great demand from a very wide variety of tenants like that. I think Jeff Berkes has talked about them. Now when you're talking about restaurants, is the credit great in a restaurant? No. Is the fact that 110,000 restaurants in the country went away during COVID a positive? Yes. Because supply/demand is reaching a much better balance in that very important category for the type of assets that we have. And I -- frankly, we're doubling down on restaurants. I love it. I love the idea of being the consolidator to have a place where those key gathering places have those choices. And when you go out and spend your time, I think you would agree. You may worry about who's going to fill a P.O. box if that business doesn't work three years from now, five years from now. But I think we've proven -- I think the country has proven that restaurants, outdoor dining is here to stay and effectively making -- we've got the places for that particular group. We also have the places, and we've been seeing it in terms of those digitally native brands that want only a few places to make sure that their brand is appropriately reflected. We've gotten more than our fair share of that, certainly at the Road property. So I think it's -- going back to where we started, there's a lot of -- it's not that there's a lot of choice, if you will, for any particular tenant. It is that the best tenants do seem to be coming, and we get a shot at them. And if we get a shot at them, we got a shot at creating the best place. And that's how we can push rents and create value. So from my perspective, very encouraged by what we've seen over the last nine months, frankly, in terms of our places and demand at our places. Jeff Berkes : Ki Bin, it's Jeff. And just to kind of add on to what Don is saying. One thing, and we've discussed this on past calls I think. One thing that's different about this crisis than 2009-2010 and even if you dial back to the tech bubble bursting in Silicon Valley, right, when we're delivering first phase of Santana Row is there is a ridiculous amount of capital on the sidelines. And whether it's money to fund new restaurants or new restaurant concepts, it certainly wasn't around when we delivered Santana Row back in the day, which is why we had to invest in those restaurants ourselves. We're seeing this time just completely different availability of capital for new business and new business formation, particularly in the restaurant category. We're also seeing it in the fitness, and I would call it the healthcare and wellness segment, where we've seen a few new concepts come that are very well backed, very well financially backed. And a couple of fitness operators that didn't have legacy issues for whatever reason, that have invested a ridiculous amount of equity, capital in the fitness sector. And really a lot different from that perspective than prior downturns. So we're not relaxing our credit quality standards at all. And quite frankly, we haven't needed to. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for that. Very colorful answer. Just one quick one. Are there any changes to some of the leasing language that gives kind of more hours? Whether that be sales based? Wendy Seher : So in terms of our contracts, I mean, it depends. So if we're talking about tenants that we have that have a proven history with us and strong sales and we see them as a key fundamental of the places and the environments that we want to continue to build upon with that foundation, we -- as Dan had said, we had mentioned that we can be creative, provided that it's going to benefit the tenant and that we're going to be able to share in that upside as well. As it relates to other tenants going forward, new coming in, It depends on the center and it depends on the concept. We sometimes don't mind, depending upon the capital allocation if it's very limited or 0 where we can make an opportunity for a tenant, they can try us, we can try them and see how that marriage works. And we maintain control over the shopping center. So that can oftentimes be a win-win. So it really depends. I'm sounding like I'm not answering you, but it really depends on the operator. And it also depends what we're seeing more today than we've seen in the past is if we had choices, right? If we have choices between two great operators, and that happens, it's happening more often than not now. So all those factors come into play as we continue to kind of emerge post-COVID. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Linda Tsai with Jeffries. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi. Just to clarify, [indiscernible] prior period rents in 1Q, were those from both deferrals and cash basis tenants paying back? Dan Guglielmone : It's cash basis and it's paying back. Linda Tsai : Okay. Got it. And then so within guidance, there's some assumption, some level of that baked in as well? Dan Guglielmone : Exactly. Exactly. So, a low range for the lower end, yes. And maybe we continue on. We've seen in the third, fourth and this quarter, reasonable prior period rent collections. We don't expect that to continue at the pace that we've had. We expect that certainly to burn off. And so we have different assumptions in there. But yes, we don't expect $8 million every quarter for the balance of the year. That should shrink to a much smaller number by the fourth quarter. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then your comment on Bala Cynwyd as the precursor to gauge demand for larger residential projects, how is progress at Bala Cynwyd versus expectations? Don Wood : There in terms of -- so let me actually answer that, Linda, really the right way. Everything stopped in terms of demand between April of 2020 and November, December of 2020. So from that perspective, we're behind, as you would expect us to be. What I was talking about is now you look at this spring and what's happening there in February and March and April, better than we expected. So clearly, a trough and now, like the rest of the country, I guess, this renewed ability to come out and make decisions, including living decisions. And so we should be leased up fully there within the next few months. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Floris Van Dijukum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris Van Dijukum : Thanks guys for taking my question. I hope David Simon was listening to your comments earlier, Don, about productive real estate generating high rents. I think that's part of his spiel as well. Wanted to -- the talk -- ask about the past due rent collection, $8 million. It's an $0.11 impact this quarter. Obviously, you -- again, you've baked in some of that going down the road. Could you quantify all of the past due rents from existing tenants that you have in your portfolio? And how much potential there is of that, that you haven't collected. Don Wood : Well, we've got a receivable of how big? About $80 million. We do not expect to put $80 million. But yes, that's what the receivable is -- the gross receivable. So I mean, it could be -- that's not in our forecast. Floris Van Dijukum : Got it. It's just -- it's a portion of that, that you're -- a small portion. So it's like 20% of that? Is that sort of the ballpark of what I'm hearing? Is the right assumption for past due rents to be collected or is it higher? Dan Guglielmone : No, it's -- I don't have that number kind of offhand. What I guess I could do is follow up with you off-line. Floris Van Dijukum : Okay. Okay. And a follow-up question maybe. So obviously, the ATM issuance, I think you did $87 million during the quarter and some post the quarter. I think you mentioned on the call, $124 million in total. Maybe talk about the average price and maybe the implications for where your share price is relative to your NAV as well? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Look, it was in my comments. We transacted -- sold stock at $105 million. $88 million of that was in the cash market, $36 million of that was in the [indiscernible]. And honestly, I think we're in and around kind of our estimate for NAV. Not too far off where kind of -- but hey, look, that's a moving target for us. Don Wood : Hey, Floris, the one thing about us, I guess you probably -- I know you know about us, but I hope you appreciate that about us is that we try to do some every year. And effectively, obviously, we're not going to do it down at levels that are significantly dilutive. But in every year, as a REIT, we want to stay very active in acquisitions, development and property improvement plan. We want to stay very active at being able to lease to the best tenants. We want to stay very active in making sure that the dividend gets paid. This company believes in the future and a long-term future. And when you do that, you want to issue equity in modest amounts. But each year, in each period as you can. And so doing it at $105, I think we're worth more than that. I think you think we're worth more than that. I think everybody thinks we're worth more than that. But effectively, in being in that range to be able to utilize the ATM to create some level of equity inclusion, we think is prudent and is on balance, an important part of the overall capital plan. Floris Van Dijukum : Thanks, Don. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is with Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Lucas : Hey, good evening everybody. Sorry for the long call, but I do have a couple of quick questions. Don, first, congratulations on Chesterbrook. Hard to find an asset that actually improves your demographics but you did it. And the other comment I would make is that, that could have used the Federal truck when I was in [indiscernible]. Don Wood : Exactly. That's why I think you should be really happy or you will be really happy when you see the growth that we generate from it. I think it's a low bar. Chris Lucas : I would agree. The one thing that I did want to talk a little bit about is just on the apartment lease rate. Nice improvement since the fourth quarter. Just curious, was that just snapback in demand? Or would you have to do any significant incentivizing to drive that improved activity? Don Wood : Significant incentivizing up in Boston. Very little activity at all in California, which is snapping back beautifully and the same here at Pike & Rose. In fact, the leader, by the way, among those three in terms of rent growth and -- or lack of rent ammunition is Pike & Roses. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then, Dan, two quick ones for you. I'd be remiss if I didn't ask what these term fees were for the quarter. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. They were flat to last year. About $2.8 million in each of those first quarter of 2020 and first quarter '21. That was above what we had forecasted. Chris Lucas : Right. I was going to say. So have you, in your guidance for this year, have you upped your expectations for lease term fees? Dan Guglielmone : No. I mean, look, I think that we've got a range at the high end of the range. And at the low end of the range, it's kind of our average over the last 10, 15 years. So figure that. We won't -- we're not anticipating getting to $14 million in any of those cases. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then last question for me. Can you kind of give us a little more color on sort of the ins and outs of what Splunk is? The sort of timing is Splunk sort of, I guess, lease fee versus -- or how they're making up the difference between sort of when that app starts paying you rent or however that work. Can you kind of go through some of the timing issues and what -- I'm assuming it's a net neutral, but just can you kind of walk through the timing of the transaction there? Don Wood : You bet. Jeff, can you take that? Jeff Berkes : Yes. Chris, I think Don said this in his opening comments, but we're made whole and there's no lapse in rent payment between when the Splunk stops and NetApp starts to made whole from that perspective. Chris Lucas : So Jeff, I appreciate. Yeah, go. Don Wood : So basically -- I was just going to say that basically, the make whole was in a cash payment effectively or NAS and that we had a straight-line receivable that we had to write off. So those things kind of netted effectively, but we added two years of term and a big number. Chris Lucas : Okay. So that's the second quarter transaction, so less straight line, more cash. That's not a bad thing. Don Wood : Say that one more time to make sure I got that. Chris Lucas : So it's a second quarter event, right? Don Wood : Yes. True. Chris Lucas : Yes. And so -- but the net is you're less straight line but more cash, which is a good thing. Don Wood : Yes, correct. Jeff Berkes : Yes. And 2Q is correct. Chris Lucas : Okay, thank you. That's all I had. I appreciate it. Don Wood : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at NAREIT and please reach out to the virtual meeting. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference. It disconnect your lines at this time.

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Leah Brady. Thank you. You may begin. Leah Brady : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood; Dan G.; Jeff Berkes; Wendy Seher; Dawn Becker; and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance.  Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions that our Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.  The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued tonight, our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our second quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Well, thank you, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. To quote Seinfeld's Frank Costanza, \"We're back baby,\" and it seems to me we're the real estate of choice. Let me just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 of these points. We killed it in the second quarter at $1.41. We raised our 2021 total year guidance by over 10% at the midpoint. We raised our '22 guidance, the only retail real estate company to get '22 guidance, by the way, by 5% at the midpoint. We covered our dividend on a cash basis in the second quarter and raised it again for the 54th consecutive year. We had record leasing volume, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history.  So we'll put more meat on the bone for each of those points and others, but that's where this company is as we sit here in the first week of August of 2021, and we're feeling great about our market position. At $1.41 a share, we exceeded even our most optimistic internal forecast by $0.20 a share and we're up 83% over last year's worst COVID-impacted quarter, of course, it was the second quarter. In a nutshell, we didn't anticipate the bounce back in nearly all facets of our business to be so fast and so strong, and we didn't anticipate some of the onetime deals that we were working on to be executed so quickly. We talked about the pent-up demand on the last call in the form of strong traffic and leasing demand, and that has continued unabated ever since, no pun intended. The quarterly financial impact of that optimistic consumer meant that we : one, collected more rent in the second quarter from prior periods than we thought; two, we had significantly less unpaid rent in the quarter than we thought; three, we had fewer tenant failures than we thought; and four, we had far higher percentage rent from COVID-modified deals than we thought. And as I said, we covered our dividend on an operating cash basis in the second quarter, way ahead of our expectations. Of course, all that means that we'll significantly raise 2021 earnings guidance and raise 2022 earnings guidance as well. As we've said all along, visibility toward '22 earnings was ironically better than 2021. That has proven to be the case, and Dan will talk you through guidance details in a few minutes. And while this quarter's earnings were as strong as they were, in large part, because of the collection of big rent dollars, both past and present, the real story here is the unprecedented amount of leasing that was done and what it means for the value of our real estate into the future. Our properties are in demand across the board. We did 124 comparable deals in the quarter, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history for 558,000 square feet at an average rent of $37.34 per foot, 8% more rent than the deals they replaced. We signed another 9 noncomparable deals, mostly in our new developments at an average rent of $44.71 per foot. That's 570,000 square feet of space leased in 1 quarter alone, 25% more than our pre-COVID quarterly average. You might remember that we did almost as much last quarter 2. So when you put the 2 quarters together, the production in the first half of 2021 is both staggering and unprecedented cost. Big kudos here to our leasing, our legal, our support teams, nearly 1.1 million square feet at an average rent of $37 a foot, 8% more than the previous leases, growing through annual rent bumps over the next 8-plus years. That's really just the tip of the iceberg here. Another really interesting consideration is the breakdown of all that leasing between deals to renew tenants and deals with new tenants. Traditionally, 2/3 of the deals we do in any 1 period hovers around 2/3 renewals and 1/3 new tenants. Well, not in these post-COVID 6 months. It's actually nearly flipped, roughly 40% renewals and 60% new tenants. So what does that mean? And why is that important? Well, first, it means that we lost a heck of a lot of tenants during COVID. And since it costs more to put a new tenant in the space rather than renew an existing tenant, our current tenant capital is higher. On the face of it, that seems like bad news, but you got to dig deeper. Because what it also means is that our properties are in high demand from today's relevant and well-capitalized restaurants and retailers that are all trying to improve their sales productivity post-COVID through better real estate locations. We've always been picker than most in terms of the tenants we choose to merchandise our centers. When you couple that with the execution of the broad post-COVID property improvement plans that we've talked about over the last several quarters, that higher capital outlay will result significantly higher asset value tomorrow. I mean think about it in a post-COVID world. Major market's first-tier high-quality suburban shopping centers with more than a smattering of new post-COVID relevant tenants doing business in revitalized shopping centers and mixed-use properties focused more on outdoor seating, on a curbside pickup, on covered walkways and improved placemaking than ever before. Places that are more fresh, more dominant, more relevant in a myriad of ways in the communities they serve for years and years to come. The value of our real estate, net of capital, is going up, and the prospects appear to be better than they were before COVID. Also, consider that at quarter end, our portfolio was 92.7% leased, yet only 89.6% occupied. That 310 basis point spread, or nearly 780,000 square feet of space representing roughly $30 million in rent, is the largest spread we've had since 2005. You might remember how 2006 and 2007 turned out, which obviously bodes well for the future, assuming inevitable tenant fallout occurs at historical levels. And by the way, just 3 years ago, we were 95%. Okay. Onward. I hope that you all saw the major acquisition announcement that we made in the press release on June 7 that laid out the 4 deals that we closed during the quarter. Overall, we have an 80% interest in the combined income stream, Grossmont Shopping Center in Greater San Diego, Camelback Colonade and Hilton Village in Greater Phoenix and Chesterbrook Shopping Center in McLean, Virginia. Gross asset value of $407 million for 1.7 million square feet on 125 acres of land in prime locations in these markets, and we strongly believe that pricing today would far exceed what we negotiated in the middle of COVID. A presentation that we put out ahead of NAREIT and our investor NAREIT investor meetings in June focused on these acquisitions in depth, including a very unique potential redevelopment opportunity at Grossmont since we control virtually the entire 63-acre parcel from a tenant perspective in less than 5 years from now. Separately, we have another deal under contract currently that we hope to close on in the quarter -- this quarter. On the development side, residential and office leasing activity is also picking up on both coasts. It's really gratifying to see Pike & Rose quickly maturing, coming into its own and becoming the go-to place for lots of things in the region. In Montgomery County, Maryland, a county that's not doing a lot of office leasing these days, our Phase 3 office building, 909 Rose, is 77% leased with another 11% under executed LOIs. So nearly 90% committed at the point at rents in line with pro forma. That's strong in this office environment with mostly 2022 rent starts there. Big quarter up at Assembly Row, and now we've received our certificate of occupancy for the retail portion and half of the units in Marcella, the 500-unit residential building that's part of the Phase 3 development. Tenants began moving in, in July and initial leasing pace is exceeding our expectations. 145 units are already currently leased at rates that approximate our lease-up underwriting and that seemed to be getting stronger with each week that passes. Assembly Row is the mixed-use project in our portfolio that got hurt the most during COVID and took the longest to begin to bounce back, but now feels like it's recovering as fast as the others. Office leasing in the Puma-anchored building is also picking up with serious negotiations underway for the first time in over a year for a large portion of the remaining space. Nothing tangible yet but a good sign nonetheless. Similar situation in San Jose with our 375,000 square foot spec office building under construction and nearing completion remains on lease for the time being. At our CocoWalk in Miami, its all about getting tenants open as we're fully leased on the retail side and mostly leased on the office side. Tenant openings will continue through the remainder of this year. We look forward to hosting an investor tour in Coconut Grove early next month. More to come on that. In Darien, Connecticut, construction and leasing are moving forward on time and on budget with the newly built Walgreens opening during the second quarter ahead of schedule. That's important because it makes way for the remainder of the demolition of the old shopping center and started a residential over retail component of the project. Goods happening up there, too. Let me pause there. stop. That's about only half of the prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. The unexpectedly strong results of $1.41 per share in the quarter, not only blew way 2020's year-over-year comparison, but was a 20-plus percent sequential gain over first 2 quarter and more than 20% above our forecast and consensus. Given the big beat for the quarter, let me take a little time to put some color around the broad categories of outperformance that Don outlined. $0.13 of outperformance was driven by collection-related items. $0.06 of upside was from improved operations, with $0.05 for one-timers that were above our forecast, which collectively totaled to $0.24 beat versus our previous quarterly guidance. First, some detail on the $0.13 of upside from collection. Rent collection for the quarter, net of percentage rent, was almost 200 basis points ahead of expectations. Prior period rent collection was $7 million versus $4 million in our forecast. Our percentage rent for the quarter was almost $3 million above forecast, highlighting the strength in consumer traffic across the portfolio. Second, the $0.06 of operational outperformance was driven by our occupancy essentially staying flat, which was roughly 50 to 100 basis points better than we had expected. And improved hotel, parking and specialty leasing revenues all exceeded forecast. The third category of $0.05 of onetime items above forecast were attributable to term fees, bankruptcy payments, loan reserve reversals and other miscellaneous payments all collectively exceeding our expectations. Please note that we do not expect the $1.41 to be the run rate for the balance of the year. Even $0.09 of the results are not expected to be recurring. And as Don mentioned, we are in the midst of delivering 500 units of residential at Assembly Row, which will be dilutive over the next few quarters, amongst other items, but we'll address that later when we get to guidance. Let's take some time and revisit collections. Our collectibility impact was more than cut in half to $6.4 million versus the $14.8 million we had in the first quarter on the strength of prior and current period collections, net of abatements. Rent collection in the quarter surged to 94% or 4% from the 90% level as reported on our first quarter call. With abatements and deferral agreements totaling 4% of billed rent, our unresolved rent now stands at just 2%. Of the $39 million of deferral agreements negotiated to date, $17 million have been repaid, representing about 90% of the scheduled deferral payments. The remaining repayments of $22 million are set to be paid back over the next few years. Elections for cash basis tenants improved substantially to roughly 80% for the quarter, up from 66% in the first quarter, a very strong signal. For occupancy, the continued pressure that we expected during the second quarter never really materialized as our tenants remain resilient. With the record-breaking leasing volumes across the portfolio, economic occupancy should steadily climb higher from this point driven by 310 basis points of spread between leased and occupied, that is embedded within the portfolio. Other strong leasing metrics to note, our small shop leased occupancy grew almost 200 basis points to 85.7% from 83.8%, a huge movement of that metric in a single quarter. And with respect to our lifestyle-oriented retail assets, whose performance was hardest hit during COVID, the spread between leased and occupied has grown to 440 basis points, driven by strong tenant demand and signaling a sustainable acceleration in this segment's recovery. Comparable property growth rebounded in a big way for the quarter, up 39%, an unprecedented result and obviously a record for Federal. But also no better evidence of the lack of relevance for this metric in the current environment, whether it's positive or negative. Now let me move over to guidance. We increased our guidance for both 2021 and 2022, taking 2021 up over 10% from a prior range of $4.54 to $4.70, up to a new range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share. This implies 13% year-over-year growth versus 2020 at the midpoint. And we are taking 2022 up 5% from a prior range of $5.05 to $5.25 to a new range of $5.30 to $5.50. Let's review some of the assumptions behind the improved outlook. For 2021, as I mentioned, the $1.41 per share results for the second quarter will not be a run rate for the balance of the year. As I mentioned, $0.09 of that 2Q results is onetime in nature. Term fees and bankruptcy-related income will not recur at the same level, and note that we have very few term fees in the pipeline currently. While current period collections should continue to climb modestly higher, prior period collections are forecasted to trail off for the remainder of the year. Also consider the previously mentioned dilution, roughly $0.03 per quarter from the residential and assembly and other developments that we'll be delivering in the second half. We also expect increased G&A and property level expenses of $0.02 per quarter as the cost of doing business has increased post COVID. However, we do expect accretion from the second quarter acquisitions of roughly $0.02 per quarter. So this revised guidance implies an increase in our FFO forecast for the second half of the year of '21 of almost 10%. For 2022, the improvement in outlook is driven by : One, a faster return to pre-COVID collection levels; two, a stronger occupancy due to the record leasing activity we've seen; three, a full year contribution for Grossmont, Chesterbrook and Phoenix; and then continued improvements and contributions from our development pipeline. Although we continue to await tangible leasing at Santana West, it feels like that will not contribute to FFO until 2023. Also note that there is a level of pragmatism in these numbers. By all reports, the COVID variants are keeping the virus with us longer than we would like. And we are still anticipating some level of tenant fallout as PPP money and other government subsidies fall away and impact selected tenants' ability to operate profitably. And lastly, getting rents started on our record levels of new leasing activity will be a paramount focus for the operating teams here at Federal. Please note there is no benefit assumed in our guidance in either year from switching tenants back from a cash basis to accrual basis account. Finally, let's move to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity and leverage. On the heels of deploying over $325 million on acquisitions and over $100 million on new process development during the quarter, we continue to have ample total available liquidity of $1.3 billion, comprised of $300 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion revolver. With $125 million of mortgage debt scheduled to be paid over the next 90 days, we will then have no maturing debt until 2023. And lastly, we continue to be opportunistic selling tactical amounts of common equity through our ATM program. We sold $140 million at a blended share price of about $117.50 for the quarter and a forward sales agreement in order to manage our liquidity over the next year. Our remaining spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline is down to $270 million with an additional $60 million remaining on our product improvement initiatives across the portfolio. Given the surge in our EBITDA, our leverage metrics returned to significantly stronger levels as well. Pro forma for our 2Q acquisitions and $175 million of forward equity under contract, our run rate for net debt to EBITDA is down to 6.2x. Our fixed charge coverage is back up to 3.7x. And our total liquidity binds pro forma to $1.5 billion. Our targeted leverage ratios remain in the mid-5x for net debt-to-EBITDA and above 4x for fixed charge coverage. Now before we get to Q&A, let me quickly mention in the wake of covering the dividend this quarter from AFFO, yesterday, our Board declared an increased quarterly dividend per share of $1.07, given the surge in traffic across the asset base, the resilience and quality of our sector-leading real estate portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the sound forward-looking decision-making and management, maintaining the dividend through another challenging economic cycle now looks likely. This should provide federal shareholders with further peace of mind that with an investment in FRT comes a reliable, uninterrupted steady, stable stream of current income as part of their total return. And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. CraigSchmidt: I guess what I want to focus in on is the small shops. The 190 bps seems really strong. Most of your peers are showing just the reverse. They're showing an increase listing by the anchors, reasoning being they're national and they can move faster than the small shops; and two, sometimes you need these anchors in place to push the small shops. Maybe you could tell what you did differently to drive the small shops? Or what is it indicative of from the small shop side? DonWood: Thanks, Craig. Let's just turn that over to Wendy. Let's see Wendy what thinks about that. WendySeher: Craig, yes, I think that we continue to see kind of that really strong, steady demand from our anchors, whether it's Target and Home Sense and [REN], which was new to market, we continue to make those deals as we always have historically. So really strong strength there. But what I'm -- just as you pointed out, what I'm really excited about is the fact that our small shop leasing has been terrific. A lot of demand for our properties very broad-based between all of our property levels, and we continue to do deals with those best-in-class partners who have always been on our small shop side, whether it's Nike or Athleta, Starbucks, Ulta, to name a few. What I'm really kind of intrigued about and really speaks to the strength of the real estate is the kind of retailers who maybe have a little bit more of a conservative expansion program and they're selectively choosing best-in-class locations across the country doing very small increments of growth that really differentiate your property types. And that -- those names like Levain Bakery and Blue Bottle Coffee and Oriana, Room and Board and Simon Peers and I could continue on and on, are really what I'm excited about are the kinds of tenants that are selecting our properties in the neighborhoods and areas that we're in. CraigSchmidt: So I know Don gave a breakout of 60% new, 40% renewed. Were you seeing a similar ratio? Or was it even higher new tenants in the small shop? DonWood: Well, I'm not sure, Craig. We can go back and look at it. I would expect that to be commensurate either way, but I have to go back and look at it. I'll tell you, the new deals on the small shop side have been spectacular. And so that's going to be a good -- that's going to be a big number. I just don't know if it's bigger or smaller than the anchors. JeffBerkes: Yes. Craig, it's Jeff. And just to put a pin in it and really this is what Wendy's saying, but a differentiator, obviously, between us and our peer group is the lifestyle and mixed-use properties of -- what's said in the prepared remarks, the leasing in those properties has been exceptionally strong, and the bulk of the leasing in those properties are, by definition, small shop tenants. So we're just very pleased with the level of activity there and the quality of the deals that our leasing teams have been able to get done in that portion of our portfolio. CraigSchmidt: Okay. I mean I was really surprised to see the lift in small shops. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. MikeMueller: I just have a quick question on -- in terms of cash on hand. I mean things have obviously improved quite a bit. It still seems like you're running with about $300 million of cash on hand. I mean how should we be thinking about what's, I don't know, like a normalized level for the current environment of cash? Should we expect that to drop off to something more pre-COVID like? Or do you anticipate running with something more elevated over the longer term? DonWood: It's a good question, Mike. Look, we run through COVID with higher levels of cash. I think we're still above kind of the stabilized level of cash that we expect to need and expect to run with. I think over time, we'll run that down. And my expectation is that maybe it's $100 million, maybe $150 million of cash on hand, versus kind of what we used to run, which was kind of more in the $25 million plus/minus. MikeMueller: Got it. And 1 clarification. When you were talking about before the upside in the quarter, you just said $0.05 of onetimers above what you assumed. What was the total amount of what you would consider to be the onetimers in the quarter? DonWood: Roughly about $8 million onetimer. DanGuglielmone: $0.08. DonWood: Or $0.08, sorry. I misspoke. $0.08 worth of onetimers in the quarter, and we had forecasted something obviously lower than that. We did expect the -- obviously, the Splunk term fee of the straight line, and we did expect the repayment of our [Indiscernible], but we were surprised by a lot of other activity that came through in the quarter that we don't expect to recur going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Katy McConnell of Citigroup. KatyMcConnell: I'm wondering if you could comment on, based on your current fundamental outlook, how you're thinking about the opportunity to start additional phases of development in the near term? Or even potentially new ground-up sites as opposed to pursuing more acquisitions? And just how you're thinking about the yield differential there? DonWood: I love the question, Katy. I'm not sure if you've been in our senior executive meetings over the past few weeks, if you're spying because those conversations are front and center. And look, the -- it depends, right?  When you look at a place like Pike & Rose, for example, this is a property that we're really, really happy with the office leasing. That's been done in the first building and the building we're standing in, in 909 Rows. Could there be enough demand here to effectively start another building in time? It's possible. So we're talking about that, looking at that. Could we find a big enough tenant that anchor it? I don't know, all that stuff is the kind of thought process that we go through in each of these big projects. Do we want to start a brand-new ground-up in the next year? I said no, we don't. We frankly have plenty to do on the existing ones that we have. And when you look at the acquisition trade-off, if you will, versus development, I think there was a window. And I think we jumped through that window during COVID, where that difference was really attractive and pointed you toward acquisitions. That's changed a little bit now. It's still early in the recovery. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But with us, it's not about turning 1 [stick] on and the other one off, it's about adjusting based on what it is that we find. So I hope that's helpful in terms of where we'll be going forward. And obviously, any time we have a deal to announce, we'll certainly announce it on either the acquisition or the development side. KatyMcConnell: And I know you mentioned you had 1 additional acquisition in the pipeline as of now. Any other comments you can share as far as what's in the pipeline beyond that? Or what you've seen as far as pricing movement since you've closed the last 4? DonWood: No, not at this time, Katy. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. SteveSakwa: Don, you talked about the wide spread between the lease and the occupied. I' m wondering : A, how quickly can that close? And maybe if you or Dan could just talk about what is implicit in your 2022 guidance for either an average occupancy or perhaps a year-end occupancy by 2022? DonWood: Sure, Steve. I'll take the first piece and Dan, if you can take the numbers on the second grade. But the -- when you see all the leasing that we've done, and it goes back a little bit to Craig's point, a lot of it has been small shop. And the small shop stuff tends to happen quicker effectively than the anchors. So that stuff should be starting to help us later in 2021 and a lot 2022. The anchors have a longer tail. And so there, you should see more benefit coming in '22 and even a few as far out as '23 there. But they are more focused towards -- or more weighted toward those small shop deals that do go faster. Now look, the difference between, obviously, new deals versus renewals, renewals are there right now and keep that income stream going. The new stuff that's coming in is in a lot of places, too, part and parcel of kind of our property improvement plans and our redevelopment plans. So as a result, you'll really see a really upgraded portfolio over the next few years as a result of this. A -DanGuglielmone: And with regard to guidance, what's embedded there is, I think, some modest continued improvement through the end of the year. We should get back up above 90% occupied by year-end, and then probably over the course of 92% to get into probably somewhere above 92%. Will we get to kind of that full spread of 310 basis points? We'll see. But the guidance is roughly kind of 92% to 93% by the end of '22. SteveSakwa: Okay. And maybe just as a follow-on for you or for Don. When you think about -- you guys obviously took a lot of pain in the downturn and are starting to see the snapback. When would you sort of guesstimate that your NOI would be back to pre-COVID levels? Is that a '23 number? Is that kind of by the end of '22? How do we sort of think about that pace of recovery? DonWood: I don't know what to tell you about that, Steve. It's certainly something that we've talked about a lot. I would hope for it to be there in '23. But let me throw something else out at you that maybe is a little bit thought provoking. If you took our portfolio today, and you said, all right, historically, this company has certainly been a 95% leased portfolio, and you took all of the capital that we've spent in development projects to date, the acquisitions that have been made et cetera, and other capital that's not yet producing income, and you simply said, \"All right. Finish up. Let's get this thing leased back up to 95%, whenever that happens. Let's do all that development with tenants full.\" We'd be over $7 a share. So this really comes down to a notion of we're not sitting here trying to focus on getting back to 2019 levels. We're sitting here saying, look, we're putting money out in places we think that are smart. We've certainly been hit by COVID, obviously, delayed in terms of -- and certainly in the markets and the asset types that we have all the way through even more so. But getting back to something that was just okay back in 2019 hardly seems like it should be the goal. So I don't know when we get to what I just said, but that's where we are aiming, man, and we're trying hard. Operator : Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. AlexanderGoldfarb: First, congrats on being a Dividend King. I wasn't even aware of that. I knew about a Dividend Aristocrat. So Dividend King is pretty cool. Don, following up from Steve's question, last quarter when I asked you about '22 and said, you wouldn't put out '22 unless you thought that you could beat it, which is what you've now done. And listening to Dan talk about what's not in the number, meaning like your tenants to a cash basis now, you're not assuming any of those people go back to being a straight line, which means that's a boost, that's an upward bias to earnings, plus you killed it on this quarter, there's no reason to think that you won't outperform on further quarters. Again, why should we stay within your guidance range for '22? Why wouldn't we do -- be above it? Because what you do is you run the team to always outperform. You don't put something out there unless you think that you can achieve beyond that. And if you're telling Steve that you don't think you'd be back to peak NOI to '23 and you just covered your dividend basically a full year earlier than you thought, again, it sounds like there's some good upsides to '22. DonWood: How in the world, my friend, could I possibly answer you the same way I did last time when I have to sit here and say, from last time, Alex was right. I mean that's hard for me to do well. Hard for me -- AlexanderGoldfarb: Can you say that -- Don, Don, Don. Slow down. Say that louder and slower. DonWood: Well, now you're getting greedy, Alex, okay? So I said it one time. And do I believe what we were doing was sandbagging? I do not believe that. I believe what we were doing is assessing the situation as best we could at that time. And I believe that things have could have gotten better a whole lot faster in our markets. But at the end of the day, Alex, you are right, dude. And let's do it again. And you didn't use dude back on me, which I thought you should have in that particular spot, but nonetheless. So with respect to where we are now, I'm going to say the same thing to you. We've done the best we can to kind of lay out where we are, lay out the probabilities of hitting our numbers. I don't know what Delta does. I don't know what the situation -- where the situation goes in the country, the way we are -- the way we move things through. But I do know when you sit and you look at our forecasting and what it is that we see happening, we are clearly improving faster than we thought we were before. Will that happen again? I don't know. Maybe I got to get you in here to do the forecasting for the company. But that's -- I don't have a good answer beyond that for you. AlexanderGoldfarb: I mean, to that point, I mean, one, the straight lining is a positive; two, you have your experiential tenants who are coming back; three, there's the improvement in [occupants]. I mean, it just seems like there's a lot of stuff in there that's upward bias in each quarter, everyone exceeds. So I mean that's the point is I think I've answered my own question, but you've answered it. So the next question is, as far as the new -- the -- you said that 60% of the people coming in to your portfolio are new tenants, are those simply relocations from other centers? Are they new to market? Are they tenants looking to expand? Like just a little bit more color on what that new demand is. DonWood: Yes. The new demand is very broad-based. It's all of the things that you said and more. And frankly, Wendy kind of touched it when she was talking about some of these tenants who are well-capitalized tenants that are not -- they're not volume guys. They're not trying to do 250, 300 stores, 500 stores et cetera. They are selectively picking locations to have brick-and-mortar outfits that supplement their online businesses et cetera. We're getting our fair -- more than our fair share of those type of tenants. That's a real positive thing. They're new to market in a lot of cases. They're effective. They're newly capitalized in a lot of cases. One of the things that is most important here to think through is that obviously, COVID cleaned out weaker tenants, and they did that earlier. That's the April and May and June and July of 2020. And you know that list by heart.  The notion though of what happened over the next year and who you want to have in your centers, particularly if you're spending $10 million and $12 million and $8 million on a center for a property improvement plan, you want new blood in the retails because you can't just have a nice place to sit outside the same old tenants that were pre-COVID and average or are average now because of their sales. So you're seeing -- we've said it from the beginning that the demand is broad-based and the demand is largely tenants trying to improve the real estate locations that they're in. Why? Because they're trying to improve the sales. That it is that they do, which is why they can pay the rents that we charge. It's all about that relationship. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. MichaelGoldsmith: Just on the guidance, again, what are the assumptions that you have built into the 2021 guidance that would get you to the low end of the range versus what it would take to get you to the high end? DonWood: For the most part, I think it's just the range of a lot of the things that we talked about in the numbers, whether it be continued upward surge in collections, how much additional prior period rent we are assuming that rent trails off from, it was -- yes, we've had pretty steady prior period rent collection of $7 million, $8 million and $7 million over the last 3 quarters. We expect it to trail off to -- in the second half of the year to about $3 million and $2 million, respectively. There could be some upside there from that perspective. We are likely to increase. We are successful with acquisition, we'll bump guidance slightly from that perspective. But it's all the reason -- all the outperformance we had, we're expecting term fees. We had $3.4 million net in the quarter versus $1.8 million net last year. We're now expecting -- we're expecting maybe $1 million this quarter. That's an area of some upside. To the extent we're higher than that, that's up towards the upper end of the range. So that's some of the pieces that get us from the top and the bottom. MichaelGoldsmith: That's helpful. And it's really admirable that you put out 2022 guidance. As we think about your prior guidance to the current one, your '20 -- the gap between your '21 and '22 guidance kind of shrank this quarter. And some of that's explained, I think, by some of the onetime charges, but what are the other changes in assumptions next year that are reflected in that? DonWood: Well, no, Michael, all I was going to say and may I add to this, like what you're basically seeing is a faster recovery. So all of the things that were assumed are simply happening faster. And so when you look at kind of what we had put out in '22 initially, obviously, there was a run rate from '21 that rolled into '22, to the extent that run rate is better in '21. It inures or some of it accrues to '22 also. And that's basically all it is. We stay with the methodology that we use in our multiple year forecast. And we make that consistent each quarter that we update those assumptions. That single biggest change is what I'm saying, and that is simply a faster recovery than most here. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. JuanSanabria: I was just hoping to spend a little time on the lease spreads. I guess based on current demand and your lease expiration schedule, how do you think spreads will trend into and maybe through '22? There's a slight dip sequentially in the spread in the second quarter despite the strong momentum. So I don't know if that was mix related and your expirations kind of jump up next year in terms of the dollar per square foot. So just curious if you have any context on how those spreads may evolve into and through '22? Donald Wood : I guess what I'd say to you is a couple of things. First of all, we're a relatively small company. And so in any particular quarter, there's always going to be a rather significant variation. I laughed a little bit when you said there was a decrease in the second quarter to first quarter. I think one was 9 and one was 8. To me, that's exactly the same, just so you know. In terms of the -- and in both of those quarters, there were still deals, obviously, that were rolled down. There were other deals that were rolled up in a more significant way. That's basically what happens in most quarters. There is a mixture of those 2 things. The probability that it will stay in those single-digit numbers is highest. That's where we're most comfortable effectively in kind of running -- pushing rents and seeing what we can do in any 1 period. And again, that definitely, definitely depends on the mix of any particular quarter, which you don't get in a bigger company. If you've got a much bigger company with more of a commodity product to kind of do the same type of deals over and over again, that's a great thing for consistency. But we are trying to bring in more value here. Juan Sanabria : Great. Sorry, I should have been more clear. I was focused on the new lease rate spreads, but point taken. Donald Wood : Just to understand. Juan Sanabria : Got it. And then just on the acquisition side, any thought or color you could provide about potentially further expanding into new markets, whether it's the Sunbelt or maybe Texas about how you're thinking about that and conversely what could be used as a source in terms of potential calling or dispositions? Or that's not really the focal point for funding to be more just match funding with equity at this point? Donald Wood : Hey, J.B., do you want to take that to start? Jeffrey Berkes : Yes, sure. I mean, we are -- and I think we've talked about this in prior quarters and in NAREIT. We are looking at some new and different markets to expand, I think, as we put it, the number of ponds that we can fish in. And you saw us go into Phoenix, and we're looking at other markets as well right now. We don't really have anything to talk about. When we do, we will. I think Don said earlier, we're really happy we got the deals done, that we did get done when we got them done. The market has tightened up quite a bit. So as always, we'll be careful and conservative and hopefully get some deals done. Every time we do a deal, we do a deal on a cash basis that always causes us to look at the existing portfolio and think about disposing of an asset or 2 that maybe doesn't keep up with the rest of the portfolio in terms of its property level NOI growth. And when we have cash acquisitions to -- that will allow us to do that and make those dispositions on a tax neutral basis, we will, but really not a lot to talk about in that regard right now. Donald Wood : With regards to funding, as we always are, we're very balanced and opportunistic in how we'll look at it. And to the extent that the investment sales market offers us an opportunity to sell some assets at really attractive pricing. We'll take advantage of it, and we'll let you know when we do it. Operator : Our next question is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : How has office interest materialized, especially for Santana West? And thanks for the color on your HQ and also the traction that you're seeing at PUMA. And I do know that Santana is still a bit away from delivering. But I also believe it was almost fully leased with an LOI prior to the pandemic. Has that potential tenant or other anchors like them perhaps reengaged? Or are you seeing any traction there? Donald Wood : Jeff, this one is all yours, buddy. Jeffrey Berkes : Well, to answer the last part of your question directly, the potential tenant that we were close with pre-pandemic, no, they have not materialized, and we don't expect them to now that we're starting to come out of the pandemic. Activity out here in Silicon Valley, the office leasing perspective has definitely picked up in the last 60, 90, 120 days. Tours have started again. You probably all heard about the deal that Apple did a few weeks ago for 700,000 square feet, which is a great sign for the market. There are several other large users that have requirements and are conducting tours, including tours of One Santana West in coming days and weeks. We don't have anything to talk about. And again, we won't until we will. But I can tell you that activities picked up quite a bit. What's great and what we're really happy about as it relates to One Santana West is there's very, very little supply in Silicon Valley right now, and particularly new supply that's amenitized. So that makes us feel good about our prospects for getting the building ways. There's not a lot that we're competing against right now. Derek Johnston : No, it seems like a great asset. And work with me here. So all high-quality retail assets seem to be generating a ton of demand, all right? So this strong of leasing in a post-pandemic environment, I mean, I don't know who could have fully seen this. So okay, Federal, strong leasing, solid spreads and the highest ABRs. Now what's going on here, Don? Like what dynamics or shifts can you share that you're seeing? Because really, I just want to stop talking and listen for another minute, if you would let me. Donald Wood : Yes, Derek, let me go through at least what I think is happening. And Wendy, please feel free to add or anybody that wants that. I mean, look, there is -- if you're just be a retailer for a minute, be a restaurant for a minute and have gone through what just happened in this country over the last 18 months. And frankly, what was happening, the pressures that were on you for the 3 and 4, 5 years before that. And so here you are now, in many cases, recapitalize, in many cases, with a different level of competition than you had before. And you're in a position where you can reset. And effectively, that's what's happening. If you've got the chance -- I mean, I think it\u2019d tell you, man, if you sit on Rockville Pike in 1 of the 4 or 5 shopping centers that all aim for different parts of the consumer on Rockville Pipe that we own, there have been tenants that have been trying to get on the Pike for years and years in the right type of centers. We've been over 95% leased for a Rockville Pipe for much, if not all, of that time, except for the last 15 months. There is an opportunity that has not been here.  So there's an opportunity to improve your real estate in a very, very well-located, first-tier suburb of major cities, and you've got a landlord who is openly and anxiously improving those shopping centers for a post-COVID environment, why would you not choose to go there? Where would you choose to go instead? Because at the end of the day, it's not about the rent. It's about the profit there. And effectively, higher sales, better margins, a more affluent customer in better real estate with a landlord that's investing side-by-side with you, seems to -- and you're in there with a new balance sheet, seems to be a pretty smart choice for a lot of tenants, including and especially those small shop tenants that Craig Schmidt was referring to before and that Wendy went through in detail. So I hope that's helpful. That's what we see happening in the markets that we're in, at the properties that we're in. That's why the investment in the properties, to be post-COVID investments are so important to a retailer. They've got to be partners with their landlord. Wendy Seher : The only thing, Don, I would add to that is that as -- you summed that up so well in terms of how the retailers are thinking. And now think on the flip side of how we're thinking, it gives us the equal opportunity to strengthen our assets and more merchandising with forward thinking of who is well capitalized, who's relevant, who's going to meet that post-COVID world and what -- how should we make our investments in our properties. So it's really a benefit to both sides. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Chris Lucas : Don -- and this kind of follows up on Derek's question, but I appreciate the comments you've made about sort of the demand being pulled forward. But I was curious as to the conversations you're having with your -- the tenants you want to have in your shopping centers, are they expressing interest in thinking about not just this year, next year deals, but the future out years, are you seeing the sustainability of this demand with those kinds of tenants? Donald Wood : That's a good question, man, because, Chris, as you look, I mean, one thing you'll notice is with the volume that we're doing, there's still average term of what...? Jeffrey Berkes : 8.4 years. Donald Wood : 8.4 years, which is about a year more than you kind of used to see from us. And I think what you're trying to -- what they're trying to do is plant flags that effectively get them to the next decade. Now certainly, as a portfolio goes from 89% leased to 92% to 94%, et cetera, it gets harder and harder and harder to be able to do that. So in some respects, it's -- in a lot of respects, it's constrained by the supply that's available to them. And that's kind of why when everything is great in the industry and everything else, a rising tide lifts all boats because you got to find the best spot. But that's also especially at a time like this, when those tenants are trying to take advantage of an opportunity that they have not had for years. So that's kind of what I'm seeing. I don't know, Wendy, if you want to add anything to that or... Wendy Seher : I think the only thing I can add is when I -- I don't know how long you're thinking. But when I look at the pipeline, it is still very robust. So I don't see that we've done a lot first and second quarter and when we're just -- it's robust. So right now, it's -- I'm confident. Chris Lucas : Yes. I think my comment really relates to anecdotal conversations I've had with tenant rep brokers who have talked about their clients not really thinking about '21 and '22 openings, but thinking about '23 and '24 openings, and that their volume of activity has ramped considerably. But that is really how I was thinking about it. Donald Wood : Yes. Look, Chris, but that is what happens to it. I mean this stuff takes time. I mean, I was thinking before when somebody asked the question, the difference between the high and the low end of the guidance. One of the things that we didn't say once, are we going to be able to get with all this leasing? Are tenants open faster than assumed or slower than assumed? And that's not totally in our control. As cities with permits, there's retailers that have different plans of their timetable, et cetera. So the lag in our business, obviously, between signing a lease -- or signing a lease is not the end of the process, getting that rent started is the end of the process. And that is a complex thing to do. In a lot of ways, it takes some time. So that's part of what you're hearing from those tenants also is the lead time to be able to lock up space for a true post-COVID environment. Chris Lucas : Great. And then, Dan, I just wanted to follow up on the collection side. The abatements were down sequentially from $10 million to $7 million. I'm just curious as to whether that thought was driven by -- driven by tenant fallout? Or is that driven by them moving towards paying rent? And then kind of alongside that is also your ABR under cash basis, looks like it went up, call it, $10 million quarter-to-quarter. Is that predominantly new deals? Or are those legacy leases move to cash? Just give me any idea on that? Donald Wood : I'm going to ask you to repeat the question, Chris, and do it one at a time. Chris Lucas : Okay. Sorry about that, Dan. So on abatements, you went from $10 million to $7 million. Was most of the drop related to this tenant fallout? Or was it related to tenants primarily moving to paying new rent, so the abatements sort of going away? Donald Wood : Moving towards paying us rent. Chris Lucas : Okay. And then the second question is related to the ABR that's under cash basis. The percentage of your commercial leases under cash basis remain the same quarter-to-quarter, but the volume of ABR was up considerably from the first quarter to second quarter. So it generated about a $10 million delta on gross ABR that's under cash basis. And so I wanted to understand whether that was predominantly based on new deals that you had signed or whether there were some legacy leases that sort of contributed to that increase in ABR under cash basis. Donald Wood : That distortion was driven by the acquisitions. Obviously, we acquired $325 million or $400 million worth of assets that had 1.75 million square feet. Obviously, that's going to skew some of the data there. Operator : Our next question is from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : So Don, on development, I believe I saw entitlement request that Pike & Rose to potentially add lab or R&D space there. Can you provide some color on how potential construction costs and investment yields compare between traditional office and lab space near major developments and whether that's an asset type you may pursue in other locations as well? Donald Wood : Greg, first of all, I love that you're looking at that stuff and seeing what's going on around here. What we're doing is trying to make sure that we uncover -- we're real estate guys. So we're trying to uncover the highest and best use for the real estate that's here at Pike & Rose and certainly up at Assembly Row and other places. And certainly, when you look at life sciences and you think about Montgomery County, Maryland, it's an important business that's here, that with a little bit of luck expands, and by the way, expands to places where the tenants value the amenity base that other office type tenants value in these locations. And the same applies to Assembly Row. Now at Pike & Rose, are we anywhere near being able to answer your specific questions in terms of the economics on it, whether it's viable, does it make any sense? No, we're not. We're in that early exploratory phase, but we're in the early exploratory phase because we believe there are assumptions potentially there. I've got nothing more to say about that at this point other than the entitlements in this -- on this 27 acres could certainly be used for that use and similarly at Assembly Row. So an Assembly Row could be closer because that business is -- that business, in terms of Boston and Cambridge and Somerville, is even closer to fruition than it is here. But in neither case, am I really ready to talk to you about the economics because we're not sure what we got yet. Greg McGinniss : Okay. That's fair. And then you also mentioned that lifestyle centers are having a bit of a resurgence in tenant demand. Could you also discuss the level and type of demand you're seeing among the other asset types? And if there's any noteworthy trends by geography, that color would be appreciated as well. Donald Wood : No. I don't -- I wouldn't do it necessarily, but I can't really do it between power centers or grocery-anchored centers or regional centers because it really does, it does depend on the geography. There is no question that even in the second quarter, we were operating in markets which were still -- I wouldn't say locked down like they were in January and February, but only coming back and coming up and building in terms of their resurgence. But that -- it was so strong in all of them, that, that we had to -- we just feel really good about talking about it. The only thing I would say is during that period of time, this second quarter, weather had a lot to do with it. So Boston felt like it was a few weeks behind New York, which felt like it was a few weeks behind Washington, D.C., et cetera. That's the -- as that weather changed and as those restrictions came off, holy cap, was there pent-up demand. And that has -- that's continued. It's interesting. We're talking a little bit -- I'm going off on a little bit of tangent, but you gave me an opportunity, so I'll do it. When you think about the Delta variant itself and what's going to happen with respect to it. Obviously, we don't know. But we do know a few things. The open-air format is fantastic. And in the markets where we're at, which has been a big disadvantage as they all closed down in 2020, these are markets where the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country. They are also the markets, and this is important, where mask wearing is accepted. There's not a stigma to it otherwise. So the notion, like we see a lot of people wearing masks at our shopping centers and our properties, but they're shopping just fine because they're comfortable with that. So I don't know how it's going to play out, but I do like the fact that really in these markets, both East and West Coast, that the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country because I think that's an important thing for the long term of this mess we're in. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And just a quick follow-up because you mentioned pent-up demand. And I'm curious on guidance. How are you guys thinking about this level of leasing activity and how much of that might be pent-up demand versus more continued and sustainable tenant demand? Donald Wood : Yes. There's certainly some. But as Wendy has said a couple of times here, the pipeline is full. We've got a bunch of deals to do yet. Will it be as robust as that second quarter or the first quarter? I doubt it. I mean it's hard to maintain that level of activity, plus I think half the people with Twist, they've been working on their asses off. But nonetheless, the ability to see elevated levels based on historical levels for the foreseeable future is real. Operator : Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point. Floris Van Dijkum : I know it's a long evening here for everyone. Just making sure I understand the singed not open pipeline, the 320 basis points, you said is around $30 million of ABR. Is that correct? Donald Wood : Correct. Floris Van Dijkum : So it's about 5% of your POI? Donald Wood : Of total rent. Floris Van Dijkum : Total rents, yes. So is that about 5% of your POI, ballpark figure? Donald Wood : Yes. That's right. Floris Van Dijkum : Yes. Yes. So look, it's a solid number, but it looks like you've pulled forward a lot of your NOI pickup already in this past quarter. So you got another 5% to go. Just making sure, you've also indicated, Don, I think you said you hope to get back to 94%, 95% occupancy, that suggests another 3% or 300 basis point pickup from the current levels. So is that another 5% potential NOI impact going forward? Donald Wood : Yes, of course, Floris. I mean at the end of the day, this is a 95% lease portfolio, and as I said earlier, with the development filled and the capital that we've spent fully performing, I don't know when that would be, you're talking about over $7 a share in earnings for the place. So yes, you bet you. Now ask me the day we get to 95% occupancy. I'm not sure I can give it to you, or when we're fully leased up on the development that's happening obviously. But yes, your model makes sense as to the way you're looking at it. Floris Van Dijkum : So let me ask you the follow- on that. So obviously, your NOI goes up, your NAV should be going up as well. Does that make you think, wait a second, maybe I should hold off on tapping the ATM until my stock price gets up a little bit more? Or would you still be comfortable raising more capital at $1.17 level -- at these -- with these results behind you? Donald Wood : So you know the answer, what it's going to be for me. This is a balanced plan and the ability to effectively raise a little bit of capital in most markets along the way is something that doesn't surprise investors. It keeps everybody, it matches beautifully the money that's spent out. The idea of letting leverage get way up because there may be that day that you can do it and then you do a big overnight, that's not our model. And so we need those investors, and I think we have them we need more of them who basically appreciate that steady, balanced approach toward equity raising, debt raising, dividend payment, what you get when you get the high-quality assets. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Linda Tsai : I just had 1 question. In terms of the tenants that have a payback plan beyond 2021, what percentage of your ABR is that? And then when do the plans finally conclude? Donald Wood : Linda, you've got people moving papers around all over the place around here. Just give us a second. Beyond -- what we have outstanding, roughly half of that should be paid back by the end of the year. And beyond that, it's another chunk in '22, with the balance -- with the balance in '23 and in '24. So you're probably looking about a half in the balance of the year, a quarter in '22 and then the balance beyond that. Linda Tsai : But what percentage of your ABR is on that kind of plan? Donald Wood : I don't have that right at my fingertips. We can provide that to you offline. Operator : Our next question is from Paulina Rojas-Schmidt of Green Street. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: There is clearly a lot of interest -- investor interest in the open-air center these days. How do you think investors are looking at lifestyle centers? And how has the level of comfort with the category change in recent months, in your opinion? Donald Wood : I don't know. The -- when you look at retail real estate, the big investors that we talk to are very interested, obviously, in the cash flow prospects of that particular asset, the particular real estate. When you look at lifestyle, I think what has become very clear during this -- during these last 6 or 8 months is that those type of assets -- and I don't know what we really mean by lifestyle in my mind that we are talking about largely our mixed-use properties and larger assets set that also include a residential or office component associated with it. I know that demand that we're seeing from tenants and therefore, the understanding of that from investors is very strong. The notion that -- the notion that we all know that grocery-anchored centers are very popular right now to effectively look at based on how they worked out through COVID. But in terms of when you sit and you say, where is your growth over the next 5 years or 6 years or 7 years, I know how we feel, and I believe the investors in this company appreciate the higher growth potential of those types of centers. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: Yes. Your portfolio, of course, has a mix of some property types. But if you could break up your portfolio, how far from pre-COVID is the NOI from the 30% of your portfolio comprised by lifestyle centers? Donald Wood : It's still 15%, 18% of it, I think. Operator : Our final question is from Katy McConnell of Citigroup. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Katy. Don, I guess as you listen to all your peer calls and review there, leasing stats, pretty much every public company has been reporting pretty record leasing, strong pipelines. And I wanted to know whether you and your team have noticed any shift in the marketplace between public and private landlords in their share of sort of leasing that's going on, if there is a market share shift that is occurring to the better quality assets of the retail and the better capitalization that the REITs are -- and whether that shift is real or it's just sort of on the margin? And if it's real, does that alter the landscape at all and then provide -- I don't know what happens to all those centers that are not getting the leasing. Do those become acquisition opportunities or redevelopment opportunities? I didn't know whether this is a thing that's happening or not? Donald Wood : Boy, Michael, that's a great question. And I wish I had more than anecdotal evidence by it, but let me give you the anecdotal stuff that I see. I mean it kind of ties back to what I was saying before in terms of retailers making longer-term investments. They're trying to set themselves up for the next decade post COVID, and they want to be with landlords who are with them. And what that means with them is care about who they're merchandising next to care about whether they're investing in the properties to effectively attract customers with a place-making perspective, a curbside pickup. And I mean curbside pickup, I cannot tell you how many tenants ask about it. Whether they use it or not, that's another question. But it's a critical thing to figure out whether the landlord is in it with them in trying to make them successful as businesses. If you're a private company that is undercapitalized, and I've got to make that distinction because the well-capitalized private company, and there's a bunch of them that you and I know that are not disadvantaged at all, and then darn good at what they do. But if you are a private company who is undercapitalized and trying to kind of milk the cash flow from the existing shopping center, I think you're in a serious disadvantage post COVID. And so that -- depending upon the marketplace, who's in the marketplace, who's willing to invest or not. I do think that is a sustainable trend that will widen the gap, if you will, between better real estate and less invested real estate. Michael Bilerman : Do you think that there's a shift like your example on the Pike & Rose -- on the Pike example, are tenants just signing leases because it is available now and they know they want to get into the better space with better quality landlords but they haven't let their other lease expire. And so macro retail statistics are going to start eventually showing this depressed level of overall occupancy just because it's more of a tenant moving around with maybe a slight uptick given some of the new tenants coming into the marketplace? Donald Wood : I don't have an opinion on that. Do either of you, guys? Because they -- when they're signing leases, it is for a move generally. It's not to milk the old store that they had in the market and add another one. So it is -- now I will say that we'll try to incentivize them to leave early and effectively use this period of time to create an economic deal that makes sense for them to leave earlier or something, but it's not -- no, I don't -- I don't see it being extra deals, if you will, that are going to wind up with closeouts in the old places down the road in any significant way, at least I don't see it that way. I don't know, Wendy's shaking her head. Wendy Seher : I agree. I agree. It's more strategic. It's more timing, but I don't see tenants just leaving their other stores and having 2 years left on their lease. It's just -- it needs to match up most of the time with the quality of tenants that we're dealing with. I mean... Donald Wood : Yes. Now historically, Publix was a good example of a company in Florida that would do that. Publix would leave a store, go dark in a store and open 1 -- open 1 across the street, if it was better it was better real estate, better landlord, et cetera. So I mean, there's always exception, I guess. There's always one-offs, but I do not see that or we don't see that as a trend. Michael Bilerman : I mean, like it's just such an unusual market to go through, right? Sorry, Jeff, you were saying? Jeffrey Berkes : Yes, to answer kind of the second part of your question, Michael. If you look at the acquisitions we got done in the second quarter, one of the common threads across those deals was the owner, for whatever reason, was unwilling or unable to invest capital in the property going forward. And those are perfect, well-located shopping centers where that's the owner's mentality. Those are perfect acquisitions for us. We like those because we will come in and put in the capital in a great location and show virtually immediate results, and leasing are very strong results in the short term in leasing. So yes, to the extent the pandemic causes more of that to happen, that will put more properties on our radar screen, for sure. Michael Bilerman : Great. Well, I appreciate the color, even if the tenant, I know we're not going to have perfect answers as yet as we transition to the next phase of this pandemic. Operator : Our next question is from Tammi Fique of Wells Fargo Securities. Tammi Fique : Great. Sort of given all the leasing activity that you did in the quarter, I guess I'm curious what annual contractual rent bumps look like on the new leases signed relative to what you were negotiating pre-COVID? And then maybe as a follow-up to that, I'm wondering if you are seeing any retailers backing away from openings or closing stores due to an inability to find labor today? Donald Wood : I guess the first part of your question, Tammi, on average, you'll still see plenty of deals at 3% bumps, 2.5% bumps. The anchors will still be flat for 5 and then up 10. And I don't see a difference in the deals we're doing compared to pre-COVID, I guess, is the big point there. And then the second part of your question was what? Tammi Fique : I'm just curious, I guess, given we've heard some -- there are some challenges in some of those smaller retailers in particular, finding labor. And I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any retailers backing away from openings or closing stores as a result of that? Donald Wood : I don't think so. I mean, there is no question that is a current issue, especially when you're talking about the service businesses and the restaurants and other service businesses like that. But in terms of not doing deals because of that, no, I don't see that today. I don't see that actually happening now. Ask me that again every quarter and figure out what's going on with that labor situation because I do think that has to give a little bit. And I think it will just, by the natural -- in the natural course as we go. But no, not that you\u2019ll see it today. Tammi Fique : Okay. And then maybe just one more. As you think about future development opportunities and just as we first sit here and reflect on the approaching stabilizations in the current underway pipeline, I guess I'm curious what projects either in the big 3 or in the shadow pipeline, you view as most compelling today. And our higher construction costs, having any impact on how you're thinking about future development. Donald Wood : Yes. Well, the costs always do and what we do. And on the big 3, what we want to make sure we do as best we can because these are planned for 15 years in 20 years in terms of their execution on those things, just to have a good mix of both retail, which brings people to the asset; residential, which we do love to do in terms of that night and weekend traffic; and a component of office, which adds that daytime. So we still want to be able to do all of those on our big projects. We're working those numbers all the time. Construction costs seem to have stabilized a little bit at this at this point in time. I think that's a general good sign. We do need to get comfortable with where rents are and whether we're able to make some money. I think I said earlier in the remarks that there are a number of opportunities potentially at Pike & Rose or Assembly that we see now. I can't wait to be telling you that there's other opportunities at Santana Row once we get that big building lease, which I would love to be able to tell you but I'm not ready to do that yet. And the existing projects that are still being built like Darien and income yet to start like CocoWalk in full measure, we'll also provide -- be providing growth over the next couple of years. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Have a great night. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great evening.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mike Ennes. Thank you. You may begin. Mike Ennes : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty 's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don. Don Wood : Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everybody. By the way, that was Mike Ennes stepping in for Leah Brady. We're going to do this call today as Leah just gave birth to a second child last week, a boy named Weston. Mom and baby are doing great. If you do get the chance, please reach out by email to congratulate her. So, my prepared remarks today are going to sound a lot like last quarter, because the recovery continues on updated and ahead of schedule.  The momentum that we took into the second quarter carried through and in fact strengthened in the third quarter, most evidently on the office leasing demand side at our mixed-use properties. I'll just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 easy points. For one, we killed it in the third quarter at $1.51 a share. Secondly, we raised our 2021 total year guidance by over 7% at the midpoint. Thirdly, we raised our '22 guidance, the only shopping center real estate Company to get '22 guidance so far by the way, similarly by over 6% at the midpoint. And Dan is going to talk about 2023 and 2024 also. We executed 119 retail leases for 430,000 feet of comparable space at 7% higher cash basis rents than the leases they replaced. And we ended up the quarter with our Office product fully leased up at CocoWalk, 89% leased are under executed LOI at Pike & Rose, 88% leased are under executed LOI at Assembly Row. We're even having some consequential discussions with full building users at Santana West. And then after the quarter, you might have seen last week that we signed a 105,000 square foot deal with Choice Hotels to be the leading tenant in the next phase at Pike & Rose.  Some serious office leasing progress for any 3-month period, never mind 1, which decision-makers are still unsure of their future office space needs. Sure, says a lot about many rich new constructions in our markets. We'll put more meat on the bone for each of those points and others. That's where this Company is. We sit here in the first week of November 2021, we're feeling great about our market position. With FFO with a $1.51 per share, we exceeded even our most optimistic internal forecasts, we're up 35% over last year's recovering third quarter. We didn't anticipate the bounce back in nearly all facets of our business to be so fast and so strong, even with the effects of the Delta variant surge. The quarterly positive impact of the past recovery meant that we collected more rent in the third quarter from prior periods than we anticipate, $8 million collected versus a few million forecasts. We had significantly less unpaid rent in the quarter than we anticipated. We collected 96% of what was due. We had far fewer tenant failures than we anticipated. And at $4.9 million, we had far higher percentage rent from COVID -modified and unmodified leases than we had anticipated.  We also had less dilution from our new residential construction in Assembly Row. Because our lease -up is well ahead of schedule at this point, nearly half the new residential building is already lease d. Even the 3 hotels in our mixed-use properties are performing better than we thought that they would be at this point, with occupancy and all 3 back into the mid-60s and better. And of course, we more than covered our dividend on an operating cash basis in the third quarter as we did last quarter. As a reminder, that's the dividend that was never cut during COVID.  So, all that means that we'll significantly raise earnings guidance, and take a peek at the out years too. As we've said all along, visibility to our 2022 earnings was ironically better than 2021. That's proven to be the case. Dan will talk through guidance details in a few minutes. On the retail leasing side, we continue to see strong demand across the board and see that continuing for the foreseeable future. Over the last 4 quarters, we've done 442 comparable deals for nearly 2 million square feet. Not counting another couple of 100,000 feet for non-comparable new development.  To put that in to context, that's 27% more deal volume, 25% more square footage than the annual average over the last decade., a decade that itself was very strong for us from a retail leasing standpoint. We've been saying all along, demand for Federal Realty properties, that's not the issue. They are high demand from today's relevant and well-capitalized restaurants and retailers that are all trying to improve their sales productivity post - COVID through better real estate locations.  We've always been pickier than most in terms of the tenants we choose to curate our centers. When you couple that with the execution of the broad post - COVID property improvement plans that we talked about over the last several quarters, that higher capital outlay today will result significantly higher asset value tomorrow. Places that are fresher, more dominant, more relevant in a myriad of ways in the communities they serve for years and years to come. The value of our real estate net of capital is going up. And the prospects appear to be better than they were before COVID. But assigned lease designing for our rent store and the well-publicized supply chain issues affecting most U.S. businesses will have been manage thoughtfully and definitely in the next 18 months to move all those tends from signed lease commitments to build out operating stores, in the shortest possible time frame, at a reasonable cost. Although we're talking about a shortage of rooftop air conditioning units, or production shortages or kitchen equipment from overseas or material stuck on boats way and offload, supply-chain issues are broad and to some extent unpredictable. As a Company, we're all over it and we have been for months. Early ordering, stockpiling, problem solving, and leveraging longstanding relationships are all tools that we're using to mitigate filled out the legs. At quarter's end, our portfolio was 92.8% leased, and 90.2% occupied. Both improvements over last quarter, and the quarter before that. But a long way from being 95% lease, which we were just 3 years ago. The earnings upside from not only getting rent started in all the leasing we've done to date, but the continuation of occupancy gains to historic levels and maybe higher over the next couple of years, provides a visible and low-risk window as a strong future growth. And that's before considering the inevitable earnings growth coming from the lease up of our billion-dollar plus development and redevelopment pipeline, the cost of which are largely locked in and are very active acquisition program also will add to that. By the way, we did close on the $34 million acquisition of Twinbrooke Shopping Centre in Fairfax, Virginia in another off-market transaction during the third quarter, marking the fifth deal that we closed in 2021 and the second in Northern Virginia.  Very excited about the remerchandising and rent upside is underinvested shopping centers stable in the middle of Fairfax County. I've got to believe that the visibility of this Company is bottom line earnings growth. Coming out of COVID is on a risk-adjusted basis, one of the, if not the, most transparent in the sector. That's about all I have for my prepared comments. Let me turn it over to Dan, who will be happy to entertain your questions after that. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don. Good afternoon, everyone. Feels really good to be here discussing another quarter, where we blew away expectations. $1.51 per share of FFO represented a 7% sequential gain over a strong second quarter, 35% above 3Q last year, and with $0.23 above our expectations, which represents an 18% beat. As Don highlighted, the outperformance was broad-based, with upside coming from continued progress on collections, occupancy at leasing gains, better - than - forecasted contributions from hotel, parking, and percentage rent, faster lease -up at our developments, and another accretive off-market transaction.  While collections climbed higher to 96% in the current period, up from 94% last quarter, plus another 8 million of prior-period collection, leasing is what continues to command center stage for yet another quarter at Federal. Momentum that started during the second half of 2020 continues with a fifth consecutive quarter of well-above-average leasing volumes across the portfolio. We saw our occupied percentage surge 60 basis points in the quarter, 89.6% to 90.2%. Other strong leasing metrics to note, our small shop lease occupancy metric continued its climb upward, as it grew another 40 basis points to 86.1%, coming on top of the nearly 200 basis point gain in the second quarter. Overall, small shop is up 260 basis points year-over-year. Leasing momentum continues to be driven by strengthen our lifestyle portfolio, as we signed leases with such relevant tenants of tomorrow, names such as [Indiscernible] Jenni Kayne, American Giant, Herman Miller, Peloton, Las lab, purple, another parity location, another Nike location, our fourth this year.  And restaurants such as Slot line, Moto [Indiscernible] Astro beer hall, Gregory's coffee, and van Loon, just to name a few. Some of these names, you may not be familiar with, but trust me, you will. Office leasing continues to be a bright spot, with 224 thousand square feet of leases signed during the quarter, and subsequent to quarter-end, including the investment grade rated Choice Hotels deals by Don Highland. Comparable property growth, again, while not particularly relevant this year, continued its resurgence up 16%. Please note for those that keep track, as we expected, term fees in the quarter were down significantly to $500,000 versus $6.1 million in the third quarter of last year.  A headwind of a minus 4.2%, without it our comparable metric would have been 20%. Our remaining spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline stands at $215 million with another $50 million remaining on our property improvement initiatives across the portfolio. You may have noticed that we added a new project to our redevelopment schedule in our 8-K, a complete repositioning of Huntington shopping center, on the latter. An $80 million project which will transform a physically obsolete power center on a great piece of land, into a re-merchandised whole food anchored center.  The project is expected to achieve an incremental yield of 7%. Now, onto the balance sheet, and an update on liquidity, and leverage. For the $125 million of mortgage debt having been repaid over the last 60 days, we have no debt maturing until mid-2023. We continue to be opportunistic selling tactical amounts of common equity for ATM program on our forward sales agreements. And as a result, we maintained ample available liquidity of $1.45 billion as of quarter-end, comprised of our undrawn $1 billion revolver, roughly a $180 million of cash and $270 million of equity to be issued on our forward agreements.  Additionally, our leverage metrics continue to show marked improvement. Pro forma for our 2021 acquisitions over equity, under contract, our run-rate for net debt to EBITDA is down to 6.0 times. Pro forma for leases signed, yet not open, the figure is 5.8 times. Fixed charge coverage is backed up to 3.9 times. Our targeted leverage ratios remain in the low-to-mid 5 times for net debt EBITDA and above 4x for fixed charge coverage. We are almost there. Finally, let's turn to guidance.  Given the strong recovery we are experiencing in 2021, we will be meaningfully increasing guidance again for both this year and 2022. Taking 2021 up 7.4% from a prior range of $5.05 to $5.15 to $5.45 to $5.50 per share. This implies 21% year-over-year growth versus 2020 at the midpoint. And are taking 2022 up 6.5% from a prior range of $5.30 to $5.50 for a revised range of $5.65 to $5.85 per share. And while maybe premature, preliminary targets from our model show FFO growth in 2023, and 2024 in the 5% to 10% range. The drivers behind the improved outlook for 2021, first, a significantly stronger third quarter than previously expected. And this should continue in the fourth quarter as we increase our fourth quarter estimate to $1.36 to $1.41 per share, a 10% improvement versus previous guidance, but down from this quarter. While we again collected more rent than expected from prior periods in the third quarter, we don't expect that to repeat. Repairs and maintenance demo and other expenses are all expected at elevated levels as we continue to drive the quality of our existing portfolio, and G&A will be higher in the fourth quarter as well, given higher compensation expense. In addition, we forecast issuing a $150 million to $200 million of common equity under our forward agreements before year-end.  For 2022, the improvement in outlook is driven by strength across all facets of our business from our occupancy growth driven by the continued momentum of leasing activity, contributions from our in-process $1.2 billion development pipeline, a full-year contribution for all of our 2021 acquisitions and higher collections as we returned to pre - COVID levels. Let me try to add some color to each of these areas to provide greater transparency to a multi-year path of out-sized growth. The first driver of growth, occupancy, and leasing, which I would like to break into two components.  First, what deals are already executed. With physical occupancy at 90.2% and our lease rate at 92.8% are signed not open spread to 260 basis points for our in-place portfolio. This represents roughly $25 million of incremental total rent. The second component. What leasing demand will drive going forward? Given the strength of our leasing pipeline, getting back to 95% lease, a level we were at just 3 years ago, is certainly achievable. If you look at our current pipeline of new leasing activity for currently unoccupied space, this could add another approximately a 115 basis points the current lease percentage or $12 million of total rent upside when executed.  Please note, for every 100 basis points of occupancy gain, we see roughly $10 million in additional total rent on average. The third driver of growth, our development pipeline. At $1.2 billion of spend, we'll throw off just over $10 million of POI in 2021 for about 1%. So, the stabilized projected yield in the mid to low 6% range, it should produce $70 million to $75 million of POI when stabilized. The $60 million to $65 million of incremental POI should begin to deliver more fully in 2022, but will also be a meaningful driver of POI growth in 2023 and 2024.  Please note, as we did before COVID, next quarter, we plan to reinclude in our 8-K supplement, the disclosure detailing the ramp up of POI for each of the projects in our pipeline. The fourth driver of growth in 2022, acquisitions. as they -- as Don mentioned, the closing of Twinbrooke Shopping Centre, our fifth off-market deal of the year brings our consolidated investment to $440 million, plus $360 million on a pro rata basis with a blended going in yield of 5.5% plus a full-year of contribution, these purchases are very accretive.  Lastly, collections. Current period collections for 2021 are forecasted to finish at 95% on average, for the entire year. We are expecting that to be higher in 2022 with pre-COVID levels returning in 2023. This is expected to more than offset any falloff in prior rent collection next year. Keep in mind for every 100 basis points, a collection percentage improvement that represents almost $9 million annually.  Please note that similar to last quarter, there is no benefits assumed to our guidance in either 2021 or 2022, from switching tenants from cash back to accrual basis accounting. The combination of these primary drivers of growth supplemented by forecasted upside in other parts of our business such as parking, tell investments, percentage rent, gives us a clear and transparent path of growth, not only in 2022 but beyond into 2023 and 2024. We couldn't be happier with our market position and expect to have sector-leading FFO growth over the next few years. And with that, Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. [Operator Instructions]. [Operator Instructions]. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up per person. One moment, please while we pull the questions. Our first question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Please state your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good evening, Don. 1, it's great to see that you already are putting out '23 and '24 guidance. So, I guess it's going to be the standard thing you'll -- you're going to sandbag those and next quarter we'll see those numbers raised as well. But the bigger question here, Don, is what is actually going on asset properties at the operations everywhere that the recovery is so strong and the tenant demand is so strong? Meaning, a number of years ago, tenants were still coming to your centers, taking space.  They could see the consumer shopping at your properties. What is going on now that it's supercharged? Is it just merely that these tenants don't have the threat of the online shopping? I mean, it's just been incredible and I know I've asked this question before, but the pace of demand across retail this quarter is just mind-blowing and it just really begs the question for these retailers really just holding back before? Or is it really fleshing out of the bad credit that's allowed you guys to have better space to rent to people who are willing to pay higher rents? Don Wood : Well, first of all Alex, it's good to know that you are very predictable in terms of the first part of your statements are not a question. But the -- in terms of the bigger -- in terms of the question you're asking, it's a whole bunch of things. It's not just one thing, but certainly the notion of the amount of time that -- there are a lot of people assume certainly in our markets have not -- had not been out and had been at home and have restrictions one way or the other. I got to tell you, as you know, that gets old. And so, you would have thought -- I think you're seeing a revised -- rejuvenises if you will, low for socialization. I can tell you any restaurants, certainly in New York, that you would see you would be -- you can't even get a reservation. And we're seeing that same thing throughout our properties. So, people want to be out. Tenants are upgrading their space and having the ability. Obviously, I'm talking at our portfolio primarily, but having the ability to get into better real estate, in a portfolio that was as low as 89% is some-odd percent leased. That's just rare as it gets perfect. And so, the ability to actually have a chance to upgrade is -- it's a huge driver as we've been talking about all the way through. From a consumer perspective, you've certainly got the demand.  From a real estate perspective, the tenant perspective, you certainly have the demand, and then the other side of it is -- and this surprise me. You can call it sandbagging or whatever, but it's surprised me that we have not lost more tenants over the past 6 or 8 months in 2021. The notion of tenants holding on to their properties and finding a way to make it through and not wanting to lose their superior positions from real estate was greater than we expected. So, the combination of not losing them, having availability from the 89% coming back up, and the strong consumer demand, you put those 3 things together. And I think you've got the bulk of the answer to your question. And we have a say and we don't see a change to that, at this point. That's continuing strong in an innovative way. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second is on Office, you had a win with Choice Hotels and I think you mentioned Santana West. We all hear the low return of Office numbers and yet all the Office companies talk about the really strong leasing that's going on. Clearly, you're seeing that in demand for your different mixed-use project. So, as you look out over the next 12 months, how many new office projects do you think you could start based on the conversations that you're having today, is it just 1 or 2? Or you think you can easily balance 4, 5 or 6 buildings to go? Don Wood : No, no. No, Alex. It's the trice building. It's one. For us, first of all, just get it all in perspective. There is Assembly Row with office Pike & Rose, with office potential opportunities and it's Santana Row. In all 3 markets, the demand is there. The Santana West is a different kettle of fish because it's one big building that we're looking for one big tenant to take the whole thing. At Assembly, the -- what has happened to the building that was Puma and just boom up forever has been astonishing in the past period of time. There you may see us able to announce another building next year.  We're working it hard right now. But to your point, that demand could mean that there's a faster route to the next building. In terms of Pike & Rose, we certainly didn't expect to be announcing another office building here, as you know, building we just moved into. We were the only tenants in here on August 10th of 2020. The notion that this building is 90% or 89, whatever it is, percent lease, and our conversations with Choice, who originally started about this building, was such that we could not accommodate them.  We needed, if we wanted to do that deal, to started another building. It's astonishing. And I don't think this is even handed throughout the country. Obviously, there's a whole question of what happens to office-based as in terms of needs going forward over the next decade. But I know if you're in an amenity rich environment with new buildings in places like where we are. I know you are in the catbird seat. Because I'm seeing it in terms of the deals we're doing. So, 1, maybe 2 buildings over the next year. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thank you, Don. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Great, thanks. I just -- the acquisitions in your acquisition pipeline, are these still deals that you originated in 2020, or are they deals that you struck up since '21 started? And how are you doing with the more competitive cap rates? Don Wood : Yeah, the -- so everything we've announced to this date were pre - COVID negotiated deals, or deals that started in their negotiation. A pre -COVID often got renegotiated during COVID and allowed us to close, to me, 5 of the best acquisitions we've ever done at this Company. Now, going forward, you bet it's different, because it's not back in a big way. I'm going to let Jeff give you his perspective of where that road leads. Doesn't mean we can't find them, but it's certainly harder than it was to be able to get those 5 deals done during COVID, did it? Jeff Berkes : Yes. Craig, as you probably know the market, like Don said, has snap back very quickly. And it is very active, deals, institutional quality, first-ranked deals in the markets where we do business are now 4.5 to 5 cap deals. So very aggressive pricing. We have a pretty strong pipeline. Our acquisitions teams are busy.  Nothing real material to talk about yet, but we've got some stuff on the Verizon we're excited about and maybe next quarter or 2 we will be able to talk more about it. But the market just picked up very, very significantly and we're obviously happy to see that, but being disciplined and differentiating ourselves by trying to get stuff before it comes to market and put our money into assets that we think we have a reasonable chance to redevelop and grow income stream over time. Don Wood : And Craig, the only thing I just want to add to that is it's a different perspective when you're trying to do what Jeff is talking about here, when you also have the development pipeline that's already been spent creating inevitable future growth, Jeff Berkes : when you also have a portfolio that was hit harder during COVID and therefore has more room to grow to get back to a stabilized occupancy. So, there are other levers, if you will, to flow that continue the growth. And frankly, any acquisitions are the cherry on top of an already very robust growth profile. Craig Schmidt : Right. And then just on the other arm of external growth, maybe you could talk about Huntington. And do you already have anchor lined up to take the newly constructed anchor and small shops space? Don Wood : Yeah, let's talk about Huntington. First of all, I think Simon did an amazing job, amazing job at the adjacent Walt Whitman Mall to Huntington. They did -- they just did a great job bringing the entire profile of that product up to what that market frankly deserves. That -- but we would've liked to have done something similar at Huntington, but we have leases in place which are restricted.  Well, COVID took care of that, didn't it? And so, the notion of being able, therefore, to go and lock in Whole Foods as our anchor, which we have, is a game changer. And so now the future of Huntington, which will marry up very nicely to a brand-new Whitman mall adjacent to it, with a Whole Foods anchored center, on that piece of land, I mean, it's gold. Give us a couple of years to get it built out and done, and that'll be another avenue for future growth for Federal. Craig Schmidt : Yes. It seems like you're laying the groundwork for an extended period of above average growth, given that this would open in 2024. Don Wood : It's certainly feels like it, Greg, it certainly feels like. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Katy Mcconnell of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Katy Mcconnell : Thank you. I Just had another one on the new office plans for Pike & Rose. I'm wondering if you can provide some context around what you're expecting from a cost perspective? And just based on leasing progress to date would you expect somewhere close to the office portion of Phase 3? Don Wood : It's a good question, Katie. And so, we are pretty darn good shape in locking up our costs, but we're not all the way there yet. Basically, at the end of the day, we should be able to yield as fix, and potentially better on the building. The building will be close to $200 million to build, hopefully not that high, but somewhere around that spot. And so, what it does, and that's a fully loaded 6, to the extent you talked about incremental will be higher. We're really just thrilled to be able to take what we've done and capitalize on it. I couldn't imagine starting that in a place that wasn't already very established with the amenity that's already here. Katy Mcconnell : Okay. Great. And then just start on the results and we saw a big confident straight-line this quarter. I'm curious if you've started converting any of your cash basis tenants back to accrual this quarter? And how should we think about the run rate straight line going into 2022? It's probably going to be lumpy. Dan Guglielmone : It will be lumpy, but it should grow with all the office leasing that we're doing. The big driver was boomer this quarter, which is still in a free rent period. But as we do more and more office leasing, that's going to push to our straight-line rent increasing, and that should increase next quarter and into 2022. And no changes to how we're assessing cash to accrual. Katy Mcconnell : Okay great, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, good evening, everyone. How are you doing? Don Wood : Hi, Derek. Derek Johnston : Have any of the big 3 master mixed-use developments recovered more briskly? Are there any leading or notable laggards? And if so, does that bode well for a snap-back in demand clearly for the laggard in the coming quarters or would you describe leasing demand as being relatively balanced across the big 3? Don Wood : I would. I would say it's balanced now. And all 3 of them, they got hurt a lot more obviously than the essential base properties throughout the portfolio. And so those 3 still are not back to where they are going to be or where we want them at all. So yes, there is outside growth at those properties because as you know -- I mean, the office leasing is just one component of what we're seeing. And then you can imagine what it's doing to the retail side, in terms of the leasing that's coming to fill space that hadn't been there before. That growth will continue and we will take all of 2022, the variant in the 2023 where you'll continue to see that out-sized growth from those 3 properties space.  They are special properties now. That is where people want to be. It's also, as you can imagine, where people want to live. And so, I think we're like 97% leased at us at the residential component of those assets. Certainly, we have some restrictions in the jurisdictions that they're in on the ability to increase rents in the case of Montgomery County, and evict in the case of Summerville and Massachusetts. But overall, when you sit and you think about those, they were the places of choice. And so, we see some real good long-term growth on that component, of those mixed-use properties also. Derek Johnston : Oh, okay great. And to -- just back to the off-market COVID era acquisitions, especially the 4 big ones prior to Twinbrooke or even including Twinbrooke. With private markets, which we've discussed being competitive and cap rates compressing, where do you feel those 4 assets would trade if they were being marketed today versus in the throes of the pandemic or how much value do you think is already been harvested in your view? Don Wood : Significant. And Jeff and I argue about this, cause it's all conjecture, right? Who knows? But when you look at what things are trading at, all the way through, I'm thinking 15%, maybe 20% more? Big numbers. Derek Johnston : Great guys, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Greg Mcginniss of Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg Mcginniss : Hey, good evening. So, Dan, and I apologize, I know you've covered some of this already. Could you please just outline the one-time items in Q3 results or changes expected into Q4? And then what are the base assumptions that underlie future guidance? And especially if you could just touch on the expected cadence of occupancy recovery, that'd be pretty appreciated. Thank you. Dan Guglielmone : Sure. I mean, the big items for next quarter is as I mentioned, a little higher expenses of property level of repairs and maintenance, demo, and other expenses. I don't expect prior period meant to be as strong consistently, a bit poor forecasters of prior period rents. I think at some point that's going to fall off and I think this quarter feels like it probably is the quarter that has happened. I think we will be issuing and we plan to be issuing about a $150 million to $200 million of equity in the quarter, which will call some drag.  And then G&A is expected to be a bit higher due to compensation expenses. So those are the main drivers that take us all Focal 151 that we had this quarter. And then in terms of cadence of occupancy, I think next year, like by year-end, we should see continued growth in our occupancy percentage from the 90.2 where it is today, probably somewhere between 90.5 and 91, in that range. And then over the course, we'll be somewhere -- I think we should get into the 92s by year-end 2022. So somewhere between 92% and 93% is probably somewhere in that range is the cadence on occupancy. Greg Mcginniss : Okay. Great, thanks. And then thinking about lease structure post-pandemic, have there been any changes in these terms or needs from retailers and office tenants as we talk to them today? Wendy Seher : On the retail side, Greg, I don't see any changes. I did when we were in the middle of COVID, and as we're coming out, I see that we're in a strong position to negotiate what I call real deals and also participate in some cases in a percentage override. So, no, I think that we're in a strong position to continue to negotiate strong contracts for the future. Greg Mcginniss : And on the office side, have you've seen any changes? Don Wood : Yeah, activity. No, I like the way Wendy put it, Greg, they are real deals. And so, yeah there's a lot of capital, there is a lot of capital on all deals today and that is a trend that continues, but the rent pays for it. And so, when you look at it net of capital, these are good deals. Greg Mcginniss : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Thanks for the time. Just curious on a couple of the hot topic items. One, inflation and two supply-chain issues. What impacts they are having? Do you expect the supply chain issues to have the lease versus occupied spread right now? Further before contracts given maybe some delays in getting permits and/or parks, you mentioned HVAC units and I'm just curious on how you see inflation impacting the profitability of your tenants. In particular, I'm curious about your thoughts on the grocers. Don Wood : There's a lot to unpack in there. And certainly, as I tried to hit in the prepared remarks, the supply chain issues are so broad that yeah, they got to be managed really tightly, and there is absolutely risk there. And so, when you take a -- you go from lease to actually getting a tenant opened, we had better be proactive. And we have been extremely proactive about whether it be allowing for a larger lead time, whether it be moving ahead with work effectively before everything is all tied up.  A big one and I've -- Wendy mentions this all the time, and that's how I know it must be pervasive, is using our relationships with our tenant to be able to divide up work for who has the best leverage in a situation to get the appropriate supplies, or to trade some things out, has been really effective. So, I am certainly not expecting us to have significant delays throughout the year, there will certainly be example where we do, there will be other examples where we'll beat it.  But it does -- but your point is important. It has to be a very proactive and creative way to deal with something that is, in some respects, uncontrollable. So, we'll see how that plays out, so far so good. And then on the costs, really good thing that the biggest piece of our development pipeline is already locked in and is -- even as I sit here on 909 Rose, our office building here, this building was built with 2018 money. And even though there's been a delay and has taken longer to effectively get it leased up.  Now that it has, those deals are really good deals on 2018 money. And so, this will work out just fine same way at Santana, same way up in assembly. On a new stuff, we got a lock in early, best we can. Lock in price escalation, we got to leverage buying power with bulk purchases. We have the sole source alternate suppliers. It's all part of a very proactive and tightly controlled development organization. I think we're really good at. Juan Sanabria : Thanks, Don. And then just my follow-up would just be on cap rates for acquisitions, you're looking at -- you mentioned in the release that you're aggressively looking for opportunities. Should we think of those as opportunities for those mid to high 4s for stabilized assets or are you targeting more redevelopment opportunities that maybe have some potential for you guys to add value with your platform and or leasing expertise? Just curious on how we should be thinking about that going forward. Don Wood : I think you're really need to think about it from an IRR perspective. Because going in cap rates today are so -- you don't even know what the NOI or the POI is being captives when people talk about cap rates the way they are. Because of the disruptions of COVID, because of the assumptions being made about releasing and things like that. You have to dig deeper when somebody gives you a cap rate. What -- so from our perspective, we don't say no to something at a 4 or say yes to something at a 6 based on that cap rate, we are looking at where we can create value in that real estate.  And honestly, looking at IRR, with IRR assumptions. So, to the extent our IRR is over and above 150 basis points of our cost of capital as we define it, we like that deal. Sometimes 100 basis points over, sometimes 200 basis points over. We look at our IRR in a I'm very honest, sober way because I think if you only think about it in cap rate perspective, you miss the opportunities of the both. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good evening, Don, Dan. Thanks for taking my question. Your occupied percentage grew 50, 60 basis points sequentially, but lease occupancy grew a bit less than that sequentially. So, can you help bridge the gap between all the strong commentary about what you're seeing in retail leasing and how that's reflected in your lease percentage? And then also is 200,000 square feet to 250,000 square feet of new leases the right piece to expect going forward? Dan Guglielmone : With regards to the lease percentage being a little slower, it was actually reversed the last quarter where our lease percentage was up significantly by 90 basis points, something like that. Look, it's quarter-to-quarter, look for the trends. We see trends continuing upwards on our lease percentage, quarter-over-quarter, some quarters may be a little slower.  We had some tenants left. We took some space back. There were some issues that came up this quarter that put a little bit of a damper on our lease percentage momentum. But we would expect given the leasing activity that we have and the leasing activity in unoccupied space that we see, we should see -- that should resume to a better than basis point increase that you saw this quarter. I think one thing to comment, Don, is that while our occupied percentage grew 60 basis points, I don't think we had any impact. We got rent started, and it was I think a strong quarter for that in terms of getting tenants in, getting them rent-paying. And that's going to ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. Don't look at any one particular quarter, look at the trends over time. And I think you see looking backwards, the trends have been very positive than I think that going forward we should expect that as well. Michael Goldsmith : That's really helpful. And then on longer-term question. Don, you've talked a lot about reaching $7 a share in FFO over the past several calls in this updated guidance. If you take the high end of '22 numbers and you get that 10% growth in '23 and '24, you're going to get there. So, what has to go right in order for you to get their kind of by the end of 2024? Don Wood : What's happening now. The single biggest thing that's going to impact the timing of the trajectory is the lease up of the Santana West building in California. As I've said, that's an on-off switch. Or hopefully it's an on-off switch because it's a we're looking for a single tenant user the building, at least the majority of the building.  So, the timing of that creates variability in that trajectory. And the second thing is, I am very confident this is going to be a 95% leased portfolio. That trajectory of that 95, we have to see. To the extent that is quicker will get the seventh faster to the extended slower. We'll get it to its lower. But basically, what we're seeing happening now, the continuation of that will get you there. I hope that's helpful. Michael Goldsmith : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, there. I guess my first question is on capital allocation. You talked a lot about the cap rate compression in the market seeing grocer deals in the 4.5%, 5%, I guess I'm curious how you think about incremental dispositions in the face of this strength to fund some of your external growth pursuits? And how that maybe you're thinking about your stock as currency with implied cap here in the high 4% range? Jeff Berkes : On the disposition side of things, we do what we always do and come for the portfolio and if those assets aren't keeping up with the growth that we've projected for the rest of the portfolio, we look at selling them and we're actively in that process right now. Again, nothing to talk about on this call, but we always look at peeling off a portion of the portfolio and that's scheduling $100 million or so every year, and we're in that process right now. Don Wood : And Haendel, just to make the point, we expect stock rates go up, and accordingly when you're looking at capital allocation, how you're going to fund our growth, whether that's with those dispositions or whether it's with equity or, you know we take a balanced approach. So, you should expect some dispositions and taking advantage of the market that is there today.  As Danny said, you should expect some of the forward contracts that we've taken to be issued all on a modest basis, all with a balanced approach to that. I'm not surprising you with one way to fund this Company, but with that we're using all the tools we got available. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And then I don't know if I missed this, you talked about the $25 million of signed, but not leased rent. Did you talk about what proportion of that will likely hit or is embedded in your 2022 guidance? I'm looking at [Indiscernible] Don Wood : A big chunk of that number will hit in 22? I would say that 90% of the income from those leases, will happen in the fourth quarter, and over the balance of 2022. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. [Indiscernible] Don Wood : It turns the cadence. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Percentage rents if I could sneak one more in here, I guess how they performed in the quarter perspectives are big, a pickup versus prior quarters. Any thoughts on that into year-end here? Don Wood : Yes, no. Strong and significantly better than we thought. There\u2019re 2 components to it. First, is there are -- there is percentage rent on deals that were not adjusted during COVID. They have natural or unnatural breakpoints betting on how it contracts its RIN and sales have been high. So just there's a natural component to percentage rent that is better than the others. And then as I think we talked about in the past, there have been -- some of our COVID deals effectively traded out; fixed rent for a low great point of percentage rent, so that we were sharing the recovery, if you will, with the prospective tenants. The recovery has been stronger. And so, percentage rent on those COVID adjusted deals were higher. So, I think what we have $4.9 million in the quarter. When you think about $5 million, will be 5 million times 4, $20 million for the year? No, it won't. This was -- it was a really good quarter and some of those deals in percentage rent will convert back to fixed rent deal. Just by the very nature of the contract, it won't be as strong in that particular number going forward. But I am hopeful that's helpful. In either case, it's because sales were higher than we thought they would be. Haendel St. Juste: No, I understood. Understood. And certainly, appreciate the color on the sales. The adjustments you made in the leases, is that going to be for the next year, 2 years, or when do they go back to more traditional? Don Wood : Most of them are done in '22, I think 1 or 2 will make their way into '23. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Thank you. Don Wood : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truest. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks, Don. Good evening. Just going back to your acquisition. Your basis value per square foot was pretty low and I know that was negotiated during COVID, but even if you market to market is still pretty low basis, so I was just curious, I know you could mention IRR, but what's the real estate strategy behind your acquisition? Jeff Berkes : Hey, Ki, it's Jeff. It's a little different, of course, or maybe a lot different than a couple of cases on the group of properties that we bought. But you know us and you know us well, and we're always looking to the highest and best use of the real estate. So, in a couple of those centers, it's relatively simple; cleaning them up and doing a better job on leasing, including in extent to one case potentially having a better grocery anchor.  There\u2019re some identification opportunities for a couple of the properties for sure, and then gross bond is a little bit of a blank slate that we need to think through and figure out what we're going to do with all leases about property coming up in 2025 and we're in that process.  The goal there is to narrow the options by the end of the year, and have some clear direction at some point in 2022, but we're not quite there yet. As you know, our view is always buying this piece of land we can buy, in terms of location and isolation, density, incomes, road network, all that gets up. And then put on that piece of land what the market demands and generate as much rent as possible one. That's why we bought those deals. They will have those characteristics and it's a little bit different than each one that, that's what we'll be doing. Don Wood : But you are right. Jeff Berkes : And they'll leave some good growth. We're really happy with the growth profile than what we bought the last year. Don Wood : You are right, keeping to look at one of the components we look at, and that's price per acre. Because at the end of the day, what you get in at, will help determine what it is that you can make work, in terms highest and best use. And so, when you look at something like Grossmont, price per acre is really important to us because we're not sure of exactly which way we can go. But because of a price we've got in it, we've got multiple ways to go.  And that's when you really think about creating value it really often comes down to the flexibility. To show we have an idea, and then often something gets in the way of that idea; whether your choices. And so, I don't want to say that price per acre is not important. It's really important. And obviously, when you get the highest and best use, you try to figure out what your IRR will be as you go through. That going in price is probably the most important factor in determining what it is that you can do. Ki Bin Kim : Yeah. Thanks for that color. And it is interesting because you're seeing different reasons, take different strategies and -- it'll be dumb to say just low basis is good. Obviously want to smart deals and put smart capital to work. But it is something I noticed that your basis is just low on a lot of these deals. Anyway, on second question on development, what is the likelihood of adding a 4th project to your big 3? And does the fact that just the cost to develop is so high, and if you do it and get started then you're basically locking in a higher rent that you need to justify it. Does that hold you back from adding a 4th grand project? Don Wood : Well, so I would say the chance of having a big 4, a 4th project, are less than 50-50. They're not 0, they're not even 20%, but it's less than 50-50, and there's a number of reasons for that. The single biggest reason is everything has to be looked at through our risk-adjusted prism. And when you look at the big 3, it's funny because we've been doing the big 3 for so long, everybody loves to say, Okay, what's the next? But if you work here and you would try to figure out where you want to put capital incrementally to create the most value. Time and time again, you will come down to the big 3 because we're not close to being done. And so, the notion of adding incremental building to Santana Row, Pike & Rose, and Assembly Row, just kills the comparison with starting another mixed-use property that will take two decades to do. It always comes down to capital allocation and where your alternatives are and what the smartest thing to do is. And then I think the mistake that some investors and analysts make are underestimating the level of growth and capital that is still yet to come at the Big Three, some 10, 15, the case of Santana, 20 years later. Ki Bin Kim : Got it. Thank you for color. Operator : Our next question is from Paulina Rojas-Schmidt of Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: Good evening. Your tenant collectability impact includes $5 million in rent abatements. I'm curious, what type of tenants are still receiving these abatements? Then how much longer do you think they will need it? And 3, are these really rent abatements or these are deferrals that you are writing off? Dan Guglielmone : I mean, deferrals that you're write off are abatements. But I mean, different parts of the deals that Don alluded to where we restructured and we lowered the rent for a period of time, and then would participate through participating rent based on sales. Effectively, whatever demunition from the contractual rents to the new floor rent is considered an abatement.  To the extent that you write off previously negotiated deferrals, that's an abatement. Really where the abatements are occurring, we have restaurants. We still have that because a lot of our deals that were restructured like that because of the limits on their capacity constraints during COVID and so forth. Don Wood : Paulina, I want to say one thing about that right now. You asked a question; how long do you think they'll need it? That's irrelevant because these are deals that were cut. They were cut in the middle of COVID. They were cut to expire with expiration dates at some point either in 2021 or in 2022, and a couple just because negotiating got us to 2023. They actually don't need it any longer. And that's why you see percentage rent the way you see it, middle of setting that abatement.  And it was smart that we were able to switch off an abatement for a fixed rent for percentage rent because we are getting paid. It's just in a different line than you see it there. I just want to make sure you know. These are contracts that were agreed to previously that have sunset dates on them. The end of this year, some in '22 and a couple in '23. That number will bill -- burn down over the course of 2022. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: That's very helpful, I wasn't fully aware of that. And then are you able to share the same corporate NOI growth implied in your FFO guidance for next year, even if it's a wide range, it will be helpful. Dan Guglielmone : Yeah, we're going to provide that detailed, comprehensive assumptions in our guidance for next year. Just guessing it's probably in and around 3% for next year. This year while we don't think it's relevant, should come in in double-digits, low double-digits blended for the year. But I think this year it's somewhat irrelevant. Next year we'll give you a detail ed assumption on same -- comparable property growth on the February call. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Hi. A couple of quick ones here. How much quarterly hotel and parking NOI are you guys getting today? And what do you see is a more normalized level for that? Dan Guglielmone : Hang on, Mike, that's bandwidth. Mike Mueller : While scrambling, the second one was -- Dan Guglielmone : Let's go one question at a time. I'm not -- you're going to get them. Mike Mueller : Sure. Dan Guglielmone : Help me out here. It's roughly the run rate right now, parking income is about $2.5 million a quarter. And given that -- that should stay -- that's probably at about 70% to 75% of a stabilized run rate. And then hotels are not going to contribute this year. And so, we should see that it's only gravy as they increase. We've seen the scale in the list. Couple of months, kind of a real resurgence in our occupancy levels at the 3 hotels that we have. So, we're really optimistic that they will start to contribute in '22 and certainly in '23 and '24 portfolios. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. And then, Dan, when you were talking to you about prior-period rents not recurring, was that a comment when you're talking about 2021 guidance in 2022, you're not booking anything at the same level as to what you saw in 2023 or you just have 0 in for prior period on everything going forward? Dan Guglielmone : I don't have 0. No, I will give some guidance on 2022 in February. This year, we've been pretty consistently in the $7 million to $10 million range. Started out high in the third quarter of last year, and it's been about $7 million to $8 million the last 3 quarters. I don't think we can sustain that. So that should start coming down just based upon on what's outstanding in terms of our build accounts receivable. And so, it should come down pretty meaningfully, certainly in 2022 from the levels we've had this year. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi. Just have one question. Do you have big picture thoughts on how companies are utilizing office space differently coming out of COVID, based on what you're seeing in your own portfolio, or any anecdotes to share? Don Wood : You know Linda, all I would say is -- and I just did an interview for the Washington Business Journal around the Choice deal. And the -- we are seeing pretty consistently in our places and again, it's a small sample size. But most people are looking for less space. And from where they are to where they're going. And I guess I'm not saying anything so eye-opening there. But it's been pretty consistent and equally consistent is obviously the ones we're talking to are putting a very high-value on the amenity base environment in buildings that are brand-new. And so, when you put those two things together, we're not getting frankly, the rent pressure, partly because I think it's -- the total rent that they're paying is not more than they were paying before because they are taking less space. And so interestingly, the biggest component of where they're going, and almost all have some kind of a hybrid work model associated with is that partly allows them to take less of space. But they're unyielding with respect to what amenity base means, and the frankly newness of the building. Linda Tsai : Do they also want shorter lease terms too? Don Wood : No. And no cases, frankly. Linda Tsai : Thank you. Don Wood : But again, just remember Linda, you're not talking to a guy with a lot of office knowledge throughout the country. We're talking about really San Jose, California, here in outside of Washington D.C., and outside of Boston, and that's it. Linda Tsai : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Tammi Fique of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Tammi Fique : Thank you. Good evening. I'm just wondering in terms of the acquisitions in the pipeline, I'm wondering if you could talk about where you are looking to expand geographically going forward. Particularly given the recent acquisitions in Phoenix. And then as a follow-up, do you think that there is an advantage to geographic portfolio concentrations in your business, where given that you have been pretty concentrated historically? Thank you. Jeff Berkes : Yeah, let me try and start with the end of your question first Tammi, and if I don't get all of it, tell me what I missed. Look, we've said a number of times we really like the markets that we're in, and we see great benefit from having a concentration in each of those markets. We think that helps us see more deals on the acquisition side of our business going forward, and it certainly puts us in a much better position when we're talking to tenants. Every one of our leasing people would tell you that so being concentrated in a market is important. So certainly, now that we're in the greater Phoenix Metropolitan area, we're going to want to grow in Greater Phoenix and get that same concentration that we have in our other target markets.  So, expect to see that. I think we've mentioned on some prior calls that we are looking at a couple of new markets, doing our research, making sure we're identifying where in those markets we want to be in. We're working on deals in those markets. Whether they happen or not, I don't know. It's too soon to say. But. don't be surprised if we pick another a couple of markets to be in. The share of the -- characteristics of the markets we're already in, which is barriers to entry and good education and income, and the population density levels, and properties where we think over time we can grow the income stream and add value. That's what we do. Don Wood : Tammi, I just want to add that something what Jeff said, which I couldn't agree with more all way through. You can't really -- you cannot underestimate that when you're a player in a market, how prospective sellers, or people that are not even sellers, but might be sellers, will view you, how they'll come to you? How you'll see things that you wouldn't see? It's so different than just owning one or two properties in a very wide place because obviously, our business -- this business is local.  And the best example we have that just happened is effectively what's going on in Phoenix. I mean, we are talking -- the inbound questions along with our own work in Phoenix has quadrupled from what it would have been when -- if we had just bought 1 or 2 very small properties. By owning Camelback Colonnade, we're a player. It's well-known. And what -- you can't underestimate how that can lead to more work. And certainly, on the retailer side and on the operational side, you get your obvious efficiencies and disproportionate level of play. We've seen that in Washington, DC, in suburban Maryland forever. We're now starting to see it in Northern Virginia. because we've made such a play there. There's no doubt in my mind that concentration is a really big plus in this business. And no more so than on the acquisition side. Tammi Fique : Great. Thank you for that perspective. And then I guess just following up on collections question, just to be clear. You expect a majority of those tenants to start paying full rent again and not get results during move-outs. Is that the right way to think about it? Dan Guglielmone : Can you repeat that again? You flooded in and out. Tammi Fique : Sorry about that. I was just saying on the collections question, I just wanted to be sure it was clear, that you expect a majority of the tenants in that 4% number to start paying full rent again and not get resolved through move-outs. Is that correct? Don Wood : I think some will be resolved. I think some will be kicked out. Right. We're down to the last 3% to 4% of tenants, and we are obviously have taken a much stronger position with them. We are not in COVID as an economy anywhere near the extent we were obviously. And so, to the extent those businesses can survive in the existing business and going forward, maybe they don't belong here. A nd so we're taking a harder line on that side. With respect to the balance. We certainly expect to get paid and will. I'm not -- I don't -- the difference between 96% and 99.3%, I don't know whether it's 1/2 and 1/2of those choices or 2/3 and 1/3, but it's something like that. Tammi Fique : Okay, great. Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Mcconnell of Citi. Please proceed with your question. Don Wood : Are we going around [Indiscernible]? Michael Bilerman : Hey, Don, Q - Michael Bilerman. Don Wood : [Indiscernible] Michael Bilerman : Why are you laughing? Don Wood : So, we started with Katy Mcconnell. We ended with Katy Mcconnell, but it's not Katy Mcconnell. So, I thought -- Michael Bilerman : No. Don Wood : I thought we're going around the circle again, but no, sir, what can I do for you? Michael Bilerman : I'm not going to ask you for drivers of 2023 and 2024 guidance. So, don't worry about that, but you did give us '21 and '22. So, I really appreciate that you guys came around and provided that to the investment community. So, thank you. I wanted to ask 2 questions.  One, just one on Summer Ville. Joe has put out some revised and updated plans for what he wants to see at Assembly, I guess how close could we be to that next phase and incorporating the power center into a larger project? And I know you talked about the big 3, the gifts that keep on giving, it feels like this is closer now, but I wanted to get your sense of where things stand. Don Wood : I don't think that the power center conversion to Assembly Row 9.0 or wherever it would be at that point is imminent, so I don't want you to think about it that way. It is obvious when you think about the long -term highest and best use of any piece of property, given what's happened at Assembly Row. And eventually, one day there should be intensification on the power center site. But it is years and years away. I don't -- heck, you won't pay me for '23 for Pete's sake, never mind whenever that's going to happen at that asset. But forgetting about that, look at the rest of Assembly Row.  Look at the space between Partners HealthCare and our existing property and what happens to them. And it is -- we are looking very hard at life sciences sale, as you can imagine. And to the extent we can get the economics to make some sense at all. Obviously construction costs are the biggest hurdle in that. But given what's happened to the adjacent properties, it's really clear to us that the assembly site at -- in Somerville, is going to be a life sciences site at some point. Whether it's just the adjacencies or whether it includes us, will depend on whether we can make the numbers work or not. But that you should -- that is far more imminent certainly than the power center site. Michael Bilerman : And then just thinking about -- trigger over your enthusiasm, I don't want to curb your enthusiasm at all, but I guess how do you sit back? It's been a pretty strange 2 years. And so how are you able to distinguish that all the things that are happening now are not just sort of a little bit of a catch-up, from just being out of the market for a while? And not taking what's happening right now on all the leasing and activity and everyone's excited and we're getting back out and we're having meals and dinners and bar mitzvahs and weddings. How do you not take it to not get ahead of yourself in terms of where it goes? Don Wood : I love that question, man, because you're basically talking to a very conservative guy. In terms of those, I worry about everything going forward all the time. In this case the thing that gives me confidence, and it's a lot of confidence, is I am sure that what we own and where it is, is really valuable. And so, it's like the office side, we may be over office in this country now. We talked about being over retail wherever, we may be over office.  But Federal Realty is it, because where we have that office and what is being built in terms of that office, if there's any office at all. It's going to be -- That demand is going to be at places like this that we own. I feel the same way on the retail. And so, where you hear confidence from me, you don't hear confidence that everything is great in the world is going to stay great in the world. I just know on a relative basis, whatever is happening, we've got the right products. And that's where my -- that's where my confidence comes from. Michael Bilerman : That makes sense. Perfect product. Well, thanks for the time and speak to you next week. Don Wood : Thanks, Mike. Talk to you soon. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Ennes for closing remarks. Mike Ennes : Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with those attending NAREIT next week. Have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to your host, Ms. Leah Brady. Thank you, ma\u2019am. You may begin. Leah Brady : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call maybe deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty\u2019s future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued tonight, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our conference call tonight will be limited to 75 minutes. We finally ask that you to limit yourself to one question during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have additional questions, please re-queue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin the discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thank you, Leah and congratulations to you on your promotion to Vice President of Investor Relations this month. Really well deserved and we are sure lucky to have you. Well, good afternoon, everybody. What makes Federal\u2019s business plan so different is our multifaceted approach to capitalize on these best located, best tenanted retail properties with a laser focus on bottom line earnings growth, 104 individual assets with a proverbial toolbox filled with numerous ways of achieving that goal for years to come. Took a global pandemic to knock us off our horse for a time, but we are back up and we are riding high. 2021 was the first step, where each quarter throughout the year exceeded our constantly upwardly revised expectations. That trend continued in the fourth quarter, with FFO per share of $1.47 handily beating our forecast, and of course, last year. The shining star of the business continues to be leasing as it\u2019s been a whole year, but it was taken to new levels in the fourth quarter. I need to put this into context, so bear with me for a minute. First, on a company-wide basis in the fourth quarter, we signed 149 commercial leases, that is retail and office but not including residential leases, which itself was really strong, for nearly 900,000 square feet of space. That includes renewals of existing tenants, along with space that here sits vacant today, is expected to be vacant in the coming months or as for new buildings currently under construction or just completed. That\u2019s an annual base rent commitment of nearly $35 million. Consider that over the last 10 years, an average quarter\u2019s outlook produced about 110,000 commercial \u2013 110 commercial leases and 500,000 square feet. That means that in this quarter, we did 35% more deals or 80% more GLA than average. This is very strong quarterly volume even in a year where each previous quarter seemed to set some sort of record. And while I don\u2019t think that those fourth quarter levels are regularly repeatable, our leasing pipeline suggests that they will remain above historical averages for the foreseeable future. For the full year 2021, we did 573 commercial leases for 2.9 million square feet and an annual rent commitment of $116 million. These activity levels are unprecedented over the very long history of this company. But this leasing volume is particularly important because it provides strong validation at the very diversified product type that we own and are creating very highly sought after. And the leasing is broad-based. It\u2019s the single biggest reason that I believe Federal Realty is better positioned post-COVID than we were before. Let me breakdown the quarter numbers a little bit more. I think you will see what I mean. Of the 149 commercial leases signed, 116 of them or nearly 600,000 square feet were for comparable space, one where a tenant previously operated from. Those leases were written at an average rent of $34.34, 6% higher than the tenants they replaced. Another 9 leases or 22,000 square feet were written for non-comparable space at an average rent per foot of $43.53 at places like Assembly Row Phase 3, CocoWalk and Camelback Colonnade in Phoenix. But it\u2019s the remaining 24 leases or 277,000 square feet at net rent of $48.52 that really is a strong positive differentiator to our business plan. It\u2019s the office leasing at our long-established mixed-use communities in this quarter, primarily at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose. Now look, I certainly realized that general office leasing does not evolve right now for good reason, given the macro levels of uncertainty surrounding back-to-work policies. But not all office space is created equal and it has become clearer and clearer with each quarter and each month that passes that the new Class A office product that we own or are building at 5 of our amenity-rich mixed use communities is in extremely high demand and commanding rents that are clearly additive to both earnings and value. Each of those 5 are well-established retail locations already and the office component is in expansion, building on the success of the retail. They are Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, Bethesda Row, Santana Row and CocoWalk. That\u2019s it. Deals with a myriad of companies and lots of different industries, headlined by our lease with Choice Hotels for their new world headquarters at Pike & Rose are just the latest examples of company choosing our building as the product of choice, no pun intended for the future. Those companies are joining others like Puma, Avalon Bay, NetApp, Bank of America and Splunk in helping to create long-term sustainable communities in our portfolios in Somerville, Massachusetts, Montgomery County, Maryland, Silicon Valley and Miami. And check this out. While 197,000 feet of the 277,000 feet done in the quarter was primarily at newly constructed buildings at Assembly and Pike & Rose, the remaining 80,000 was for comparable space at a positive 23% rollover. That strong rollover was largely driven by our first renewal and expansion at 450 Artisan Way at Assembly Row, the 100,000 square foot office building built as part of Phase 1. That rent went from a blended sub-$30 triple net rent to the mid-40s triple net. Pretty good data point of the longer term office upside that exists at well executed, well-amenitized mixed use communities in first-tier suburbs. As I said and firmly believe all office opportunities are not created equal. And while we don\u2019t have anything to announce on this call at Santana West, there is serious interest from a number of substantial tenants where we are making some very good progress. And by the way, take a look at the occupancy gains we are making on the retail portfolio portfolio-wide, which are equally impressed. At year end, we are 93.6% leased and 91.1% occupied. That\u2019s an 80 basis point leased and a 90 basis point occupied pickup in just 3 months, impressive for sure, but still a ways to go to get to our 95% plus historical bogie. Okay. So what about the Omicron impact? Well, as you would expect, there is little impact in the fourth quarter as the variant spread didn\u2019t take hold until late December and January. And what the impact will be on 2022 has yet to play out. But thus far in 2022, it feels like across the board, shoppers, tenants and other constituents seem to be viewing Omicron as temporary. And while wearing mask and being more careful in most of our markets, are marching forward with typical winter shopping patterns. Requests for rent accommodations from tenants have been few and we have not agreed to anything significant at all at this time. Now, from a capital allocation standpoint, which after all is really what we as management teams in this industry do to add the most value, we are actively using all three levers : asset sales, acquisitions and the continued expansion in our established properties, all in the name of bottom line earnings growth. You will notice from our 8-K that we closed on the sale of 2 shopping centers where we saw limited upside in the future. The combined proceeds of $113 million in just Leesburg Plaza and Saugus Shopping Center sold at a blended high 5% cap rate were used to reduce debt before year end. On the acquisitions front, we would like to invest several hundred million dollars in 2022 based on our identification from our hit list of targeted properties that feel like they may trade this year. Progress early in the year has been encouraging and soliciting serious conversations. Stay tuned. And certainly, on the development front, we expect to be substantially done constructing our residential of our retail neighborhood in Darien, Connecticut this year. We are underway at our $190 million office tower for Choice Hotels at Pike & Rose. And we have more than a dozen property improvement redevelopments underway throughout the portfolio. By the way, Citi will be hosting a tour of our newly completed CocoWalk mixed-use project during their conference in South Florida next month. It\u2019s pretty spectacular. It\u2019s created over $60 million in value on our $200 million investment and we would love to see a wide variety of investments there. It\u2019s going to be an active year on all fronts at Federal. I got to believe the visibility of this multiple year bottom line earnings growth plan is the most transparent in the sector. That\u2019s all about all I have for prepared comments. Let me turn it over to Dan and we will be happy to entertain your questions after that. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don and hello everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.47 was up 29% from the fourth quarter of last year and roughly $0.06 above the top of our guidance range. For the year, we reported FFO per share of $5.57, a 23% increase over 2020\u2019s results. Both of those reported increases exclude the one-time debt repayment charge from 4Q 2020 in order to show a meaningful apples-to-apples comparison. Primary drivers of that outperformance versus expectations were higher percentage rent from COVID-amended leases bolstering better collection rates; a faster acceleration in occupancy than expected; stronger leasing at our residential assets, including the Phase 3 residential at Assembly; lower real estate taxes than we had forecasted; plus financing activity, which occurred later in the quarter than expected. This was offset by higher G&A higher property level operating expenses, primarily one-timers; and lower term fees than we forecasted. For those analysts that keep track, we had $1.7 million of term fees for the quarter against a 4Q 2020 level of $3.6 million. Collections continued to improve, with 97% of monthly billed rent being collected for the quarter, up from 96% reported on our third quarter call. Including abatements and deferrals, we are 99% resolved. Prior period collections were down to $5 million versus $8 million in 3Q. And as a result, our collectibility adjustment was up modestly to $2 million, primarily driven by this prior period follow-up. Collection of deferrals continue to outperform our expectations. Of the $46 million total rent we deferred since the start of COVID, $27 million has been collected, which represents roughly 90% of the amounts that were scheduled to be repaid by year end. Don already highlighted our record breaking quarter and year of leasing, but let me add some additional color. As you mentioned, we were 91.1% occupied as of quarter end, a 90 basis point increase over both the third quarter and year-over-year. Our lease rate stood at 93.6%, an 80 basis point increase over the third quarter and a 140 basis point increase year-over-year and a 250 basis point spread between leased and occupied should set us up for strong growth over the course of 2020. These significant gains were primarily driven by small shop leases. Our small shop lease percentage is up to 87.4%, a 130 basis point sequential increase in the quarter and a 280 basis point increase year-over-year, solid progress in getting back to our targeted bogie of around 90% to small shop. Highlighting some of the small shop activity were deals for some of the most sought-after tenants of today : Warby Parker with 3 new deals; Made Well with 2 new leases; [indiscernible]; Aged Denim, Old [ph] Pizza; another Nike Live; another [indiscernible], just to name a few. Anchor leasing was solidly up 50 basis points to 96.8%, given broad-based activity with 12 deals totaling 320,000 square feet of the almost 600,000 for the quarter. Categories for new deals include grocers, discount apparel, sporting goods, home furnishings and healthcare. On the residential side, we saw a surge in leased occupancy of 240 basis points year-over-year to 97.2% and saw strong high single-digit year-over-year new lease rent growth. We feel well-positioned to drive incremental POI growth in 2022 given forecasted strength, particularly in our Boston and Silicon Valley markets. Evidence of this plan \u2013 evidence of this can also be seen where after just 7 months, our 500-unit Miscela residential tower at Assembly is already 60% leased at rents which are 15% higher than the pre-COVID lease-up rental rates of Montaje, its sister resi tower next to it at Assembly Row. In terms of redevelopment, we now have roughly $400 million of remaining spend on our $1.5 billion investment pipeline. Much of that pipeline has recently been placed into service. These projects will be a source of significant earnings growth in 2022 through 2025 as we continue to ramp up in POI contribution. In our 8-K, we have reinserted disclosure relating to the ramp up of POI at our large in-process projects and also provided some detail in a footnote on the 99% leased CocoWalk. Now, to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position, the fourth quarter was an active one in the capital markets front. We raised another $85 million of common equity for our ATM on a forward basis at a blended gross price of $130.50. We have repaid mortgages totaling $117 million that encumbered the avenue of White Marsh and Montrose Crossing, getting another $18 million of POI to our unencumbered pool. And during the quarter, we sold $121 million in assets, including the Leesburg, Virginia and Saugus, Massachusetts assets Don mentioned, bringing our total for the year to $142 million at a blended yield in the mid-5s. As a result, we ended the year with $162 million of cash available, an undrawn $1 billion credit facility at $264 million of forward equity to be taken down in \u201822, leaving us with total liquidity of over $1.4 billion. Our leverage metrics continue to improve. Net debt to EBITDA is now down into the high 5x level for the fourth quarter annualized net of the forward equity. And that metric is forecast to improve over the course of 2022 as development POI comes online and occupancy drives higher from leases that are already executed. Again, our targeted level is in the low 5x range. Fixed charge coverage is back up to just under 4x and we have no debt maturities until mid-2023. Now on to guidance, for 2022, we are increasing our guidance range to $5.75 to $5.95 per share, a $0.10 increase over our previous range. This represents 5% growth at the midpoint, 7% at the high end. And this was driven by occupancy levels expecting to increase from 91% at year end up into the mid to upper 92% range by the end of 2022. An increased forecast for current period collections, up from an average of 95% in \u201821 to an average 98% over the course of \u201822. Greater contribution from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline, again, for those modeling, let me direct you to our 8-K where we are providing our forecast of stabilized POI ramp up by year as well as accretion from our 2021 acquisitions being online for the full year. Additionally, of the $440 million of 2021 acquisitions, they are really outperforming our original underwriting and are expected to yield a blended 6% in 2022 versus an initial 5.5% expectation. Please note that these deals would clearly sell at a blended sub-5 cap rate in today\u2019s environment. Now this will be offset by lower prior period collections, where the net 2021 level is $22 million. And for \u201822, it is expected in the range of $5 million to $8 million. We are expecting lower net term fees. We had $8.4 million in 2021 and forecast $4 million to $6 million in \u201822, more in line with historical averages. Despite over 300 basis points of headwinds from prior period collections and lower net term fees, our comparable growth forecast is 3% to 5% for 2022. Other assumptions include $300 million to $400 million of redevelopment and expansions at our existing properties. $300 million to $400 million of equity to be issued inclusive of the forward equity already total. G&A is estimated in the $50 million to $54 million range for the year. We have set a credit reserve of roughly 2%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Dispositions made in 2021 contributed $8 million of PRI to 2021. And that obviously won\u2019t be there in 2022. And we will have lower interest income, given the repayment in mid-2021 of our $30 million mortgage loan at yield of 10%. As is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2022. We will adjust for those as we go, given our opportunistic approach to both. It also does not assume any tenants moving from a cash basis to accrual basis. And please note the expanded disclosure in our 8-K relating to guidance. With respect to our goal posts for 2023 and 2024, we continue to believe that 5% to 10% compounded growth from our upwardly revised 2022 FFO range is achievable. Timing in terms of the lease-up at One Santana West will have a big influence on where we end up within that range. Now while we are not providing color on specific timing, $7 per share of FFO is a realistic target in the coming years. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So two questions here. The first question is, obviously, on the apartment side, what we\u2019ve seen all around is the rent rebounds and rent growth is tremendous. On the retail side, the sales recovery has been just off the charts. I mean, the mall companies have been saying it\u2019s well exceeded 2019. You guys are talking similar. It\u2019s hard to believe that this is all just a catch-up of people staying in their homes during 2020 and early 2021. So do you think there is something else at work? Or is this just like a one-hit wonder. We all rebounded this year or 2021, and then sales are leveling out? Or do you think that people have sort of \u2013 and retailers themselves have rediscovered retail, and therefore, this accelerated sales pace is sustainable in the next several years? Don Wood : Yes, Alex, I mean that is the \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s the question of the day. The \u2013 everything we said, we seem to see. And again, it\u2019s looking at it through our view, which is not a national view. It\u2019s really primarily a postal view, suggests that this \u2013 that the recovery of sales, etcetera, are here to stay. I do think there was something very interesting that happened through COVID in terms of people\u2019s realization of how important socials was. It\u2019s really important into how going out to eat and to play at the shop is. So I think a lot of that states. The other thing, and you kind of touched on it early in the first part of the question, I want to address it is the residential side. There is no doubt that places \u2013 and again, our residential outlook is only on a few places. But it got hurt as you think about it going into COVID. The way it\u2019s recovering is pretty interesting to me. And we have a really interesting barometer. If you remember at Assembly, pre-COVID, we were opening up a big 500-unit building that we call Montage. And in that building, in the fourth quarter of \u201818, October, November, December of \u201818, before any COVID, that building, we had average rents of $3.35. Ironically, we\u2019re now opening the second building, which is also 500 units, and it\u2019s right next door. It\u2019s called Micelle. It\u2019s leasing up faster than we thought, and it\u2019s leasing up at $3.85 in that fourth quarter, 15% more than pre-COVID at Assembly Row. It\u2019s really interesting. And if you look at the deals that are happening in January and February, it\u2019s not a big sample size because of January and February in Boston, but those are well over $4. So there is something that\u2019s happening here with respect to lifestyle, with respect to shopping, with respect to certainly the office piece in terms of what\u2019s to come there that is really \u2013 that really feels to me like an energized pre-COVID time that, to some level, is here to stay. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then the second question is \u2013 with the recent \u2013 the prime waves that have happened and stores that have been targeted, I mean, your portfolio has been hit. On the public earnings calls, all the companies that I\u2019ve asked so far, everyone said, there is a little bit more security costs but no tenant has changed their leasing plans or is moving stores. And yet when we speak to people and some of the companies privately or speak to others that are involved in retail in urban settings, it\u2019s a different story. So my question is, is it just that, in general, there is really been no fallout. There is increased lease security costs, but in general, there is been no leasing fallout. Tenants really aren\u2019t shifting their portfolios or is it that, yes, in certain markets, they are seeing a change, but it\u2019s not a change that is appearing nationally as the retailers look at their fleets? Don Wood : I can really only respond to our properties in our markets, and I can tell you there has not been a change in any of the retailers\u2019 plans for moving forward because of price. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay, okay. Thank you, Don. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Yes. Thank you. You guys have come out of COVID being rather aggressive, impressively so on your external growth. You\u2019ve really taken up your acquisitions and you continue to push on your redevelopment. I\u2019m just wondering though, with the continued pressure on cap rates, may you start to favor redevelopments over acquisitions just because it\u2019s tougher to buy and adding value when cap rates are so attractive is a compelling proposition? Don Wood : Great question, Craig. Let\u2019s let Jeff jump on that first, particularly from the acquisition side. Jeff Berkes : Yes. Hi, Craig, good evening. I think you\u2019re right on the point. We were really happy with what we got done in \u201821. As Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we got that those deals done in the first half of the year, generally speaking, which was great. All the properties we bought in \u201821 have great redevelopment and value-add opportunities going forward, which as you know we think is very important when you are buying something. The second half of the year [indiscernible] tightened up yield now, whether you\u2019re talking about cap rate or IRR, are lower than they were pre-pandemic. And where public equity trades in the teens on average, it\u2019s a real head scratcher as to how you make the numbers work for your normal grocery anchored neighborhood or a community center. The numbers just don\u2019t work, especially when you look out a few years and what the growth of the property level needs to be to support the implied growth in the equity that\u2019s issued by the asset. I think you\u2019re spot on. And as you know, we\u2019re careful about that kind of stuff. We\u2019ve always been really disciplined because we\u2019ve never felt pressured to buy anything because we have, as Don said, so many tools in the tool bag. So we will continue doing what we\u2019ve done for the last two decades that most of us have been here and will be careful about what we buy and make sure it\u2019s got good go-forward growth prospects, densification opportunities, lease-up releasing, all that kind of stuff. But certainly, if you don\u2019t have the ability to source that stuff, if you don\u2019t have the ability to take advantage of those opportunities, just growing by buying something in today\u2019s market is not a very good idea, in my view. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell with Citi. You may proceed with your question. Katy McConnell : Hi, everyone. Thanks. Just wondering if you could walk us through some of the key swing factors that could get you to the higher or the low end of your updated FFO guidance range? It is still a fairly wide range for this year. And what would need to happen for you to narrow that more throughout the year? Dan Guglielmone : It\u2019s Dan. Hi, Katy, how are you? Look, I think that we\u2019ve given a range of 3% to 5% for comparable property. I think that kind of what goes in that is just collections, both prior and prior period as well as kind of going forward current. Also kind of what we do with regards to term fees, which we\u2019ve kind of reduced. Our prior period rents have also been reduced. We\u2019ve given a range. I think you\u2019ll see on Page 33, in our guidance we gave kind of a little bit of a range with regards to G&A expense of $50 million to $54 million. I think it\u2019s a little bit of a sense of the range of development, redevelopment capital that we can put to use. And then also how much equity we raise. We\u2019ve also \u2013 how quickly some of the rents can come online at our developments as well as the rest of the year, how we can get things rent started. So I think there is a whole host of those. I think our \u2013 we\u2019ve given a range of credit reserve at around 2%, plus or minus 50 basis points. That\u2019s another one. Obviously, that shows up, will be reflected in the 3% to 5% comparable to an extent. But those really, I think, kind of are levers that get us there with regards to that stated range of guidance. Again, it does not include dispositions, does not include acquisitions, does not include any changes in our revenue recognition with regards to cash versus accrual. Michael Bilerman : It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Katy. Don, I was wondering if you can maybe step back and just think about capital sources and uses. You have $300 million to $400 million of development and redevelopment spend that you have targeted for this year. And in your opening comments, it sounded like there was number of transactions on the acquisition front that you have underway. You list here about $300 million to $400 million of equity, which is effectively \u2013 I don\u2019t know if that equity is all common equity. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re deeming that to be equity selling assets. But just talk a little bit about how you think about funding that growth and how significant it could be. Don Wood : You bet, Michael. So the first thing you got to remember is that we\u2019ve got forward equity contracts of $250 million. Dan Guglielmone : $260 million, Don. Don Wood : $260 million that has already been sold, that will be taken down in 2022 at some point. That\u2019s important. Incremental equity in our budget is another $140 million or so on top of that. We\u2019re also looking at selling a couple of assets that probably should think \u2013 you should think about another $100 million or so there. So what we\u2019re really certainly trying to do is be very balanced with respect to the capital that we would use \u2013 that again, have raised a lot of it already. That\u2019s important. We\u2019re not going to lever up the company. We\u2019re going the other way. And so the notion of new deals and how those deals would be financed, they\u2019ll stand on their own. And we will figure out the best way to finance those depending on what type of assets they are, where we\u2019re going. But with respect to the stuff that\u2019s committed, we\u2019re in really good shape because of the pre-funded equity so far and the couple of dispositions that we would do. Michael Bilerman : And I guess from a volume perspective, how do you think about \u2013 you added all the yield back to the supplemental, thank you for that. Some pretty attractive yields relative to where the acquisition market is being priced and certainly relative to where you got those deals off last year, so I guess, why not activate more of the stuff that\u2019s in your wheelhouse versus going out and paying lower cap rates for acquisitions and issuing equity at a discount to where your NAV is, right? I mean due to diluted\u2026 Don Wood : First of all, I fully agree with you, Michael. I fully agree with you, which you have to first really mixture you get is all the capital that has been spent to date that has not \u2013 that is not yet producing. And that is automatic FFO growth, automatic property level growth. And it is the single biggest source of growth in the next couple of years after plain old lease-up of a portfolio that is still under lease in terms of where it goes. Those two things are huge. The other thing with respect to acquisitions, and this is where I could not agree with you more. They have got to make a lot of sense. Now I will tell you that there is one that we\u2019re looking at specifically in order to handle a 1033 transaction that we had a couple of years back. So there are \u2013 we will step up to be able to do a deal that makes sense overall on an overall tax reform tax perspective. But beyond that, your point is 110% right. I couldn\u2019t agree with you more. Michael Bilerman : Okay, thanks. See you at Coco in a few weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. You may proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : Hi, good evening. I guess looking at leasing, the leasing volumes are obviously quite strong. Rent spreads are slightly less exciting. Could you just talk about market rent growth that you\u2019re seeing relative to 2019? And then in what regions you\u2019re either seeing more strength or recovery in rent growth? Don Wood : Yes. I can start on that. When, you jump in wherever I screw this up. But the \u2013 when we sit and we look at 6%, 8%, 9%, something like that, which is where we expect to be overall, that is \u2013 that\u2019s about where we are overall compared to not only \u201819, but what is in place all the way through. When you look specifically to \u201819, and I just did this to get comfortable with it, we are 3%, 4%, 5%-or-so higher than 2019 overall. That doesn\u2019t mean, and I have said this 100 times, that it will always be the case that there aren\u2019t specific deals that will either drag that down or drag that way up. In this particular quarter, I got a \u2013 was a good example of it. We had a CDS in line at Barrett\u2019s Road, one of our best shopping center that we could not accommodate a drive-through. They left the shopping center to go across the street for a drive-thru. Those things happen. That was a big rent payer that wouldn\u2019t be able to be replaced without that deal, those rollovers that would have been eight for the company. So, there is always a couple of things like that. They go both ways throughout the company. But overall, you are talking about a level of demand that\u2019s in excess of the supply of our particular product. So overall, you should expect that continued growth in rents. The other thing is, though, you have kind of translate that down to the bottom line. And when you hear big numbers of rollovers, but no growth at the bottom line, you kind of sit there and say, what, because from my perspective, taking \u2013 being able to expand that properties that are fully settled as great retail destinations like a Pike & Rose, or like an Assembly, like a Santana Row, to be able to add buildings to expand what you have. My gosh, that\u2019s great risk-adjusted growth. That really needs to be thought through and considered in terms of it. So, both the leasing and the expansion and the PIPs, the property improvement plans, all of that, when that happens, winds up, I think would show you bottom line growth that is consistent and sustainable for a number of years. That\u2019s the name of the game. Greg McGinniss : Alright. Well, thank you. And then just regarding those potential acquisitions that you and Michael were referencing, what are you seeing in the market from a cap rate perspective? And how do you think that impacts the value of your portfolio? I know, Dan, a few years ago gave us his NAV estimate, which I believe you weren\u2019t too pleased about. I am giving in the first place to comment otherwise, which we all appreciate it\u2026? Don Wood : First of all, Greg, that\u2019s just good topics between Dan and I. It\u2019s not \u2013 we are on the same page in terms of that. Look, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s so well publicized. It\u2019s so well clear that really strong shopping centers today are in the markets that we want to hit or some general. I mean that\u2019s really \u2013 when you take a look at the big projects that we have, when you look at what the value of CocoWalk is going to be when you come and see it, when you take a look at what\u2019s being added at Pike & Rose, at Assembly, etcetera. I think you are going to \u2013 I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that you are talking about sub-5 across the board in this company. Not at every shopping center, but across the board in store. And so when you look at that, you can do the math. That\u2019s the way you think the NAV should be. But to me, that NAV is critically important. The most important thing about that, that ties obviously into the cap rate. Where is the growth, man, how are you going to grow it and what\u2019s that thing going to be like in a few years because that\u2019s what a buyer is paying for. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And then just to follow-up on that, with the new structure in place, should we expect to see some use of that structure in terms of OP units to help on the acquisition side? Don Wood : Maybe yes, maybe no. That is \u2013 that was an administrative change that was, frankly, we found a relatively simply the simple way and inexpensive way to do it or do foundationally to be able to do that, such that so that we weren\u2019t in any disadvantage should the opportunities come up. So, I know it\u2019s not a bad thing in any way you look at it. And to the extent some of the deals we are talking about are looking at can utilize that and give the particular seller more comfort, great. But I couldn\u2019t handicap it with you is that \u2013 so yes, that means we will do four deals instead of one deal or that kind of thing. But it\u2019s generally a good thing. Greg McGinniss : Alright. Thanks. Don Wood : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital. You may proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Thanks for the time. I think you mentioned about 150 basis points of occupancy growth in the prepared remarks from year-end to year-end. But just curious if you can give us any sense of the cadence throughout the year. Typically see some seasonality in the first quarter, but that seems to have gone out the window with COVID here and the recovery to-date. So, just curious if you have any wisdom to share on how we should think about occupancy for \u201822? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. I think that growth \u2013 and it\u2019s a range where we are trying to get up into that 92.5% to high-90s range. I think you should just model it pro rata by quarter. I don\u2019t think there is a particular key in terms of where \u2013 how that increase will occur on the occupied metric. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Great. And then just on Santana West, hoping you could give us a little color on how those leasing discussions are progressing, any expectation for signing a lease here in the near-term to give us more confidence? And maybe adding that incremental NOI to like a \u201823 property NOIs as that development comes on, or how should we think of the timing of that potentially? Don Wood : On this particular issue, I have never been so toured in my life about talking more than I should or less than I should on this. I know what I am very comfortable with is that the conversations that are happening are a bit of a horserace right now. And the notion of kind of helping one versus the other, I don\u2019t want to signal anything on that more than to tell you that we are making some good progress. I am not going to put a time on it, and I can\u2019t give a little bit more given the nature of the negotiations at this point. Sorry. Juan Sanabria : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. You may proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hi Don. Hope you guys are well. I wanted to ask you about the cash basis tenants, still pretty elevated here. I don\u2019t think there is a change versus last quarter. I guess I am curious why we aren\u2019t seeing more progress on that given the backdrop. You are doing tons of leases, rents are going up. How do we square that versus the optimism that\u2019s early, obviously, in your voice and your outlook? Dan Guglielmone : What are you referring to with regards to your question regarding the cash basis tenants? Haendel St. Juste: The percentage, I am looking here at 26% of \u2013 let\u2019s see. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. There is no plans for us to switch them back from a cash basis to an accrual basis. There is likely to be some fairly high hurdles for us to do that. And look, even pre-COVID, we had a big chunk. Most of our restaurants on a cash basis to begin with already. So, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate \u2013 it\u2019s not as though there is any progress, we need to see kind of repayment of deferrals, you need to see other progress with regards to consistency and payments, and then we will make those decisions. But I wouldn\u2019t anticipate anything in \u2013 and that\u2019s why we have nothing in our guidance with regards to making that change from cash to accrual. Haendel St. Juste: Yes. Got it. And for clarity, but what was that pre-COVID, what was the range relative? Dan Guglielmone : Probably around kind of the mid-teens as a percentage of ABR, just a big chunk of that was restaurants, and then our normal cash base has been tenants of lower rent quality, lower quality tenants at any one point in time. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And a question on rent commencements, last year, certainly, the focus on rent collections, this year, more so on rent commencement. And I am just I guess I am curious to a question of supply chain and labor constraints. Any risk of perhaps not meeting some of the rent commencement timelines and risk to the side note opened rents? And any sense of anything you are able to do to perhaps compress some of those timelines or work with tenants in any way? Thanks. Don Wood : Yes. The answer is yes to all the questions you just asked about it Haendel. I mean look, supply chain is a big deal. And are we able to do stuff about it, you bet we are from the standpoint of certain of the components of it, whether you are talking about HVAC equipment, whether you are talking about some of the provisions in the lease where that tenant will work with us, there are things that we have done and continue to do. And as Wendy loves to say, and boy, you can\u2019t argue with this, is great relationships with tenants means that there is a partnership there in trying to get a store open. And that partnership means there is more likely to have a give and take in that \u2013 in the build-out process of where you can find the right equipment to be able to get stuff in. And we have had some real good success getting started with that. Does that mean there is no risk on the supply chain side, the store opening, of course, not. But it tells you differently as you look at them square in the eye because that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the country right now. But we are all over, and frankly, have been all over for quite some time, floating staffing up there, including helping as best we can with relationships in the cities on the permitting side, which is always the least predictable part of this. So, all hands on making sure that the 3 million square feet of leasing that has been done at this company in the past is able to have its best chance for starting before or on the dates that we have got forecast. Haendel St. Juste: Could you guys give an updated number for the side but not yet rents? I think last quarter, that figure was like $25 million. You expected 90% to hit this year. Can you give us\u2026? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. No, with sign and not occupied, that \u2013 what\u2019s identified and a difference between our leased and occupied is about $23 million. We have also got a big chunk that is effectively about $17 million. That is in our non-comparable or basically currently in our redevelopment pipeline as well as what\u2019s in our current pipeline of kind of 2022 deals that have been signed so far and going forward gets you up into the $50 million-plus of total rent starts potentially. So, we feel good about where we stand, and we see that as a big driver of some upside in over \u201822 and into \u201823. Haendel St. Juste: Wonderful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. You may proceed with your question. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks guys for taking my question. Actually following up on what Haendel asked about as well. I mean, if I do the math, I see excluding the NOI coming online from the development pipeline, which could be up to $75 million, you have got more than $10 million of NOI growth sort of identified here if I add up all of these pieces. So, if we start factoring this out, and obviously, not all of it is going to come online in \u201822, but a significant amount will be probably back ended in \u201822 into \u201823, but we are looking here at double-digit NOI growth going into \u2013 by the end of \u201823 comfortably double digits. That seems pretty attractive. Are we missing something here? Dan Guglielmone : Well, keep in mind, I mean, look, we will have strong growth as the developments come online. And I think you can look at our additional disclosure on the big projects to kind of get a sense of that. Keep in mind, though, also there is the offset of capitalized interest going away as we deliver those buildings. We have signed leases there as we deliver those spaces to the tenants. Obviously, we shut off and capitalized interest. So, that\u2019s a bit of an offset. So obviously, that\u2019s what flows down to the bottom line. It\u2019s just not kind of how quickly we grow the NOI on top. Obviously, there is capital associated with some of the redevelopment and expansions that we have got. Floris Van Dijkum : And then as Don sort of alluded to in some of your residential leasing, presumably, having a building that signing rents 15% higher than next door, that suggests that the existing rents have some significant potential upside here as well. How long will it take, do you think, in your view, to harvest some of that residential rental upside as well? Don Wood : Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Haendel. And that should be a source of positivity for 2022, particularly through the spring season, and so later in the year, a little bit of luck, we will have that big building up at Assembly all these stuff by the end of the year, which would be great, which would be good stuff for 2023. And really, based on what\u2019s going on in Boston right now, that is a real bright spot from a life sciences perspective and a back-to-work perspective and a job creation perspective. That is one of our, if not our strongest markets, which is interesting because it was a market that was hurt the most during COVID. Floris Van Dijkum : Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi, can you discuss expectations embedded in your POI growth of 3% to 5%? What\u2019s the balance between growth in revenues and expenses? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. I think that the \u2013 we would expect expenses \u2013 we have got a good year with regards to real estate taxes and keeping them low this year, so they should have be grow from this level. I would expect that there should be kind of modest, kind of bigger 3% rent expense growth kind of ordinary course from that perspective. And then obviously, just occupancy growing, with collections growing, with the offset of some prior period and lower term fees and so forth, all factor in. And obviously, some of the credit reserve is embedded in there beyond just the collection impact. So, all of those \u2013 but with regards to expenses, I would forecast kind of a traditional kind of 3% increase on both OpEx and real estate taxes. And maybe a little bit higher on the OpEx, just got to get inflationary pressure, but that\u2019s all embedded in that 3% to 5%. Linda Tsai : And then what are you forecasting for bad debt in 2022? Dan Guglielmone : It\u2019s \u2013 like I said, our credit reserve is call it, 2%, plus or minus 50 basis points. I think there is a bunch of \u2013 traditionally, we are kind of in the 50 basis points of bad debt as a component of that credit reserve. It\u2019s going to be elevated, I would expect, probably going to be at least north of 1%. And that\u2019s what\u2019s \u2013 and there is a range that\u2019s reflected in that 3% to 5%. But it will be elevated in \u201822 even above kind of the collection in that. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then in the earlier comments, you have mentioned that lease-up at Marcella is getting 15% higher rents. Is there anything in particular driving that maybe in terms of the demographics that are moving in? Don Wood : No, it\u2019s job growth. It\u2019s job growth in Boston. I mean life science is absolutely on fire. It\u2019s returned to work. It\u2019s just a powerful job-creating market, a lot of relocations into the market from other parts of the country. Very impressive. Linda Tsai : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Ms. Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everybody at Citi conference in a couple of weeks. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, enjoy the rest of your day.",

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode, a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. . Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Leah Brady. Thank you. You may begin. Leah Brady : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Dawn Becker, Jan Sweetnam and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your call -- take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but a future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued yesterday, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask you to limit yourself to one question and an appropriate follow-up during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have additional questions, please requeue.  And with that, I will turn our call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everybody. There's lots going right in Federal Realty these days. Demand for our products has outpaced even our raised expectations and 2022 first quarter was no exception. Yes, the reported -- the reported $1.50 per share, beat both the street and our internal forecast. And of course, last year's COVID impacted quarter by 28% but it's really the contributions from all parts of this multifaceted business plan that's at the heart of our optimism, starting with the enduring strength of leasing. Over the last decade, average first quarter production for comparable properties at Federal Realty meant doing about 80 deals or roughly 375,000 square feet. In the '22 first quarter, we did 119 deals for 444,000 square feet, 50% more than the average. We've never come close to doing 119 deals in any quarter, never mind the normally weaker first quarter, before last year's record-setting COVID recovery demand. But the fact that, that demand has remained this huge with a deal pipeline that looks to stay strong, speaks volumes about our properties and the markets they're in. And naturally of our future earnings growth. So one of the reasons Dan is raising annual earnings guidance, $0.10 at the midpoint of the first quarter, something we rarely, if ever, do. That leasing demand is broad and has resulted in a 130 basis point increase in small shop lease percentage 88.7% sequentially over the fourth quarter, well ahead of expectations. That small shop lease rate is also a remarkable 490 basis points higher than a year ago. Now we did lose 40 basis points of  occupancy since the fourth quarter. That's just typical first quarter expirations of few boxes portfolio volume. The portfolio was there for overall 93.7% leased at the top at the end of the first quarter. Importantly, there's plenty of room to go. We expect continued small shop occupancy gains throughout 2022. So all of this commentary thus far relates to our core portfolio, and it doesn't speak to the multiple additional ways that we grow earnings and value. Selective acquisitions, development, redevelopment, all add incrementally to our best-in-class core portfolio.  Here's a case in point. We did 10 deals, both new and renewals in the first quarter at the four properties that we bought last year, Chesterbrook, Camelback Collonade, Hilton Village and Grossmont. The rent rolled up in every single one of those deals and overall up by 33%. And even though no redevelopment has started yet at any of those centers. The universal belief during those tenant negotiations was that federal would improve the productivity of those shopping centers, enabling them to afford higher rents. That reputation and credibility grounded in a long established track record is critical to all that we do and in my view, one of our key differentiators. When we tied up Fairfax County, Virginia Kingstowne Shopping Center for $200 million in a five cap some months back, we similarly expect to improve the productivity of that 410,000 square foot destination through better merchandising and operations and finding the inevitable opportunities that always seem to accompany big land parcels. This one is 45 acres in densely populated in affluent first-ring suburbs. As I assume you read in our press release a couple of weeks back, we closed on the first half of that parcel in late April and expect to close on the second half in late July. Northern Virginia is an important and a growing market for us.  Our stepped-up post-COVID redevelopment effort is another critical component to future growth. It's no news to anyone on this call that the traditional generic and homogenous shopping center business is cyclical in nature and not a high-growth business. So you have to stand out to outperform over cycles. You do that by picking the right markets and positioning and merchandising in those markets, but you also have to reinvest in those assets to continually find the edge. Reinvesting is more important post COVID than ever before. So why we have nearly two dozen active and meaningful development projects in planning are underway, totaling over $100 million this year and next, which will likely yield double-digit unlevered yields over the ensuing years through higher customer traffic and rents in line with our historically observed results following redevelopments. That reinvestment is one of the primary reasons we can continue to put push rents. Now as to our development business. At the Citi conference in March, we were able to tour live in person CocoWalk, our fully leased mixed-use development. We had an impressive group of investors attend and our team was proud to showcase the unique approach that we take to real estate development and value creation. Consider that in its first stabilized year, the project will generate in excess of $11 million of NOI on a $190 million investment with rents that are already under marked. Our unlevered IRR is over 8%. CocoWalk is pretty special. At Santana West, while I don't have any specific announcement to make on this call as to the leasing of our newly constructed office building, interest in the product and negotiations are more active than they've been at any time during the COVID era. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to provide a positive update in the coming months.  Office demand is back in Ernest in Silicon Valley given the Google and Apple back-to-office announcements in the past month or 2 and we have the only new fully amenitized state-of-the-art project in the market. We've updated costs and returns on the accompanying 8-K based on real negotiations and market conditions. Ensure higher costs, along with higher rents, thus maintaining yield expectations. With residential base rents comprising 11% of our total rented base, the upward pressure on apartment rents in many U.S. markets is also benefiting our bottom line. A meaningful residential income stream in our fully amenitized properties is such a unique incremental benefit of Federal. At Assembly Row, lease-up of Miscela, our 500-unit apartment building continues faster than forecast and a higher net effective rents. We're currently 70% leased at 10% higher rents than forecast. Our office building, affectionately known as the PUMA building, as you can see the PUMA site from New Hampshire is now 88% leased with another 5% at lease. Assembly Row has really outperformed all of our expectations coming out of COVID. Nothing yet to announce with respect to the next phase of expansion here as we've yet to lockdown costs, but we are getting close to a go/no-go decision on a life science project here that complement the growing life science demand and adjacent Summerville projects. More to come. Pike & Rose, Darien construction both continue on time and on budget. One thing that always strikes me about our mixed-use development pipeline is the extent to which we incorporate what we've learned over the years into our core portfolio. While mixed-use development is certainly a different business than operating four shopping centers, much of what makes our big development special can be seen throughout our portfolio.  From a broader array of tenant relationships to state-of-the-art construction techniques relative to place making, storefronts, any coordination and environmental considerations to unseen but impactful operational efficiencies. Our 25-year experience building mixed-use communities adds and continues to benefit our core shopping centers far greater than most people realize. Expect to be more -- see more of our showcasing that in the coming quarters and years. When you think Federal Realty, think about the multifaceted ways that we've got to grow. Just as we did between 2010 and 2019, and just as we plan to do from 2021 on with assets in the team whose confidence is proven and time tested. Dan? Daniel Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. As Don outlined, $1.50 per share reported FFO for the first quarter outperformed against every one of our benchmarks. Last quarter, year-over-year, versus consensus and versus our own forecast. That outperformance was broad-based. All aspects of our business model played a role in the results of drivers such as better-than-expected small shop occupancy stronger residential performance, particularly in Boston and San Jose, better improvement in collections than forecast both in the current and prior periods, growing parking revenues and percentage rent underscoring accelerating traffic and tenant sales, particularly at our large mixed-use assets. However, this was offset by higher-than-forecasted property expenses. Our GAAP-based comparable portfolio growth metric was exceptionally strong at 14.5% for the quarter, more than 3% above forecast. Comparable growth, excluding prior period rent and term fees was 18.5%. To emphasize the strength of these metrics relative to the broader sector, our cash basis same-store metric, as calculated in line with our peers would have been 18% on an apple-to-apple basis and 18-plus percent excluding prior period rent and term fees.  Term fees this quarter were $1.5 million versus $2.8 million in 1Q '21. Prior period rent this quarter was $5 million versus $8 million in '21. Year-over-year occupancy results were also strong with our overall occupied metric growing 170 basis points year-over-year from $89.5 million to $91.2 million, our lease percentage increasing 190 basis points from 91.8 to 93.7. More upside to come on both of those metrics in the coming years as we realistically target 94% to 95% were occupied and 95% to 96% for leased. Our signed not occupied spread in the comparable pool held steady at 250 basis points representing over $24 million of incremental total rent, which should come online over the balance of this year and into 2023. In our non-comparable pool are designed not occupied upside stands at $19 million of total rent. New lease deals and our leasing pipeline are currently unoccupied space will drive another $12 million of incremental total rent, primarily in '23 and '24. This totals roughly $55 million of cumulative incremental rent, which will very visibly drive bottom line results over the next 2-plus years, highlighting the diversity and strength of our multifaceted business plan. As a testament to our asset management and tenant coordination teams, we have not seen any material delays in getting tenants open and paying rent due to supply chain issues or labor issues to date, further enhancing the timeliness of that income coming online. Rollover for the quarter was solid at 7%, in line with our expectations and our trailing 4-quarter average as we continue to take a long-term approach to leasing up our portfolio in the wake of COVID and look to balance driving occupancy, improving merchandising, enhancing tenant credit quality, increasing starting rents and importantly, getting strong practical rent bumps. Contractual rent bumps are an extremely important part of our business plan, one that is not always visible to our investments. We believe that we achieved sector-leading average contractual rent bumps anchor and small shop blended in the 2.25% range given the quality of our portfolio. In this quarter, the blended annual increase releases signed with an exceptional 2.5%. From a pure math perspective, 2.5% compounded over 10 years, results in a rent which is 9% higher in year 10 than a lease, which compact -- the compound at 100 basis points slower growth or 1.5% annually. It's not just about rollover, contractual rent bumps do matter. Now to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion of total available liquidity comprised of an undrawn billion-dollar revolver, $160 million of cash and $175 million remaining on our forward equity contract. Additionally, we have roughly $150 million of noncore dispositions under consideration with pricing expectations that have blended cap rate below 5%. We have no maturities in 2022 with our only near-term maturity being $275 million of unsecured notes, which mature in mid-2023.  We've reduced our encumbered pool to just 7 assets, increasing our unencumbered EBITDA to 93% of total EBITDA or $600 million. With respect to our leverage metrics, our net debt to EBITDA is inside of 6 times as adjusted for our forward equity, we fully expect to be back to our pre-COVID target of low to mid 5 times by late '23. Our fixed charge coverage ratio is over 4 times already above our targeted level, and 93% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate. Additionally, we are targeting free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital to return to pre-COVID levels by next year. As CocoWalk in the Phase IIIs at both Assembly Row and Pike & Rose are largely complete from a spending perspective and are stabilizing $700 million comes out of us in-process development pipeline. These 3 projects will yield roughly $48 million when stabilized versus their 2021 contribution of $12 million.  As a result, our in-process pipeline of active developments now stands at $800 million, with roughly $425 million remaining to spend. As we always do, we sit with significant dry powder against our $1.3-plus billion of liquidity. Now on to guidance. As Don said, even after such a strong start to the year, it is rare that we would raise guidance for just one quarter in the books. However, the steady momentum we're seeing in the business makes it really difficult not to. As a result, we are pushing our guidance range of $0.10 to $5.85 to $6.05 from the prior range of $5.75 to $5.95. $0.01 to $0.02 of the $0.10 increase is from our recent purchase of Kingstown and its contribution to 2022. The balance is from the first quarter outperformance and a better than forecast outlook for the rest of the year, in both the comparable and non-comparable boots. We are also bumping up our guidance for comparable POI growth to 3.5% to 5% from the prior range of 3% to 5%. Excluding prior period rents and term fees, our forecast increases to 6.5% to 8% from a prior range of 6% to 8%. We still expect our occupied rate decline from 91.2% today, up until the 92.5% to 93% range by year-end. At the SNO spread in our operating portfolio of 250 basis points begins to come online. In terms of FFO growth in '23 and '24, we are still comfortable with the 5% to 10% growth guidepost we didn't previously. The strength of our business model provides us with a diversity of avenues to grow sustainable sector-leading FFO growth beyond driving portfolio occupancy levels back to our mid-90s targets, Federal has additional years to propel growth. A proven track record and cost of capital to opportunistically acquire assets accretively over the year, middle and long term, a completed redevelopment and expansion pipeline totaling $700 million an in-process redevelopment and expansion pipeline totaling $800 million. Together, these redevelopments and expansions will drive an incremental $80 million to $85 million of POI over the coming years through 2025.  As we have highlighted previously, this is not pioneering development in a proven location, this is redevelopment and derisked expansions at established and highly successful properties that we already own and know extremely well. On a risk-adjusted basis, there is no better, more compelling business plan in the sector today. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator :  Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Great. On Kingston Town Center, I'm just curious, why is it being purchased in two phases? And then when we think about you being able to increase value here, obviously, remerchandising upfront, but the incremental capital investment, is that to take advantage of the 45 acres? Jeffrey Berkes : Hey Craig, it's Jeff. Yes, that was a solar requirement that we closed in 2 phases, something that the solar asked for to be accommodated. Just a little bit more color on that acquisition. We're really, really happy with it for a number of reasons. We've talked about this a lot in the past, we've, for a long time, had a hit list, and we were very proactive about working our hit list and -- in this case, that really paid off. Barry Carty and team here has done a really good job of developing a relationship with the seller. We've been talking to the seller for a long time before the property came to market. And through that relationship and our credibility, we were -- we developed with the seller, we were able to step in and buy that even after it went to market at what we think are pretty good terms, going in at a 5 cap and kind of mid-6s unlevered IRR. And that IRR does contemplate a lot of upgrading in the way of merchandising and some investments in the assets itself so we can push rents but really happy with that.  It goes into our Virginia portfolio. We opened an office in Northern Virginia a few years ago that has just been incredibly successful running our assets and adding value, Chesterbrook, Twinbrook, Fairfax Junction, Kingstowne added to that portfolio in the last few years. So real happy about it. And finally, and I know you know this, but just as a reminder, buying Kingstowne helped us cover a pretty big gain that we created when we sold under threat a condemnation half of San Antonio Center on Mountain View, California with more than double what we paid for it 5 or 6 years ago. So all around just a really good deal, and we couldn't be more excited about it. Craig Schmidt : Great. And then just as a follow-up, I noticed you mentioned in the call that Northern Virginia is kind of growing in importance to Federal. Could you talk about Pan Am.? I'm understanding you're possibly planning to redevelop a mixed-use there. And then maybe some information also on the new parklet that's coming to Mount Vernon Plaza? Donald Wood : Yes, Craig, you've hit on something that's really important. When you -- as you know, we've owned Pan Am, and we've owned a whole lot of assets in Northern Virginia for a long time. But it really wasn't until we put the office over there we're able to make inroads in the acquisition market that whether you're a Fairfax County or Arlington County that the leaders of those governments helped recognize Federal as a big player there. Accordingly, we've been able to make some strides. We're certainly not all the way there yet, but strides with the entitlement process in Fairfax County with -- at Pan Am. We'll get through the rest of it. But we made already more inroads than we would have, I believe, if we were still operating the portfolio somewhat remotely. It just proves again how important local knowledge is and local presences to the portfolio. So don't have a lot to say yet about Pan Am. But I can tell you, you know where it is, we're at the Nutley Street exit of route 66 in the middle of Fairfax County on, again, a big piece of land. There really is a common thread there with us because stuff happens on the big pieces of land much more easily.  So that will go on to -- I'm hopeful our redevelopment pipeline list and -- I don't want to give you a time frame, but in the not-too-distant future on mobile. So good stuff there. In terms of Mount Vernon -- you got it, Leah? Leah Andress : Yes. The parklet, Craig that you had mentioned. So as Don mentioned in his opening remarks, we have more than 2 dozen investments happening in our existing portfolios to strategically make them better and get them stronger coming out of COVID. This parklet is a good example of not a full redevelopment but how we continue to invest in our properties to make them better for the communities that they serve. So this parklet we've been working on for a while. It's going to open shortly.  We just got the building permit and it's going to make kind of a center of gravity for Mount Vernon. As you know, it's a very large center, and it will provide some opportunity not only to the community, but the 4 or 5 tenants that circle the parklet. So again, really just kind of doubling down on that outdoor amenity program and outdoor seating that we see was so valuable during COVID. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good morning. So Dan, I can understand your general hesitance to increase guidance on Q1 results, but even so, it feels maybe a bit underwhelming, considering the outperformance versus our estimates and maybe even your own internal numbers, especially when looking at percent rent reimbursement and other revenue contributions. So I guess I'm just trying to understand what can even push you to the lower end of the guidance range, even assuming that there's no more prior period rent contributions? Daniel Guglielmone : Look, I think that there are massive kind of macro kind of storm clouds up. And I think it's just us being, I think, a little cautious in nature. I think the bump in guidance is, I think, reflective of strong first quarter. But it's -- we'll see. I think we want to be mindful of increased inflation and all the other things that we worry about every day when we go to sleep. So I mean that's -- I don't know, Don, if you have anything more to add? Donald Wood : Greg, gosh, it's hard for us to argue with the premise of your question when -- over the last 6 quarters, each time we have outperformed and increased guidance and it wasn't enough. And so I certainly understand your question. There is absolutely an inherent conservatism in the way we run this business. There -- '22 is looking real good, to your point. We're trying to reflect that in the guidance. But if it comes out better, it comes out better. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And Dan, I forget if you covered this, but have you talked about what kind of prior period rents are included in the guidance number? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. No, we've had -- we're actually increasing that number. We had -- in our original guidance, as I mentioned on our last call in February, roughly about $5 million to $8 million. Obviously, we did very well in the first quarter, increasing that range up from 5 to 8 to 9 to 11. The pool of potential rent grant from is shrinking. We're doing a lot better. And grabbing it as evident by a strong first quarter, enhanced the increase there over the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Michael Bilerman : Yes. Don, in your opening remarks, you talked a little bit about Santana West and how you sort of the costs had gone up, but the rents went up as well, which we're able to maintain your yield. I was wondering if you can just sort of step back on the entirety of the redevelopment and development pipeline. Your commentary on the core portfolio and the leasing environment is so optimistic and strong.  And clearly, the numbers are coming in the leasing environment. Why isn't that translating more into the redevelopment and development pipeline, I would have thought at this point, especially during COVID where you marked down a lot of those yields that those would actually start seeing the other side. Is it all just on construction costs that you're just finding that you're just not able to get those yields up? Donald Wood : Mike, just let me make sure I have the premise or we agree on the premise of the question. We have not adjusted in any significant way, the guidance that we've given kind of pre-COVID because we're -- we want to make sure that we've got good numbers and the ability to be accurate when we change it, not do it in a depth of 1,000 cuts.  When -- in terms of the Santana West piece, what this reflects is a real negotiation that gives us a much better window on what rents really are today. And what costs really are for the remaining piece in Santana West, it's basically just the TIs, which is a big number, but it's that and some other stuff. So we didn't want to change part of it without doing the whole thing. That similarly applies throughout the development portfolio. And as you know, much of our development stuff is baked and done under GMPs. And so to the extent we're comfortable with that, and we are, that's what you see disclosed.  You might have seen I also made a comment that we're not ready yet to talk about or announcing a life science building up at Assembly specifically to your question, specifically because I want to make sure we are locked down on costs before we're able to do that. We're getting close, but we're not there yet. What we do seem to see in all of our markets where we are developing is that the higher costs, which are clearly out there on new money relative to a year ago or 2 years ago are being offset by higher rent expectations that seem to be able to be met. So there's nothing on the development side yet that we've seen that has stopped as a result of higher cost, but no ability to push those rents that create a decent return on those costs. I don't know if there's a lot in there, and we'd have to go project by project but that's the general landscape. Michael Bilerman : Yes. I guess I was just -- I guess I was surprised that with all of this commentary and the commentary that you normally don't increase guidance at the beginning of the year and how strong the leasing environment is and record leasing that, that somehow is not translating into better yield on the development and redevelopment. And in fact, Santana West, if it wasn't for lifting the rents, that yield would have gone down. And it's not inconsequential. You're talking about $130 a foot, $50 million increase. The stocks small. Donald Wood : No, there's a fair -- that's a fair point, Mike. And maybe like I'll give you a great example. Right, with what's happening up in assembly on the residential business. we're going to be at the upper end of that range, and we may even increase that guidance going forward based on the actual residential leasing that is happening on their relative to the cost. So is there an inherent conservatism in the way we try to do things? Absolutely. It kind of ties to the earlier call.  Well, it's a pretty -- there are headwinds out there in terms of the marketplace. And so we try to take the most balanced approach we can. I think you guys look at our history and can determine whether you believe we'll get there. We won't get there and act accordingly. But no, there is an incurrent conservatism in the way we report. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : I guess given the commentary on strong demand and leasing volumes, is it your expectation that once we move into '23 and '24, we're going to see rent spreads take a notable step up? Donald Wood : Oh, gosh, how do I answer that? Mike, I would say, it is so hard to answer your question about '23 and '24 as we sit here on May 5, '22, right? I mean the reason we originally gave guidepost going out was because you'll remember, we had better visibility post-COVID than we did in the middle of COVID. So that's why we started getting those guideposts that. Now as I sit here and you look at the macro issues affecting the economy, trying to figure out exactly what's going to happen with lease negotiations in '23 and '24. I'm looking at Wendy here and I got a little bit of a shrug. And the -- that's not an indictment of the portfolio or an indictment of the way we do business. It's simply the market out there is uncertain. What we know is what we are seeing really good progress with is where we spend capital to be able to create a better place making asset. We get paid. And I don't expect that on a relative basis to change 1 bit. But it is on a relative basis based on what's going on in the more global economy, and that's affecting real estate. So -- as I sit here today, I am really bullish on all the facets of the way we're growing, including the basic leasing of shopping centers, especially those that have been redeveloped and invested in but more of a crystal ball than that for '23 and '24, I don't think I can give you today. Michael Mueller : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up here. On the comments about rent bumps and escalators. Was that a comment just on the retail portfolio or does that cover the office portfolio as well? Daniel Guglielmone : It's the commercial portfolio, including office. Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Thank you. Regarding acquisitions, with local retail cap rates, the spread to the 10-year treasury really historically tight right now. What kind of cap rates are you seeing for quality assets or, I guess, more importantly, expecting to see in private market transactions in the next quarter or two? Are there currently fewer bidders for assets or are cash buyers now really in the driving driver's seat given rising rates? Jeffrey Berkes : Yes, Derek, it's Jeff. Let me take a shot at that. I mean, we've been pretty active for the last 12 to 18 months coming out of the pandemic and bidding on stuff and being successful in several cases and buying properties. And in the most recent round of deals, we've still seen a very active bidder pool and a very well-capitalized bidder pool there is at least -- in this last round of deals, there's been a lot of capital in the market.  A lot of people think big picture. That's because the yields on retail are better than they are in multifamily and better than they are in industrial, which is why you've seen a lot of low to mid-4 cap rate purchases by institutions the last couple of quarters, and there's some deals in the market price like that. They're going to close in the next couple of quarters as well.  So not every buyer is a leveraged buyer a lot of institutional capital out there that needs to be placed. And going forward, I think it's not just interest rates that are going to drive cap rates. It's what are returns on other product types? And does that wallet capital stay in the market or does it not? So to be determined, but a lot of money for high-quality retail right now, competitive market. So -- and as always, there's a big spread between A and B quality property, right? And we're looking at stuff that we think we can add value to over time, really focused on value-add opportunities, the densification opportunities and more of the IRR than the cap rate. So kind of keep that in mind as you think through maybe where pricing might go to. Derek Johnston : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then kind of where Mike was headed but not so long term. Clearly, healthy retail leasing activity this quarter, built on strength of last year, which clearly is positive. But investors have focused on the high ABR versus peers and the post-pandemic era has being a possible headwind or perhaps led to year-to-date underperformance. But when you look at it, cash basis rollover this quarter was again positive at 7%. So I guess the question is what may investors be missing when focused on Federal's ABR? And how do you view the in-place rents versus market rents at your centers and the opportunity set? Donald Wood : Yes. This is the perennial question, I mean, right Derek, no doubt. I want you to focus on something that Dan said in his comments, check this out. A 7% cash-on-cash rollover. If you did the math and considered our -- what I believe our superior contractual bumps, if it's 100 basis points, if we're growing at 2.5, somebody else has grown at 1.5 typical shopping center business, right? 7% bumps equal 16% rollovers, 9% more.  That's an amazing thing that we have not, frankly, done a good job educating people about -- and look, part of that is we don't know what everybody's bumps are, but you can consider the following things. We have -- this portfolio is two-thirds tankers and one-third small shop. The opportunity for bumps is easier in the small shop, obviously, than convincing TJX or Ross to have annual bumps, obvious stuff. In our small shop, the notion of being able to have those bumps. I would bet more regularly, but I bet others, but I don't know that for sure. I do know that wars are very strong. That you have to consider that when looking at rollovers also. Yes, a small shop, not only maybe one-third of the GLA, but it's half of our rent in total. So think about that, number one. Number two, it's -- and I made this -- it's such an interesting point. I think when you look at the acquisitions we were -- we made -- and even before we do any redevelopment or do investing, we were able on 10 deals, not the smallest thing, 10 deals this quarter, get 33% more rent than when somebody else owned it, on the reputation that we're going to make you more productive. So the end of the day, Derek, is the productivity of the retailer, not the ABR -- and so put those 2 things together, and that's why we're confident with respect to how we run our business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Don, I was hoping you could just spend a little time on the potential life science deal up in Boston. And -- just how are you thinking about pre-leasing and credit underwriting and tenant underwriting for that project? Donald Wood : Yes. It's very fair, Steve. There are a couple of things to think about there. The business is not a pre-leasable business in large measure. So there's no question that as we underwrite the risk, as we underwrite the dollars, the cost of capital, we will expect a higher return to compensate for the inability to the likely inability, you never know. But the likely an ability to re-lease the building. What we're thinking about with respect to that opportunity is what is pretty demonstrably a pocket of much more than 1 building. It could be more than 1 building for Federal in time. We would expect it to be already, as you know, BioMed has begun gun construction and Greystar right there has begun the construction. So the notion that Assembly is likely to be a cluster of life science has grown dramatically. Over the past year or two. That's a really important component in terms of who's going to wind up there. Actually, one of the interesting things would be when you look at the number of companies that have been developed on the life science side over the past few years, it's pretty dramatic, and demand is just -- demand is off the charts relative to the supply, even though there's supply coming on in other parts of the Boston market. So together, the short answer to your question, Steve, is the return has to be able to compensate for the spec nature of it, as well as the undeterminable at this point of credit quality of the tenants that have come. Steve Sakwa : And as a follow-up, would you contemplate sort of joint venturing with a more established life science player or you -- or ground lease it? Or are you pretty much committed to going in alone and keeping it for yourself? Donald Wood : We've considered all of those opportunities, and we've decided to do it ourselves, and we've decided to do it ourselves in large measure based on the team that we were able to compile in terms of not only the general contractor, but the designer, but the operator and all of the individual components of it as well as our team up there. So we've created a lot of value at Assembly and over 15 years in that project. We want that value fully recognized in our incremental investment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Connor Mitchell : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So with the depreciation of the strong balance sheet, how can rising rates impact, if at all, the developments going forward? Daniel Guglielmone : With regard to what? I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you repeat it? Connor Mitchell : Yes. I think a better way to ask the question might be, whether you see rising rates within the development and then also or material cost and inflation as a bigger issue for impacting developments? Daniel Guglielmone : Look, there's no -- we expect and I think before we go forward, we lock in prices to the extent we can with the GMP before we start. I think what we've seen is because of the strength of the markets that we're in. We benefited from increasing rents, which have kind of offset kind of costs as it relates to rising TIs, tenant improvement dollars. And that's why we've been able to maintain the yields and deliver the yields that we set out to achieve. And we won't start something unless we've got those costs locked down to a large extent. And there's an important follow-up in that. It is, while you kind of globally talk about, we kind of globally talk about our development pipeline. Every project has to stand on its own. If the rents are not -- certainly a higher cost of capital, to your question, right, and long-term cost of capital is the way we look at it. There a higher cost of capital has to be supported by cost that work in there and rents that we're confident we can achieve. And when you think about the primary markets where we're doing that, Boston, Massachusetts, San Jose, California, Montgomery County, Maryland.  You're talking about markets that heretofore and I don't expect it to change based on job projections and economic projections in those markets. We're able to push the rents to be able to compensate. Does that continue forever? Your guess is as good as mine because we make those decisions on a one-off basis. But right now, everything we see in those markets suggest that rent will compensate for the higher costs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thank you. Just wanted to touch on the funding side of the equation for acquisitions and how you guys are contemplating that given your cost of capital? And if you can give us a sense of where debt costs are today relative to still the strong pricing for acquisitions and how you think about kind of your mix cost of funding your weighted average cost of capital? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Look, I think in the last -- yes, certainly, in the last 90 days, cost of debt capital has kind of gone up. So obviously, that -- which is up our weighted average cost of capital. I think with regards to --. Juan, can you repeat the question? We're -- start over with the last part of it there. Juan Sanabria : Sure. Just curious on how you plan to fund what seems like a still a very active acquisition pipeline, given where leverage is today and just get a sense of how you're thinking about where you could raise debt out to if we think about match funding? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Look, I don't think that is a big component of what we're looking to fund growth going forward. We've got $175 million of forward equity still ready to be taken down. We've got in process and under consideration $150 million of dispositions that were sub-5 cap and on deck after that, another $100 million to $150 million of dispositions. We are thinking about to take advantage of a strong environment. So I think that, that balanced with a higher cost of debt capital currently is something we will take into consideration. Jeff, do you want to add. Jeffrey Berkes : Yes. And one other thing to keep in mind here, too, whether it's an acquisition, a redevelopment or a development, we've never been a spot capital price of our investment opportunities. We've always looked at our long-term weighted average cost of capital. So when interest rates are really low, we weren't chasing acquisitions, for example, down into the low 4 cap range, simply because they were still accretive and with increasing interest rates and increasing debt costs, we don't really expect that to impact our ability to perform in the market for that reason. We always have maintained a very strong discipline on looking at kind of the long-term cost, not the spot cost. Juan Sanabria : And then just as a follow-up question, just curious on the small shop side, as you're thinking about merchandising space in the centers but also thinking about maybe we see a potential recession we'll see. Does your strategy change about the types of tenants maybe more national with regards to the small shop space? Wendy Seher : I would say that the short answer is no. We really take a balanced approach, sort of like what we were talking about before our overall business plan is growth in various areas from our core through developments to redevelopments to acquisitions, and I like to apply that same philosophy to our leasing, where we're talking about growth whether it's through merchandising, whether it's through investing in the properties, whether it's through selecting tenants that also want to invest in themselves.  We're seeing a huge amount of investment with tenants and us together, and that creates a better result. And we like the balance, again, intertwining with the community of that local flare, mom-and-pop, best-in-class as well as the regional and national as well. So I think we'll continue to take that balanced approach. Jeffrey Berkes : And we're sticklers, too, on working through a tenants\u2019 business plan and looking at their credit and also securing the lease in the right way, regardless of what's going on in the economy. So we don't relax as our standards when things were good. So I wouldn't expect us to do anything any differently like Wendy just said. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hey good morning. A couple of question on redevelopment here. Don, the enthusiasm in turn, it's clear, demand is strong rents rising and you're adding to the redevelopment pipeline. I guess I'm curious -- how close are you to maybe getting back to the pre-COVID game plan of $300 million to $400 million of annual redev debts funded by free cash flow as well as incremental debt and opportunistic sales here? And what's the right way to think about redev spending as we move into this higher cost and higher interest rate but higher rent backdrop? Donald Wood : Yes. No, Haendel, I love the question. It's -- it is -- the answer is driven by opportunities. And one of the things that has become pretty clear to us post COVID, and I think Wendy talks about this all the time to me. So it's kind of stuck in my head. The demand and the conversations with tenants has, in our view, what we've seen is they are more important in terms of who the landlord is than ever before. So to the extent that landlord is investing, not only in the asset alongside that tenant to be able to create a better and place-making is a big part of it. No question. Convenience is a big part of it. No question. To create a better environment, that's a here to stay. And you know what will stop that, Haendel, if we can't get paid for. But effectively, everywhere we've seen so far where we are laying out an aggressive redevelopment plan, improvements to the property, the impact on the leasing has been very clear. And when I say the impact on the leasing, I'm talking if you're interviewing leasing agents and understanding from their point of view, what the deals look like, what those bumps look like?  You know what Dan talked about higher bumps. That's not an accident. That has to happen, commensurate with a tenant conversation that -- where they are confident they're going to be able to afford that and continue to pay that. And a key part of that is what are you doing as landlords to the shopping center post-COVID. So I don't -- the days of kind of milking your -- just kind of milking the shopping center and our milking the cash flow from the shopping center without a significant investment. I'm not sure -- I'm not sure this industry goes back to that. And to the extent you do that, the differentiation between great properties and not so great properties gets wider and wider.  So as you think about the next few years, and a return to normalcy from a demand and a supply perspective, ask yourself where you're likely to be able to push rents and get paid if your shopping center is materially better than the competition. And that's kind of the way we think about it. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. Any desire to perhaps provide some guideposts on how we should think about redev up spend here as we move into the next few years? And then can you remind us what estimated value of the assets in your -- sorry, in your portfolio that can be sold on a maybe tax neutral basis to fund acquisition development. I think a few years back, that number was close to $400 million. Obviously, you've sold some -- just curious on where you think that is today? Donald Wood : I think that the last part of your question, it's -- that's about the same. I wouldn't see that very differently. Yes. No, that's kind of what I got to say on it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please proceed with your question. Chris Lucas : Just one quick one for me. Dan, on the percentage rent number for the quarter, it was roughly almost 2x what it was pre-COVID in the first quarter. Just curious as to whether that growth came from more leases running into the over the break point and generating percentage rent or those that have been in percentage rent continuing to sort of just add to the contribution to percentage rent. Just trying to understand where that increase is coming from? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Look, the increase is partially being driven by just better tenant sales across the portfolio. And it's -- there's two different parts. We have the -- the leases that were restructured were collecting a percent of rent, and that shows up in the collectability adjustment. The percentage rent that's in that line item that outperformed pretty significantly is really just, I think, a combination of a few more deals that are leases that are percentage rent deals as well as just higher performance from those leases over time. I would expect that first quarter number, not to be typically, we're around 1% to 1.25%, we're at 1.5% today of revenues. I think that it's in that 1% to 1.5% over time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : In past presentations, you've shown retail format by the percent of 2019 POI contribution. Just wondering as this trend line has normalized and demand is higher now, have those contributions changed at all materially? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes, there's really been no material change to those figures. Linda Tsai : Got it. And then you have a few tenants that have chosen your assets, your office assets like NetApp, Splunk and PUMA as their headquarters. Was this the strategy you had in mind when you develop these office spaces or was it just more product -- byproduct of having new and desirable amenities? Donald Wood : Yes. Well, I mean, look, we always hope that we have the best credit tenants take the entire building, and we're done in 5 minutes. And so that's always the hope of the strategy, the more likely result is what has happened. Now those are great companies, all of those companies, all of them look to the amenitized base, look to the ability to retain the track workers as critical to their decisions. That's not a surprise. That's been in the strategy from the beginning. That will continue to be. And I think you'll see that that's where we'll end up with the other stuff that's not leased up yet to date. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Looking forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT. Please reach out with any meeting request, and thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode, a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host Leah Brady. You may begin. Leah Brady : Good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.

If you have additional questions, please requeue. And with that, I will turn our call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah and good morning, everyone. An all-time record quarter for us in a number of important respects, none more important than bottom line earnings. At $1.65 per share of FFO, the 2022 second quarter handly beat our previous record of $1.60 posted three years ago in the second quarter of 2019. Even when adjusting for COVID one-timers, second quarter FFO per share matched that previous high watermark. Lots of things going very well here at Federal. We did more deals both on a comparable basis and overall in those 90 days than we've ever done in our company's 60-year history. We continue to lease up our development pipeline and increase our occupancy percentage. We ended the quarter at 94.1% leased. We've added multiple new strategic properties to our portfolio that have clear paths to future growth. And our balance sheet remains strong with $177 million of cash on hand and zero drawn on our $1 billion line of credit at quarter end. As we've been saying all along, the execution of our multifaceted business plan, which in these uncertain times does not rely on a big bet on any one particular income stream, continues to set us up extremely well for the future. The quality of our assets, combined with our sector-leading demographics and high barrier markets tend to outperform through economic cycles as has been the case every time in the last 25 years. So check this out because we did just get new demographic data in as of August 1. So within three miles of our centers, there are 175,000 people on average, that's 68,000 households, 68,000 households, right? $150,000 of average household income. That equates to $10.2 billion of spending power within three miles of our shopping centers. And more than half of those people have a four-year college degree or better. Who else can say that? It's about that spending power that's critical in uncertain times in my view. And cyclicality of the economy is far different than the unprecedented restricted market shutdown due to a global pandemic. They're different. Perhaps the best way we can demonstrate our confidence in the portfolio is by standing behind and in fact raising our dividend to shareholders just as we have each and every year since 1967 -- 1967. That's 55 years a totally unprecedented track record among REITs and among most companies in any industry, one that speaks to the commitment to our owners and to the quality of the income stream. At an annualized rate of $4.32 a share, that's a 4.1% dividend yield at the current share price pretty darn strong for a company of this quality. Okay. Let's start with leasing during the quarter. Over the last decade average second quarter production for comparable properties at Federal meant doing a little less than 100 deals for just over 400,000 square feet. In the 2022 second quarter, we did 132 deals for 562,000 square feet nearly 40% more than the average. And we've never come close to doing 132 deals in any quarter. But the fact that demand has remained this heated with a deal pipeline that looks to stay strong, speaks volumes about our properties and the markets that they're in and naturally about future earnings growth. So, one of the reasons Dan is again raising annual earnings guidance $0.23 at the midpoint. So, one of the more underappreciated phenomena of the strong demand is that, we're able to be more proactive in terms of leasing space that's not yet vacant. While that leasing doesn't immediately show in the occupancy stats, it will mean, less downtime in the future and shopping centers that are merchandised with more relevant tenants sooner than they would otherwise be. The portfolio was 94.1% leased and 92% occupied at quarter's end with continued improvements expected by year-end particularly on the small shop side. At 89.3% leased, small shop space is a remarkable 580 basis points higher than the COVID low-point. Our stepped-up post-COVID reinvestment effort is another critical component to future growth. It's no news to anyone on this call that the traditional generic and homogenous shopping center business is cyclical in nature and not a high-growth business. So you have to stand out to outperform over cycles. You do that by picking the right markets and positioning and merchandising in those markets, but you also have to reinvest to continually find the edge. Reinvesting is more important now than ever before. It's why we have nearly two dozen active and meaningful development projects in planning or underway totaling over $100 million this year and next which will likely yield double-digit un-levered yields over the ensuing years through higher customer traffic and rents, in line with our historically observed results following property improvement projects. That reinvestment is one of the primary reasons we can continue to push rents. Leasing has been exceptionally strong at our newly development assets also, from the completion of CocoWalk, to the office projects at Pike & Rose, to the residential over retail at Darien and to the residential and office Phase 3 at Assembly Row each of these additions have exceeded our post-COVID expectations in terms of lease-up pace. In the case of the residential product at Assembly that's exceeded in both pace and rental rate. Now the one exception is Santana West and there's no question that the cooling of the technology sector in the last 90 days both in terms of their stock prices and getting employees back into the office has been a wet blanket on what had been strong leasing momentum. It has therefore been difficult to bring fully negotiated deals over the transom. Disappointing yes, but important proper perspective having a brand-new state-of-the-art office building adjacent to one of the most successful amenity-rich destinations in the tech capital of the country, isn't so bad. Particularly, since it only represents about 2% of Federal's asset value and will be an important driver of future growth when it hits. It's a matter of time. Stay tuned. We've also remained active on the acquisition front. Following the end of the quarter, we completed the All-Cash acquisitions of two very special properties in two of the markets where we're focused on expansion. The Shops at Pembroke Gardens a 392,000 square foot dominant retail center on 41 acres at the corner of I-75 and Pines Boulevard in Pembroke, Pines, Florida, as an important asset to our portfolio eight miles south and west of our equally dominant Tower Shop Center in Davy and 20 miles north of our newly completed and highly acclaimed CocoWalk mixed-use destination in Coconut Grove. Our ability to remerchandise and push rents potentially add density down the road and fortify federal as a must talk to player in South Florida, were all considered in this important acquisition. The $180 million purchase will generate better than 5% return in year one with a very strong going forward NOI growth that will produce an IRR well in excess of our cost of capital. Across the country in Scottsdale, Arizona, we were able to acquire the 214,000 square foot office building directly adjacent to our Hilton Village, property giving us over 1/3 of a mile of continuous -- contiguous frontage on Scottsdale Road, immediately across the main entrance to Paradise Valley, the region's most affluent in our view underserved community. The integration and rebranding of these properties as one along with the proximity of work home and retail and restaurant amenities in this post-COVID environment is expected to allow us to create a seamless modern environment that will support greater rents and higher long-term occupancy. This $54 million acquisition will yield 6% in year one. And like Pembroke is expected to provide very strong NOI growth that will produce an IRR well in excess of our cost of capital. These two acquisitions along with the previously announced 410,000 square foot Kingstown Shopping Center, in Northern Virginia represent a combined investment of $435 million at a 5.25% yield in year one and more importantly very strong IRRs on three dominant retail destinations in three particularly fast-growing markets from a good job\u2019s perspective. Okay. It's about it from my prepared remarks this morning though I want to leave you with one final thought before turning it over to Dan. Investing decisions grow tougher as economic uncertainty increases and real estate investing is clearly a cyclical business. It's why the underlying business plan of this company has always contemplated cycles in its investment strategy. These are the times when well-leased well-located dominant retail and mixed-use centers in supply-constrained affluent densely populated markets and submarkets shine. Whatever it is to come economically over the next couple of years Federal is well positioned to outperform. Dan? Dan G.: Thank you, Don and good morning, everyone. As Don outlined, the record $1.65 per share reported FFO for this quarter blew way our expectations and consensus by over 10%. As in the first quarter our outperformance was across all aspects of our business continued gains in small shop occupancy; stronger performance in our residential portfolio; surging parking revenues and gains in percentage rent; underscoring continued momentum in consumer traffic and tenant sales; higher collections than forecast both in the current and prior period; and larger term fees, offset by higher G&A and interest expense. While some of these items can be considered timing related or nonrecurring, the Lion's share of this outperformance is driven by continued strength in our in-place portfolio which drove another increase in our guidance. Let me spend a little time here, highlighting some metrics, which demonstrate this strength, led by our dominant mixed-use properties. Near-record parking revenues, a strong indicator of consumer traffic at our mixed-use assets was a near record $3 million for the quarter, up 80% over second quarter 2021 levels and up 25% sequentially over the first quarter. Percentage rent, an indicator of tenant sales strength was up over 90% on a comparable basis and up 18% sequentially on a rolling 12-month average. With respect to specific tenant sales metrics, at Assembly Row, reported tenant sales were up 13% over 2019 pre-COVID levels and are up 10% sequentially on a rolling 12-month basis versus first quarter. At Santana Row, tenant sales were up 13% over 2019 with traffic up despite the impact from work from home. The Pedestaro [ph] tenant sales were up 9% over 2019. And Pike & Rose reported sales are up over 5% and versus 2019 levels with consumer traffic of almost 10%. These data points all serve as a testament to the relative strength of the consumer in our high income, highly educated densely populated high barrier markets. Again, markets that have demonstrated resilience over cycles and the ability to outperform during cyclical downturns. Very different than the pandemic-related market-specific government shutdown. As a result, our comparable portfolio growth metric was again sector-leading at 8.2% for the quarter. Comparable growth excluding prior period rent and term fees was 9.5%. As we highlighted last quarter, a cash basis same-store metric would have been 9% and 10.5% excluding prior period rent and term fees. Term fees this quarter were actually up, up to $5.6 million versus $3.4 million in 2021. Prior period rent was down to $3 million versus $6 million in the second quarter of 2021 as adjusted to reflect only COVID-19-related prior period rent payments. Year-over-year, occupancy results were also strong, as our overall occupied metric grew 240 basis points year-over-year from 89.6% to 92% and our lease percentage increased 140 basis points from 92.7% to 94.1%. We should continue to see upside in those metrics, as we realistically target 94% to 95% for occupied and 95% to 96% for leased. As we have now had eight consecutive quarters of above-average leasing activity, we are continuing to see strength and we're continuing to see strength in our leasing pipeline as it's never been this full. The volume of deals in process are up 15% versus pre-COVID 2019 levels and are as strong as they were last year at this time when we had a record year of leasing volume. While deals in the pipeline still need to be brought to completion, demand is broad-based across tenant categories as best-in-class retailers all look to expand and upgrade their real estate footprints within Federal's best-in-class portfolio. And again, we had strong, solid quarter achieving sector-leading rent bumps. And we continue to drive average annual contractual increases in the 2% to 2.5% range across all our leases anchor and small shop. Now let's review the math once again. For every one percentage point more in annual rent bumps, the ending rents in year 10 will be 9%-plus higher over a 10-year lease, plus you are collecting more rent along the way. Contractual rent increases do matter. With respect to our residential portfolio, it now stands at 98.5% leased on a comparable lease basis, and 97% leased overall when you include the new 500-unit Mocella building at Assembly Row, which we expect to stabilize this quarter. We hadn't expected Mocella to stabilize until late fourth quarter and it is now achieving higher rents and lower concessions than we had underwritten. And despite this competition from the new 500 units next door, our existing Montage residential tower at Assembly is almost 100% leased and saw a 23% rental increases during the second quarter. Now on to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity. At June's quarter end, we had $1.2 billion of total liquidity with an undrawn $1 billion revolver and $177 million of cash. Additionally, we have over $400 million of non-core dispositions under consideration with pricing expectations at a blended cap rate in the sub-5% cap range. We closed out our remaining forward equity this quarter, issuing $177 million of common stock at a net price of $120 per share further bolstering our liquidity. With respect to our leverage metrics at quarter end, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now down to 5.8 times annualized for the quarter as we continue to target a ratio in the low to mid-five times range over time. Our fixed charge coverage ratio increased to 4.3 times comfortably above our targeted level, and 93% of our outstanding debt remains fixed rate. Our significantly derisked $700 million of in-process pipeline of active redevelopments has $340 million remaining to spend, much of that being tenant improvement dollars tied to tenant leases. Now on to guidance. Given the comprehensive outperformance during the quarter across all aspects of our business, we are increasing our guidance by roughly 4%. That's $0.23 at the midpoint to a tightened range of $6.10 to $6.25. $0.01 to $0.02 of the $0.23 increase is from our recent purchase of Scottsdale Forum in Phoenix and Pembroke Gardens in South Florida and their roughly half year contribution to 2022. The balance is from another quarter's outperformance and a better than forecast outlook for the rest of the year in both the comparable and noncomparable pools. This guidance assumes ranges of $1.48 to $1.55 of FFO per share for both the third and fourth quarters, which reflects an increase over our previous guidance for those quarters. We are also bumping our forecast for comparable POI growth to 5.5% to 7% from the prior range of 3.5% to 5%, a 200 basis point increase for the metric. Excluding prior period rents and term fees, our comparable POI forecast increases to 7.5% to 9% from the prior range of 6.5% to 8%. While the cadence may be a little choppy, we continue to expect our occupied rate decline from 92%, where it is today, up into the 92.5% to 93% range by year-end. As we continue to get tenants open, on time and on budget overall, a testament to the capability of our legal leasing, tenant coordination and property operating teams. Now I don't want to just highlight those specific groups at Federal, let me take a little bit of time to thank and congratulate all 320 employees at Federal for their tremendous effort over the last two-plus years working intelligently, creatively and tirelessly through an unprecedented -- the unprecedented challenges of COVID, but also for driving to achieve a record quarter in funds from operations for the company. For many of us here at Federal, it really means something to be part of a company that stands alone in the REIT sector with a 60-year public history coupled with a 55-year track record of increasing dividends. In celebration of both of those milestones, members of the Federal team will be ringing the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange this afternoon. And lastly, during the quarter, we released our annual corporate responsibility report. It's available on our website. I encourage all to give it a read to appreciate the long-standing and established commitment to sustainability, our communities, our corporate culture and our strong governance practices that we have at Federal. And with that operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good morning. Goldfarb. First, enjoy the bell rings today. And Don, I have to say your decision during the pandemic to not cut the dividend certainly paid off. So that's the decision on your part, but I guess well done. Two questions here. First, as you guys are looking certainly you've expanded into Arizona, into Florida, what's going on with the tenants as far as -- are there regional tenants which you would have normally seen in like your home base is in New York or Bethesda Mid-Atlantic or San Francisco et cetera that really aren't down in Florida or Phoenix and you see an opportunity to bring tenants down where people who used to live in your home markets have moved down, or is your view that because the country has become so sort of homogenous that there's less opportunity and as people move to new markets, it's not as though they're really missing that many of their home stores or home restaurants or whatever it is? Don Wood : Listen Alex first of all, I got to really thank you for that comment on the dividend because we in this company believe what you just said in terms of its importance more than a lot of people for whatever reason. So yeah, we're real proud to have be able to raise the dividend every year since 1967 and that includes COVID. With respect to the question on demand and regionalization of tenancies, there are absolutely tenants that are looking for new markets to expand into and particularly the well-capitalized companies to be able to do so. What is always important to us, and I know you've heard this before, but it's so true is the merchandising of those centers. So when you look at CocoWalk and you look at the mix of regional tenants, but also really important local tenants that make the place special. The secret sauce is the mix that happens. And yes, we will have success effectively getting any particular tenant, with the wherewithal to be able to demand to the extent, we can show them a profitable opportunity in a new market. And I think we can do that. I think we do that well. Jeff? Jeff Berkes : Yeah. Alex, it's a bit of a two-way street, particularly between Arizona and California. And what we found during the last year or so since we've been in Arizona, there are relationships our leasing people in California can bring to the leasing team that's running our Arizona properties. And in addition, particularly in the food space, whether it's Quickserve, or sit down, or some other type of specialty food, there are some really good operators in the Phoenix Scottsdale market that we're now closing to our California portfolio. So it is a two-way street. Some real advantages, there to the expansion. Alexander Goldfarb : Okay. And the second question is, Don you mentioned, Santana West looks to be sort of on pause as far as the leasing and what's going on with tech. Elsewhere in your portfolio, where you have office are you seeing a similar slowdown or an acceleration as more people look to work remotely or work in suburban settings? Just curious, if Santana West is a read-through to the entire portfolio or stands in contrast to the portfolio? Don Wood : Yeah, it's a great question. And the two places in particular, where we continue to lease up office products both at Pike & Rose, and at Assembly, nothing has changed. They are \u2013 there is still that strong demand and we're running out of product. At the Choice building, which is the one that Choice has taken about 40% of the building for, we've got really good activity moving along in the rest of that building and that feels great. And just one other comment on Santana West man, Short Silicon Valley gets our own part. The \u2013 there's no question that a pause caused by getting people back to work, and what's that going to be, and what our space needs are going to be at the same time, those stocks have been hammered. I mean you as a CEO, any of us a CEO would sit back and take pause about that. But when you think about that particular product in that particular place and what is likely to happen, you have to be positive about that. I don't know, Jeff, you got anything really to say further on that. Jeff Berkes : Yeah. Let me add a little bit to that, Alex. And let me also maybe clean up a bit, where you started too. You mentioned San Francisco is one of the markets we're in. We're not in San Francisco. We're in Silicon Valley, and there's a big difference between the two. And a lot of people read headlines on watching news, and hear about things that are happening in San Francisco, and attribute it to the whole Bay Area and this. Yeah, it's just not accurate, if you will. San Francisco is still struggling mightily through some social issues that are making a return to office and office leasing very difficult. And that's not really, the case in Silicon Valley. And we're not taking a pause on leasing, if you will. We're out there working as hard as we can to lease a building as quickly as we can. Year-to-date the Silicon Valley Class A office market has absorbed 2.8 million square feet of space, vacancy is 12%. If you include sublease space, I think it goes up to 14%, which historically for Silicon Valley is not great but nationally, those aren't bad numbers. And last quarter, there was 1.8 million square feet of positive net absorption and four big leases between 150,000 and 380,000 square feet that accounted for 1.1 million square feet, of that positive net absorption. So I think what's happening now is -- and it's going to be choppy for a few quarters, and I think we're probably going to see more sublease space come to market. The companies are really struggling with a way to get their employees back to work, and figure out what the appropriate locations and space needs, are for those employees. And I think we're going to see some downsizing -- and perversely, that might work to our advantage in Santana Row. You remember NetApp, took 700 Santana Row, because they downsized out of multiple buildings that were not state-of-the-art, and not fully amenitized. And there's other tenants in the market right now, that are thinking about doing the same thing. And when you look at one Santana West, it is the only way fully amenitized Class A, building of size in Silicon Valley. So well I think, it's like Don said, disappointing that we're not leased yet. We're working hard on it, and we're confident about it. And when you step back and look at the rest of our portfolio, excluding one Santana West and 915 Meeting Street, which is still under construction, our Class A office space and our other office space and our mixed-use properties, is 95% plus leased. There is a very strong positive reaction, whether you're a small tenant or a large tenant to officing in properties, that offer a full range of amenities close to where you live, which is why we bought for down in Scottsdale. We can talk about that further, if you want but I just wanted to make sure you got the full kind of detail on the, what's going on in the portfolio and our thinking going forward on one Santana West. Operator : Thank you Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with BofA. Please proceed with your question Craig Schmidt : Thank you. Good morning. I'm just wondering, if the second quarter results are really highlighting the difference in dealing with the COVID market pressure, versus dealing with a challenging interest rate and inflationary market pressure? The former, you have very little control, but the latter would seem like whether it's your first ring demographics, or the qualities of your center you're able to put up more of a challenge to it. Don Wood : Thanks Craig, for the question. And look man, consumers have to be able to consume. And at the end of the day, that means you got to have money to spend. That means, there's got to be great product out there. What I think is really -- and obviously I think, this about federal is that we don't go all in on any one particular format. We don't go all in on, any one particular market. . And so the notion of, the sector-leading demos. I mean, I've said in the prepared remarks, think about this, $10.2 billion worth of spending power, within three miles of this portfolio's assets. That's a crazy big number. And so does that help you work through good times and bad times and higher interest rates and inflationary pressures? Of course it does. It's not a leap. And I think that's got more to do with this performance and the performance that whatever that might be over the next few quarters or a few years than anything else. Craig Schmidt : And what are you hearing from your tenants that are taking space now? The challenge being there's a possible recession soft or otherwise. We still haven't solved inflation and yet they're taking space. So, what are they telling you that they're seeing that gives them the confidence? Don Wood : Do you want to do that? Wendy Seher : Sure. Thanks Craig. Basically during COVID and post-COVID, the retailers confirmed that their greatest customer acquisition tool is the right location. And so they are focused on that to set the stage for growth continuing, especially with more relevant tenants and the savvy tenants and there's a sense of urgency in getting the right real estate. And we're seeing that in our performance, we're seeing that in our pipeline, and we're seeing it on our varied shopping center opportunities that we have with all -- it's not just value-based, it's not just service-based, it's all across the sector full-paced apparel and value as well. So, we are seeing that sense of urgency on setting their fleet in the right direction for the growth and being able to go through what is normal cycles and being able to mitigate that downside. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : Hey good morning. I just wanted to go back to the leasing during the quarter in the pipeline. Looking at the stats you guys had a healthy amount of renewals there. I'm just kind of curious from a tenant perspective, how much of that is being pulled forward as tenants want to lock in rates today in anticipation of maybe higher rents in the future? And how you're balancing that financial tenant mix and credit versus kind of downtime of re-tenanting? Wendy Seher : Yes, I think what you're -- I don't know that I focus 100% from quarter-to-quarter on renewal rates and whether they're slightly up or slightly down because they all have a way of working themselves out throughout the year. But what I will say is that we are seeing a tremendous amount of retailers within our portfolio that want to had those discussions a little bit earlier because they want to invest in their store. They want to make sure that they have the term because they see the value of the real estate long-term. They want to invest and that's -- we're seeing it as a very positive momentum and we're also investing in a big way in our shopping centers. So, the partnership together has been very strong. Jeff Berkes : And it is a robust discussion. There's obviously tension, particularly, in an inflationary environment where we're pushing hard to get the kind of increases during the term that Dan talked about in his prepared remarks and not give an excessive amount of term when we're in an environment like this. So, it's a healthy conversation. It's not unusual. Every lease negotiation is tense and Wendy and her team and the folks on the West Coast do a really good job of balancing everything they need to balance to make sure we have the right people in our properties that are investing in their operations and we're getting the best economic deal possible. Don Wood : I guess, Craig the only thing I would add to that and I do think this is such an important component of the negotiations are the bumps during the term of the lease. And I mean, I know, Dan goes through the math of what it means, but when you think about inflationary time and being able to push three and sometimes four and sometimes better annual bumps into the lease that getting that along the way is a whole lot better than sitting there and looking at a flat lease and maybe getting 7% after five years or something like that. So I don't know the best way that you can understand that or compare that. I don't think we found a good way that that can be compared, but I know it's a critical focus of the company. And because the real estate is really good we have probably more success that way than you would otherwise think. Craig Mailman : That's helpful. And then just a guidance question. The lease term fees in the quarter looked like they added a couple of pennies on a sequential basis. Kind of, what's the impact of that in the full year guidance raise? I mean what are you expecting the back half of the year? Dan G.: The back half of the year, I think, is probably back -- looking back to the last year in line with our last year's performance in the second half of the year. We're ahead. We're probably $0.02 to $0.03 ahead in terms term piece and that's reflected in the guidance. Craig Mailman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Samir Khanal : Hey, Dan. Can you help us walk through, sort of, the 2023 growth at this time? On the one side you've done a great job on the leasing front right? The leased versus occupied that pipeline is pretty solid here. But on the other hand, you have potential headwinds from closures. Santana West it seems like maybe getting pushed out a little bit here on the timing perspective. I guess how are you thinking about growth today versus a few months ago? Dan G.: Look I think that we've have been really pleasantly surprised with how strong the performance has been. This is the first time I've been here since my six years at Federal where we increased guidance to this magnitude in consecutive quarters. We've increased to $0.10 one quarter and then $0.23 the next. The $0.05 to $0.10 guideposts that we provided previously we're off of previously lower guidance. I feel comfortable with that guidance with kind of where 2023 is off of that. I think we're going to take a step back with regards to 2023 and provide formal guidance at the normal timing. We still expect to see strong internal growth in our portfolio, but we'll provide more detailed formal guidance at the appropriate time in line with the industry in February. Samir Khanal : Okay. Thanks for that. And I guess Don just on the acquisition of Pembroke Gardens and with the 41 acres that comes with that property just curious is the near-term goal more of a merchandising play at this point? Just trying to figure out the near term and maybe kind of what the long-term focus is on that just initial views? Don Wood : Yeah. There is -- this piece of land is what made us so darn interested in this thing. If you kind of see where Pines Boulevard and I-75 come together, there is no good product out there. There is -- there are amazing traffic counts. And so we love what we've got in place albeit you will see remerchandising as the primary way we create value over the next few years. Having said that and you know as well as I do, big pieces of land things happen that you can't underwrite initially. And I know if you go and spend some time at the property and the surrounds and you look at housing stock around there, you understand the traffic patterns, I think you'd be salivating for the possibilities over the mid and longer term even beyond the remerchandising of the asset. But that's what it would be for now, Samir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to touch -- go back and apologies if I missed this. Is there any update in terms of the rent bumps you are getting in the strong leasing environment with regards to what you have on the books and have historically achieved? Don Wood : I don't know if I'm allowed to say this or not, so I'm looking at Dan and Melissa, because we do try to take an accounting if you will of how many of our leases have 3% bumps, 4% bumps, flat, whatever is happening internally in the leases. And I can tell you that over the past two years basically, what's happened coming out of COVID not the beginning part of COVID but coming out of COVID that the percentage of our deals that are -- that now have stronger than 3% bumps is up about 20% from where it was. So the notion of being able to do more of those deals, which is bringing up the overall portfolio to over 2% annual bumps as Dan said before. So the trend is in the right direction and it's been a major focus. Juan Sanabria : Great. And then just on the Phoenix office acquisition, I was just hoping you could maybe spend a little bit more time on outlining a plan there and how that's integral to retail and if that's going to be redeveloped as well potentially down the track? Don Wood : Yeah, let me give you a couple of things. I'm sure Jeff will have more on this. But I personally couldn't be more excited about this. First of all Hillan Village, which we bought last year, I guess a little more than that now at this point. We just see very strong re-leasing potential to make it much more of a specialty shopping center with a higher end tenant because of where it is. Our first 12 months of leasing or so there has validated that that's what's happening. So with respect to that first acquisition, we are more than pleased with the basic thesis for buying it. When this office building adjacent to it, which is a very attractive office building, but frankly lease in a very pedestrian way, we think we can do the same thing on the office side to make it way cooler to the right type of tenant base that would -- that's the same tenant base that we're aiming for in the adjacent retail property, putting those two things together, especially in a post-COVID environment where individuals and companies in the area are looking to be closer to home with an amenitized environment we feel like there's great upside all while yielding over a 6% yield while we do that. So, I love the idea of being able to not to take our vision for the retail and effectively expand and integrate what it is with the office building which really is building directly adjacent to it. That's the thesis for what we're trying to do here. Jeff Berkes : Yes. Juan, it's Jeff. And I'll just add a couple of things. One, owning those properties together is synergistic in both directions. So, we can certainly offer the office tenants. The amenities of Hilton Village is we make the project look and feel like one project and market them together and upgrade the merchandising and food offering at Hilton Village, like Don mentioned. But on the office building is also good for Hilton Village, because we just picked up a ton of parking that we can use nights and weekends to support more intensive uses at Hilton Village. So that's great. And then second, just kind of on a stand-alone basis, when you think about Forum, we bought Forum for roughly 60%, 65% of replacement cost, 85% leased at rents that are probably 10% to 15% below market, with a weighted average lease term of less than five years. So, by upgrading the building and applying creative intensive leasing effort to it, we think we can really bring those numbers up and make the return much, much better than it is today. So, on its own, we think we made a real great real estate deal. There's a couple of buildings in that market that traded recently. We're a local developer that's done something similar to kind of Class B, B-minus buildings and much, much lesser location than Scottsdale Road across the street from Paradise Valley and those buildings sold basically a replacement cost at sub-5% caps recently. So we think the institutional investment market appreciates real estate like this, and we think we made a very good buy and really happy to have it. And like I said, when I was answering Alex's question, we've proved multiple times now that amenitizing office space making a great space and having it in close proximity to decision-making -- decision maker housing is a real win for us. So, just really happy with the deal. Operator : Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Hi, there. Hi. Good morning. Don, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how being an all-cash acquirer has given you maybe an edge in the acquisition market here in terms of maybe [indiscernible] closed? And is that something you expect to be able to continue to use for advantage near term? And I noticed that there aren't any acquisitions contemplated in the second half guide here, curious, what if anything is interesting or perhaps under discussion out there? Thanks. Jeff Berkes : Yes. Hey, Haendel. It's Jeff, again. We are obviously in a market where there's less certainty than there used to be. So, having the ability to close all cash and not have to tap the secured mortgage markets is definitely an advantage as a buyer. That combined with really a two-decade track record here of being very transparent with an intermediary and an owner about what we'll do and what we won't do and how things are going along the way and ultimately doing what we say we will do, gets us deals and gets us deals at better prices than other people have to pay. So we kind of like the type of market we're in right now. We think there's going to be more opportunities but I'll let Dan answer questions about our go-forward guidance on that. Don Wood : Before you do, I want to add one thing to that Haendel, and I really do think this is important. We've talked about this in the past. When you look \u2013 when you have multiple ways to grow and you don't want to rely on any one thing you don't turn those switches on and off. And when it comes to acquisitions, this is one of those examples, where yes, you can turn it down, when there's uncertainty of the pricing or turning up when effectively you think you can get a good deal. But it is that ability to be in the markets regularly, not just on the publicly marketed stuff. In fact, hardly in the publicly marketed stuff but the ability to do what you said you were going to do. When you turn that off for a couple of years and turn it back on, it's not much different than the dividend in our view then you are looked at differently than when a seller knows you're going to be there and do what you say you're going to do. So I think that is as much of an advantage as being an all-cash buyer is in fact I think it's more important. Sorry, Danny go ahead. Dan G.: No. With respect to guidance, we do have a pipeline and we do expect to be active on the acquisition front but be disciplined, but we don't provide guidance for speculative acquisitions or dispositions, when they happen we update guidance to reflect that. So yes, there's no forward-looking acquisition or disposition impact on the guidance we have. Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Thanks. And maybe one more just on the slow rent. You've been able to get them \u2013 I guess the stores open on time, get the store rent in. I guess, I'm curious if you're seeing any signs of the delays from labor shortage supply concerned. And on restaurants and particularly, some concerns in certain pointers about getting some of the equipment in place, which could be impacting the timing of certain things. Thanks. Don Wood : Haendel, it's a great question and it's been a critical focus and frankly a worry of mine for the past year and half or a little bit more. I don't exactly know beyond more beyond our approach to it. Why it has not been the problem that I worried it was going to be but it has not been. We found alternate solutions. In a number of cases it's been job number one for the operating team, the tenant coordination team. The ability to effectively do things different than the lease contemplated in order to get a restaurant open or a store open have been critically important tools. And that again is a relationship part of our business. It's a critical part to it. And so when I look at have we been hitting our opening dates. The answer to that is yes, we have. And it was the single biggest thing I was worried about coming into 2022. So it's been handled I think pretty darn well, even though the spector of delays, kitchen equipment and other things is certainly still out there. Dan G.: I think it's evident in our in our metrics. The fact that with record leasing volume, we're tightening our spread between leased and occupied. So we're getting tenants open. And I think that's again in my prepared remarks I mentioned and gave a shout out to the strength of our legal leasing, tenant coordination and property operating teams they've been really successful on average getting tenants open on time and in many cases ahead of time and on budget. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. You called out the strength of parking revenues and percentage rents. Has that continued into August? And how sustainable is the run rate achieved in the second quarter? Dan G : Well, we would expect kind of given traffic in July was strong as well where we have parking revenues coming in. we hope that it continues to be sustainable. I mean, I think, the traffic volumes at our big mixed-use properties where we can charge parking revenues. We see that being a consistent source at least through the balance of the year. Don Wood : Michael I think the only thing I would add to that is -- so where it comes from as Dan just said, are only a few of our properties and they're the big ones. And the -- if you think about those properties particularly Pike & Rose and Assembly Row those properties have matured into critical places in their communities. So it's not just about coming out of COVID. It's about these are now community centers if you will. And so I would expect the traffic comparisons period over period to continue to increase. As we've seen -- we've seen in July too, obviously, we're in the beginning of August. So we've seen that same thing at Pike & Rose and Assembly in July, relative to the July of 2019. So I'm very much positive or hopeful that it will continue. Michael Goldsmith : That's helpful. And my follow-up is, just given the strength of all of these factors that you've noted, how should we pair that with the implied same-store property NOI growth guidance for low single digits in the back half? Dan G : Well, I think the comparison or kind of the implied slowdown in the second half of the year is really difficult comps in the second half of the year plus, the week of prior period rent and kind of a pretty modest forecast for turn fees in the second half of the year. Hopefully we can outperform that but I think that -- those are the big headwinds particularly prior period rent. We've got some pretty tough comps in the third quarter and even fourth quarter of last year. Operator : Our next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Hi everyone. Thank you. I'll try to get creative most of what I wrote down was asked. So your 2022 equity issuance guidance, I think it moved back to $350 million at the midpoint from $450 million last quarter. Just wondering, if anything drove that? I mean, does it the share price related, or should we read through that maybe 2022 acquisitions are pretty baked in at this point? Dan G.: Yeah, I think with regards to -- we are making progress and we've kind of pivoted and I think elevated our discussions and our activity on the disposition front. And given the visibility we have kind of as the year goes along, I think that dispositions can serve as a surrogate for kind of raising equity. And given that visibility, we're tempering kind of the expectation of raising equity, plus given where we're -- our equity has been traded. So, we've raised the lion-share of what we expected at a very strong blended price. We basically contracted for that all last year in 2021, when our stock price was obviously at a different time. Really pleased that we did. And I think it positions us -- we look to be very balanced in how we approach financing the business and feel very, very fortunate that we're as well positioned to continue through with the equity that we raised over there throughout COVID. Derek Johnston : Okay. Great. Thanks Dan. So, some investor pushback, I hear on federal and has always been the high ABR, right? But despite the economic backdrop right and really even more importantly elevated vacancies across your peer set, you've continued to grow rents. So how do you kind of respond to that? What is it really attributable to? And anything -- any thoughts there I think are helpful. Mike Ennes : Tenants need to make money. Rent is one component of their expense structure, to the extent they're doing the volumes and trading value, they'll pay the rent. And with us it's not just about, beating on that tenant for rent we are partners. And so, the notion of making that shopping center or a mixed-use property, the best place the go-to place is just a critical part to what we do.  I mean if you think about it Derek, the 580 basis points increase since the bottom of COVID in terms of small shop occupancy, up almost 600 basis points. That is only because there is demand from people who have a chance to get into a federal center who could not get into it before because of the high occupancy and are willing to pay that because they're going to make money when they pay that. It's really not much more than that and I know there's always focus on our ABR. I've been here 25 years there was focused on our ABR, 25 years ago. It's -- they're better assets man. And those tenants can make money at those levels. Operator : Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks and good morning. A quick one first. What has your retention ratio been historically? And where do you see that for the remainder of the year? Dan G.: Yes. I think historically it's kind of been in and around 65%, 70%, but we have seen better this year, better retention rates north of 80%. So, we're pleased with that. Tenants have been successful at our centers. They want to stay they want to renew they want to exercise options and they want to continue to make money. Ki Bin Kim : And going back to that previous question about profitability I mean that makes sense, right? It's not just sales yet to be profitable. Any high-level metrics you can share in terms of how much more profitable, do you think tenants can be at your centers versus some other centers on a just low rent basis? Yes, just trying to get a sense of what -- how much mode of safety there is for tenants to continue to pay these higher rents? Don Wood : We keep in. I'm just looking at Wendy's here, because I don't have a metric that I can give you. What do you think Wen? Wendy Seher : It's the consumer spending power. It's the demographics that Don mentioned in his opening remarks, which is the quality of the real estate in the demographic markets with high average household incomes that have the ability to spend. So that's a critical component when they're looking at these markets. The other piece of it is, the history. If you can go into a center, as Don said, you haven't been able to get into Federal Realty Centers always, and they have a history of performing, and there's value in that and that's recognized, so that's why we've been able to keep up this leasing demand is partly, because there's -- this need to get -- they might be doing less locations, but they need those locations to perform. And they're willing to make a higher spend in order to make sure that there's confidence that that store will be profitable. Operator : Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Linda Tsai : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the quarter's leasing strength, I know you discussed the philosophical bent of tenants being able to make money at your centers. But where are you seeing the outsized demand? Is it a certain tenant type or regionally based? Don Wood : No, Linda, it's broad, it's broad. I mean, we see it at the mixed-use centers in particular, because they were hurt the most during COVID, but it's everywhere throughout the portfolio. I don't have a better market or a worse market for you in terms of the ones we're operating in. Just please always remember, this is still a very local business, and it comes down to the specific shopping center and the specific tenant base in that shopping center. And I think I leave it at that. It's broad-based. Linda Tsai : Thanks. And then in terms of BioMed Realty getting construction financing for the first phase at Assembly Innovation Park. Does this give you more conviction towards a large lease for a life science tenant assembly row, what would you be looking for to proceed with more confidence? Don Wood : Oh, please let me just correct the premise. We could not be more confident in Assembly Row as a life science destination for many, many years and decades to come. We're just at the beginning of that. All we've done at this particular time, given the uncertainty in the venture capital market and what's happening there is to hold back and see where things become a little more certain. Certainly, great for BioMed in terms of being able to raise that capital. I wouldn't be -- I'd be surprised if they couldn't frankly given the Blackstone involvement too. And we will be -- I mean, there will be a life science building done by Federal Realty on that site at some point. But prudence and capital allocation at this point suggest that we said on the sideline BioMed make a little further. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. Dan I think you were talking about cash collections in the quarter running at a higher level. Can you talk about what the level was in Q2 maybe how compared to Q3 -- Q1? And is the higher level continuing into the third quarter? Dan G.: Yeah, we're essentially back to normal, back to pre-COVID collection levels, on the current period collections. We're effectively above 99% overall in collections in the second quarter. So I think that is faster than we expected, faster than we had forecasted and we expect that to continue. There's a normalization in that part of the business with the added benefit of continuing to collect rent from prior periods. But we're back. Mike Mueller : Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question. Chris Lucas : Hi everybody. Talked a lot about the leasing strength on the retail side. Just curious as to how you described the leasing strength on the residential side and what the rent growth has been in your portfolio on a year-over-year basis? Don Wood : Let me go on the three big properties -- or actually four big properties, if you throw in Bethesda, Chris. Let me go in order. Unbelievable at Assembly Row, 20% plus. Dan G.: Yes. Don Wood : 23% increases in rents. Just what's happening at Assembly Row not just on resi, but on office, on retail as such a critical place in the marketplace, it's really impressive. And so You should be very optimistic about the future including rent growth future rent growth at Assembly. Santana Row? Jeff Berkes : Equally. The -- again that's the place you want to live and I don't know where we are on rent growth there\u2026 Dan G.: Mid-teens. Don Wood : Mid-teens on there. And looking extremely strong. Pike & Rose, the demand is there but we're still just about out of this COVID cap on the amount of rent increases that there can be. So it's artificially been kept down. But you could see it from the occupancy. And we know in terms of the demand to be able to move into the space is that once that cap is lifted, which should be hopefully later on this year. You'll see similar demand there. These are the type of properties people want in it. And it's the same as on the office side. It's you got to make the money after you spend all that time and effort on creating the street in the place by getting it done upstairs too. Chris Lucas : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just on the Plaza El Segundo consolidating your ownership position there. I guess just curious is there anything operationally that improves what drove the timing just a little bit of background on that? Jeff Berkes : Yeah. Chris this is Jeff. So we have two individuals that when we acquired the asset, I guess, the very last day of 2011 decided to stay in the deal and they've been in the property with us as partners since that point in time up to a few weeks ago. They both decided they wanted to exit for their own personal financial reasons. They had no day-to-day involvement in the running of the asset we reported to them on a regular basis and that was about the extent of it. So nothing changes at pause again those related to how that's run or leased. Don Wood : We got it at an attractive return. Operator : Our next question is from Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Paulina Rojas : Good morning. You talked about the names you're seeing in resi. Is it possible to have a notion even a range for how we think property NOI trending on the same property basis not for your office on resi segment? Is it also in the high teens? Leah Brady : Paulina, we're having a hard time understanding you. Can you try to say that quarter again? Paulina Rojas : Yes. Can you hear me now? Don Wood : Yeah, that's better. Paulina Rojas : Okay. Yes, I was saying that is it possible to have a notion of how is same-property NOI trending for your office and resi segments? Don Wood : Same-property NOI for office and resi? Jeff Berkes : They're trending up. we don't have those -- and we don't publish those. But we can -- but they're certainly heading and they're modeled and forecasted to continue to trend up. Don Wood : And we can talk offline about that Paulina. We can get a little more granular on that with you. Paulina Rojas : Okay. Thank you. And then the other thing is how you provided any reference for how much of your signed but not open leases are scheduled to come online in 2023? Dan G.: Yeah. I think what we have in our existing kind of comparable pool is about $23 million of incremental rent which have come online over about half over the balance of this year and half in 2023. We have another $15 million of signed not occupied in our non-comparable pool, which should come online probably similarly. And then -- so I think most of the Lion's share of that will be over the next six quarters in terms of contribution to our POI line item. Operator : Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Tayo Okusanya : Yes. Good afternoon. First question, thank you for the update on just life sciences at Assembly Row. Curious, if you could also give an update on life science potential at Pike & Rose at this point? Jeff Berkes : Yeah. The -- as you know, when I think about that market I don't think that market is as advanced in terms of demand and supply as Somerville Massachusetts is but it sure is on everybody's radar screen including ours as to what it is that we can do there. So we're having conversations with a number of people there none of which are far enough for us to really say anything more about it. But when you think about life sciences as another use as a component at a place like Pike & Rose. I mean, it's a distinct possibility. It's going to come down to economics. And will the incremental rent be enough to support the construction of that product type at Pike & Rose. And we don't know the answer to that yet but we're certainly in the heavily exploratory phases to find out. Q \u2013 Tayo Okusanya : Got you. And then second of all some of the mall REITs and open air center guys are kind of at that point where they are renegotiating a lot of the short-term percentage rent deals back to, kind of, more traditional leases. Are you guys kind of running up against any of that at this point? And does it kind of change the dynamics of what the retail component of your income could look like in 2023? Wendy Seher : So I would say that most of our percentage deals that we were working on during COVID have all burned off and we have established new deals moving forward. So we are not still working on a tremendous amount of renegotiating post-COVID. This is more kind of looking forward and doing new deals based on the environment that we're in. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call over to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : We look forward to seeing everyone this fall. Have a great rest of the summer and thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead. Leah Brady : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call, are Don Wood, Dan G, Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements. And we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued this afternoon, our annual reported filed on Form 10-K, and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Given number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question and an appropriate follow-up during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have additional questions, please re-queue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks, Leah. And hello everyone. Well, consumer spending remains very strong in the major submarkets where federal operates, particularly in our mixed use properties, and has resulted in another quarter of outperformance in terms both executing long-term leases as well as bottom line earnings. 126 executed long-term leases for 585,000 square feet of space, an FFO per share $1.59 were both above external and internal expectations and continue to signal strong demand for high quality retail and mixed-use real estate. The future pipeline appealed not yet executed also remains robust and as such will be raising 2022 guidance again. Demographics matter, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Past cycles have convinced us that families simply have to have money to spend for retail real estate cash flow to grow. 68,000 households with annual average household incomes of $150,000 sit within three miles of federal realty centers. That's $10.2 billion of family income generated within a three mile radius, and more than half of those people have a four-year college degree or better. I know of no other significantly sized retail portfolio that can say that. It's manifesting itself in a myriad of ways, including a wide variety of tenants who are seeing their sales exceed the over trend threshold in the lease. Although not a huge absolute number since we strive for strong fixed rent in our leases, the broad based over trend contribution in the quarter, particularly among our restaurants and soft goods tenants over and above the fixed rent, is notable and contributed an additional $0.02 per share compared with last year's third quarter. As I said, strong core leasing remains the engine that drives us. Over the last decade, pre-COVID, that's 2010 through 2019, average third quarter production for comparable properties at federal meant doing 88 deals for just over 400,000 square feet. In the 2022 third quarter, we did 119 deals for 563,000 square feet, 40% more than the average. Annual rent bumps of our retail leases average about 2.25% overall and higher when including office leases. That's a powerful advantage over the typical shopping center portfolio. The fact that demand has remained this heated with a deal pipeline that looks to stay strong, speaks volume about our properties and the markets they are in and naturally about future property level operating income growth. It's one of the reasons Dan is again, raising annual earnings guidance $0.12 at the midpoint. The solid tenant performance also manifests itself in continued occupancy gains as tenant failures remain low. Our current year lease rate is now at 94.3% and occupied rent rate now at 92.1%. Those leased and occupied rates are 150 and 190 basis points respectively better than a year ago and there's obviously still room to grow there, particularly on the small shop side. At 89.9% leased small shop space is a remarkable 640 basis points higher than the COVID low point with further gains expected by year-end. I referred earlier to the outsized demand that we see at our mixed-use properties. Note that the retail component of our four large ones Assembly, Pike & Rose, Bethesda and Santana are 98% leased at quarter\u2019s end. In addition, we continue overall to hit or beat targeted delivery dates. One of our key corporate goals for 2022 and a real tribute to our tenant coordination and construction teams, I'm as convinced as I've ever been that we have the right product in the right locations with the right demographics for the inflationary economy that we're in. And by the way, with a well demonstrated 55 year respect for the dividend component of our total return, a dividend yield of 4.3% for a portfolio of this quality seems awfully compelling to us. And against that backdrop, we've also been able to sell a couple of non-core assets at good pricing and refinance and upsize our term loan and line of credit to be sure that we have plenty of balance sheet flexibility and dry powder for whatever the economic environment feels like in 2023. In terms of capital needed for our large development projects, we have less than an incremental $225 billion to go, about $100 million to complete the Choice Hotel, headquarters building at Pike & Rose. A $100 million largely for tenant build out commissions at Santana West and $20 million to complete Darien Commons. By the way, after the quarter, just last week, we just signed a 52,000 square foot lease with a credit tenant bringing that building at Pike & Rose to over 60% pre-leased. Those products alone will be contributing an incremental $40 million in operating income in years to come. Investing in these and other projects, both large and small with fixed rate debt and equity before the recent rising rates will serve us well in the coming years as these state-of-the-art buildings begin cash flowing. Similar to development, our pro rata share of the acquisitions that we've made since the beginning of COVID through today totaled $850 million. Those acquisitions from Grossmont to Camelback Colonnade, the Pembroke Gardens and so forth, are performing well ahead of our expectations in the aggregate and are expected to yield in the mid-60s in 2023. In that same time period, we generated over $400 million in proceeds from non-core asset sales at a sub-five cap. That capital recycling was not only immediately accretive, but the medium and long-term growth rates of our acquisitions, net of dispositions are clearly superior. Okay, that's about it for my prepared remarks this morning though, I'd like to leave you with one final thought before turning it over to Dan. In our view, the recent run-up in interest rates was inevitable, but not necessarily at the pace we're seeing, while sure to pressure everybody's earnings to some extent in the years ahead, how much so and for how long remains to be seen. So the real question is, will property level operating income more than compensate. These are the times when well-leased, well-located dominant retail and mixed-use centers in supply-constrained affluent, densely populated markets and submarkets shine. We're in a cyclical business, no news to anyone. And it's why our business plan has always included multiple ways to counter the rise in money costs and the effects of inflation. The combination of best-in-class shopping centers along with acquisition and development property level income contributions financed with money from an earlier time, along with the potential sale of certain assets, including discrete residential buildings within our portfolio, gives us more flexibility and more tools with which to handle cyclical pressures than most. We look forward to the challenge. Dan? Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. For another quarter, strength and resilience of our portfolio has exceeded expectations. With FFO per share of $1.59, we beat a strong comparable from third quarter of 2021 by over 5% and beat consensus by $0.06. And once again, we saw broad strength across all aspects of our business driving this performance. Continued gains and small shop occupancy, strong tenant sales driving higher percentage rent, continued increases in customer traffic resulting in another uptick in parking revenues, strengthen our residential assets and better collections than forecast, although offset by higher property level expenses and higher interest. Let me add some color to these items. Small shop leased occupancy basically hit 90%, up 60 basis points over 2Q, up 380 basis points year-over-year and up to a level not achieved since 2017, but still not back to targeted levels. Parking revenues, a strong indicator of consumer traffic at our mixed use assets continued higher up 8% sequentially over 2Q and 33% year-over-year. Percentage rent, an indicator of tenant sales strength was up over 31% sequentially and almost double third quarter 2021 level. Same-store residential POI was up over 10% year-over-year. On the other side, we did start to see some inflationary impact on operating expenses in the quarter as OpEx grew by 10% over 3Q 2021. However, we estimate that roughly a third of that increase is non-recurring and it is all predominantly recoverable from tenants. Despite coming off a strong comp in 2021, our comparable growth metric for 3Q was a solid 3.7% well above forecast. Comparable growth excluding prior period rent and term fees was 6.3%. On a cash basis, our same-store metric is 5%, excluding prior period rent and term fees, our same-store metric is up to 8%. Year-to-date comparable POI growth is a sector leading 8.8% and almost 10% on a cash based same-store metric. For those of you that track it, term fees this quarter were $1.3 million, up from $0.5 million in 2021, but down significantly from the second quarter\u2019s $5.6 million. Prior period rent was $2 million, decreasing $4 million relative to the third quarter\u2019s $6 million level. Again, this is adjusted to reflect only negotiated prior period rent payments relating to COVID-19. We did another exceptional quarter of leasing a record for any third quarter, giving us nine consecutive quarters of above average leasing activity and not by a little bit by over 25% on average over this nine quarter period and 40% this quarter. Furthermore, our pipeline remains as robust as we\u2019ve seen it. Currently exceeding both second quarter of 2022, third quarter of 2021 levels at this juncture in the quarter. Our rent rollover metric was 3% for the quarter with rollover gains for deals in our pipeline, indicating a much more robust outlook in future quarters. We also had another solid quarter achieving sector leading rent bumps, as we continue to drive average annual contractual increases of 2.25% for retail leases only for banker and small shop-lended and as a result our rollover on a straight line basis is 13%. And I know, I\u2019m repeating myself, but for every 100 basis points higher in annual rent bumps, the ending rent will be 9% to 10% higher at the end of a 10 year lease. Hence, a portfolio with 2.25% rent bumps and 3% rollover is the equivalent of a portfolio with only 1.25% rent bumps and 12% rollover, plus the 2.25% rent bump portfolio collects more along the way. With respect to our balance sheet, we made significant progress during the quarter in enhancing our liquidity and financial flexibility. Just after quarter end, we closed in a comprehensive refinancing which increased our unsecured bank capacity by over $0.5 billion, from $1.3 billion previously to $1.85 billion today. And a combined revolving credit facility and term-loan, both of which we expanded. We increased our previous $1 billion revolving credit facility to $1.25 billion, extending the term to April of 2027 with two six months options out to 2028 and transitioned the base rate from LIBOR to SOFR and we doubled the size of our existing term loan from $300 million to $600 million. This term loan has an April 2024 maturity with two additional one-year extension options, which take us out to 2026 at our options. The interest rate here also transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR. As a result at closing of the facilities we had $1.4 billion of total liquidity including the $1.25 billion available on our undrawn credit facility. With respect to leverage metrics at quarter end, our net debt EBITDA ratio is roughly six times annualized for the quarter and adjusted for asset activity. Comfortably within the range of our ratings and we continue to target a ratio in the low-to-mid 5 times over time. Our fixed charge coverage ratio rests at 4 times and additionally we sold two assets one retail center and one residential asset during the quarter for a total of $67 million at a blended five-and-a-quarter cap rate. And we're in process on an additional asset sales totaling over $350 million in potential proceeds at a blended cap rate that is sub 5%. Having non-core assets including residential, that we can sell at extremely attractive valuations even in this environment there is an error in our quiver that most retail companies do not have. Onto the remainder of 2022 given another quarter of outperformance and a strong outlook for 4Q, we are increasing our guidance from $6.10 to $6.25 to a tightened range of $6.27 to $6.32 per share, an increase of $0.12 to the midpoint or 2%. And this is on top of two other guidance increases earlier this year in the first half, which brings our year-to-date total increases and guidance to $0.45. Current 2022 guidance implies 13% growth over 2021 at the midpoint despite over 200 basis points of headwinds from prior period rent. We are also bumping up our forecast for comparable POI growth to 7% to 8% from the prior range of 5.5% to 7%. Excluding prior period rents and term fees our comparable POI forecast increases to 9% to 10% from the prior range of 7.5% to 9%. We continue to expect our occupied rate decline from 92.1% today, up to around 92.5% by year end. And please note that our recent third quarter acquisitions weighed on our occupancy growth during the quarter. This guidance assumes a range of a $1.53 to a $1.58 of FFO per share for the fourth quarter. With respect to 2023 we will be giving formal guidance on our call in February, but let me provide some commentary for you to consider. Our $600 million term loan is floating rate. We have consciously decided not to hedge the rate to maximize our financial flexibility to be opportunistic and the timing of refinancing on a longer term fixed rate basis. Its interest rate is set; the term SOFR is adjusted plus an 85 basis point spread which is 4.7% today. Also note while our only debt maturity in 2023 is $275 million of unsecured notes with a June maturity, it does have a 2.75% interest rate. We again expect prior period rents and term fees not to contribute in 2023 to the level they did this year while the impact will not be as material as it was this year. And G&A which is running at $13 million per quarter currently is expected to increase in 2023 using \u2013 use $14 million, per quarter is a good placeholder for now. As a counter to these trends, our core business continues to show significant strength given over two years of above average leasing volumes with relatively little impact from failing retailers over the last year. We expect to see POI in 2023 continue to show strong momentum driven by solid comparable growth continuing in 2023 and the existing portfolio driven by 220 basis points of signs not occupied upside a robust current portfolio of new leasing. As well as growth in the non-comparable portfolio, particularly at the recently stabilized Assembly Row Phase 3, 100% lease 909 Rose at Pike & Rose and the 100% lease CocoWalk. Despite uncertainty in the economic outlook for 2023, POI growth will be robust and should provide momentum to counter inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. And with that operator you can open up a line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey good afternoon. So Dan, just wanted to go back to the rent spreads because this is something you guys have talked about over time and certainly looking at your spreads in the quarter, they're not \u2013 they're low but the FFO growth is high and I'd rather have FFO growth than rent spreads. So can you just sort of give an overview of how we should think about the interaction between rent spreads in FFO? And then I think you said that you're every year the embedded annual bumps are 2.5%, but one, I just wanted to validate that number; and two, is that just small shop or is that also in like the junior anchors and some of the bigger format retailers? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Now we'll go to rent spreads to FFO first. The rent spreads we announce are for deals that are signed during the quarter. They will not start for the next year or two, so there's obviously, and that's just one component of how our company grows, which is what the rent spreads are. As we said we also grow rents from contractual rent bumps, which we'll get this year, it is two-and-a-quarter percent retail leases only both anchor and small shop blended that we see in our portfolio, a little bit higher, if include the office leases where we get a little bit higher bumps. Alexander Goldfarb : And the second question goes back to the guidance that you gave a few quarters ago on 2023 and 2024. Obviously this year has really outperformed and it's hard to believe that the metrics for 2023 and 2024 sort of stuck in the ground and that this year has come up but it's just going to flatten growth. So is that really the case? Like we should think about it flattening growth versus the goal posts that you guys laid out a few quarters ago, or can we think about 2023 and 2024 those goal posts moving up as well? Dan Guglielmone : Look, we provided goal post or guide posts that that got us to 2023, and we've hit that here in 2022. We're going to provide guidance in 2023 on our February call, but one thing I will tell you is we will see really, really good and strong robust property operating income at the property level in 2023, and we'll continue to see growth coming from our non-comparable portfolio, coming online as well contributing and that obviously in this environment we'll have to counter inflation on operating expenses and we'll look to counter the impact of interest expense. Jeff Berkes : And I would just add Alex to the implication of your question, which I understand an let me just say there are two things when we gave that those goal posts back there, it was obviously based on the timing of the recovery. As you said the timing of the recovery has clearly been faster and that's great news, but also to your point not only the timing of the recovery, it's been the strength of the recovery. So I would expect that POI growth and the property level to be even more robust than when we set those guideposts back in \u2013 whenever we set them in 2021 or 2020 effectively. So at the POI level, you're darn right this business is performing as good or better than it ever has and a lot of that's post COVID. Obviously we got to deal with the current macroeconomic situation in terms of interest rates and all, but overall your point is a good one that that not only did we get there faster, we got there in 2022 verse 2023, but if you were to reset today and look at those POI goals that those goals are effectively even better with respect to the core portfolio because of the strength and the leasing over this period of time. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. We have definitely witnessed your properties and your trader performing well in an inflationary environment. I'm wondering how do you think it might perform in a recessionary environment? Dan Guglielmone : Well, yes. I don't think there's a lot of wondering about that. If you take a look at history, obviously this isn't the same as the great financial crisis. It's not the same as the dotcom crisis of 2000, 2002 Craig. But it is clearly a period or going into a period of reduced economic activity, call it what your will. It's why we own the properties we own. It's why the demographics we believe are incredibly important going forward. So what those exact numbers will be and what they're \u2013 what the future holds and in terms of both inflation and reduced economic activity, I firmly believe we'll outperform. And I believe that just as we have in past cycles, because the affluent, the density and the barriers to entry of where we are, I go back to those numbers because they\u2019re so important. When you\u2019ve got $10 billion of income power within 3 miles of a shopping center, it\u2019s very hard to imagine that that\u2019s not going to be a significant advantage in both an inflationary environment and a lower economic activity environment. So I like this on a relative basis very much. Craig Schmidt : And I agree with you. There\u2019s definitely a tale of two cities when you look at different income cohorts and how they\u2019re spending. But I\u2019m wondering if your centers have also benefited from what we\u2019re seeing is people are more actively pursuing experiences, travel it\u2019s held up well. People paying very high rates at vocation, hotels just frankly the socialization and the experience that at your shopping centers may also be benefiting from just the consumers wanting to get back to that aspect of their life. Don Wood : Craig, it\u2019s hard to imagine that\u2019s not the case. We\u2019re taking this call today from Santana Row out in the middle of Silicon Valley. There\u2019s always confusion is Silicon Valley, the Bay Area and the stuff that you hear about San Francisco, it couldn\u2019t be \u2013 40 miles is a 1,000 miles away in terms of markets. I\u2019m looking out on this street right here, if you saw the activity, if you saw the restaurant numbers in particular that are generated here, it goes to validate your point critically. We\u2019re seeing the same type of thing in those restaurant numbers at Assembly Row and at Pike and Rose. And so the notion of the combination of those type of properties along with a very substantial grocery anchored shopping center portfolio together, I think makes your point crystal clear. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, Dan or Don or Wendy, just as you talk about the leasing pipeline, I was just wondering if you could add a little bit of color on the types of tenants that you\u2019re seeing, if there\u2019s any regional variation. And I guess, as you think about the upside in the portfolio, where do you think the lease percentage can ultimately get back to and when does the \u2013 I guess the gap between leased and occupy close more significantly? Wendy Seher : So I guess Steve, I\u2019ll take the first part of that question. And as you\u2019ve heard in our remarks, the pipeline that I\u2019m seeing is really strong. What we\u2019ve just accomplished in the quarter and frankly the last 12 months by taking our small shop and increasing it by 380 basis points over a 12 month period is remarkable and proud of the team, of course. And just speaks to the real estate. As I look at what we\u2019ve been doing, I mean, we\u2019ve had everything from Atlanta to Nike to Dave\u2019s Hot Chicken seems to be the big one to Petco to very broad based as it has been, frankly, in the last several quarters. So again, seeing it \u2013 and the other piece of this that is really positive is the activity that we\u2019re seeing and the challenges that we\u2019re having, both on the retail side and on the landlord side is costs of construction with the relationships that we have and the amount of tenants that we\u2019re dealing with over a period of time and the credibility that we have in the market to do what we say we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019ve kind of been able to put our heads together and figure out how to move forward on a lease, even though some costs can be challenging. And with this transparent approach, we\u2019ve been not only being able to get the rents that we need to have it make economic sense, but we\u2019ve been able to grow the annual embedded increases and the leases that make sense for us. So again, speaks to the strength of the real estate and that buying power within those markets. Don Wood : And I guess, Steve, with respect to the second part of your question, I would very much expect this portfolio to be a 95% plus leased portfolio. Now, the notion of the timing of getting there is dependent on the number of things. First of all, we\u2019re not solely driven by occupancy. We\u2019re driven by economics and value creation. And I\u2019ll give you a perfect example. What happens with the Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s as we go forward? If I had my way, we would get them back as soon as we can and we'd lease them to more productive tenants at higher rents. That's what we'd like to be able to do. Now, that doesn't mean we won't extend one for a year, another year, whatever, but I guess occupancy per se, my point is here is only one consideration in trying to reach the goal. It's not trying to get to 95% no matter who and no matter when. And that's an important thing to understand. And I do think that that's something that we put a lot of weight on the balance necessary to be able to get there. The second thing is obviously the leaks in the bottom of the bucket. What are we going to see over the next couple of years in terms of tenant failures, et cetera? Obviously, we've gotten into this period of time of post-COVID in a better position the industry has because of the loss of weak tenants at the beginning of COVID. And at this point it's still looking really strong and I don't see a lot of leaks at the bottom of the bucket beyond the Bed Bath and always a few small shops, et cetera. But what the extent that's going to be is going to determine the timing of the question that you're asking. I would hope to be there within a couple years. Jeff Berkes : Hey Steve, it's Jeff, I\u2019m just backing cleanup here. We've probably got another a 100 basis points to go to get to where we want to be on our signed not occupied percentage. We're sitting at 220 basis points today, and historically that's been a 100 to 125 basis points. And like Wendy said, we are doing everything we can, working our relationships with not only the tenants but also the people that do the work both inside the company and outside the company to build out space as fast as possible and get runs started. That's really been going well for us the last six, eight quarters. We hope to get that shrunk down in short order exactly when it'll happen. Like Don just said, we can't tell you, but that is a primary objective there. Don Wood : Yes, we've made good progress on that. It used to be north of 300 basis points spread. We've got it down to 200 on our way to that targeted, 100 to 125 basis points. Dan Guglielmone : I guess the fourth matter really is the cleanup matter. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Sorry for long question. Second, just on capital deployment, I guess, Don, how are you thinking or how have you changed kind of your hurdles for either new development, redevelopments ground up or acquisitions? It sounds like you have a pretty robust disposition pipeline at 5%. Don Wood : Yes. Steve Sakwa : But just how are you thinking about unlevered yields for new investments? Don Wood : Yes, well, obviously that's all in that state of flux as the capital market are in that state of flux. So within the context of that, Steve, the bottom line is we're still \u2013 we always through periods want to make sure that the company continues to view capital on long-term weighted average cost basis, not just yield for a particular project at any one time because it's as uncertain in terms of where it's going to end up at this point. We have clearly put the brakes on some of that capital deployment for new projects, unless the project that we're working on is very clearly not only needed for the asset, but very accretive. And that puts it up in those 8%, 9%, 10% ranges to be able to do right now. That won't stay like that forever. We just want more visibility in terms of where that overall cost of capital will end up. And I think you would probably agree somewhere by the middle of next year, we will have an awful lot more visibility than we do today. Steve Sakwa : Great. That's it for me. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Derek Johnston : Hi everybody. Good afternoon. We view renewed office demand as a real potential, positive catalyst for federal, and especially when it comes to investor sentiment. And I think I'd say what we learned exiting the pandemic era is office location, newness, quality operators, they have all seen and, and should continue to see outsize demand. So I guess, how are tours progressing and interest progressing, specifically at Santana West? And perhaps touch on some other assets. And are you more confident on your office component, given what you're seeing on the ground than maybe a few quarters ago or a year ago? Don Wood : Derek, it's a great question. I really appreciate that. Let me start by saying, \u2013 and I've said it a million times, but I couldn't believe it more, all office is not created equal. The notion of having the type of office product that we do, which is solely at our big mixed use development, so therefore solely driven by the retail environment effectively, that is the differentiator here along with new buildings. If there is any demand for office space, how can that not be knowing the economy, knowing the proclivities of CEOs and hiring managers, et cetera, How can that not be the best product available? We remain as confident as we've ever been. As I said, we just signed a lease. I can't disclose who it is at this point. So they tell their employees, et cetera, over at 9 :15 meeting at Pike & Rose. In terms of Santana West, we're not there on anybody yet, but we remain as positive as we ever have with respect to the product. The reason I'm out here at Santana row and why we held our board meeting out here over the last couple of days was to make sure our board saw what we see in terms of the product that we are delivering here and heard from Jeff, who you will hear from here in a second in terms of this environment. You got to be about this over the middle term. Jeff Berkes : Yes, I mean, setting 9 :15 and once Santana was aside, our office portfolio is 97%, 98% leased. And the reason why it is, is because all of our office locations are amenitized, and we've been saying this for a long time, that is the new standard for having office space. If you can't offer your employees amenities, you can't keep your buildings leased. And we have amenities and space at our properties, that's why we're 97%, 98% leased. Big change out here in Silicon Valley. We talked a little bit about this last quarter. But three, six months ago, the big question here was when are we going to get people back to the office? And I think I said on last quarter's call that Apple, Google and others had made the decision to get people back right after Labor Day. And that has in fact happened. If you live or work out here, you notice it when you turn on the TV in the morning and see the traffic stacked up to get over the Bay Bridge, or you drive down 280 past Apple's headquarters, there is a line of people that get off 280 at the Apple headquarters exit. So the conversation has changed from when to what. And the what is all about what do we need in the way of space to right size our requirement and provide our employees what they are demanding, which is state-of-the-art space with state-of-the-art systems and amenities. So the confidence that Don just mentioned is because of that. And if you look around Silicon Valley, there is really only one building that's state-of-the-art with state-of-the-art amenities, and that one is Santana West. So, I wish we could say when we can't, but we remain positive on our prospects to lease that building. Derek Johnston : All right, thank you. Well, we will stay tuned. And I guess, secondly, you mentioned Bed Bath & Beyond, can you talk about the watch list? And specifically for your portfolio, right? And how your centers and tenant exposures may differ from peers, so that it's well understood out there? And thanks guys. Jeff Berkes : Hey, thanks Derek. Yes. No, look with the exception of Bed Bath & Beyond that's probably at the top of our list. We only have about 83 basis points of exposure to them. About 60 basis points of that is to the Bed Bath name. Other than them, nobody else is anywhere close to material in terms of folks were focused on, they were all single digit basis points of revenue. And so there is really not anything that's on the near term concern list for us. Don Wood : Wendy anything you want to add? Wendy Seher : I would say, when I think about Bed Bath & Beyond, look at what we've done over the last, last three, four years or so, which is we've kind of reduced our exposure in that with them as a company, probably about four or five locations, so material. And as I look at what's left, we have three buybuy BABIES that are in good, healthy condition in terms of their productivity from the shopping centers. And we have six Bed Bath & Beyonds and one Harmon. And as I couldn't agree more with Don that although there would be some short term pain, I would be very comfortable controlling all of that real estate. Don Wood : On average those are low rents. They are $15 or so, which given our centers again, on average is fairly low. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Dan, your commentary about 2023 was really helpful. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color about the puts and takes. It looks like G&A is going to be about $4 million higher, refinancing this 2023 bond it looks like it could be about a $5 million headwind. There's also the capitalize interest for percent had less and that's offsetting some of these factors of the growth of the portfolio. So can you just provide a little bit more detail on some of the puts and takes of 2023, so that we know kind of like where the starting point is in our model before we start to kind like model the growth upon it? Dan Guglielmone : Yes, look, I think, you highlighted some of the color I've provided on 2023, we are going to provide more detailed, comprehensive with underlying assumptions on our February call. We're in the middle of our budgeting process. We're not done with that, that we need more visibility. And we'll have more visibility hopefully in three months. And that's when we'll give you that detailed information. And so stay tuned. Don Wood : It's funny. I had a laugh because when we were preparing comments on what Dan was going to say for 2023, I thought he was given too much at that point. But if a heck, we\u2019ll try to get more out of it at this at this point, stay tuned. Michael Goldsmith : I appreciate that. Are you able to at least provide kind of where prior period rents collected are, just so that we can kind of quantify around that? Don Wood : Yes. I think that prior period rent, what we think about and how we're thinking about it currently is what's prior period rent that we expect to collect that's related to COVID modifications that to previous deals with tenants. That's about $8 million to $10 million this year, it's probably going to be probably in and around $5 million plus or minus. Use that as a placeholder for now. We'll have more guidance there. Certainly, a lot less impactful than it was last year in 2021 to 2022. Operator : The next question comes from Greg Mcginniss from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg Mcginniss : Hey good afternoon, I guess. Just looking at residential, comparable occupancy saw a 50 basis point decline year-over-year. Is there any point to there? And then also what level of spreads are you seeing in the residential assets? Don Wood : Yes, it's a great question. So you know what that's about, Greg, is about pushing rents hard, particularly of Fed Assembly. And so we were we lease that up so fast that as the turns happened, we wanted to push rents to find the equilibrium lost as a point or two of occupancy, which is just fine. It's funny when you \u2013 and going back even to Steve Sakwa's question earlier, what should this portfolio be leased at? I always say 95% or so because it's not just about leasing it up and getting the building filled. It's about making the most money with it. And so the notion of testing where the rates are, where they can be, where they should be relative to occupancy, always makes me more comfortable in the 95%, 95.5% range. For 97%, 98%, it feels like we're leaving money on the table. So there's nothing more to look into that \u2013 into it than that. Extremely strong growth, I don't have those numbers actually at either Santana or at Assembly, but they're strong. Jeff Berkes : Yes. The year-over-year revenue growth at our stabilized property at Assembly Montage and our stabilized building here at Santana Row, it's kind of low to mid double-digits, Greg. We do have one hand tied behind that are back a bit in Montgomery County because of the rent restrictions there that were just recently lifted and we are starting to work through the rent rule in the Montgomery County assets. But where we haven\u2019t been restricted, the lease trade-outs have been incredible and the year-over-year revenue growth has been incredible. Also doing a good job managing expenses over the past 12 months so residential has been a great contributor in the company. Greg McGinniss : Okay. Thank you. And then just thinking about tenant retention and the potential for increasing occupancy, looking at this quarter, new leases represented 90 basis points of occupancy, leased rate was only up 20 basis points, though. So 70 basis points to move out during Q3, how is the tenant retention comparing to prior years? And as we look towards potentially more challenged economic environment, thinking in that context, what's driving move-outs today? Don Wood : There's a bunch to unload in that question. And I heard something that you said that kind of that I'm not sure the premise is right. Part of the reason that you don't see occupancy going up as fast as the overall lease volume that we have is because often, we lease space for which there is already a tenant still there. And the way we think you should show it is if it was occupied before, yes, you're showing it in your lease rollover, but it's still occupied. So it's not going to change that occupancy number. That's a much bigger component than any move outs, if you will, that are diluting the occupancy number. So I kind of got caught when you said that, that got stuck in my head. It's the part of your question that I wanted to argue you about. And I'm not sure there was anything else in there for me to answer to. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Mailman of Citi. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Seth on for Craig. I just wanted to go back to your 2022 guidance and the $0.12 increase where are kind of the moving pieces in that guidance? And is there any type of onetime pieces to that? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. With regards to \u2013 we kind of feel as though our 2022 guidance for \u2013 it was just a stronger outlook for the fourth quarter, significant outperformance in the third quarter. I don't think there's necessarily onetime items in there, except for prior period rent and term fees, which really third quarter over third quarter, we're roughly modest and I don't see that. It's just stronger continued expectation that the trends that occurred and our outperformance in the third quarter will continue into the fourth quarter with regards to continued strong percentage rent, continued strength in occupancy buildup, asset in our pipeline, tenants taking possession of space and then, obviously, with some offset to a higher interest rate environment. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for the color. And then just another quick question on Page 25, and this is up on the comparable new lease summary. It looked like the cash rent spreads were 0%, but the straight line was 10%. Is that due to like the type of tenants you're leasing to? Or is there anything specific driving that? Dan Guglielmone : Well, the difference between zero on a cash basis and 10% on a straight line are the rent bumps we're getting. And that's an important component to consider when you think about rollover is not only what is the rent you're getting at least maturity to the new market rent. But what are you collecting along the way? And so the rent bumps that you get are reflected in that straight line rent rollover number and we think that's as important the ramp-ups you get as the rollover you get at least in. Operator : The next question comes from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hong Zhang : Yes, hey, I think you talked about how your typical lease-to-occupied spread is around 100 to 125 basis points. As we think about commencements next year, I was wondering where you think that spread could trend to by year-end. Dan Guglielmone : That's a tough one to guide because one, it's hard to really predict where the lease rate will go. I mean, we can get a sense of when leases will commence and tenants will take possession. So we think our occupied rate should get up towards \u2013 up into the 93%, up towards into the mid-93% range. Don Wood : By the end of the year. Dan Guglielmone : Where \u2013 how much leasing we can continue to do from a leased percentage and what is the holes at the bottom of the bucket where that goes is a little bit more difficult for us to forecast. But we should get back to a more normalized level over time. And I think our goal is to have both components, the metrics, the occupied in lease metric continue upwards, but narrowing it over time into 2024 and 2025, probably in that time frame. Don Wood : I do want to make another point and make sure you're getting the specific \u2013 what this is all about. The difference between signing a lease and getting rent started is all based on the tenant construction and the tenants, the permitting process, tenant coordination process. That's been one of the things that has really dogged this industry for the past three years since COVID, supply constrained environment, the logistical problems, et cetera. So really, what you want is to get that tight because what that means is the time between a signed lease and the time and that rent start is the most important thing. Yes, over COVID, that was going to be exaggerated because you were doing leases in such volume that it took time to get that rent started. But the objective should be to get that number lower and lower, not necessarily to have it as wide as it can be because that to me suggests that we're not getting tenants over. And that's really important. So Dan, answer is absolutely correctly, but I just want to make sure that you kind of get what that metric means on an overall basis and how \u2013 why it's so important for us to get it down to 100 to 125 basis points. Hong Zhang : Yes, agreed. And it looks like you have an option to purchase the remaining interest at Escondido. I was kind of curious if you could talk about the decision to get that option and what cap rate you would think you could purchase it at right now? Jeff Berkes : Yes, it's Jeff. We've had a partner in that asset for a very long time approaching 30 years that needed some flexibility on their exit from the asset. So we structured a deal that gave us the option should we decide to exercise it next year to go ahead and take them out. I think the cap rate that we used to value the asset was in the upper 5s. Escondida has been a great property for us over the years, one of the stronger growers in our West Coast portfolio so little bit of a win-win for everybody there. Operator : The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thanks for the time. Just curious on the guidance for same-store NOI and what has been delivered year-to-date and kind of what the exit implied is for the ex any term fees noise that's caused there, I know you raised the guidance, but just curious on what the fourth quarter implied expectation is with the upward limit of raised guidance you think about 2023? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. The number that we report, which is \u2013 includes the headwinds from term fees and prior period rents. In the fourth quarter, should be about, call it, 3% to 5%, in line with what we did this quarter at 3.7%. Our year-to-date number is 8.8%, which I mentioned, and we provided 7% to 8% for the year. So the 3% to 5% is what is implied in the fourth quarter is what is implied with the overall guidance. And obviously, that will be higher. We expect because of prior period rent continuing to be higher last year than we expected this year should be higher in the fourth quarter than that 3% to 5% range, probably more in the \u2013 something of around 5% to 6%. Juan Sanabria : Great. Thank you. And then just \u2013 this has been asked a couple of different ways, I guess. But for the small shop tenant base, you're basically at 90%. So could you just remind us what the prior peak was, how high that could go. And like out of that small shop tenant space, what is kind of local versus national or regional tenants? And any color on that more local tenant kind of confidence in the credit behind that? Dan Guglielmone : Look, I think we\u2019ve taken advantage of the opportunity on that note. We\u2019ve taken advantage of the opportunity to improve the credit of our small shop tenant base and so forth. And I\u2019ll let Wendy answer that in a second. But let me answer the first part of your question. The peak, which was back pre-financial crisis was up around 94%, I think that 92% is kind of a reasonable targeted level that we\u2019ll try and achieve over time on the small shop side. Wendy Seher : When I think about the small shops, we certainly had, like everyone did failures throughout the pandemic. And what we \u2013 what the result is, post-pandemic is a pretty savvy and experienced small shop that knows how to get through a difficult time. So I think our small shops are pretty on stable ground. Many of them have better balance sheets than they\u2019ve had before. They are quite active in making sure that they\u2019re maintaining their locations with us and growing, and certainly we\u2019ve always felt that that local tenant really brings the color and the vibrancy to the community that we need. So I\u2019m bullish on the small shops. Don Wood : Hey, Juan, I got to add something to this. As I said, the notion of the question means that there\u2019s a premise here that local tenants are poorer credits than regional tenants. And I have a problem with the premise because what we have found is local tenants by and large do whatever they have to do to not lose their space. They\u2019d borrow money from families, they borrow money from other places that they have to do and they keep it going. So if history is any indication here, we would expect to Wendy\u2019s point as to why the small shop, including and maybe especially the local tenant should outperform here is because of those reasons. They\u2019re in places that they don\u2019t want to lose those shops. So they do whatever they can to not lose that spot. Particularly coming out of COVID where there has been a complete influx in new money, in new tenancy and effectively a robust and solidified small shop basin total. Operator : The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good evening. Don, I wanted to go back to some of the earlier cabinets you made on capital allocation. I understand you\u2019re being somewhat opportunistic selling some assets here, which looks like they\u2019ll effectively fund your active redev. But looking ahead and I know the macros uncertainty you have a future pipeline you alluded to, and there\u2019s some \u2013 probably in there with some pretty good return potential. Can you talk a bit about some of those key signals you\u2019re looking for before you start on some of those? And should we expect disposition to be the source of funding? Thanks. Don Wood : Yes, and it\u2019s a great question. And yes, I do, expect dispositions to be a key funding source of it. One of the things we\u2019re talking about in looking now and it\u2019s premature is it\u2019s pretty incredible the value that we\u2019ve created on some of the residential product that we have. And it is such a unique funding source. And again, that\u2019s at our big mixed use properties that that such a critical part to getting these places established and moving them along, and now they\u2019re established. We\u2019ll look hard at does harvesting that make any sense? And so that\u2019ll be a component that\u2019s in the consideration of how to fund. Secondly, the \u2013 when it gets to where to deploy the capital, that deploying of capital is very much dependent on a very localized look at demand. And making the case for the Assembly, life science development building, obviously, we want to see venture capital funding in a better place than it is today. Obviously, we want to understand what the cost requirements of building that are. And so, building by building, redevelopment by redevelopment very localized in terms of that decision making process. But again, the capital \u2013 the sale of particular assets, I just think we have more flexibility and more arrows in our quiver, if you will, to decide how to get that done then most. Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Great, appreciate that. And follow-up on redevs with the focus on Assembly Row where you pause the life sciences projects. Any update to share there? See you have some additional entitlements for more resi. Could we see you or perhaps would you consider prioritizing that over life sciences or anything or office there given the growth and supply in the life sciences market in Boston? Thanks. Don Wood : No update to talk about there. At this point, I can tell you it\u2019s very important to us that the entitlement process not just for that one building, but for the adjacencies to that is completed. We\u2019re working hard on that during this pause period that could give us a whole kind of leg up if you will, when we are ready to move forward again. I also very much want to see what happens next to us with the Blackstone financed life science project to the extent who they land is obviously very important to what\u2019s happening there. So the one thing I know that you can get comfortable with us is that we\u2019re not formulaic in terms of those decisions. They\u2019re very, very much revenue-based based on what\u2019s happening around us at that particular time. So bit more time to go to see what and when there, if you will. Operator : The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi. How much leasing is completed for\u2026 Don Wood : You\u2019re cut out there, Linda. Linda Tsai : Sorry. I said how much leasing is completed for 2023 and what\u2019s that usually like this time of the year? Don Wood : She\u2019s simply saying, of the 1.6 million or so, 1.7 million that we\u2019ve done this year, much of that will start in 2023. I\u2019m not sure how to give an estimate effectively of that. Dan Guglielmone : As of today, we\u2019ve got about 881,000 still expiring and anchor 1.6 million or 1.7 million in total. And obviously we\u2019ve got the leasing that we\u2019ve got done. I don\u2019t have specifically that number. Probably makes sense, we could follow back up with you with regard to specifically how much of that specifically has been leased. Linda Tsai : Got it. And then how much growth should we expect in property operating expenses like insurance, maintenance costs, utilities and repairs for next year? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. I think we need to kind of spend some time getting through the budgeting process, fine tuning that. That\u2019s a tough question today for us to assess. We\u2019re in \u2013 we\u2019ll have that ready and done in January, and hopefully we\u2019ll provide some of that guidance when we provide more formal guidance on the February call. Dan Guglielmone : Keep in mind, most of it is faster to the tenants. Operator : The next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Hi. Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Just kind of given the overall concern of moving into a slower economic cycle, wondering if you could give us any color in regards to what you are seeing in regards to how your customer base is behaving specifically like office. Are they asking for shorter leases? Are they asking for more flexibility in the leases? Are you starting to see more price sensitivity on the apartment side? Just kind of curious, if you could just kind of give us some color about tenant behavior at this point versus say, six to 12 months ago. Don Wood : Yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s all good stuff that you\u2019re asking about. And let me go for a few things that that I\u2019ve noticed along the way. There \u2013 on the retail side, very little difference in behavior in terms of getting those leases \u2013 the desirability of getting the space, and that\u2019s why the pipeline looks as strong as it does. The question there is, it always comes down to what\u2019s the construction of the space going to cost? And because that\u2019s uncertain now in a period of inflation that flows down the process a little bit. And so, from a behavioral perspective, does it \u2013 will it take longer to get leases done? That\u2019s a potential effect of trying to underwrite construction costs primarily, but not got nothing to do with demand. It\u2019s got everything to do with the math of getting that done. In terms of the apartment side, you\u2019re in a period of time here in the markets we\u2019re at where interest rates and home mortgage is going to where they are, make apartments look awfully, awfully attractive. It\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the demand that we\u2019re seeing. I just went to the numbers here at Santana Row. It\u2019s incredible in terms of the strength of the consumer here as it relates to apartment spending and again, the same thing over in Boston with respect to the product that we\u2019re offering there. So, for me it always comes down to does that consumer have the means to consume? I can tell you, we\u2019ve got a couple of shopping centers that are \u2013 where the demographics are below $75,000 of household income. There is no doubt in our mind that those shopping centers struggle more than the ones that have $150,000 and $160,000 of consumer \u2013 of household income. So from our standpoint, this is a portfolio that\u2019s very high quality. We certainly have a couple of shopping centers, a few shopping centers at the lower end, and there\u2019s a demonstrable difference, so that\u2019s how I kind of look at the consumer. Omotayo Okusanya : Anything on the apartment side? Don Wood : Yes, the whole last 6 minutes of the conversation. No, no, very strong demand. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay. All right. Thank you. Don Wood : Yep. Thanks. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : We look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT. Please reach out to me with any meeting request. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Leah Brady. Thank you. Ms. Brady, you may begin. Leah Brady : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Jan Sweetnam and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.  A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance.  Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may materially differ from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.  The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued this afternoon, our annual report on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial conditions and results of operations. Our conference call tonight will be limited to 60 minutes. [Operator Instructions] and with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Well, thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. We ended 2022 on a very strong note and reported FFO per share of $1.58 in the quarter and therefore, $6.32 for the full year, ahead of both internal and external consensus expectations and a precursor to the strong guidance that great real estate with class-leading demographics will allow us to forecast. We're more than a year ahead of where we thought we'd be in recovering from the depth of the pandemic in terms of leasing, occupancy and bottom line earnings. We executed a record 497 leases for over 2 million square feet of retail space in 2022, and the comparable deals were done at 6% more rent on a cash basis and 15% more rent on a straight-line basis than the leases that were expiring. We did that while simultaneously increasing our inherent contractual rent bumps to over 2.25% annually overall.  And by the way, based on what we see looking forward into 2023, at this point, while I doubt that we'll do 497 leases again. I would expect a higher lease rollover percentage in 2023 as continued strong demand and inflationary pressures are helping negotiations. We leased up the portfolio at 94.5% at year-end compared with 93.6% a year before and still have room to further increase in 2023. Most importantly, that intensified focus we've been talking about over the last year or so, aimed at minimizing that difference between percent leased and percentage occupied, i.e., getting tenants rent paying more quickly. Well, it's working.  While our percentage lease continues to grow, up 90 basis points in 2022, our percentage occupied is growing even faster, up 170 basis points in 2022, suggesting some of the quickest times between lease signing and rent paying in our history, a particularly impressive feat during the supply chain struggles of the past two years. So all of these things resulted in 2022 FFO per share of $6.32, 13.5% higher than the year before and right on top of our pre-pandemic record. I know you've heard me say it many times before, but it bears repeating. Demographics matter, especially in times of economic pressure, past cycles have convinced us that families simply have to have money to spend for retail real estate cash flow to grow. 68,000 households with annual average household incomes of $150 to $1,000 sit within 3 miles of federal centers. That's $10.2 billion of family income generated within a 3-mile radius, and more than half of those people have a 4-year college degree or better. I know no other significantly sized retail portfolio that can say that. So it's manifesting itself in a myriad of ways, including a wide variety of tenants who saw their sales exceed the percentage rent threshold in the lease in the fourth quarter. While not a huge absolute number, since we strive for strong fixed rent in our leases, the broad-based percentage rent contribution in the quarter, particularly among our restaurants and soft goods tenants over and above the fixed rent is notable and contributed an additional $0.02 per share compared with last year's fourth quarter and is a continuation of the trend that we've been seeing all year. Now as economic activity falls and higher interest rates affect everything from car loans to mortgage payments to deal underwriting, we would certainly expect to see a slowdown in consumer spending which very well may cause retailer reticence and a slowdown in the period. It hasn't happened so far. Leasing -- that kind of change is pretty obvious. But that's okay. This business remains more solid. And if history is any indication, federals real estate will outperform given that superior demographics, along with a very strong diversification of rent. No one tenant makes up more than 2.8% of our rental stream, and that tenant is TJX. To put a finer point on that, when you think about today's troubled tenants, Bed Bath, Party City, Rite Aid, Tuesday Morning and even Regal Cinemas, of which we have no exposure, all of them combined comprise less than 1% of our 2023 forecasted rental stream. Average in-place base rent at our 9 Bed Bath & Beyond and Buybuy Baby locations is $15 a full. Rental will be more than replaceable as we navigate through the expected bankruptcy process with. We continue to opportunistically prune the portfolio of non-core and slower-growing assets. And in the fourth quarter and the last few days of the third quarter, we sold three smaller properties, all in Maryland, for proceeds of about $135 million at a combined flat 5% cap rate : one, a legacy residential community from Federal's earliest days; the second a Federal developed residential building on excess land in Towson Maryland; and the third, one of our earliest small retail developments in Rockville Maryland. Those and earlier sale proceeds were reinvested into assets like Kingstown and the shops of Pembroke Gardens, which are generating better going-in yields and add significantly better growth process. The ability to sell non-core assets accretively is just one of the differentiating tools that we have to manage this company through economic cycles. And of course, you only need to look at the $600 million-plus construction and process number on the year-end balance sheet to identify a large source of future income, much of at least not yet reflected in the results. Okay. So that's about it for my prepared remarks this afternoon, so I'd like to leave you with one final thought before turning it over to Dan. The run-up in interest rates will surely pressure everybody's earnings to some extent in the years ahead, as included, beginning in 2023. Dan will go through the expected impact in a few minutes. But keep in mind that Federal has been around since 1962 and has raised its dividend every year since 1967. This business plan doesn't need money to be virtually free to thrive. It's proven that. In terms of 2023, know that significant incremental rent from contracts that are already in place, particularly where demand is strongest at our mixed-use operating properties like Assembly Row, Pike & Rose, Santana Row, Darian and CocoWalk, along with a full year of contributions from '22 acquisitions, will more than cover incremental interest and lead Federal to what we believe will be an all-time record earnings year in 2023 with sector-leading growth. Dan? Daniel Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.58 for the fourth quarter and $632 for the year were up 7.5% and 13.5%, respectively, versus 2021. For both periods, we're at the top of our previously increased guidance range. Primary drivers of the outperformance : acceleration in occupancy up to 92.8%, a gain of 70 basis points for the quarter and 170 basis points for the year. Other drivers : higher percentage rent, which more than doubled 2022 versus the previous year; and continued strength in consumer traffic at our mixed-use assets, driving marketing revenues higher. This was offset by higher property operating expenses and higher interest expense. Comparable growth, our GAAP-based metric for same-store in the fourth quarter and the full year came in at 5.4% and 7.7%, respectively, strong metrics despite the negative net impact of prior period rents and terms. On a same-store cash basis, we came in at what we believe to be a sector-leading 5.5% for the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Excluding the negative impacts of prior period rents and term fees, cash same-store growth was 7.8% and 10.8% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. For those analysts and investors to keep track, we had $1.1 million term fees for the fourth quarter against a 4Q '21 level of $1.7 million. Prior period rent contributions related to COVID-impacted negotiated yields were $2 million this fourth quarter versus $4 million in the fourth quarter of '21. Please note that in our investor presentation on our website, there are updated slides plus an appendix which provide all of these figures. Don already highlighted continued strength in leasing, but let me point out a few more statistics of note. The 94.5% and 92.8% in leased and occupied metrics represented growth of 90 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, over 2021 and 20 and 70 basis points of sequential growth over the third quarter.  We continue to see strength in our small shop leasing, which now stands at 90%, a level not seen since 2017, but still short of our targeted and historical peak levels. The 80 basis points of relative pickup in our SNO [ph] spread over the course of 2022 demonstrates our ability to get tenants open and rent paying. More upside to come in 2023 as we target an SNO spread at more typical levels of 100 to 125 basis points long term. I mentioned leasing activity has been strong to start 2023, and our pipeline of deals executed to date in the first quarter and those under executed LOI is in line so far with 2022's strong leasing volumes. Additionally, we remain optimistic so we can continue to drive favorable lease terms in 2023, including both strong lease rollover growth and sector-leading contractual rent forms. A big driver of our growth in 2022 was the continued stabilization of a large portion of our redevelopment and expansion pipeline. We expect that to be the case in 2023 as well. Having placed $800 million of projects into service in 2021 and 2022 at Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and CocoWalk, we saw a $24 million of incremental POI 2022. We expect another roughly $12 million of incremental POI in 2023, just from those 3 projects alone. The balance of our development pipeline now stands at roughly $730 million which will deliver incremental POI starting this year and continue for the next few years but is less than $300 million remaining to spend. Now to the balance sheet, a quick update on our liquidity position. We ended the year with $86 million of cash available and an undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility for a total liquidity in excess of $1.3 billion. Our leverage metrics continue to be strong. Fourth quarter annualized net debt to EBITDA is roughly 6 times. That metric is forecasted to improve over the course of 2023 as development POI comes online and occupancy drives higher. Again, our targeted level is in the mid -- is in the low to mid 5 times range. Fixed charge coverage was 3.7 times for the fourth quarter and 4 times for the full year. Now on to guidance. For 2023, we are introducing FFO guidance of $6.38 to $6.58 per share. This represents 2.5% growth at the midpoint $6.48 and 4% at the high end of the range. Despite the challenging capital markets environment and embedded headwinds, as promised, Federal will grow in 2023.  This is driven by a comparable growth forecast of 2% to 4%. This assumes occupancy levels will increase from 92.8% at 12/31, up above 93% and by year-end 2023, although that progression will not be linear throughout the year. Additional contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline will total $15 million to $18 million. For those modeling, let me direct you to our 8-K on Page 16 and 17 where we provide our forecast of stabilized POI and timing by projects. Accretion from our 2022 acquisitions being online for a full year will also contribute. Those $500-plus million 2022 acquisitions are expected to outperform our original underwriting by at least 50 basis points. This will be offset by lower prior period collections with a net 2022 level of $9 million that's expected to fall to a range of $4 million to $6 million in '23. And lower net term fees, we had $9.5 million in 2022 and forecast $5 million to $6 million in 2023, more in line with our historical averages.  Despite over 100 basis points of headwinds, our comparable growth forecast is 2% to 4% for 2023. It would be 3% to 5% without the headwinds from prior period rents and term fees. Quarterly FFO cadence. We'll have one quarter being the weakest with sequential growth thereafter. Other assumptions include $175 million to $200 million of spend on redevelopment and expansions at our existing properties; $175 million to $225 million of common equity issued throughout the year, refinancing our $275 million of unsecured notes, which mature in June in the mid-5% range; G&A in the $52 million to $56 million range for the year; and capitalized interest for 2023 is estimated at $20 million to $22 million which includes the continued capitalization of interest at Santana West. Given our change in leasing strategy from a single tenant leasing approach to a multi-tenant building as we build out tenant floors and add tenant amenities. Dispositions completed in '22, contributed roughly $5 million of POI during the year. That POI will not be there in '23. We've assumed a credit reserve, excluding the impact of Bed Bath & Beyond of roughly 75 basis points. With respect to Bed Bath, we are adding another 25 to 60 basis points of reserve depending on the uncertain outcome with respect to this tenant. Please note, in 2023 and moving forward, we have less than 70 basis points of exposure at our Wynnewood location had a natural expiration in January 2023 and has not been on our '23 forecast since mid-last year. As is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2023, except what has already been announced. We will adjust for those as we go given our opportunistic approach to both. This guidance also does not assume any tenants moving from a cash basis to accrual basis revenue recognition. Please note the expanded disclosure in our 8-K on Page 30 provides a detailed summary of this guidance. And before we go to Q&A, let me take a minute to highlight the strength the outperformance that our signature mixed-use retail assets demonstrated in 2022. The big four of Santana Row, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose and Bethesda Row, took a disproportionate hit during COVID, because of government shutdowns in their respective markets, but they now sit they finished 2022 at 99% leased.  Reported retail sales were 15% to 20% higher than the prior year and are back up above pre-COVID levels. Consumer traffic was up 20% versus the prior year and 7% above pre COVID levels. Comparable retail POI at these assets were up 30% versus 2021 and over 6% above pre-COVID levels. Plus, we are forecasting comparable growth in retail POI for 2023 of 6% to 8% if these four assets given continued strength in leasing demand. The retail components of our mixed-use assets are unique and have driven and should continue to drive POI growth materially above that of a typical open-air shopping center, providing an additional point of differentiation between Federal and its peers. Further, our operational mixed-use capabilities in design, construction, leasing, operations are unrivaled and a unique competitive advantage moving forward in the continued evolution of open-air retail, capabilities that are applicable across our entire retail portfolio and a big reason why we expect that sector-leading retail growth for years to come. And with that, operator, you can open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with you question. Juan Sanabria : Good afternoon, and thanks for the time. Just curious on the total portfolio to one of your later comments in your prepared remarks where NOI sits relative to 2019 levels and when do you expect to get back to that. You kind of made the comment for the big four, but just curious on the broader sample set? Donald Wood : We're back. Yes, we're, in fact, well above 2019 levels. So I know one that what Dan was just talking about was specifically with respect to the 4 mixed-use assets and for obvious reasons there. But the whole portfolio is on overall back above 2019. It's the higher interest expense that effectively brings us back down to about the same FFO but certainly, operationally, significantly above. Operator : And our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Thank you. I just wondered if you could just give us what the drag will be on the increased interest expense of '23 versus '22? Daniel Guglielmone : Roughly $0.30 per share, plus, minus any above where we end up. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And then just real quick. Small shop was relatively flat sequentially, do you still see that as a major opportunity for growth on your POI? Donald Wood : Yes. And Wendy, I don't know if you want to add to this or not, but I'm very, very positive about our small shop occupancy. And I think we're sitting there at 90% or so now, which is back to place that we haven't been for quite some time, and we're not done. We've got some more room to grow there. Wendy Seher : And I would add to that, there's a real sense of urgency on the leasing side overall, especially on the small shops. Through COVID, the weaker guys, as we know, have gone away and our small shops are thriving right now. Obviously, we're heading into maybe some headwinds, but some of the technologies and so forth that have come post COVID are really driving sales for a lot of the retailers, including the restaurants. Operator : And our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good evening. Dan, I was hoping you can just touch on what would be driving you to either the bottom or top end of guidance this year? Daniel Guglielmone : Look, I think a big variable is what happens to the Bed Bath bankruptcy. I think that probably at the top of the range, we'll expect to have a more normalized Chapter 11 where we expect to get a few boxes back whereas, if it's a liquidation, that will push us towards the bottom of the range. I think that's probably one of the bigger drivers that takes us either up or down. Greg McGinniss : Okay. And if I could just\u2026 [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Samir Khanal : Thanks for the question. Maybe you can touch upon the transaction market and kind of what you're seeing from pricing or cap rates today. I don't know if there's a way to bifurcate between sort of your suburban open-air centers versus any color you can provide in lifestyle centers. That would be great. Thanks. JeffBerkes: Yes. Hey, Samir, it's Jeff. Not a lot of color because there's not a lot of transactions. We're always in the market looking for stuff regardless of what's going on, but there's just not a lot out there right now. I mean, if you want a data point, back in the day, when the market was active for the best grocery-anchored centers or maybe 100 to 150 basis point spread cap rate over the 10-year treasury. But we haven't seen many trades, and I don't expect to see a ton of trends this year. So kind of anybody's guess at this point. Operator : And our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on the comparable property growth guidance. Can you help reconcile kind of the moving pieces that generate your guidance of 2% to 4% growth in ex prior period; in terms of fees, 3% to 5% this year relative to last year. I see curious, you're expecting a little bit less occupancy growth and maybe walk through some of the other pieces. And then on capital interest, does that go from a potential headwind to tailwind this year? What are the implications for '24? Daniel Guglielmone : Okay. Look, I think the building blocks that kind of are comparable is kind of a combination of things that get us there. I think we would expect I think contractual bumps, which continue to be kind of sector-leading, kind of north of 2.25% and include kind of some of the office. I think occupancy growth relative to where things were last year will add, I think, a good chunk of rollover because what's interesting is ours is a GAAP number, so the contractual rent bumps don't contribute as much. What really does is the rollover to rollover growth, which is the straight line rollover, which captures those rent bumps. And so that should be a big driver because of the progress we've made.  And you've got residential. I think we'll continue to see percentage rent and parking. And then we mentioned the probably 100 to 130 basis points of credit reserve, then also about 100 basis points of term fee headwind and prior period rent headwind that gets us kind of to that midpoint of that metric. Operator : And our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Craig Mailman : I just wanted to circle back up on the interest capitalization question. Dan, just two questions on this, basically. Just what guidance have been if you guys had burned or ceased capitalization on Santana West? And kind of from a timing perspective, even if there was no leasing, when would you have to just finally stop capitalizing there? And then just secondly, the strategy shift to the multi-tenant, are you -- what kind of demand are you guys seeing, if at all, in those smaller spaces? And are you guys gearing to build out suites or just trying to demise the space? Donald Wood : No, it's a good question. Listen, the -- it became pretty clear. As you know, we worked hard to get a full building user at Santana West. We shifted to that strategy, we talked about a little bit last year, but we shifted to the strategy of building out the individual floors instead, that the accounting for that is to capitalize and continue to capitalize. But the reason for it, the business reason for that, is that we do see more demand in that 50,000 to 100,000 square foot user. There are tours that we're giving now. Obviously, you know what's going on with tech in Silicon Valley. So I certainly don't have anything great to say about the demonstrative progress there. But that building is getting a lot of looks. And so we're very hopeful that this strategy of looking for 100,000 square foot tenants rather than the full 350,000, 375,000 will be fruitful. It feels good that way.  In terms of what that means on the accounting is you've got $250 million into a building at call it 5% or so a year of carry on that. And so that winds up continuing at this point to be on the balance sheet. And effectively at some point, it will wind up going through the P&L, but you can do the math on that. Operator : And our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Haendel St. Juste: Good evening out there. So Don, I was intrigued by your comments on the Federal rent bumps and the superior long-term core growth profile of the portfolio. I remember while back you provide a buildup of what you thought the portfolio could do over a longer-term basis in terms of that core internally generated growth, I think it was like 3% to 4%, which included some of the bump spreads redevs. So I guess I was curious if you could give us an updated sense of what do you think the long-term core growth profile looks like now or could look like now with the improved bumps you're referencing as well as maybe factoring some of the various deal rent tailwinds coming online here\u2026 Donald Wood : That's fair, Haendel. I mean the -- look, the business, the general business and the shopping center business, allows the portfolio to grow with common occupancy of a typical shopping center of 1.5% and 1.25%, what they do. We've been able to have long-term growth of 3%, 3.5%, something like that, on an occupancy neutral basis. I feel very good about that.  And with respect to the comment I was making about the about the rent bumps, it's really -- we've talked about this in the past, a little bit of inflation is a really good thing in our business. So much inflation certainly isn't. But to the extent we get to a normalized level of inflation, it allows us to push more. And Wendy and that team is having success effectively with the ability of increasing or improving the economics for longer-term deals because inflation is real, and everybody knows it. You're not trying to push a noodle uphill. So that long-term growth rate of 3%, 3.5%, I feel very good about. Operator : And our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris Van Dijkum : Thanks. Guys, I appreciate you throwing out guidance that is a little bit more adventuresome than some of the your retail partner. And maybe if you can talk a little bit, as you know, not all space is created equal. And I know you've been saying that for a long time, Don. But one of the things that intrigued me about your portfolio and where I think people might be underestimating the growth potential, particularly in your small shop space because your rents are double your anchor tenants, you talked a little bit about your lease percentage. How much of that is occupied? How much more do you expect to gain in terms of lease growth in '23? And then maybe if you can -- if we walk through the elements of your growth for '23, you talked a little bit about -- Dan, you talked about the 2.25% fixed bumps, you have an element of leases that you signed in '23 that were -- where you got a partial year, and obviously, those are going to contribute in '23 as well. And then you got your SNO and you get your spreads. If you do the math, I mean, it looks like you're going to be well north of NOI growth, if I'm adding it up correctly. Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. I appreciate the question, Floris. Look, we -- if you add all those things up, yes, it gets beyond the 4%, but then you apply a credit reserve, you've got some headwinds and so forth. And so look, we're hopeful that our 2% to 4% net comparable growth is a conservative estimate. And we hope that the strong rollover we're expecting in 2023, continued contractual rent bumps, continuing to be able to push occupancy, will continue to drive a strong core portfolio growth profile in 2023. But there are headwinds out there, and so the 2% to 4% reflects that. Operator : Our next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Derek Johnston : Everyone, good afternoon. Yes, so you mentioned earlier and obviously it's widely understood, with debt cost of capital elevated, what about tapping the equity markets as valuation here as the year recovers. I think there's $200 million issuance at the midpoint. But really, guys, it seems to match development spend. So I guess how do you view greater equity activity as a financing tool given the state of capital markets and as values recover? Thanks. Donald Wood : Yes, Derek, let me start, and Dan will add to this. Look, there's a couple of principles involved here. So one is I never want to surprise our own so I never want a whole bunch of equity out there at any one time. I'd like to do it in conservative amounts as we go through a year. We opportunistically then obviously can turn that dial up or back based on where we believe value lies and what the uses are.  The most important thing is what is the use for that money. And at the end of the day, to the extent we are very comfortable that we can use shareholder or debtholder proceeds to be able to create incremental value, that's what we will do. That's the driver always because we don't have to, to the extent we don't have those uses, and even the development pipeline that you know, it's far lower than it was, only a couple of hundred million dollars left spend at this point. So lots of flexibility. And that's what I always want to maintain with respect to the balance sheet here is the ability to kind of take advantage opportunistically of what's going on in the marketplace to create value. And I look at debt and equity similar to that. Operator : And our next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Powell : Hi, good afternoon. It's a question on lease spreads. Good to see the acceleration in the fourth quarter. How are you balancing higher lease spreads versus maybe higher bumps? And are you seeing any tenant push back in that conversations or tenants just saying we need the space and like the space, so we're going to accept the higher prices? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Look, there is -- these are an amalgamation of a number of deals. In any particular quarter, you'll see some deals that have higher rollover, you'll see some that are more anchor related versus small shop related. There's a giant mix. I don't want you to look and say, I see a deceleration in leasing spreads in the fourth quarter. There's no trend there. The trend you should expect to see is actually higher rollovers in 2023 based on what we see in the pipeline. And that's simply an opportunistic notion of being able to understand what spaces are coming due, where the demand is for that space, and that's what's in the pipeline. And that's opportunistic based on what's happening there. But in every case, we're pushing for very high contractual bumps associated with those leases. So, in total, the economic contribution is greater. I don't want to just look at that lease rollover spread. I want to look at it holistically, in total, including the contractual bumps. Donald Wood : And I think because demand is strong and continues to be strong, we found success in being able to push on both of those levers, particularly in the last couple of quarters. Operator : And our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Alexander Goldfarb : Hi, thank you. Good evening. Just a question on Santana West because it seems to be -- that seems to be the delta versus the Street. I think it was $0.20 is what you originally guided when you ceased capitalization. Now obviously, great to hear that there's work going on in demand.  But I guess my question is, do you guys think that you were a little too conservative in ceasing capitalization? I understand that you stopped work on the project, but given markets are moving or fluid when it comes to leasing, do you think that maybe should have just left it as a capitalized project? I'm just wondering because all the other stuff that you guys are doing is great, but that capitalized interest seems to be the delta between the '23 outlook and where the Street is, so I'm just trying to understand. Don Wood : So, Alex, my point on that is the direct answer to your question is no, I don't think we are too conservative on that. I think your inherent premise and what you're saying is that the accounting drives the business decision. And it's exactly the opposite. It is the business decision with what -- with the strategy towards the building, that drives whatever the accounting is and frankly, we didn't even know the accounting when we first talked about how the -- how we were going to go after -- what tenant base we were going to go after once we lost the first couple of big building users.  So, no, I don't think so, and the notion of looking at capitalized interest as a positive or negative thing with respect to '23, here's the fallacy in it. What we're laying out in '23, agree, does not have an impact from Santana West. What it does is show the impact of everything else in this company.  And that's why that operating growth is coming through. That's why the bottom line is coming through. ideally, you will see, as we move forward, rent debt more than pay -- rent on Santana West that more than pays for the interest expense. But it's not like we're getting a benefit for that in '23. We simply don't have any impact of Santana West for '23. So just fundamentally, I think you're looking at it a little backwards. Operator : And our next question is from Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please proceed with your question. Paulina Rojas : Hi. Good evening. Last time we spoke, I think office traffic at Santana Row was still down materially versus pre-pandemic. I don't remember the exact figures, but maybe in the neighborhood of 30% down. Has that changed at all? And at this point, what is your view of how those traffic patterns will look like in the midterm? Jeff Berkes : Yes. Paulina, it's Jeff. And I think I understand your question. I think you're talking about the number of people that come to work every day, Monday through Friday, at the office buildings at Santana Row. I'll tell you two things about that. One, that's a small part of the traffic at Santana Row. Santana Row generates a ton of traffic over the year. And the primary reason people are coming there is to shop, eat and enjoy the property.  The weekday traffic is building as well as return to office is ramping up in Silicon Valley. So, we do see that coming back and coming back strongly. But overall, that's a relatively small component. And like Dan said in his prepared remarks, traffic today at Santana Row is above what it was in 2019. So, we're in pretty good shape there, and I appreciate the question. Operator : And our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Mueller : Hi. I guess looking at the future phases at Assembly, Pike & Rose and Santana, whenever you think the time is right, how -- I guess, what's the time frame to reactivate those various phases in the project? Don Wood : That's a great question, Mike. And there's an important underlying assumption here. We love the development component of our business. And there are certainly times like now where we turn down that spigot and aren't comfortable to be able to start construction. But don't let that misinform you to believe that, capacity and the work that we do with our team, which stays together during down cycles here. Making its shovel ready to be able to activate quicker -- the idea is to be able to activate quicker than any of the competition. That's what we try to do. So, the ability to stay very tight on not only with our contractor, with pricing, with entitlements for future phases at places like Assembly, it's front of mind all the time. So, whatever is going on in the market, Mike, and I don't have a crystal ball with respect to '23 or '24 or '25, but I know we'll be back at it faster than most. And that's the key competitive standpoint in terms of the way we look at it. Operator : And our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Something I believe we\u2019re at a point on Santana West. But from a business standpoint, I'm actually curious if you go multi-tenant. And I would guess that maybe prolongs the lease-up time frame. So even though you're capitalizing cost for longer, shouldn't the all-in cost expectation go up, therefore, the yield come down incrementally? I'm not sure if there's probably other variables to consider, but I was just curious if you can provide some color around that. Don Wood : Yes. No, it's a very fair question. I'm not sure it will take longer. And the reason is because we are building out the individual floors. So that work, effectively a year's worth of work here, is being done ahead of time. And so, on timing, I think feeling pretty good.  In terms of the extra carry and potentially on cost, yes, I would expect those to be incrementally higher, but we also have benefits in terms of our base building and lots of other things that are reducing the cost of Santana West.  And I guess the last point to really make just make sure you're not overemphasizing this one building that makes up 1.5 points -- 1.5% of the asset base of the company. And when you kind of sit back and you take like our entire office portfolio, they back out just Santana West, just alone, even our ongoing other buildings, which are under construction, in total, 92% leased. And if you knock out the one that's being built here at Pike & Rose, that's not finished yet, they're 97% leased. So, the product -- and this is really important, from a real estate person's perspective, the product is right all the way through, and it's a different product when it's attached the Santana Row, Assembly Row, Pike & Rose. Operator : And our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Craig Schmidt : Great. And just one, I wanted to congratulate Jan Sweetnam on his new role of Chief Investment Officer. Jan Sweetnam : Thank you, Craig. Don Wood : Thanks, Craig. Craig Schmidt : Are you staying West Coast base? Or will you be moving to East? Jan Sweetnam : Still West Coast-based but spending some more time on the East Coast, Craig. Craig Schmidt : Okay. And then just maybe what are some of the opportunities you most want to pursue in your new role? Jan Sweetnam : Well, that's a good question, Craig. Well, look, there's a -- feels like there's going to be some increase in product out there, Craig, and some new product for us to look at. Expanding our base in Phoenix, I think, is going to be a big focus for us.  But I feel pretty good that there's going to be some larger good product for us that we can buy accretively. So, nothing's set in stone, feet ready to go, and we'll see where it takes us. Operator : And our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question. Greg McGinniss : So just a couple of follow-up questions. One is on the disposition pipeline. I think you noted $350 million on the last call. Just curious if you're still pursuing the remainder of those transactions. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Essentially, we got done, the one Rolling Wood, which was $68 million. We're still in process on about $130 million of additional acquisitions. We'll see if we get them over. And then I would say the balance, we determined that it didn't meet the timing parameters we needed or the pricing parameters, and we stayed disciplined and decided not to move forward. But there's a possibility. You bring those back later in the year when there's a more receptive capital markets environment. Greg McGinniss : Okay. Great. And then on the resi occupancy, which fell quarter-over-quarter, was that because of the Rolling Wood sale? Or are there some other reasons for that? Don Wood : No. That's just timing a little bit. We're pushing hard on rate. And so, as turnouts come, we don't want to leave money on the table. So that balance between rate and occupancy is always -- it's always part of the formula. And we push just a bunch charter on rate. You'll see that come back in '23. Operator : And our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Just curious if we should expect any action on the balance sheet in terms of your '24 expirations given you've got a couple of chunky pieces of debt coming due and kind of how you guys are maybe thinking about getting ahead of that? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Look, I think we're going to look to be opportunistic like we always are. I think we're going to -- we created a significant amount of capacity to give us the flexibility to be opportunistic, completely undrawn on $1.25 billion will give us flexibility from a timing perspective. But we expect to access the bond markets throughout 2023 to address the maturities that we have, June maturity as well as the January '24 maturity. Operator : And our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Michael Goldsmith : Thanks a lot for taking another one for me. The lease occupied spread compressed by 50 basis points down to 170 basis points. So, on the one hand, you're monetizing all the leasing that you're doing, but maybe on the other side, you're not -- there's maybe a little bit less benefit in the pipeline. Like how do you think about it? It seems like you've been very positive on being able to monetize it sooner, but just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on either side of that argument? Don Wood : Well, Michael, I want to make sure we agree on the premise. The lease percentage continues to get better, get higher. The primary thing there is that we continue to lease up the portfolio. We feel very good about that. Now that's a job of that leasing team, and that's working out pretty darn well. But the job of the tenant coordinators, the job of the construction people, the job is to get those tenants open. And frankly, that has just been as amazing as leasing is and leasing have record years. Tenant coordinators and that part of the construction of those spaces to get them open, is just stellar.  And so, I hope when you look through what's important about leased versus occupied that, if you're in the middle of COVID, it's great to have a whole bunch of leasing done and not a bunch of sub open as it come back up. But to get to normalized operations, you want that as tight as you possibly can to be able to turn a contract into rent. So, I love where we are, in fact, because we're doing both increasing that lease and more than increasing that amount by occupancy. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. And just to add another thing that's not in that 170 basis points of signed and not open SNO is are non-comparable pool where we have an equivalent amount of POI that's expected to come on from what we're delivering stuff, buildings that are not yet placed into service, where we have leasing done, contracts leases that are done. And it's the equivalent of that same 170 basis point spread. So that's an added differentiator and an advantage that none of our peers have because they don't have the scale of that non-comparable pool. Operator : As there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Leah Brady for closing comments. Leah Brady : Thank you, everyone, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the Citi Conference. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead. Leah Brady : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Dan G., Jeff Berkes, Wendy Seher, Jan Sweetnam and Melissa Solis. They will be available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued this afternoon, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and our other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. Strong start to 2023 here with $1.59 first quarter FFO per share results, ahead of both consensus and internal expectations and 6% growth over last year's first quarter. Also happens to be the best first quarter result we've ever posted. Here's the best part. We signed 101 comparable leases for more than 0.5 million square feet at $34.72 a foot, 11% higher than the cash basis rent the previous tenant was paying in the final year of their lease, 24% on a straight-line basis. Demand was exceptional with momentum encouragingly strong at the end of the quarter, late March. As you know, I've been expecting the inevitable tail off of leasing activity for months and months now as the portfolio leases up. These activity levels exceed historical levels by 20% to 30%, we just plainly haven't seen that tail off yet. The retail demand for the product that we offer is in lockstep with what today's consumers and retailers demand in these affluent first-ring suburbs of major metropolitan areas. One of the larger drivers of that leasing performance this quarter was the signing of four grocery deals, three new deals and renewals. The renewal was implied in the Boston suburb with Star Market and Albertsons brands. The new deals included Giant Food replacing Shoppers Food Warehouse, Karin Plaza and Cyber Baltimore, a grocer that I'm not allowed to announce yet replacing Michaels at Fresh Meadows and Queens and Aldi replacing Barnes & Noble on Long Island. Together, these four deals turned $3.3 million in base rent or $17.81 a foot to $4.4 million in base rent or $23.40 per point. Strong rents and rent growth in proven productive centers in Northeast densely populated suburbs. The timing of them all getting done in the first quarter bodes well for the future. The Bed Bath bankruptcy filing news will not exactly welcome, was inevitable and frankly, better than the band data is being write-off so that we can get on with creating incremental value in our shopping centers. There are many more productive retailers than this one that should be serving our customers. Deals are in the works for all of our Bed Bath boxes and replacement rent should start to ramp up in late 2024. With average Bed Bath base rent at $15 a foot, rest assured that Federal's portfolio will be more valuable, not less once these locations are retained. Dan will provide more detail on what we've assumed in our numbers. The natural lease expiration of a large-format Bed Bath & Beyond store at Wynwood Shopping Center in suburban Philly closed in January as expected and was the primary cause of a modest 20 basis point drop in occupancy in the quarter. That closure, along with a Tuesday morning in suburban Boston, it also closed when the lease expired in January, fairly overshadowed the many store openings elsewhere throughout the portfolio. Meanwhile, small shop occupancy gains continued on a quarter and increased 50 basis points. That's a total increase in small shop occupancy of 270 basis points since Q1 2022. The quality of our shop tenants and the discerning way that we choose them at our properties is where we create a ton of value. All small shop tenancy is not [indiscernible] And as much as I love the grocery deals I mentioned earlier, it's the retail side of the big four mixed-use communities that I find most impressive. Taken together, Assembly Row, Bathesda Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row are a real company differentiator for Federal and more in demand than ever before, with retail leased occupancy at 98% and tenant sales well above 2019 levels. These properties are with estimated foot traffic in excess of 28 million shoppers in the trailing 12 months. That's a big number and comes from the database of Placer AI. Roughly two thirds of tenants report sales of big 4, so the numbers are representatives. Overall sales per foot totaled $700 with total food and beverage sales per foot in excess of $1,000. In our estimation, this is the product and the markets that consumers in a post-COVID world want the most. I know you've heard me say it many, many times before, but fair to repeat it. Demographics made, especially in times of economic pressure and especially now at the $5.5 trillion of government stimulus that propped up the economy during the papers is waning. Past cycles have convinced us that families simply have to have money to spend for retail real estate cash flow to grow. 68,000 households with average annual household income of $150,000 sit within three miles of Federal Realty centers. That's $10.2 billion of family income generated within a three-mile route-mile radius and more than half of those people have a four-year colleagues agree or better. I know no other significantly sized retail portfolio back in same. With the late quarter on the transaction flow, where we sold a small grocery-anchored shopping center in the quarter for $13 million, center located in very suburban Newberg in Pennsylvania as one of the latest 3-mile population demos in our portfolio with an obvious candidate for sale. More interesting was our acquisition of the fee interest and the anchor tenant leases at Huntington Square Shopping Center on Long Island from Seritage Realty Trust for $35.5 million. Back in 2010, we had purchased a leasehold interest in the shop tenants with the hopes of someday finding a way to consolidate the anchors and the fee. With this first quarter transaction, we now fully control this 18-acre parcel in affluent East North Fort Long Island. And as I mentioned earlier, we just replaced Barnes & Noble with an Aldi grocery store you're creating another grocery-anchored property in the portfolio. With a $5 million-plus annual income stream on our $56 million all in investment, we've created a much more valuable property with an unlevered IRR in the low teens and arguably $20 million plus of immediate incremental value. You might have also noticed that after the quarter's end, we refinanced our $275 million in bonds coming due June 1, with a new five-year $350 million green bond at 5.375%. The offering was significantly oversubscribed with demand helped by our lead gold or better investments. Next up will be the financing or refinancing of our $600 million bonds coming due next year. we would expect to be opportunistically in the market at 400 points in the second half of this year. For an additional source of growth in 2021 and beyond, you only need to look at $600 million plus of construction and process on the quarter-end balance sheet to identify a large source of future income and capital already invested, Much of it lease is not yet reflected in the results. What was reflected in the quarterly results was a $10 million property operating income contribution from the latest completed phases of some of our mixed-use operating properties, namely Assembly Row Phase III, 009 Roads at Pike & Rose and a full quarter, a stabilized cocoa wall, which contributed. And finally, our floor-by-floor buildout at Santana West seems to be attracting more interest in the marketplace as inquiries and property tours have seen renewed life in the last 30 to 60 days. Tech sector in Silicon Valley is far from settled, but the increased activity is certainly well. We continue to see our fully amenitized office space on our mixed-use communities to be the product of choice in their respective markets. Okay. That's about it for my prepared remarks this morning, and I'll turn it over to Dan before opening it up to your questions. Daniel Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our $1.59 per share of reported FFO was a first quarter record for Federal and probably above our expectations and last year's $1.50 results, representing a 6% annual increase. That our performance again was broad-based as all facets of our business continue to contribute. Specific drivers, which deserve mentioned, overage percentage rent continues to outpace expectations as [indiscernible] sales demonstrate strength and resiliency. Parking revenues also saw gains above forecast as customer traffic at our large mixed-use assets continues to drive higher. Small shop occupancy again showed gains and we saw lower expenses both at the property and corporate level. This was offset modestly by higher collectibility impact or bad debt expense was forecast. Our GAAP-based comparable POI growth metric was 3.6%, coming in at the upper end of the range of our 2% to 4% initial guidance. On a cash basis, comparable excluding prior period rent term fees is 5.2%. Cash basis comparable minimum rent grew by 4%. Term fees in the comparable pool this quarter were essentially flat to first quarter 2022 and $1.4 million in each period. Prior period rent this quarter was $1.3 million versus $2.4 million in the first quarter last year. Please note that we have added all of these figures to Pages 10 and 11 of our 8-K supplemental disclosure. You're welcome, Steve. Year-over-year occupancy results were also solid with our overall occupied metric growing 140 basis points year-over-year from 91.2% to 92.6% and our lease percentage increasing 50 basis points from 93.7% to 94.2%. Sequentially, we took a small anticipated step backward given 1Q seasonality and two known anchor partners in January at lease expiration, which were reflected in our guidance. Our signed not occupied spread in the existing portfolio stands at 160 basis points as we continue to show progress in getting tenants open and rent paying. This spread represents roughly $18 million of incremental total rent. Our sign not occupied in our non-comparable pool stands at $18 million as well for the total rent, bringing total signs non-occupied to $36 million. This effectively brings our SNO percentage to a total of 3%. These executed leases will continue to drive bottom line results over the next two years, with roughly 65% coming online over the remainder of 23% and the balance primarily in 2024. When you include new lease deals in our pipeline for currently unoccupied space, this increases the SNO figure even higher. Rollover for the quarter was 11% on a cash basis and 24% on a straight-line basis, the second consecutive quarter to have the cash number in double digits and a straight line number up into the low to mid-20s. I highlight the straight line number as it reflects sector-leading contractual annual rent increases -- embedded rent increases embedded in our leases, both anchor and small shop blended at roughly 2.25% across the portfolio. Year-to-date, small shop rent bumps have averaged about 3%. Now to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $1.3 billion of total available liquidity at quarter end, comprised of $1.2 billion available under our revolver and $100 million of cash. As many of you saw, we successfully accessed the unsecured market subsequent to quarter end with $350 million, of five and three bond, and as a result, no maturities until early '24. Also, keep in mind that for our term loan, whose initial maturity is also in 2024, we have two 1-year extensions at our option, taking the maturity into 2026. With respect to our leverage metrics, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is roughly 6x as noted, and we fully expect to be back to our targeted level in the mid-5x in 2024. Additionally, we are targeting free cash flow after dividends and maintenance capital to return to pre-COVID levels by next year. Our in-process pipeline of active redevelopments and expansions now stands at $740 million, with only $250 million remaining to spend against our $1.3 billion of available liquidity. Now on to guidance. With initial guidance to start the year showing FFO growth of 2.5% at the midpoint and 4% at the top of the range. and a solid first quarter under our belts, we are affirming guidance for 2023 at $6.38 to $6.58 per share. While we continue to see strength and resiliency in our business, with three quarters left for the year, it is rare that we would modify guidance at this point in the year. For the first time in almost two years, we are seeing tenant bankruptcies in retail. As selective businesses struggled to compete in a challenging economic environment of higher interest rates and diminished government subsidies [indiscernible] Despite the bankruptcies to date where [indiscernible] very manageable exposure, we still feel comfortable with our initial 100 to 135 basis points of total credit reserve comprised of roughly a 75 basis point general reserve and a 25 basis points to 60 basis points of specified Bed Bath reserve. Now given where we started May and the expected range of outcomes, this Bed Bath reserve has now been reduced to 20 basis points to 45 basis points given the cash rents we've already received on eight of our nine anchor boxes that have not yet been projected, including May rent. That range will depend on the timing of the bankruptcy process and which leases are affirmed and/or assumed, if any. From a comparable growth perspective, given a solid first quarter metric, we are affirming the 2% to 4% range for comparable POI growth as well as our 3% to 5% range on a cash basis adjusting for prior period rents and terms. Page 27 in our 8-K provides an updated summary of the key assumptions for ours. Now in addition to the expanded disclosure on term fees and prior period rent that I previously highlighted, we'll also notice several other additions to our 8-K relating to revenues, comparable POI growth, debt, occupancy and leasing metrics, demonstrating our commitment to continuing to expand our disclosure to provide the information we believe is most relevant for investors to analyze our business effectively and efficiently. And with that, operator, you can open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just curious on the renewals, those popped up in the fourth quarter, if you look relative to the trailing 12, you also had lower TIs. Is that a mix? Or is that kind of a new normal? I know you mentioned some anchor leasing. Just curious if you can comment on that. Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. It was essentially a mix with regards just what not done during the quarter. One of them was the grocer renewal that we had up but also just a broader mix. And obviously, the TIs, again, a mix of the leases that got done. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Craig Schmidt : I kind of wanted to talk about mixed-use and added resi. I noticed on your future development opportunity page, you've gone from six mixed-use projects that could add residential, now, we have 14. What I'm wondering is, I've heard you say that one third of your properties or mixed-use now, where do you think you might be in five years' time? And the second is, will mixed-use assets grow faster in their rents than strictly retail ones? And what are retailers telling you about mixed-use? And what are the resi people telling you about mixed-use? Donald Wood : Boy Craig, that's pretty funny. I love how we limited it to one question. You have a whole white paper in that question there. You are the best. So a couple... Craig Schmidt : I apologize upfront. Donald Wood : Not at all. Don't apologies at all. I'm just having just a little fun. Listen, the -- what you see in the 8-K is a continuation of what we believe, and that is the ability wherever we can to maximize the use of the real estate that we own, especially when we're talking about successful retail shopping centers with -- and you know ours are on bigger pieces of plant. And so the ability to add other uses is something that it's just part of our DNA and something we'd like to be able to do. Now I don't -- I would not -- you should not expect us to be running and putting shovels into the ground over the next nine months, 12 months at those projects because the economics don't make any sense today. I do expect them to make some sense in the future, and that's what that is supposed to convey. Now with respect to the overall mixed-use properties, the -- what we have clearly found, clearly found is that the demand for lots of uses in both office and retail and resi and hotel frankly at a really well-done mixed-use property is a real differentiator. It's where people want to be. It's why in the comments I made -- I'm talking about traffic counts that are really enormous. These are a lot of -- there's a lot of visits there, a lot of sales. They also seem to have the ability to raise their prices in places like that more than that more value-oriented properties. And I guess you would expect that Apple in areas, the Lulu Lemons of the world, et cetera, they can raise prices. And as a result, we see the ability to charge higher rents there. Now if we did that right on the ground floor, then we should also see outsized returns, both in the form of occupancy and the rates that we're getting upstairs in the other users. That's been our experience, frankly, since COVID, I think it's even stronger than it was before COVID. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Yes. Don or maybe Wendy, just on the leasing side, I mean, I know this strength has probably surprised you, Don, things have remained healthy. Consumer spending has held up. I'm just wondering what you guys are hearing from tenants. And you mentioned maybe bankruptcies picking up. I'm just wondering how you feel about the 75 basis point general reserve and might you not use all of that as you sit here today just as you survey the landscape. Wendy Seher : Steve, let me just kind of add some color first before Dan talked about the numbers. But you're right, we're seeing great demand on the retail leasing side, specifically in the small shops. We have not seen a decline of anything considerable as it relates to people's ability to fund projects and make decisions. They're making decisions for the long term, and they're understanding that with these recession discussions that these headwinds that we're facing, the decisions that they're making are critical to their livelihood, especially for the mom-and-pop. So there's a flight to quality that continues to happen in our portfolio. So I'm feeling very bullish about what I see in our pipeline. Again, I honestly, I was expecting it to level off a little bit, and it has not. It is as robust as ever. So I'm very encouraged. Donald Wood : And I guess, Steve, I would only add to that. Yes, there might be some room in the 75 basis points. But I read the same things in the newspapers that you do, and its May 05 or May 04 or whatever day it is. By the way, Steve, my 25th anniversary at least, happy anniversary Don, right? It makes me laugh though because the power of the small shop tenants. And that Wendy mentioned is something I really want to make sure that you understand a little bit, we don't do kind of first-time mom and pops. We don't have those type of businesses here. They are almost always adding a store or adding a food use from a place that -- from strong cash flow at another location, whereby they're expanding into the third or the fourth or the fifth. There is that flight to quality. That's a critical component. So if this is anything like whatever happens this year or next year is anything like prior recessions, this is one of the strongest parts of our portfolio and the place that the differentiates us. Operator : The next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Greg McGinniss : Happy 25th Don -- to celebrate let's talk about office demand. Can you just talk a little bit more about the interest you're seeing in Santana West this feels like serious increase? Is it all tech whole building or by floor? And so any additional color is helpful there. And then we'd also appreciate updated info on 919 lease-up and initial rent contribution expectations. Jeffrey Berkes : Sure. Yes. Greg, this is Jeff. Let me start off on the West Coast, obviously, Don can jump in on the second part of your question. So the business decision we made late last year to allow the building to be leased by four by four and to start building out the building. So we were a great alternative to the sublease space that's coming on the market that I'm sure you've heard about is working out for us. That combined, I think, with a little bit more of a settling at least in the, call it, mid-sized tent market as what they're going to need in the way of the office space as cause tours to tick up, and we have paper going back and forth with a couple of tenants. So they're not full building tenants, but they are multi-floor tenants and I don't know whether we'll get any of them not, of course, at this point, but there is activity and I would call the activity very good. And really happy when we made the decision that we made to start building out more four-by-four. Donald Wood : Yes. And Greg, just to say the obvious, that is a difference. That is a difference in feeling. I don't think we could have said that. In fact, we didn't say it on the February call or maybe last November. So really happy about that decision at this point, too. Hopefully, it bears fruit. Time will tell. And with respect to 919, 919 it's really -- it's really interesting. 915, we haven't done 919 yet. On 915, we turned the building over the floors over to choice. Then they are building out their space. We will have a contribution from them next -- starting next year. Daniel Guglielmone : End of the year. Donald Wood : End of this year. Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Donald Wood : Sodexo also, which, as you know, signed the lease, we're almost ready to turn the space over to them. That is going really well. And then -- so then -- so that's the 60-some-odd percent of the building that is completely leased. We have serious back and forth on a number of tenants for most of the rest of the building at this point. So it's pretty interesting at a time when, as you know, there can't be a dirtier word than office in the country is it possible that a subcomponent of all of us is actually undersupplied. And that's a component would that be mixed-use properties where you have a new building in a first ring suburb, which is obviously all we have. So I'm pretty encouraged by what we're seeing here at Road is certainly the same up at Assembly Row. And with new activity at Santana West, I hope we have something tell to you. Operator : The next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Connor Mitchell : So now that you've entered Hoboken Phoenix, and I know you've mentioned you're not rushing to start digging any time soon. But as you deploy more capital, do you see more urban infill or population growth areas and maybe just how you think about the two different market types. Donald Wood : Yes, Conor. It's it certainly wouldn't be areas with big population growth. The problem with big population growth means that there's usually room for a lot more supply to be added. And we want to be in supply-constrained areas. Nothing more supply constrained than Washington Street in Hoboken, and love the investment that we've made there. We're just getting into on the one redevelopment there, whether we can effectively make the numbers work. I'm very encouraged by that fact. I would not, again, expect to see us under construction in the next month or two or something like that. But that project is going to very likely make some sense. To the extent we can find more have it makes sense in markets where we already are like that. We'll look at it all day long. But that's the type of thing that's far more attractive to us than chasing headcount. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Unidentified Analyst : This is Hassan [ph] on for Craig. The active mixed-use redevelopments all have a 6% projected returns. How are you thinking about return thresholds for incremental project starts given the elevated cost of capital? Donald Wood : Yes. No, it's a very good question. And I think I've answered this a couple of [indiscernible] but think about it this way. We need incremental returns or incremental returns on top of our cost of capital in terms of development of at least 150 basis points from an IRR perspective, more like 200 basis points from an IRR perspective. The reason I keep saying IRR perspective is because the stuff that we do in those projects, we won't do unless they grow faster. Our experience has shown us that those projects are -- we are able to increase rents faster. The residential component is important with respect to that. But incrementally, once we get comfortable with what our cost of capital is going to be, I'd like a little more clarity from the Fed. Maybe we're getting there -- getting a little bit closer that way on the debt side. On top of that, add 150 to 200 depending on the risk of the particular project from an IRR perspective. I hope that's helpful. Operator : Next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum, Compass Point. Floris van Dijkum : I guess could I ask about your shop occupancy at 90% leased, what is the gap between occupied and leased and how much more will that number, can you drive that over the next two years? And how much more do you think that will increase maybe even this year? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. The occupied percentage of small shop is 88%. And we would expect to be able to drive both of those up higher. I think that's a real opportunity. And up towards the occupied percentage above 90% and up towards north of 92% on the lease side. I think there's still more room to run on that our portfolio. Operator : The next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : I wanted to touch on capital recycling, primarily because it's such an important growth tool for REITs. And really, it's been hampered as you know, especially this year. But Don, with the Fed striking a pause here and some calling for perhaps a first round of cuts and maybe Q1 '24, somewhere around that time frame. Do you think there's visibility in rates and somewhat of a stability in rates can condense or narrow what must be a wide bid-ask spread. So you can maybe do some accretive acquisitions and reignite that growth engine later the year? Donald Wood : I do, Derek, I mean you said the word in your question, there has to be some level of stability. There has to be predictability. And without that, as there hasn't been, as you know, it's sure, the bid-ask is very different. That will change. Now it will change over time, and there are other things than just Fed's that dictate whether there is or an acquisition market that makes sense for a disposition market that makes sense, but it's not going to stay the way it is. So yes, I mean, we run this business. We've run this business for a long term, long time. We'll continue to do that. And during those cycles, there will be a reversion to some level of stability that allows us to get stuff done. No questions. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Michael Goldsmith : Dan, you had a slight beat on FFO relative to the consensus, you're not touching guidance as it's still early in the year. I guess like what are you looking for over the next three months or when we next speak on an earnings call, would that -- would give you more confidence that you can take the year's expectations higher? And then separately, like what are you looking for, which would maybe give you a little bit more caution in terms of the outlook for the year. Daniel Guglielmone : Look, I think the biggest driver would be just continued strong leasing volumes. Our pipeline is as strong as is large in terms of what's been executed to date this quarter and what's in the pipeline of executed LOIs. It's never been higher. And so that continues, and we can see that continue. I think that obviously, we'll have some confidence. On the flip side, look, I think the market is -- got some risk out there, particularly with regards to tenants and whether or not tenants we'll be able to weather this difficult economic environment, whether or not we see a continued uptick in bankruptcies. And I think that balance, we've done very well balancing that. I think that we've managed to have very little exposure or on a relative basis, certainly, but just in absolute terms in terms of our exposure to those bankruptcies, we hope that continues. Operator : Next question comes from Haendel St, Juste with Mizuho. Ravi Vaidya : This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Handel. I hope you guys are doing well. Just wanted to comment and ask about the snow spread. You currently are at 160 bps. Would you view this as a long-term steady state for what snow could be? Daniel Guglielmone : Look, we've done an exceptional job, I think, of bringing our SNO metric down from north of 300 basis points in our existing portfolio, down to 160 basis points. We'd like to get that tighter. We'd like to get that down to 100 basis points to 125 basis points. One of our differentiators though, is that we have an SNO and space that is yet to be delivered from our large redevelopment and expansion pipeline that is equal to that size. So we have $18 million in the existing portfolio, $18 million of total rent in our development, redevelopment and expansion pipeline and that equates to over 300 basis points. I think that's pretty compelling. And I don't think anybody has a redevelopment pipeline that has the pre-leasing that's been done, where it's something that is a real differentiator because we've got scale. And that truly, I think, the equivalent of what's in the existing portfolio and what's in the redevelopment portfolio. is effectively 300 basis points or more. Operator : The next question comes from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. Hong Zhang : Just a quick question on occupancy. I think last quarter, you talked about potentially pushing economic occupancy above 93%, maybe in the mid-93s by year-end. Just wondering if that's changed given the Bed Bath announcement and your views on near-term bankruptcy risk in general? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. No, I think -- look, it depends on so far of our 9 anchor boxes, we've only had one lease rejected. We'll see how it plays out. Obviously, if there's a full liquidation, then we're not going to be at 93% on an occupied percentage. We'll be probably closer to 92%. But we'll see how that all plays out. What gets somewhat that is in terms of what leases get purchased in there liquidation. And from that perspective, we would hope to have a clearer sense from that number as the bankruptcy unfolds. Operator : The next question comes from Paulina Rojas-Schmidt with Green Street. Paulina Rojas-Schmidt: Don, you have talked about how you believe your portfolio outperformed peers in an economic downturn. And you have highlighted how affluence, good demographics are a key driver behind that. But an are perceived perhaps as vulnerability is your slightly higher exposure to more cyclical categories restaurants a little bit more foot price apparel. So could you please provide a little bit of a history lesson on how these segments have performed historically in downturns in your portfolio to have a better understanding of how the overlap between high demographics and cyclical categories perform. Donald Wood : Paulina, thanks for asking that. it's kind of like in my prepared remarks, I wanted to make a distinction of how those mixed-use properties with generally higher-end tenants, how effectively they do. And what we have found -- and look, retail -- sorry, real estate is local. So in the specific markets where they are operating both historically and currently, what we're seeing is increased sales and importantly, very importantly, on a period of inflation, those tenants have the ability to raise prices. When I sit and I think about -- and I don't know the answer to this, but I ask you to consider something like this. If you take aspirational tenants, the Lulu Lemons of the world, people like that effectively. And imagine how much they've been able to increase prices over the next -- last two years of inflation and compare that more to maybe the big lots of the world or something that is aiming for a lower demographic. It's harder to press -- it's harder to push price increases. That's a really important thing for us in all parts that includes restaurants, et cetera. Now I don't know whether I've told you this before or not, I don't remember, but everybody was worried about Federal Realty going into the 2008, 2009, great financial crisis because we had more restaurants, because we had more lifestyle, if you will, everybody was worried about Federal, and it turned out that those were the best-performing categories in the company doing that. And when I look today at our company, and I look at the restaurant performance in the mixed-use properties, they are generating over $1,000 a foot of sales. And part of that is because they've been able to raise prices. Part of that is because there's a huge amount of volume that goes through there. But that gives them the ability to certainly cover the rents that we are charging them and more. And when you think about that in those type of areas, we would expect that to continue to happen. The conversations we have, and we are very tight, we're a smaller company in terms of number of properties than our competitors. We have very close relationships with our tenants. We understand what it is that they are doing to be able to work through difficult -- more difficult economic times. And so those things give me confidence because we have been doing this a long time, and there are cycles. And I expect it to behave similar to the way it's behaved historically. I hope that's helpful. Operator : The next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Tayo Okusanya : Congrats on a solid quarter. Don, last quarter, when you kind of talked about dispositions, it sounds like there was a pipeline of kind of a little bit over $100 million or so you were working on. I think this quarter, you kind of announced $13 million of it done. Could you talk about like the rest of the pipeline, what's kind of happening there whether it's kind of taking a little bit longer to close deals because of the shakeout on the debt market. So just give us a sense of maybe what's kind of happening on that front? Donald Wood : Yes. We have and continue to have a list of assets that we would recycle as a component of our business plan. And frankly, we have that list in good times and bad times in terms of what it is. So those are not a lot of properties, but it's a few that we look at. The -- that's what we talked about last quarter, last year, et cetera. And we got to get comfortable that we're going to get paid well. And so in going through that process, we couldn't get comfortable on as many of those assets as we thought we could. That doesn't mean they come off the table. That just means pursuant to the question that was asked a little bit earlier, once there's some stability and some understanding of the general market conditions, you'll see a pickup in the disposition side of our business. I don't know, Dan or Jeff, is there anything to add to that? Think that's it. Operator : The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Linda Tsai : I'm not sure if you look at it this way, but I think one of your peers talked about the average rents in their SNO pipeline. I was just wondering if you had a number for that for yours. Daniel Guglielmone : Probably on a total rent basis in the kind of the low to mid-20s and probably in the upper 30s on a -- mid- to upper 30s on a base rent basis. But we can come back to you with more precise numbers. I don't have them exactly here. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Don, can you -- a number of years ago, you guys expanded into the Hispanic centers out in California. And just sort of looking for an update on that. Then also the Korean like the H Marks of the world seems to also be a pretty powerful anchor, and those shopping centers also seem to have that cold-type following. So do you see expanding into more in the Asian Hispanic centers? Or is your experience so far with what you bought a number of years ago, maybe not panned out the way you thought. Donald Wood : Thanks, Alex. It has panned out the way we thought. In fact, probably better than we thought in terms -- given the fact that we didn't consider a global pandemic, and those properties performed exceptionally well during the pandemic. What -- the answer to your question really depends on the right local partner. It really depends on the market, of course, that we need to be comfortable with and a partner that we would need to be -- that we would need to be aligned with, with respect to our views and the way we can manage a property. Prime Store has been that. It's been a very good partnership. We've had trouble adding more to it. We would have wanted to have added more to it. But those are individual deal by deal, and they've got to make some sense, and we didn't find any of that made sense. But those assets perform really well. I'll actually be out there on Monday of next week with Prime Stores. So that part's worked out really well. In terms of any other property type with a demographic that we're not as comfortable with, as I say, we need the right partner because these are real estate decisions that have to be operated and have to be leased and have to be grown specific to a market and if we're not familiar with, we'll get hurt. So we better have the right partner, and we've not found that at this time. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Leah Brady for any closing remarks. Leah Brady : We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.",

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thanks Leah and good afternoon everybody. And special thanks to David Simon for finishing his call more or less on time this afternoon. All-time record-setting quarter for Federal Realty this time with $1.67 second quarter FFO per share result ahead of consensus, ahead of internal expectations, and ahead of last year's second quarter. By the way, last year's second quarter was helped by a large termination fee from Amazon as they exited their brick-and-mortar bookstores. Ex-termination fees, this quarter's bottom line FFO per share growth grew 5% despite significantly higher interest expense. That's a really strong quarter for us. Leasing velocity continues to be the highlight. We signed 107 comparable leases of 576,000 square feet at $35.34 a foot, 7% higher than the cash basis rent the previous tenant was paying in the final year of their lease, 19% on a straight-line basis. Demand was exceptional. When you include non-comparable leases, which, by the way, for us, largely relates to newly built out space on our redevelopment and development projects, along with our office leasing, we executed 135 leases in the second quarter for a very robust 652,000 square feet, representing $23 million of newly contracted annual rent. These are production numbers that lie well outside the averages over our very long history and we'll go a long way towards offsetting the loss at Bed Bath & Beyond and Christmas Tree Shop income stream in 2024, until they're re-leased and rent paying. In terms of Bed Bath, we lost 1 of our remaining nine Bed Bath leases during the quarter. That lease, a 25,000 square foot box at Mount Vernon Plaza in Northern Virginia, has been re-leased to Burlington at a 57% rent increase. Three more Bed Bath leases were rejected effective June 30 and July rent was received on the remaining five. Two of the remaining five were Buy Baby locations that were assumed by online Baby retailer Dream on Me, and we, therefore, expect to continue to receive rents in the future. The remaining three leases were rejected in the third quarter, and accordingly, we'll have a hit to occupancy of about 1% and lost rent of $2.5 million or so for the balance of 2023, all of which has been considered in our guidance. Deals are in the works for all of our Bed Bath locations and replacement rent will start to ramp up in late 2024. Both leased and physical occupancy continued to improve compared with the previous quarter and the previous year. 94.3% leased, a 92.8% physical occupancy at quarter end are up 10 and 20 basis points, respectively, compared with the first quarter and 20 and 80 basis points, respectively, year-over-year. Small shop occupancy gains, in particular, continued their trend during the quarter and increased 20 basis points on a lease basis and 40% on an occupied basis. That's a total increase in small shop occupancy of 310 basis points since Q1 2022. The quality of our small shop tenants and the discerning way that we choose them at our properties is where we create a ton of value. All small shop vacancy or tenancy rather is not created equal. I've noted in the past couple of quarters that leasing productivity and rate that have occurred at the properties we've acquired over the past several years has significantly exceeded our underwriting and that has continued. Similarly, leasing productivity at properties that have recently undergone redevelopment and/or property improvement plans have outperformed our expectations, and we expect that to continue, means that maybe we can be a bit too conservative at times. The roughly 3,100 apartments that make up an important part of the revenue stream at our mixed-use and other properties remain a real differentiating bright spot for our portfolio and continue to add to both cash flow and to value. In the aggregate, our residential portfolio was 98% leased at June 30, and provided 11% more property operating income this quarter than compared with the last year's second quarter. Resi is a super important component of our mixed-use neighborhoods as is the office component, which is also 98% leased outside Santana West and the Choice headquarters building, which is under construction. We did, by the way, deliver the newly built out office space to Choice Hotels this quarter and expect them to finish their work and occupy the building by year-end. Sodexo in the same building will follow right behind. I reported last quarter that inquiries and property tours have seen renewed life at Santana West, and that has certainly continued. Even the Northern California press is starting lower layoffs and dramatic new investment and hiring in areas like AI, electric vehicles and related technologies. Feels like Silicon Valley is stabilizing. So I look back and I think about what it is that we're doing, and I kind of tell you that some of the country's most productive and well-known mixed-use communities sitting just outside San Jose, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Miami seem to us, seem to me, be the right on the mark of the product that is and will remain in high demand as resilient consumers continue to prove that to be so. Let me turn it over to Dan before opening it up to your questions. Dan G.: Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Reporting a company record FFO per share of $1.67 is very satisfying, particularly given the interest rate headwinds we faced and is a testament to the continued strength of our business model. To reiterate Don's earlier comment, we beat our previous record of FFO in the quarter last year by 5% when adjusting for the outsized term fees that we had last year and also posted 5% sequential growth versus the first quarter, again, a strong indicator of the health in our underlying business. With respect to this record performance, which significantly exceeded our expectations, we can point to the following drivers : higher property-level POI than was forecast driven by continued strength in rents, parking, specialty leasing and percentage rent, coupled with lower operating expenses as well, as a continued focus on cost controls at the corporate level resulting in lower G&A. This was offset by the aforementioned higher interest costs. As you can see, a very strong quarter. With respect to our comparable metric, POI growth was 4.6%, excluding the impacts of term fees in the prior period rent. On a cash basis, comparable POI growth, excluding term fees and prior period rent was even better, 4.7%. Term fees in the comparable pool this quarter were down significantly to $1.6 million versus $5.5 million in the second quarter of last year and prior period rent this quarter was $1.2 million versus $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2022. Again, please note, all of these figures are disclosed in detail in our supplemental 8-K on Pages 10 and 11. Year-over-year occupancy showed continued progress with our overall occupied metric growing 80 basis points year-over-year from 92 to 92.8 and our lease percentage increasing 20 bps from 94.1% to 94.3%. Small shop momentum continued year-over-year with a 90.2% rate being up 90 basis points over the previous year with a targeted lease rate for small shop of 92%. Our signed not occupied percentage in total stands at approximately 3% or $34 million, comprised of roughly $17 million of incremental total rent in our existing portfolio and an additional $17 million of total rent in our non-comparable pool, where leases are signed and the space is to be delivered. Our non-comparable signed non-occupied pool is an important differentiator of Federal's business plan, which is often overlooked. Total comparable leasing volume for the quarter of 576,000 square feet, a federal record for a second quarter and the second highest volume for a quarter ever on a comparable basis. The rollover at 7% on a cash basis and 19% on a straight-line basis highlights the straight-line growth that's driven by sector-leading contractual rent bumps, which for our entire portfolio averaged roughly 2.25% blended across both anchor and small shop. Now, to the balance sheet. At June 30, we stood with $1.3 billion of total available liquidity comprised of $1.2 billion available under our revolver and $100 million of cash. During the quarter, we successfully demonstrated access to the unsecured market at attractive levels with a $350 million, 5 3/8% green bond, our second green bond, highlighting our focus on sustainability and our commitment with respect to our overall ESG strategy. Make sure to check out our annual corporate responsibility report on our website that was published in early June. With respect to leverage, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continues to improve each quarter, and we fully expect to be back to our targeted level in the mid-five times in 2024. Our in-process $750 million pipeline of active redevelopments and expansions has only $220 million remaining to spend against our $1.3 billion of available liquidity, with a large chunk of that remaining figure being leasing capital, which is good news when deployed. Now on to guidance. We are increasing our forecast for FFO per share for 2023 by $0.04 per share at the midpoint to $6.52 from a range of $6.38 to $6.58 per share to a new range of $6.46 to $6.58 per share. Guidance now reflects 2023 FFO growth over 2022 of about 2% to 4% or 3.2% at the midpoint. We have managed through bankruptcies to date in the retail sector extremely well, collecting more rent from Bed Bath than we had forecasted and having relatively small exposure to other retailer fold out. As the Bed Bath bankruptcy winds down, we expect it will result in a 31 basis point hit for the year versus our initial credit reserve of 25 to 60 basis points. With respect to the balance of our tenancy, we are setting that reserve at 50 to 75 basis points. We will see a dip in occupancy next quarter as the impact of our lost Bed Bath locations and one Christmas Tree Shops become fully reflected but expect to finish the year back in the low to mid-92% range. Also keep that impact in mind for the cadence of FFO per share for the balance of the year, with third quarter forecasted at $1.61 at its midpoint and the fourth quarter at $1.65 at its midpoint. From a comparable growth perspective, given a solid first half of the year, we are affirming the 2% to 4% range for comparable POI growth, as well as our 3% to 5% range on a cash basis adjusting for prior period rents and term fees. Given our focus on cost controls, we lowered our G&A forecast from $54 million to $52 million -- $52.5 million at the midpoint, and we increased our forecast for contributions from redevelopments and expansions to $16 million to $19 million, up from the previous range of $15 million to $18 million. We have provided an updated summary of these key assumptions on our guidance on Page 27 of our 8-K. Before I close my prepared remarks, allow me to highlight that for the 56th consecutive year, Federal's Board of Directors increased our dividend, a REIT industry record. As the sole dividend king in the real estate sector, we are extremely gratified to have stayed the course through yet another challenging economic cycle and continued providing our shareholders with comfort in reliably growing stream of cash flow. Please note that the CAGR over these 56 years is 7% compounded. And now I'm finished with my prepared remarks, and let me turn it back to Don Wood for the completion of his remarks. Don Wood : Thanks, Dan. As I listen to Dan's conversation and comments there, I thought one more point that I really I wanted to make. There's so much conversation about the supermarket part of our business and part of the industry and how good that is, but I want you to know about our mixed-use communities. I spoke about the overall outsized performance of the four -- big four mixed-use communities last quarter, but it bears repeating as its strength continued and helped drive the results in the second quarter. Taken together, Assembly Row, Bethesda Row, Pike & Rose and Santana Row are a real company differentiator for Federal, as you know, and more in demand than ever before, with retail leased occupancy at 98% and tenant sales well above 2019 levels. These properties are humming with estimated foot traffic in excess of 30 million shoppers in the trailing 12 months. That's a big number. And it comes from the database of place for AI, which we think is well understated. In our estimation, this is the product in the market that consumers in a post-COVID world want the most. So despite the well-publicized bankruptcies of companies like Bed Bath and Christmas Tree Shops and the effects of higher interest rates on our business, I'm feeling pretty darn good about the way this year is playing out, and that's been the basis for which we could increase guidance by as much as we did this quarter. Let's now turn it over and open it up to your questions. Q - Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good afternoon and thank you, Don, for moving the call to avoid the overlap. So appreciate it. Don Wood : You\u2019re welcome, Alex. Alexander Goldfarb : So a question, I guess, on the mixed use. You guys had a recent -- there was an article on you guys with Federal Plaza West, which I guess is not too far from Pike & Rose that you got approval for some residential addition. So, maybe a bit more color on this. I don't think you're anticipating on doing another Pike & Rose mega redevelopment, but maybe your thoughts on the apartments here. And then in general, are you feeling better about sort of ramping back up, adding more apartments across your shopping center portfolio, or is your view from a capital perspective that you'll do maybe a few of these at a time, but you're not planning to roll out multiple projects just given, again, cost of capital? Don Wood : Thanks, Alex. First of all, I'm really impressed that you're reading Montgomery County, Maryland press releases and get into the detail of what's going on at Federal. It's pretty cool. Yes, we did get full entitlements for apartments at Federal Plaza. And I think I've talked for quite some time about using a downtime to get our development team and keep our development team working on entitlements that can be put to work as the economy changes. And I know a lot of people talk about residential. Resi is a really important part for us, and it's not just resi at the mixed-use properties, which is also obviously an important part of what we do. We, right now, not only have just gotten federal Plaza entitlements, but there's 500 units that are shovel ready that we could do today, and we're really looking hard at the capital allocation and the numbers to see how much -- what we really need to get done there and what we can underwrite at Santana Row and at Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. In addition to that, there's another dozen properties, another 3,000 units, so like 3,500 units for which we are actively working on entitlements at our shopping centers. These are places, you wouldn't necessarily think about them particularly, like Friendship Heights, like the Avenue side of Baltimore, like Hoboken in New Jersey, Panam shopping center, a bunch of them. And when you think about us, we've done this stuff before. We've been doing it for 20 years. So look at the back of Congressional Plaza, Housing [ph], Chelsea Shopping Center, previously at Bala. We do a lot of this stuff and we try to do it with our own capital when the numbers make sense so that it moves the needle. Doing stuff with the capital that we could put to work and get it -- get an above-average return will move the needle for Federal. And it's one of the key differentiators given our experience that we look at and will look at over the next 5 and 6 years. Some of those projects don't pencil today. No surprise to anybody. So what? Get the entitlements. Increase the value of the land. Be ready to put money to work when it makes sense. That's a key part of our growth. Operator : The next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just curious if -- as you think about getting bigger and looking for new opportunities, which you've talked about in the past, just how you're thinking about funding. Would you consider any joint venture of any of the big 4 properties that help differentiate -- or how are you thinking about kind of the push and pull of growing that -- funding that? A \u2013 Donald Wood : Juan, it's a great question. And let's talk holistically about how we fund the company and where we move forward. I think one of the big differentiators of this company is that we have a ton of equity effectively tied up, if you will, in the big 4. I've talked about it in the past and today is not the right day to -- taking a joint venture partner on Assembly or on Santana, but those markets will open up, and we want to be ready to be able to do that. I do think that when you think about the long-term plan of Federal, that harvesting, if you will, some of the great work that we've done, I'm sitting here right now at Assembly Row, this is where we had our Board meeting today and looking out this window, and we're real proud of what we created here. And it's a ton of value. So yes, on the -- over the medium term, that is a critical source of funding and one that is, I believe, will trade. We'll show it when we show it when we can do that, at well under what history common stock would effectively be at because I don't think we're getting paid for the value that we did here. So, that's a critically important part. In addition, when you talk about the nearer term funding plan, Dan can talk about, you know that the capital markets are open to us and have been open to us even in the worst of times. So, the notion of using all of the arrows in our quiver over the next year or so is what you should expect as we normally would run the company. But longer term, there's a special lower cost of capital tied up in this company that's going to really help us grow over the medium term. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon, good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Questions on Santana Row and more specifically, Santana West. What's the latest and greatest the leasing conversations that you're having there? And as you talk to tenants, are they thinking through return to office and how return to office looks at a mixed-use center versus a traditional office setting? And is that part of the conversations there? And is that driving momentum? How the kind of return to office kind of continues to amplify? Thanks. Don Wood : Yes, Michael, it's a great question. Let me give you a little bit here and then have Jeff or Jan to expand to the extent there's something else to say. The important thing to understand here, I do believe there is a stabilization happening in the Valley. And I think if you lived out there or saw the press and everything out there, you'd say, maybe we are getting some sort of a period of time where things can start happening. We are in some earnest and, frankly, advanced negotiations with tenants for space right now that are looking at our space simply because of where it is at Santana Row, simply because that is a brand-new product that is fully amenitized. And look, I've been snake-bitten a couple of times before, so I'm certainly careful about this. But I'm pretty confident that we'll have some leasing success in the relatively near future. I hope I'm right. If I'm not, you can say I was wrong. But it feels palpably different in the Valley than it has over the last year or two. And I know that from a product standpoint, this is the stuff that -- I mean, we're getting the views because of the type of product that we have because of the fully amenitized mixed-use environment. This is where it's at. Jan Sweetnam : I think the only thing I would add, Michael -- this is Jan -- is that we're seeing more than our fair share of looks right now in the marketplace, the very reason that Don laid out. Everyone we're talking to wants to have the carrot [ph] to bring their people back in the office, where they want to go to work. Those are the types of tenants we're talking to right now, and it's been real positive. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Hey good evening. Just hoping you could touch on what you're seeing in terms of acquisition opportunities within the market today, whether you're starting to see a narrowing of bid/ask spreads and where there's properties out there of the quality that you're looking to acquire? Jeff Berkes : Hey Greg, it's Jeff. Yes, the market is starting to pick up a little bit. There's been a handful of trades or maybe slightly less than a handful of trades in our West Coast markets at cap rates to start with a five. There's probably another couple of handfuls of deals in the marketing process on both the East and West Coast where we would look to buy and the expectations there are sub six. So we're starting to see more stuff come to the market and the bid ask spreads start to narrow. As you know, we have a very active team. We're always in the market. We're always trying to force stuff before it gets into an auction process, And we're looking at a lot of stuff, but we're selective too and don't really have anything to talk about at this point. But definitely out there are definitely looking and starting to see more activity. So hopefully, we'll have something good to report in coming quarters in that regard. Greg McGinniss : Thanks, Jeff. And if I could just follow up on Santana West on a more modeling based question. But when you have to stop capitalizing interest on that property, is there going to be any sort of disconnect between when a tenant is moving in and the interest that's being capitalized there? Dan G.: Yeah. We fully expect to be able to capitalize based on our build-out plan for the floor by floor and the timing and so forth through of 2024, and we expect to replace the -- we expect to have income starting as we bring that capitalized interest down. And so we don't expect the disconnect at the moment, but we'll know more as we get leases signed and as we continue to build out and see on the success of the multi-tenant approach that we've had in the building. Operator : The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Ravi Vaidya : This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel St. Juste. Hope you guys are doing well. Just one question here. Can you comment on your watch list? What would you estimate it to be on an ABR basis? And what would you estimate the embedded mark-to-market would be on that subset? Dan G.: Look, we've done very well with regards to the watch list so far. I mean I think that with the exception of Bed Bath, we've had very little exposure to the failing retailers that we've had to date. I think that just generally those that are on our people's radar, whether they be Joanne or At Home or other names like that, we have very limited exposure there. I think, Wendy, I don't know if there's other comments. Wendy Seher : Yeah. I mean we're constantly reevaluating the list, and it's not just the watch list, but it's who's going up in size, who's going down in size and how are we managing what that means to us in the long term. If you look at what bankruptcies, I'm feeling pretty good about what I see on our watch list. If you look at the bankruptcies we've had, David's Bridal. Both of our leases were assumed. Party City, we have short-term leases with them, and we have one lease out for signature to backfill. The one location and the second location has two letters of intent on it. And Tuesday Morning, we had three locations with them. Two of them already signed leases and one is in lease documentation we executed this quarter. So, feeling pretty strong. Operator : The next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore. Please go ahead. Samir Khanal : Hey, Dan, I guess, similar to the last question, just on sort of the watch list. I know you've put in this sort of a general reserve, I think you said about, if I recall, it's 50 to 75 bps. I'm just trying to -- knowing that it's sort of August here. And is that you just being a little bit conservative, or do you expect some fallout into the back half of the year? I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. Any hints or any comments you can provide into maybe even next year, right? I mean where do you think that general reserve would be? Do you think it will be higher or lower, similar to this year? Thanks. Dan G.: Yes. Look, kind of the first half of the year outside of Bed Bath & Beyond, we had about 50 basis points of credit reserve impact. I think we -- as I stated, we're going to end up with or expect to end up with on Bed Bath about 31 basis points for the full year. Okay. And then with regards to the second half of the year, the 50 to 75 basis points, there may be some conservatism in there. But right now, we're probably -- we initially came out with 100 to 130 basis points at the start of the year. It's probably more in the 80 to 100 basis points. So we've made some real progress there. And so hopefully, we'll do better than that 50 to 75. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Mailman of Citi. Please go ahead. Craig Mailman : Dan, I just want to kind of go through -- there's a $0.06 essentially sequential dip, which I think is about $4.9 million from 2Q FFO to 3Q FFO. I know you already kind of called out the $2.5 million from three Bed Bath rejections. Could you just kind of bridge the balance of the sequential decline for us? Dan G.: Yes. A big hit there is going to be the interest expense. We refinanced a bond in the second quarter, repaid them effectively on June 1, so we're going to see the full quarter there. Plus, the Fed continues to raise rates, and so we do have a little bit of exposure on the floating rate side. And that's probably the lion's share in addition to the Bed Bath impact in 3Q. Operator : The next question comes from Lizzie Dougan [ph] of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. Thanks for having me on. So you did comment on leasing productivity and that's continued to outperform expectations. Can you talk about the spreads achieved on the leases executed this quarter? It just looks like that moderated, particularly on renewals. Just want to get some more color on what tenants are still willing to take and kind of comment on the outlook for the trend on spreads going forward? Don Wood : Liz, it's -- I hear you. I really still believe very much that looking at a 7% spread on a re-leasing spread with the type of bumps that we have inherent in our lease, it's really the equivalent of 16% of a company with inherent bumps 100 basis points less than ours. And I think that's a really important thing that we've been talking about over the last few quarters. So when you see seven and you compare that to somebody else who doesn't have the contractual bumps of 11 or 12, we still have better economics. And I don't think that's understood all that well. I don't think it's a deceleration. It's simply a matter of the mix in the particular quarter. So I don't think you should draw any trend lines associated with that. I've got to tell you, ma'am, when you -- I think something like -- I'm making up a number here. I'm not sure I get this right. But it's like three out of four of our leases have very -- have 3% or better bumps in them. And that includes anchors. And that is a big number. And I don't think anybody else could say that. I don't know because nobody discloses it. I get it. But when you look at 7% bumps here, let me tell you, the economics of that are significantly better because of those bumps. Operator : The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : Thanks. Good evening. Your equity issuance guidance is lowered. I was just curious how much impact that made to your overall FFO guidance. And from a realistic standpoint is issuing $100 million very realistic just given where your stock price is? And when you talked about some of the acquisition opportunities at sub-6 potentially, I guess, how is that more attractive than maybe buying back your stock, which is trading at mid to higher 6s? And I realize that's only one spec you want to know how you make decisions, but just curious overall. Dan G. : No, very good question, very good question. Look, with regards to the equity, that's just an assumption that we layer in for our guidance. It doesn't make a huge difference between the $200 million that we -- I think we had previously. So I wouldn't read too much into that. I think that it's just a number that is in there for an assumption to get to that midpoint of 652 [ph] and the range that we have. And with respect to buying back stock, I mean, look, I don't think it's a particularly attractive use of our capital today. given we've got potentially -- we want to preserve our dry powder for better opportunities currently and think that we'll focus on acquisitions and redevelopments given where we're currently trading. Don Wood : And Ki Bin, I guess just one more. You certainly hear lots of companies that say, they're going to buy back stock and share repurchases are great and all. But I got to tell you, unless you're doing it in size to really change the capitalization of the company and effectively have a broader notion of that, doesn't move the needle. ,So the idea of -- unless it's deeply, deeply discounted and stays deeply, deeply discounted for a long period of time. And so kind of what we see on the horizon here and the opportunities that we'd like to put money to work on driving up leverage by buying back stock doesn't make sense for us in the long-term even if it does provide a little bump, but again, how much in the short-term. Dan G. : And to the extent we don't like where our stock is trading, we've got a pool of assets that we'll opportunistically look to sell in the market and try and obtain more attractive pricing than where our stock is trading. So we've got multiple arrows in the quiver to fund the business going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Dori Kesten of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good evening. What refinancing options are you considering for your 2024 maturities? And then where is that pricing today? Dan G.: With regards to the $600 million that we have coming due in January, look, we're in the market assessing it. It's not particularly opportunistic today. We raised $350 million back in April. I think we feel pretty good about that at 5 3/8% coupon for $350 million. Look, we've got access to the market. I think today, it would be in the upper 5s if we were to access the market today. We don't particularly find that attractive, but we've got time. And so we've got multiple arrows in the quiver there as well in options, and we'll look to be opportunistic. So who knows where we'll be over the next several months, but we'll get it done. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Yeah, hi. Just a quick follow-up on the ramp-up discussion. What's the average portfolio escalator for the overall portfolio? And then if you look at first half of the year leasing, how did the bump on those leases compared to the overall portfolio? Dan G.: Yes. Blended, it's in and around roughly 2.25 across the entire portfolio, anchors and small shop. And this quarter was in line with that, maybe a little bit shy. And that's retail only. Obviously, to the extent that we have other commercial leases, they tend to be higher and they tend to have annual bumps that drives that blended spread up. Don Wood : And by the way, Mike, congratulations to those Oreos cap [ph]. They look fantastic. Operator : The next question comes from Floris van Dijkum of Compass Point. Please go ahead. Floris van Dijkum : Hey guys, thanks. By the way, I ran into Mike at one of your competitor centers the other night and he was wearing his Oreos cap. So he's not afraid to flaunt his success this year. Michael, look, I think you guys are one of two shopping center companies that have raised your guidance where the midpoint is above consensus if I'm not mistaken. So again, that should be pretty positive. There are some -- obviously, financing is going to be potentially an issue that everybody has to deal with at higher rates. I was actually encouraged by the green bonds. One of the things -- and I'd love to get some more detail on this, because I think this is sort of a virtuous cycle, if you will, because I think part of the -- maybe talk about the rate differential of those green bonds relative to regular bonds, probably not as much today, but also talk about what you need to do to qualify for that. And what kind of return on investments and lasting power that we'll have on the overall portfolio in terms of energy efficiency, et cetera, and water usage? Dan G.: Just with regards to pricing, look, we don't do it for the incremental pricing. You could say that there's probably incremental demand. And what that means for pricing with the bonds and so forth, I think, is difficult to quantify in today's market. We do it because, honestly, we like to highlight the fact that when we develop in our mixed-use communities, we develop at LEED Gold or better. We've got a LEED Gold-certified neighborhood designation at Pike & Rose, which is one of only a dozen, I think, in the country. ESG is an important part. I think Don Becker should maybe kind of highlight what we -- some of the more specifics. But look, we do the green bond because I think it kind of showcases what we do, but it also expands just the universe of potential investors who will look at the bonds. And if it gives us better pricing, that's great, but it just -- it enhances execution. And I think that's the most important thing. Operator : The next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi. The comparable signed but not occupied pipeline of, I think, $34 million and the noncomp of $17 million, what's that cadence of the about $50 million coming online? Dan G. : Well, it's not $50 million. It's $34 million. I mean the total is $34 million, and there's $17 million in the existing portfolio. And there's $17 million in the non-comparable portfolio, space to be delivered. That will come online about 45% or $15 million is scheduled to commence the balance of this year. And then the remainder of $19 million, the lion's share of that, almost all of it will come on in 2024. And it's a little bit more weighted in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter this year. Operator : Next question comes from Paulina Rojas of Green Street. Please go ahead. Paulina Rojas : Hello. I'm looking at your disclosure on capital expenditures, and we see moving topics is relative c versus last year and also other prior years. Can you provide some background on what is driving that lower rate than CapEx? Dan G.: The lower CapEx that you're seeing this quarter? Paulina Rojas : Yeah, specifically maintenance that I think you're at 8.7 million year-to-date versus, I don't know, 14 million, 15 million last year. It's down significantly. Don Wood : Yes, Paulina. We are having a hard time hearing you. I don't know whether it's the connection or not. We're going to try to answer this, I guess, on the capital. If we're not giving you what you want, please give us a call directly. Call Dan or Melissa after this, and we'll get you specifically what you want. But we're going to take a shot, I guess where we're going. Dan G.: The numbers that you're referring to, I'm not quite sure. So we'll follow up to you after the call to kind of follow up on this. One thing to notice, yes, capital is down in the quarter. And I think that we feel good about that. And -- but we can't answer your specific question. We'll follow up this evening. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Leah Brady for any closing remarks.. Leah Brady : Thanks for joining us tonight. I hope you have a great rest of the summer. I look forward to seeing you soon. . Operator : The conference has now concluded.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a good time to own high quality retail centric real estate. Demand exceeds supply for the best stuff. And this past quarter's results, and in fact, the whole year thus far has made that patently obvious. For the third consecutive quarter, we signed comparable leases. In other words, 95% of all the deals done during the quarter. The only deals we exclude in our definition of comparable relate to ground-up construction. For over a 0.5 million square feet 553,000 to be exact. For the nine months of 2023, that's over 1.6 million square feet of comparable deals, a mark we've never hit before. It's more than the first nine months of '22, which itself was a record and more than the first nine months of 2021, which itself set a record. You can see it in the occupancy numbers too. Well, the Bed Bath closings were expected to end and reduce occupancy in the quarter versus last year by 100 basis points. Our overall occupancy declined just 30 basis points on a lease basis and 50 basis points on an occupied basis. That says something about demand. If you dig deeper, small shop occupancy, the part of the business we hear the most consternation about increased another 50 basis points to 90.7% on a lease basis, and 80 basis points on an occupied basis. This trend has been a steady and powerful trend for two and a half years now. When you look at occupancy possibilities going forward, by looking at our past, it's reasonable to expect another 100 basis points, a small shop occupancy, and another 250 basis points of anchor occupancy, due largely to Bed Bath. Roughly 200 basis points overall in the coming 18 months or two years, depending, of course, on the extent of future bankruptcies that are not obvious to us today. I go through all this to really try to hammer home the obvious health of a business centered around leasing high quality, retail centric properties in the first ring suburbs of America's greatest cities. While bottom line results are and will continue to be muted by the higher, but certainly historically reasonable cost of capital that's likely here to stay. Rents will likely adjust upward over time to that reality, especially with tenants and in locations that are affluent. I hope that higher interest rates don't cloud investors' appreciation of the strong underlying business fundamentals that exist today and likely tomorrow. So let's talk about rents. 100 comparable deals, which again represents 95% of the deals done this quarter. So certainly representative of the total company. 553,000 square feet starting new rent of $34.51. Final year of old rent $31.17. That's plus 11% on a cash basis, 21% on a straight line basis. A weighted average lease term of 8.8 years, excluding options. The average lease term with all options exercised is more like 16 years. An average CAGR of contractual rent lumps of this quarter's leases was 2.5%. TI's per foot of $31.19, when you don't consider this quarter's option exercises $16.67 per foot when you do. Been hearing that our rents are high for the better part of the last 20 years. I guess on a relative basis they are. Better properties have higher rents, better properties have higher tenant sales and profitability too. Frankly it's obvious. That sustained leasing volume and those economics bode well for the future, especially the contractual rent volumes. Third quarter results benefited from that level of activity over the past six quarters. FFO per share of $1.65 in the third quarter was ahead of consensus, was ahead of internal expectations and ahead of last year's third quarter by 4% despite far higher interest expense and lost Bed Bath income. This is a really strong quarter for us. As you know, we were particularly active on the acquisition front during the COVID years of 2021 through 2022. In total, $1 billion in new additions to the core portfolio during that time, whereby the post-acquisition leasing continues to exceed the acquisition underwriting. Similarly, leasing production in properties that have recently undergone redevelopment and/or property improvement plans have also continued to outperform our expectations and we also expect that to continue. And while big new acquisitions have slowed given the higher cost of capital, note that in 2023, we've been able to invest over $120 million at 8%, with a blended IRR above 10. We did that through, number one, the acquisition of our partners, 22% interest in Escondido Shopping Center. Secondly, the acquisition of the fee and the portion of the Huntington Square Shopping Center that we didn't previously own. And number three, in October, the fee under Mercer on One in Princeton, new Jersey, one of our best performing regional shopping centers over the last 20 years. Smart but creative capital deployment of real estate very well known to us in each case. And as strong as the core shopping center business has been, the large mixed use properties have been even stronger. Retail leased occupancy at 97%. Residential lease occupancy at 98%. Office leased occupancy at 97%, excluding buildings under development. Powerful traffic counts and tenant sales make these property the center of the communities in which they operate. They draw customers from distances far more than the local neighborhood. So as not to leave it out, as I've mentioned on prior calls, our multi-tenant leasing strategy at Santana West has generated meaningful tenant interest that has progressed to advanced lease negotiations with multiple tenants for more than half the building. While leases are not executed yet, our progress here is noteworthy. Strength of our business is grounded in superior demographics. Always has been. Always will be. More density, higher incomes and real barriers to entry are always important in our business, but never more so than an uncertain times in the economy. Past cycles have proven this out time and time again, with 70,000 households with annual household incomes of over $150,000 sitting within three miles of federal centers, there's simply no large open air portfolio available for the public investor to own than this one. Not one. You know, naturally, we're all on the lookout for changes in the strength of the American consumer and their spending habits because, as you know, it's remained surprisingly resilient. So we tried to dissect the limited tenant sales data that we have for the 2023 third quarter and compared it to the 2022 third quarter. As expected for us, sales were up portfolio wide. Digging a little deeper, our properties with the highest average income surrounding them. So a quarter over quarter tenant sales that were significantly better than our properties with the lowest average incomes surrounding them. No surprise, but an indicator we're keeping our eyes on in the months and the year ahead. They set up front. It's a good time to own high quality retail centric real estate. Let me now turn it over to Dan before opening it up to your questions. Dan Guglielmone : Thank you Don and hello everyone. Another strong quarter of bottom line FFO growth despite higher interest costs. Even with the headwinds, stronger POI has driven almost 4% FFO growth both of the third quarter and 2023's first nine months. The $1.65 per share be consensus by $0.03 and was $0.02 above the upper end of our guidance range. With respect to this continued strong performance, we can point to the following drivers. Higher property level POI than forecasts driven by higher min rents as we got tenants open ahead of forecast and kept tenants in longer. Higher overage percentage rent and specialty leasing, higher term fees than we forecast, as well as lower property level expenses. Despite the offset of higher interest costs and higher G&A, as you can see, we had another very, very strong quarter. With respect to our comparable metric, POI growth was 3.8%. On a cash basis, comparable POI growth, excluding term fees and prior period rent was also 3.8%. Year-to-date through the first nine months cash basis comparable POI, ex-term fees and prior period rents stands at 4.6% of the upper bound of our expectations and will result in an increase in 2023's outlook for that metric, which I will touch upon later. This helped contribute to an overall POI growth of 7% for the third quarter and 7.5% year \u2013to-date. Term fees in the comparable pool this quarter were up 2.4 million versus 1.3 million in the third quarter of last year. Prior period rent this quarter was down to 900,000 versus 1.7 million in the third quarter of '22 basically a wash for these two adjustments. Details for term fees and prior period rent in the quarter are disclosed in our 8-K. Year-over-year occupancy showed continued progress, with our overall occupied metric landing at 92.3% and our leased percentage at 94.0%. Both metrics meaningfully higher than we have forecasted due to strong leasing and our team's efforts to get tenants open and rent paying. Net of the negative 100 basis points, occupancy impact from the Bed Bath departures during the quarter, our occupied metric grew by 50 basis points and our leased metric grew by 70 basis points. As a result, our sign not occupied percentage in total stands at over 250 basis points for 27 million, comprised of roughly 17 million recommended total rent in our existing portfolio, with an additional 10 million of total rent in our non-comparable pool, where leases are signed and the space is to be delivered. Now let me emphasize the strong quarter of comparable retail leasing, with 11% cash rollover and 21% rollover on a straight line basis, which was achieved with meaningfully less capital than we've historically seen. Despite having a significantly higher share of new leases signed during the quarter, which was largely caused due to mix. As last quarter we had a high percentage of renewals. Tenant improvements and landlord work per square foot for these new leases came down meaningfully to $41 per square foot and resulted in a blended $31 per square foot, including renewals. Strong new leasing activity was evidenced by 61 new deals totaling 423,000 square feet retail leasing representing 75% of the volume for the quarter. With more than half of this leasing for space that was vacant at June 30th. A big driver of the strong occupancy gains in the third quarter, net of the Bed Bath departures. Historically, Federals disclosed leasing volume, rollover and capital metrics have been reflective of arm's length negotiated transactions and therefore have not included option exercise. Options are one way for the tenant. And they also do not have any capital associated with it. In an effort to continuously improve our disclosure, we have expanded the retail leasing schedules and our 8-K to include option exercises. We had 100 -- we had 482,000 square feet of options exercise this quarter, which incidentally had solid rollover of 9%. But more importantly, bring our total reported capital number from $32 per square foot in total down to $70 per square foot when including these option exercises. This expanded disclosure can be found on page 23 of the 8-K supplement. Note that we have also highlighted what percentage of total leases signed each quarter are comparable. Our trailing 12 month average is 95% by number and 97% by GLA, which we believe presents a more comprehensive picture for the investment community, particularly for rollover. Now to the balance sheet. A quarter-end, we maintain $1.3 billion of total available equipment, comprised of $1.2 billion available under our revolver and roughly 100 million of cash. With respect to our leverage, our net debt to EBITDA ratio held steady at six times, and we continue to expect it to be back into the fives in 2024. Our in-process $750 million pipeline of active redevelopments and expansions, a competitive advantage for federal given its scale. That's only $180 million to spend against our $1.3 billion of available liquidity, with a large chunk of that remaining figure being leasing capital, which is good news when deployed. This pipeline should continue to drive incremental POIs into '24 through '25. And into '26. Now on to guidance. We are increasing our forecast for FFO per share for 2023, up to a range of $6.50 to $6.58, up from the previous range of $6.46 to $6.58. Guidance now reflects 2023 FFO growth over 2022 of 3% to 4%, 3.5% at the midpoint. We have managed through retailer bankruptcies to-date, extremely well. As I previously have discussed, we have relatively small exposure to expected near-term retailer fallout. Our credit reserves will likely come in lower than the originally fully loaded 100 to 135 basis points range that we provided with a revised credit reserve at 85 to 95 basis points. A dip in occupancy, we expected this quarter was much less than forecasted as two of our Buy Buy Baby locations, and only one of our Christmas tree shop locations went away and we're assumed. Coupled with strong performance on accelerating rent commencements and the aforementioned strong leasing volumes for the quarter. From a comparable growth perspective, given a solid first nine months, we are increasing the 2% to 4% comparable POI growth range up to 2.75% to 3.75% and the 3% to 5% range for comparable POI growth adjusting for prior period rents and term fees to 3.75% to 4.75%. On a cash basis, adjusting for prior period rent term fees, we're increasing our 3% to 5% outlook up to 4% to 5%. Additionally, as discussed previously, at length, we expect to continue to capitalize interest expense for Santana West for the balance of this year and through at least 2024, and have refined our G&A assumption down to 51 million to 53 million for the year. As always, we have provided an updated summary of the key assumptions for our guidance on page 27 of our 8K. With respect to 2024, we will provide guidance in detail on our 2023 year-end call in February. And with that operator please open up the line for questions. Operator : Of course, we will now begin the question-and -answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Today's first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, good afternoon, and I'll do my best to stick to the one question. Don, you guys sold. I realize it's small, but you sold one of your Third Street Promenade assets in Santa Monica. And I remember, you know, over the years that that's been sort of one of the highlights that that retail has been a highlight for you. I guess things have changed. But stepping back. Are there other areas of the portfolio that used to hold, you know, maybe better opportunity and what's happened in the past few years as populations have shift. You're now reassessing. So we may see more sales of assets that previously we wouldn't have seen you guys sell. Donald Wood : Thanks for the question, Alex. The answer is a hard, no. Santa Monica Third Street is a, it's a really unique situation, frankly, in the country. We made a fortune on Third Street. And if I show you the IRRs from when we owned it till you know when we sold that building and frankly, the rest of it, they are really spectacular. But there is no doubt that COVID changed Third Street significantly. And, yeah, there's downside on the street. We're not believers in the ability to continue what we have. Now at a different basis. Maybe that could make some sense again because it would be reset and starting again. But please don't take Third Street Promenade and extrapolate that to other assets within the portfolio. It's a unique one-off. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Don, maybe just sticking on the transaction market and looking for opportunities. You know, one of your, I guess, peers in the shopping center space is kind of pivoting and putting a fair number of assets on the market for sale. I'm just curious if any of those larger format assets might hold appeal to federal? Donald Wood : From a sales perspective for us, Steve, the answer to that is not really, I mean, it's the same it's the same process that we would that we would normally go through each year. As you know, you can always expect $100 million, $200 million, 300 sometimes of sales, depending upon the marketplace and what it is we don't have. I don't see that, for us at this point and including looking forward, I'm really happy, frankly, with the positioning that we have. On the other side in terms of buying, there's going to be a buying opportunity, man. I'm not sure if it's -- if it's the right now to tell you the truth. Hard to imagine with all the debt coming due and the situation the banks could be in the next year or two or three, that there won't be some, some really nice opportunities that we see. But we'll stick to that time and see it then. Not today. It would be my answer. Operator : The next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good afternoon. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the signed but not occupied pipeline. On the expectations for the for that NOI to come online and maybe the mix on the timing perspective between the developments redevelopment slash the kind of normal course assets the same store pool. If you could just give us a little color on the expectations for that. Thank you. Donald Wood : Sure, sure. You know, I think that you'll see roughly about 10% of the aggregate number of the 27 million coming in the fourth quarter. I think the balance of it largely will come out over the course of 2024. You know, I don't think I think it will be fairly, you know, front end loaded first half of the year, a little bit more weighted than the back half of the year. And it will not be materially different in terms of kind of when it comes online, when you look at everything, including the space coming online for the non-comparable properties. So largely 10% in the fourth quarter and then the balance in 2024. Operator : The next question comes from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinnis : Hey. Good evening. Two parter on guidance here. First is on the implied Q4 FFO per share guidance range, which at 1.59 to $1. 67 feels a bit wider than usual. So what could take you to the top or bottom of that range? And with regards to development funding, you quite reasonably took equity funding out of guidance but maintained disposition expectations. So how should we be thinking about funding development at year end and into 2024? Donald Wood : Yeah. Hey, look, we narrowed the range. The implied range there. It is what it is. The 1.59 to 1.67. It is there. I think, look, we did an exceptional job this quarter of getting rents started. You know, faster than we expected. We're going to hope to do that again. We have been doing, I think, a good job of keeping tenants in place for longer. I think that we'll see occupancy growth in the fourth quarter, given the significant amount of leasing that we had. You know, I think that there's not going to be probably it is a little wide. The 1.59 you probably want to look, you know, a few cents outside of the midpoint there, but I wouldn't read too much into that. You know, I think part of it is also we'll see what happens with regards to, you know, we're fine tuning our G&A for the remainder of the year. And, you know, I think one of the things that we did really well is, you know, we delivered choice hotels. Early. Got it in before quarter-end. And that will be a nice, you know, recognition through the entire quarter relative to kind of what we had expected. And then, obviously, I think you're going to see, you know, the headwind of interest rates and who knows what happens through the balance of the last two months. But obviously we're facing higher interest rates than we had expected. And, you know, obviously the timing and what we do in terms of our refinancing may dictate some of that. I think development. And then with regards to funding development, we have an undrawn $1.2 billion credit facility. You know, we are continuing to look at in modest levels, not alluded to, continuing to see if we can get some asset sales done. You know, we're very, very well positioned, I think, from our perspective to be able to, you know, we really have $180 million left on our development, um, remaining $750 million development pipeline, $1.3 billion of liquidity at quarter-end certainly positions us well over the next, you know, four to five quarters to get done what we need to get done. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. How does the updated credit reserve guidance compare to historical levels? And related to that, on the tenant watch list, you continue to see strong momentum within the small shop space. Does that represent a larger portion of the tenant watch list in the anchor space? Thank you. Donald Wood : Yes. With regards to the 85 to 95, that's kind of in line. We end up around about 100 basis points. So I think we did slightly better than historically, meaningfully better because I think we had less impact from Bed Bath & Beyond that I think we originally had forecasted. But I think that that's been a positive result from us managing the portfolio over time. And with regards to the watch list, we just don't have much exposure to any of the names that people are worried about. Names like Rite Aid, Big Lots, Joanne, Express represent a de minimis amount of our total rent exposure in the ballpark of about 25 basis points. It's really nothing. And so I think near term, we feel pretty good about the watch list. But we'll assess that for 2024. And we'll move forward as we get through our budgeting process through the balance of this year. Operator : The next question is from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good evening. You started the call with the expectation of 100 basis points of small shop occupancy and 250, I believe, for anchor to be gained over the next 18 months to two years. Would you expect your leasing spreads to remain comparable to what you've seen of late also for that period? Donald Wood : Yes. I think I would, Dori. It's a good question. We talk about it a lot in the notion of how to lease up, what tenants, the appropriate level of merchandising, what they will do to the rest of the shopping center. I mean, we are picky in terms of how we do that. And so the -- frankly, I think if you lease up too fast, you're probably leaving money on the table. And so the notion of being able to get the right tenant and get paid for that, that's something that's really important to us. And combine that with the credit, the type of credit of those small shop tenants, the guarantees that we get, the -- we very rarely do something with a first-time retailer. It's almost always with a regional player or someone that's got a number of stores. We get the entire organization most of the time on the lease from a credit perspective. So for me, that's the key part of where we create the most value in the company. It is that small shop stuff that works off of the anchors. And on the anchor leases, I can't empirically say this, but I believe the terms of the anchor deals that we get, including the bumps that are in those leases and the strength of those leases, I think they're superior. I think they're some of the strongest leases that those tenants do. So it's not just about occupancy. It's about profitability. And that balance is something we take really seriously. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thank you. Can you provide an update on any office lease progress at One Santana, including there was some news that maybe PwC is looking for space there? Thank you. Donald Wood : Jeff, no, I cannot name a tenant. Where are my comments? By the way, you just cost me $10 with Melissa. I said if I made the comments that I made in here, which are real clear with respect to where we are, the deals we have, how close we're getting, et cetera, but we don't have signed leases yet, I said if I made those comments in there, there wouldn't be a question about the same thing. But you are and you cost me $10. I'm going to bill you on that, if you don't mind. That's really all I can say about that. You should be optimistic because we sure are in terms of the ability to keep moving forward. But no, I cannot name a tenant. Operator : The next question is from Hongliang Zhang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hongliang Zhang : Yeah, I guess a follow-up to the prior question. If we were to think about leasing at Santana West, if you were to get a tenant in, would you fully -- would the capitalized interest fully burn off there? Or would it be a proportional amount. Thanks so much. Donald Wood : We expect to continue to capitalize interest on the balance of the year 2024 to deliver space to tenants. We would expect that we would be able to match up the reduction in capitalized interest with the rent starts. So that should be expected. Dan Guglielmone : Consistent with what we've discussed in the past, there's no changes in our expectation with regards to that and that policy. Operator : The next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Ravi Vaidya : Hi, there. This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. Hope you guys are doing well? What's your early read for '24 same-store NOI? Some of your peers have particularly expect next year's same-store to be above average again. Can you talk about that a bit and the levers that you could possibly pull to achieve above-average same-store level for next year? Dan Guglielmone : Look, I think, as I said in my statement, we are going to give guidance for 2024 in detail on our call in February, okay? With regard to same store, we will be growing POI next year. We said that before, I'll confirm that here. But that's about what I'm prepared to say at this point. Operator : The next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good evening. I guess a question on the residential piece of the business. Obviously, the multifamily REITs had a pretty tough earnings season. So what are you seeing there in terms of rent renewal rates or whatnot? And how should that perform in the next few quarters? Donald Wood : Yes, you should be very positive about that. If you think about where our residential is, it's only in four places, four or five places and they're all at the mixed-use properties that have high rents on -- in general because of where they are and the right growth is generally better because of where they are. We're seeing that particularly true at Assembly in -- just outside of Boston. We're seeing that equally true in Silicon Valley. And so when you kind of think about the particular markets that we're in and you think of the cost of home prices and home -- and mortgages that effectively go there, renting at fully amenitized, great locations looks awfully good. And that's our business model. So I can't really talk generally about the residential world because I don't know it outside of these mixed-use environments in our four big projects. I hope that's helpful. Be positive about it. Operator : The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi. It looks like your weighted average lease term moves around each quarter, but stays pretty consistent in the 6.5 to 7.5 years. I just wonder if there's any desire to drive lower lease terms to capture more upside, given the low retail supply. Donald Wood : The only thing I would say to that is it depends on the deal. And so when you're sitting there and not only you get a strong starting rent, but you can get strong bumps in there, we'll lock that in. And that's a key part of what it is that we do. In terms of the 8.8 years this time versus 6.5 or 7.5, that's simply a matter of mix. Now there are certainly certain locations where certain things are happening with redevelopment or whatever else, where we're purposely trying to keep it tighter and shorter period of time, and we do stuff like that. But overall, portfolio-wide, I really do, Linda, I'd really love you to understand those and look hard at those contractual bumps because they're a real differentiator over the term of the lease. Operator : The next question is a follow-up from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, thank you. Don, as we think about the sort of the traditional items and tenant leases that they like, optionality on renewals, co-tenancy, use restrictions, are you starting to see the tenants give on some of those as availability dwindles and they need, yes, there's less space especially at the anchor level? And if you have, can you give some tangible examples of where you've seen tenants make deals today, like the big sort of tough negotiating tenants where they've made deals today that they wouldn't have made a few years ago because of the dwindling availability. Donald Wood : Good question, Alex. It really is. I'm going to turn it over to Wendy to make sure that you get the specifics. Wendy Seher : Alex, so I would say the answer is yes overall. We are seeing with the really, especially from the better specialty brands, they are not able to find the kind of product that they're looking for. And so there is a big demand for some of our Bethesda Row and the growth, for example. I was just talking to the leasing people for Bethesda Row, and we have a waiting list of 10 to 12 tenants that are trying to get into Bethesda Row in the right format they'd like to join us. So when I'm hearing about waiting list, yes, we're able to drive those terms a little bit better than we had before. We just -- it's pretty exciting. We just signed a deal with Bloomingdale's department store to go into The Grove and just over 21,000 square feet, a great opportunity. I can't obviously get into the specifics of that deal. But I will tell you from the time we started the lease until we signed it, it was 40 days. So it was a clear desire on their part to get that deal done in a geographic area that we feel pretty strong will not only benefit them but will benefit our shopping center. Jeffrey Berkes : I would say, Alex, it's Jeff. Keep in mind that we're pretty tough on waste terms, and we're not necessarily giving away a lot of the things that you're talking about to begin with. The leverage is definitely, as Wendy said, shifted to a lot of the landlords in many respects, given the shortage of space and given our proclivity to be tough on all terms in the lease, not just the financial terms. We're cutting good deals right now, and we're cutting them with great tenants. Really, really positive environment right now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is a follow-up from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Just going back to Michael's question from earlier in the call about the implied fourth quarter guide. Maybe, Dan, could you provide a little bit of a bridge on the implied sequential deceleration of what those drivers are in FFO from the third quarter run rate to the midpoint of the implied fourth quarter guide, please? Dan Guglielmone : Yes. Look, I think that -- I think we're probably a little conservative candidly on some of the numbers there. I think we've got a good year, which could impact G&A, which would go up. Those are kind of -- I think the number is a little bit of conservatism and probably a little bit of increased G&A in the final quarter probably is what, I think, gets you to kind of the midpoint or the implied midpoint of the guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Nicholas Joseph : Just curious kind of the plans and thoughts for Mercer Mall after acquiring the fee interest. I know potential expansion or conversion. So wondering on the timing there and kind of the current thoughts? Jeffrey Berkes : Sure. Yes. Nick, let me answer the -- this is Jeff. Let me answer the first part of that question, and then I'm going to turn it over to Wendy so she can walk you through some of the things that we've got going on at Mercer. But the acquisition of the fee, which happened in October, was something that we baked into the deal 20 years ago. So exercising that option today does not have any bearing on what we would do with the property longer term. The plans that we have in place for Mercer right now are -- would have progressed with or without that. But we've got a lot of great things going on at the property, and it's been a great asset for us. So Wendy, do you want to fill in some of the details? Wendy Seher : Sure. We've been working on rebranding the property. So it will be rebranded as Mercer on One. That's kind of a catchy feel to it. We are -- you'll be seeing signage going up on the side to execute on that remerchandising and rebranding of the property. We have DSW, who's going to be leaner and meaner as they downsize and two new tenants coming in right next to them plus we have backfilled the -- as you saw with Crate & Barrel, the portion of the Bed Bath & Beyond that we got, I think, it was the end of last year. So a lot of exciting things going on at Mercer and a lot of investment on our part where we were able to drive those rents with a good demand in the market and get a return on that invested capital. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. And just to remind folks that, that was a $55 million investment at 8.7% yield. So kudos to the folks who've embedded that option 20 years ago to allow us to have this really great opportunity to invest capital at a property we own. I think an implied -- current cap rate on it significantly inside of the yield to acquire a portion of the fee underneath. Donald Wood : Yes, Nick, and I am going to chime in. I know it's a long answer to a simple question about an asset, but Mercer shows so much about kind of what we -- what's right down the middle of the play for us. There's a big piece of land that we were able to get control of. Jeff got -- did an amazing job, frankly, 20 years ago. And there's -- you think about -- when you talk about us for the long term, we didn't take a chance on whether we're going to own the fee or not own the fee. We had it contractually done. So the timing is now. But if you look at what happened to that income stream on such a big piece of land, there was so much that was done in that property that was not originally underwritten. It reminds me a thing like Pembroke today. It reminds me of things like Rosemont today, the things that we've been able to do that you can't quite underwrite, but because they are dominant community-based centers that got drop on the large areas, we want to keep it going. And with what's failing around it and some of the challenges of the inside mall space around it, it's looking stronger than ever. Operator : The next question comes from Hongliang Zhang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Hongliang Zhang : I guess as I look at your redevelopment pipeline, most of your redevelopment expansion projects are expected to stabilize by next year. When should we expect you to start activating future projects in your pipeline? Donald Wood : Yes. It's a great question and one that we spend a lot of time around here doing. Obviously, the higher cost of money means a higher level of return threshold. And so really what it's about for us and this, I think, is different than most people is we do have the ability to do, given the residential entitlements that we have, given the amount of redevelopment on retail properties with an additional residential component, that's something where you've got rates that change every year. You got year leases. And so the notion of being able to get something started for a few years from now and having it move in is much more likely in that category than it is obviously when you're talking about some other piece of real estate. So you'll see more of those redevelopments, retail redevelopments that we do on our existing properties. That will continue and will start -- will pick up again next year. But you'll also see some of the larger stuff, I think, later on next year with respect to particularly residential opportunities within the portfolio, places that we've already created that retail environment to be additive to. Operator : At this time, I am showing no further questions. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : We look forward to seeing many of you in the next few weeks. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Thanks, Leah. And good afternoon, everybody. Well, 2023 is in the books. With a strong $1.64 recorded in the fourth quarter, finish off what is an all-time record earnings year at $6.55 of FFO per share. That's happening, despite over $600 million of construction in progress not yet contributing and higher interest expense that cost the Trust an additional $0.27 per share when compared with the average rate in 2022. Yet, with comparable money cost between 2022 and 2023, FFO growth per share would have been 8%, right up there with our best pre-COVID years. It says a lot in terms of the power of the portfolio that has grown bottom line FFO per share at a compound annual growth rate of 4.5% over the last 20 years in addition to an average uninterrupted dividend yield of roughly 3% or better. That includes the great financial crisis, that includes the global pandemic, it includes everything, a better portfolio to own for long term investors in our opinion. It also feels like we're getting closer to a time where accelerated acquisition activity coupled with our redevelopment and remerchandising expertise on new acquisitions could boost that growth rate over the next few years. As far as today\u2019s environment demand continues to exceed supply for the highest quality assets in the closed-in suburbs and with the impacts of the pandemic in the rearview mirror and lack of new supply coming on, I don't see this positive supply demand dynamic changing anytime soon. Our average in-place rents portfolio wide are $31.60 per foot and the comparable retail deals we did in the fourth quarter were at $44.57 a foot and we're at $36.75 for the entire year. I've been hearing that our rents are high and can't be pushed further for the better part of the last 20 years. And I guess on a relative basis they are. Better properties have higher rents. Better properties have higher tenant sales and profitability too. Frankly, it's obvious. Percentage rents are an interesting barometer on this topic. While we push for a strong fixed rent in nearly every lease, tenant sales above a threshold level equates to additional rent. Percentage rent and overage rent totaled $6 million in the fourth quarter and $19.3 million for the year, an all-time record, which broke the $18.8 million record from the year earlier. Fourth quarter retail leasing continued to crank with another 100 comparable retail deals done at 12% rollover on a cash basis, 23% on a straight line basis. These comparable retail deals account for virtually all 98% of the total retail deals done in the quarter, making them representative of the entire portfolio, not just a fraction. It was a great leasing year, the third in a row where we exceeded 2 million square feet, roughly 25% more than the five year average during 2015 and 2019. Just to pound the point home, those cash basis rollover increases come on comp of leases that have had what I believe to be the highest contractual rent bumps throughout their term in the sector, making that rollover all the more impressive. Contractual rent bumps for the deals done in the fourth quarter were roughly 2.5% blended anchor and small shop, with new and renewal small shop at approximately 3%. The weighted average contractual rent bumps for the entire retail portfolio, anchor and small shop not just one quarter\u2019s worth, but the whole thing approximates 2.25%. Best in the business as far as we can tell. The sustained leasing volume and related economics bode well for the future, especially the contractual rent loss. We ended the year with overall portfolio leased at 94.2%, pretty strong but with room to grow. That breaks down between anchors at 96% leased and shop space at 90.7%. When you look at our occupancy possibilities going forward by looking at our past, it's reasonable to expect another 100 basis points of small shelf occupancy and another 200 basis points of anchor occupancy improvement in the coming 12 to 18 months, depending, of course, on the extent of future bankruptcies that we are not seeing today, they're not at all obvious. The residential and office product at our mixed use properties continues to outperform competing supply in non-mixed use environments and stood at 96% leased for both our comparable resi and comparable mixed use office product at year end, while commanding premium rents. Progress leasing up our mixed use office under development 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose and Santana West has been measurably stronger with 215,000 square feet newly leased or in the final stages of the LOI to sign the lease process. That includes the first signed deal at Santana West with Acrisure, the global FinTech leader to the insurance sector. With those deals complete, 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose will be 80% leased And Santana West will be nearly half leased up. I go through all this to really try to hammer home the obvious health of the business centered around leasing high quality retail centric properties in the closed-in suburbs of America's greatest cities. While bottom line results are and will continue to be muted by the higher, but certainly historically reasonable cost of capital that is stabilizing, rents will likely continue to adjust upward over time to that reality. This is especially true for tenants in locations and affluent areas where customers can absorb higher costs. I hope that higher interest rates don't cloud investors appreciation of the strong underlying business fundamentals that exist today and likely tomorrow. With that backdrop, we're also really excited to add a substantial expansion to the 87 unit first phase of residential product that we built at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia a few years back. The first phase opened strong and remains fully leased with growing rents. Strong supply and demand dynamics in this closed-in part of Philadelphia's mainline along with construction costs moderating means that we're able to build an additional 217 residential units, 16,000 feet of additional retail and the covered parking spaces to service it all. On the former Lord & Taylor site at Bala Cynwyd. The shopping center features an expansive tenant roster including an LA fitness gym, a full service grocer, restaurants and necessary services, which are often cited as the reason residents are choosing it. Projects should get underway later this year beginning with demo of the old Lord & Taylor building which should yield a 7% cash on cost return when stabilized, throw out a double digit unlevered IRR based on the rent growth we've seen and expect and be funded from free cash flow. Okay. On to 2024 where we certainly expect another record earnings year with an energized team and a strong sense of optimism. Dan will go into a bunch more detail and I'll turn it over to him and then open it up to your questions. Dan? Dan Guglielmone : Thank you, Don. Hello everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.64 for the fourth quarter and $6.55 for the year were up 3.8% and 3.6% respectively versus 2022. POI was up 6.5% in fourth quarter, a more impressive 7.2% for the year. Primary drivers for the strong performance in 2023 : first, POI growth in our comparable portfolio up almost 5% on a cash basis excluding prior period rents and term fees, driven by both higher rents and higher average occupancy over the course of the year, driven by continued strength, consumer traffic and tenant sales, particularly in our mixed use assets driving parking revenues and overage percentage rent higher. Effectively, controlling property level expenses and having a lower credit reserve than we originally forecast. Second, contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline, which came in at the upper end of our forecast. And lastly, continued focus on overall expense controls, the G&A came in below expectations. This was offset primarily by higher interest rate headwinds totaling $0.27. To reiterate Don's point earlier, with a consistent cost of debt versus 2022, FFO per share growth year-over-year would have been 8% in 2023. Reflecting an exceptionally strong year of growth at the property level. GAAP based comparable POI growth came in at 4% for the fourth quarter and 3.2% for the year. At a comparable cash basis, excluding the impact of prior period rent and term fees, growth was 5.2% for the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the year. As a reminder, this information including components of prior period rent, term fees and GAAP to cash adjustments can be found on page 12 of our quarterly 8-K supplement. Our residential portfolio continues to be a source of strength despite headwinds in the broader residential sector. Same store residential POI growth was 5.8% in 4Q along with revenue growth for the quarter at 6%. We expect this strength to continue into 2024. The value proposition providing a premium residential offering on top of an attractive retail amenity base is driving outperformance across our targeted residential portfolio. Also a big driver of our growth in 2023 was continued stabilization of a large portion of our redevelopment and expansion pipeline as $18 million of incremental POI came online from our $750 million in process pipeline. And we expect that to be the case moving forward as well as we add new projects to the lineup and maintain that part of our business as a continued driver of growth. The scale and skill set of our redevelopment program is a key differentiator for Federal. Notable updates to our in process pipeline, which will contribute an additional $9 million to $12 million of POI in 2024 include $115 million Darien Commons Projects in Connecticut where the residential is fully stabilized 98.4%, occupancy with rents above $4 per foot per month, well above underwriting. Tenant retention rates remain above 90% and the retail component approaches 90% leased. A testament to what a strong retail amenity base can bring to a residential project. At the $190 million 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, Choice Hotels fully moved in as they opened in 4Q, plus they've taken additional space. Sodexo's U.S. headquarters is next on deck to open with multiple other tenants actively negotiating leases. At Huntington Shopping Center on Long Island, this $85 million Whole Foods anchored redevelopment is over 90% leased with new anchor REI opening during the Q4 in addition to a number of small shops. We feel very good about the yield on this project, approaching the top end of our 7% to 8% return range. For those of you in the New York area, it's worth a trip out to Central Long Island later this year after Whole Foods opens to check it out. As well as the Melville asset a mile further south, both are exceptional retail redevelopments which truly highlight Federal skill set. Additionally in 2023, we incrementally invested over $120 million in properties we only partially owned previously at an effective 8.1% cap rate. No better risk adjusted investment than deploying capital accretively into assets we know extremely well. Unlevered IRRs on these investments are in the double digits. Now to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. As you all saw, we refinanced our $600 million bond maturities, which came due on January 15 for a combination of a $200 million secured loan on our Bethesda Row property at an effective 5% fixed rate for the first two years of the loan plus two one year extensions that are effectively a four year loan and a $485 million, 3.25% exchangeable notes offering due 2029 raised in early January at an effective 3.9% interest rate all in. Part of that transaction, we purchased a call spread to increase the effective strike price on the convert of 40%, up above $143 per share. So no incremental economic solution unless the common stock trades above that level as adjusted. Pro forma of the most recent financings and dividends paid, our liquidity stands above $1.3 billion with an undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility and available cash on hand. Plus we have no maturities remaining in 2024 and no material maturities until 2026. Our leverage metrics continue to be strong as fourth quarter annualized net debt to EBITDA stands at 5.9 times and that metric should improve over the course of 2024 and hit our target of 5.5 times in 2025. Fixed charge coverage was 3.6 times at year end and that metric should continue to improve as incremental EBITDA comes online and interest rates fall over the second half of 2024. Now, on to guidance. For 2024, we are introducing an FFO per share forecast of $6.65 to $6.87 per share. This represents over 3% growth at the midpoint of $6.76 and roughly 5% at the high end of the range. This is driven by comparable growth of 2.5% to 4% when excluding prior period rents and term fees, 3.25% at the midpoint. This assumes occupancy levels will increase from 92.2% at 12/31, up to roughly 93% by year end 2024. Although expect to step back in the Q1 due to expected seasonality post holidays. And then add in additional contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline of $9 million to $12 million. For those modeling, let me direct you to our 8-K on Page 16, where we provide our forecast of stabilized POI and timing by project. Now this will be offset by modestly lower prior period collections expected to be roughly $3 million in 2024 versus $5 million in 2023, modestly lower net term fees forecasted $4 million to $7 million range in 2024 versus $7 million in 2023 and continued drag from higher money costs. The recent $600 million of notes that we repaid last month at an effective rate of 3.7% versus the new blended cost on our two most recent refinancing of 4.3%. Other assumptions include $100 million to $150 million of spend this year on redevelopment expansions on our existing properties, G&A is forecast in the $48 million to $52 million range for the year and capitalized interest for 2024 is estimated at $18 million to $21 million. We've assumed the total credit reserve consisting bad debt expense, unexpected vacancy, incentive rent relief of 70 basis points to 90 basis points for 2024. More in line with pre pandemic historical averages. And as is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2024. We will adjust likely upwards as we go, given our opportunistic approach to both. Quarterly FFO cadence for 2024 is forecast that the Q1 being roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2023 at a range of $1.60 to $1.65 with sequential growth each quarter thereafter. Please see the detailed summary of this guidance in our 8-K on Page 28 and in our press release. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : I was just hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about the office leasing, it sounded like there was the FinTech lease at Santana. Was there anything else? And curious as to the momentum or prospects for signing other tenants there and how you think that evolves in 2024? Donald Wood : Yes. No, Juan, I try to without mentioning a name or getting myself in trouble, I try to indicate that there is a large tenant there that we are very close to lease signing on, the LOI is done. We're in the last stages of lease signing. I'm not going to name the tenant today, but you certainly will know them. And we would expect that lease, unless something dramatic goes wrong, done very shortly from here on. That -- along with that for sure and a couple of other smaller things is what gets us to that half done on that building in Santana West. And similarly, very close to signing on a couple of deals here at Pike & Rose or at 915 Meeting, which would get that building to 80% leased. So been a very different last few months in terms of, not just tours, but productivity in terms of turning LOIs into leases. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, thank you for taking the question. Don, just going through your tenancy, overall, it's pretty good list in the top tenants, but obviously there's some not rated, some not investment grade. But holistically, as you push the portfolio occupancy and really upgrade tenancy, are there types of tenants that you're saying no to like, for example, the classic private equity, highly levered tenants, even if they are great performer, you're saying, look, historically these type of levered tenants are the ones that cause issues in the next downturn and therefore, even though they may be promising, let's try to limit exposure. Just trying to think what ways that as the portfolio becomes increasingly in demand that you may be gaining leverage to sort of push back on the types of tenants, even if they're a great performer, but just going, you know what, great performer, but not great balance sheet we're going to pass? Donald Wood : Yes, Alex it's really a good question. I mean the bottom line is, when you're trying to improve your portfolio, what you're effectively doing is, taking all of that into consideration for not just next year or the year after that, but the term of the lease. So it includes the capital decisions that have to be made in terms of what\u2019s going in. I will tell you that to the extent a tenant and this just I think makes sense to you, a tenant that we like a lot, but that has a riskier profile to the extent we're limiting significantly the capital we'll get to and we'll give them a shot. To the extent we're investing in that piece of real estate, that particular space in there, then there better be credit, there better be comfort, if you will that we're going to get paid, we're very likely to get paid through the entire term of the lease. So as I started out, I mean, this is a very good time for supply and demand dynamics. And what that means in the better properties is choice. And to the extent you have that choice, you absolutely consider things like leverage level, like what the owners are planning to do with the asset or with their retailer, etcetera. So it's a good time to be able to continue to upgrade the portfolio. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good afternoon. Don, I guess just maybe following up on Alex's line of questioning. Just want to talk a little bit about pricing power and given where the portfolio is and the potential uptick in occupancy, I guess how are you and Wendy and the team thinking about being able to push rents? And do you expect that to materially change in 2024 or is that a little bit longer term kind of runway just given that there's been no supply in the space and demand seems to be very tight at good centers? Donald Wood : It does. It does Steve. And look, at the end of the day, it's still a very local business and you're having this conversation based on what the potential choices are for that particular piece of real estate, where I love it, where I think the -- and I just believe this is the most important thing, it is in the contract itself. And so the leverage generally, whether it comes out in better bumps, I mean, you know how I feel about the bumps. That's a contractual increase in cash flow for a long period of time, nothing beats that to me. That's the first thing. And the second thing is, making sure that we have control of the space because the tenant wants control of the rest of that shopping center, not just the space, but the shopping center. And so I do think we're making and I've always kind of focused on this as a big thing for us to make sure that contract is as landlord friendly as it could be, but those are places where we have made pretty strong strides in the last 18 months in particular for strong leases with big bumps. So that's where I'd look for it most. And that's an insurance policy to know that the foundation of this company, the basic shopping centers throughout this company are really strong with rents that whether you believe it or not are under market as proven by each quarter that we go through. Now you take that and you supplement that with things like the redevelopments that we're doing at places like Huntington with a new residential project that we're doing at Bala Cynwyd with potential stronger acquisition market as we move forward, that's where I get very excited and very positive about the future growth of the company. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thank you. Don, can you elaborate on your opening remark comment on accretive acquisitions and opportunities? It seems like you're a bit more optimistic or maybe excited at some of the opportunities you're seeing. Is that correct? And if yes, is it certain regions, again, type of centers? I know we talk about this all the time, but I think it seemed like you specifically highlighted that in the opening remarks. Donald Wood : Hey, Jeff. First of all, thanks for listening to the opening remarks. I appreciate that a ton. And yes, you are dead right in terms of where I see it. But let me turn it over to Jeff Berkes or Jan. Give us \u2013 guys, give us your thoughts on that question. Jeff Berkes : Yes, sure Don. Hey Jeff, it's Jeff Berkes. I'm here with Jan, he'll jump in a minute on what he's seeing kind of day to day in the market. But, yes, you're right. We are looking forward to a good year in 2024 for acquisitions. We didn't really see anything in 2023 that excited us that much other than the opportunities we had to invest within our own portfolio at very accretive rates, but we think the market is starting to heal and we expect 2024 to be a better year, certainly a good year for us for acquisitions and I know you know as well and you probably know what I'm going to say, but keep in mind that -- look we've got a very compelling cost to capital. We are not constrained by any one sub product type within retail, we will -- we're format agnostic. We are more focused on location and opportunity with the piece of dirt than exactly the improvements that sit on it today. We have a really well developed team here that looks at highest and best use and ways to add value through re-leasing, remerchandising and improving the existing improvements, as well as knocking parts of the property down and going vertical and doing things like we're doing at Bala and other shopping centers in our portfolio where we add residential. We've got great relationships in the market. We're known as a closer, both with the sellers and the brokers, so I think we've got a lot of advantages and a really sort of clear eye towards growing the company through accretive acquisitions that are going to deliver long term growth to the company and we hope the markets respond and I think they will, but let me turn it over to Jan and kind of let him give you his thoughts on what we're seeing in the market today. Jan Sweetnam : Hi, Jeff, Jan. So a lot of sellers have really been sitting on the sideline waiting for the comp to capital and cost to debt in their situation to kind of settle itself out. And I think 2023 was a record year for sellers asking brokers for their broker opinion of values. And it's just a massive BOV year. And super majority of those sellers chose not to put their properties on the marketplace. And so now that cost of capital and cost of debt has started to settle in a lot. We're hearing a lot of rumbling about sellers now putting their properties on the market. And in areas and sometimes in some new markets that are of interest to us that we think we're going to see. And so far as we're looking through here in early February, it seems like there's going to be a lot more interesting product for us to look at and try to acquire. So to me, I think 2024 is going to be a big year for us. Donald Wood : Yes, Jeff, you've heard us talk about this in the past. We are very creative in how we structure deals. We have been for a very long time good at figuring out ways to solve sellers issues, particularly private sellers and older sellers that have owned the properties for a long time. So A lot of tools in the toolbox here at Federal and we expect to be putting them to good use this year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinnis : Hey, good evening. So it was a great year overall for retail leasing, but Q4 leasing volumes fell about 20% compared to the first three quarters in 2023 and resi occupancy saw 190 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Could you just provide some details on the trends you're seeing in retail tenant demand as well as what happened on the resi side and expectations built into 2024 guidance for resi occupancy and rent growth? Donald Wood : I have to ask you to go, Dan or somebody on resi occupancy for a second. Before you do though on the retail occupancy in the Q4, Greg, that's just timing. There's nothing in there from a trends perspective that we feel any different about. I know we had a couple of particular Anchors that are released that went out in the fourth quarter and again released good spreads going forward, but just timing in the quarter there. I don't know, Wendy, if there's more to say about that for Greg. Wendy Seher : No. I think if you look at -- it's just timing is number one and number 2 is our pipeline still remains strong. And when I look at where we are specifically in small shop leasing, I do feel like there we have a runway there, probably another 100 basis points to grow off of. And also some of the timing is also attributed to several of the deals that we're doing are on spaces that are already occupied. So there's some overlap there. Donald Wood : Yes, let me -- Dan go ahead on resi if you want, but my comment, Greg, would be. We have a couple of markets that are very seasonal, primarily out here in California and New England. So we do try and ramp up occupancy, going into the slower winter season. So we can ride through first quarter of a little bit slower leasing in those seasonal markets and be in a position where we're not giving up a lot when the leasing season heats up again, so some of that strategic in the way we build occupancy up in the prior quarter. But Dan, if you got more to add, please do so. Dan Guglielmone : Yes. That's exactly right. On the residential portfolio seasonality is really what's driving that move. We're up year-over-year from an occupancy perspective and we fully expect occupancy to pull back in the fourth quarter relative to due to that exact reason. And we have a small portfolio. I think that it only takes a handful of units to kind of move things a little bit. So I would not read anything into that at all. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please go ahead. Craig Mailman : Thank you. Just want to go back to the question about acquisitions and it sounded like maybe there could be some OP unit deals in there, but could you just give us a sense of magnitude at this point of view at the level where we need to cap some of the equity and some of your trophy mixed use projects or can you guys fund this with kind of current liquidity? Donald Wood : That's a good question, Craig. The funding with the -- funding with the trophy assets at some point, it's something for the future. It's not something for today, given where the market stand and the appetite and got still the uncertainty on that stuff overseas in particular. With respect to boosting the acquisition portfolio now. That's what that aligns for. So there is -- there is short-term financing and then it will be long-term financing. But there is -- there is a reason that powder is dry and we'd like to use it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please go ahead. Ki Bin Kim : Thank you. Don, can you just go back to some of the comments you made about the office leasing demand you're seeing at Santana West and 915 Meeting. Just curious as there's been any kind of commonalities for why somebody says, I'm guessing it's relocations, moving to these centers and for 915 Meeting the NOI contribution, is it reasonable to expect that 50% contribution to be back end weighted or more per rentable. Dan Guglielmone : Go ahead, Don. Donald Wood : Yeah. On the pro-rata, I would say, effectively in terms of the contribution of the course of the year. Dan Guglielmone : And I'm going to take a mandate, the common thread through all of this is either -- it's funny, either relocations from Downtown to these mixed use properties in both of them basically in that first ring suburbs or out further and coming in looking for the full amenities that is true, these properties provide. And that's been so darn consistent over the past 3, 3.5, 4 years with respect to what's happening there. I don't see that stopping. It's -- the demands of these tenants who are generally taking less space than they had, wherever they were West Coast, some kind of campus. The East Coast, the East Coast, same type of thing potentially. But they were -- they are taking less space but they demand more in terms of the amenity base and that is so consistent in basically the three places, the three big projects, whether it's - same in Boston, with respect to assembly. So, that's the common thread. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Yeah, Hi. I just have two quick development questions. I guess, first for Bala Cynwyd. Is there any meaningful NOI that's coming out of the run rate, your 4Q NOI run rate. And then do you have a ballpark estimate of timing for the Santana office rent commencements? Donald Wood : Can you\u2026 Dan Guglielmone : Yeah, on Bala, I don't think there's any material -- Donald Wood : It's an empty Lord & Taylor which is\u2026 Dan Guglielmone : So no impact. Donald Wood : And then the timing, we'll let you know on the timing. We'll start on Acrisure recognized some revenue this year, 2024. And we'll let you know when we sign the leases of the timing of the leases that we have in the pipeline, kind of when those will look to come online. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead. Floris van Dijkum : Hey. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Following up a little bit on the office activity, obviously congrats on -- obviously you haven't gotten over the line yet, but certainly got the first leases going there, both Santana West as well as in Pike & Rose. Are those leases in your guidance. And maybe you can talk about what is happening to the negotiations in terms of the rents there. And Jeff, maybe I'd looked at your -- because you're on the grounds at Santana West. Are you getting pushback from office tenants on rents or other things or is it just -- talk a little bit about the competitive situation of and the balance between landlord and tenant because clearly different in office than it is in retail. Dan Guglielmone : Go ahead, Jeff. Jeff Berkes : Yeah. I'm actually going to pass it Jan. Floris, Jan handles all of our large office leasing. So, let me turn it over to him. Jan Sweetnam : Hey, Floris. I think -- just in terms of the rent side I would say two things, one of which is, both at Pike & Rose and at Santana West here and also at assembly, really the tenants are looking for something as don said, they're looking for the amenity, they're looking for a better building, they are looking to upgrade their location. And so, they have tended to be less price sensitive on rent. So rents feel like they're holding pretty well, but the tenant improvement packages have in fact gone up. So that's really the change that we've seen, and that's where the competitive piece comes in, but the rents have been really rock solid Dan Guglielmone : And just, Floris, to remind you and I think we've talked about this before, and Don alluded to it in his earlier comments. Most of the tenants that are moving into that -- are state of our buildings in those three locations are coming from inferior buildings where they take more space and they're downsizing. So while they may be paying a higher rent per foot in our buildings than they were paying because they're taking less square footage their overall occupancy costs are less which again goes to them not being as sensitive about rent. I think that's important to understand. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good evening . Can you walk through your thought process behind the mortgage on Bethesda Row on just addressing the size, maybe loan to value, why Bethesda, specifically. Donald Wood : Look, I think the debt markets have been extremely volatile. And interest rates have lacked direction, to say the least, I think back in October when we committed to doing that transaction, the 10 year was at 5%, the -- our stock was at $85 and we saw this as a unique opportunity for us to lock in a spread on a secured loan on one of our best properties and gets attractive financing. The leverage is lower than we typically would, it's a little bit structured. But today, mortgage rates on retail product today at normalized leverage levels are probably 200 basis points over the Treasury, probably 175 basis points to 200 basis points on a floating rate basis above SOFR, we were able to get 95 basis points through the structuring that we did with our lender. We felt like that was a really, really attractive credit spreads, it was certainly more attractive than the 150 basis points to 160 basis points we're looking at back in October. And to do a five year loan and so it was just a -- I think a unique opportunistic financing that really demonstrates Federal\u2019s historic ability to access different parts of the capital markets at more difficult times in the cycle. And I think that in -- our access of the convertible market, it's another example of that. Don, did you want to add anything? Donald Wood : No, I wanted to ask you, Dan, I mean from a tax perspective, tax basis perspective, putting $200 million on Bethesda Row frees up some flexibility with respect to the -- Dan Guglielmone : For tax planning. And so, I think having the leverage on there and having debt on Bethesda, where we've created significant value over our ownership created a ton of value above where if we do want to bring in a joint venture partner, this brings and gives us that optionality and that flexibility from a tax efficient. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi. Thank you. I think you said earnings growth in 2023 with an 8% apps entire money costs will level of earnings growth does this mean for 2024, if you look at it the same way. Dan Guglielmone : Well, 8% -- we had significant headwinds 2027 -- we have less headwinds heading into 2024, although they're still there. I haven't done the calculation, but it's probably a couple of 100 basis points of incremental, if you back out the cost of that. So the 3% probably goes up to something north of 5%, less money costs at least from my perspective. I haven't done the exact calculation, but that's roughly where I would say. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Anthony Powell : Hi. Thank you. I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about how construction costs were going lower, which helps with your decision to do the Philadelphia residential, can you maybe expand more on what's going on with construction cost, and do more of your projects in your future redevelopment pipeline look attractive given lower construction cost. Dan Guglielmone : Yes, it's a good question. When -- it's not dramatic in terms of a reduction in construction costs. I mean, when you think about the components of it, particularly the labor component of it. When business slows down as it obviously has passed a couple of years, you've got better leverage to get labor rates that makes them more sense. And when you compare that to really last five or six years in particular before that, it's a dramatic difference in terms of being able to forecast. And that's really the most important thing here is, anytime you want to do a redevelopment or development itself, it's about predictability of costs in addition to growth on the rents. So what's happening now is we're finding much better predictability in construction costs primarily on the labor side, we're going to tie these things down to GMP's a maximum price contracts. And so when you're able to do that, then you can then focus more on what the rent growth is the timing, does it make sense to do. In the case of Bala, it was really a case where supply and demand finally made some sense without new product being added in that particular section of the main line, which is very attractive. So we really liked that, now we could make sense of that, a year ago or two years ago or three years ago, but we can make sense of it now. I would hope to see more of those possibilities going forward. And remember, this is land that Federal owns for a very long-time, and that gives you a huge advantage because the land costs are aren't incremental landlords, associated with it. So that's why that makes sense. So when you look at construction, I wouldn't look at it as you know, costs are going to be dramatically lower than they were, but they've certainly stabilized and coming down a few percentage points because of the labor side. It's an important consideration when you're deciding where to go or not. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Paulina Rojas Schmidt with Green Street. Please go ahead. Paulina Rojas Schmidt : Hello, everyone. And my question is related to the prior one. And you reported for the Bala project an ROIC of 7, and I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the unlevered IRR as well. But more broadly speaking, what kind of profit margin we need to see when thinking about this project to [indiscernible] risks, whether it's cost or leasing. Dan Guglielmone : Not quite following your question, Paulina, you asking kind of what kind of huge premium we need to get to kind of have those -- to have the IRRs get up into the double digit? Paulina Rojas Schmidt : Yes, when we think about comparing your tax rate or -- Dan Guglielmone : I think that developing this towards -- developing this to a 7 is clearly higher than it would be in today's market. And as interest rates come down and stabilize, obviously, what we -- what the spread is, as well north of 100 basis points, 150 basis points and 200 basis points. And look, we are going to expect to be able to grow rents residentially in line with kind of what we've done in our residential portfolio is amenitize adjacent to great retail and we've been able to grow rents very attractively overtime. So as we grow rents, obviously the POI, it's going to be a big driver of those unlevered returns as well. So those are the -- those are the inputs that go in there that get us very comfortable, get a double digit IRR unlevered something that's achievable, developing this to a 7 initially, and having a growth from there. Jeff Berkes : Hey, Dan, if I can just add on. Paulina, it's Jeff. One thing to think about too as it relates to federal and the residential that we develop and we've got about $900 million pipeline of projects in the design and entitlement phase right now is almost all of those -- are at places where we already operate residential property. That's the case at Bala, the case if we do anything of Bethesda Row, Santana Row, Pike and Rose, Assembly Row, other places in Montgomery County, Maryland where we own real estate. So the risk adjusted return for us is really, really strong. We understand the rental market very well, we operate units, we're adding units. So we understand the operating costs very well. And as Don mentioned in the prior question, when we contract for the construction, we're doing that with full construction drawings great bid coverage and a guaranteed maximum price contract. So the risk adjusted returns for us are exceptionally strong when we add residential to our portfolio. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today is a follow-up from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey. Good evening. Just going back to the Bethesda Row. I think you guys had spoken previously about possibly joint venturing that asset or maybe there was institutional interest, but I guess bigger picture, historically Federal hasn't been a JV platform. But you talked about it with the potential on Bethesda. So in your view, Don, as you guys talk to joint venture capital, what's their appetite for shopping centers and do they believe that truly this burgeoning growth that we all talk about will actually come to fruition, or is there a view that the leases are so locked in in favor of the tenant that yes, at some point, they can get good economics, but may be a longer timeline than they actually are willing to underwrite and invest, just sort of curious what's going on the private side as you talked to possible partners. Donald Wood : Well, a couple of things. Alex. And Jeff, I'd love you to add a to this if you need to. But first of all, I'm -- don't use me as a proxy for what's happening among the -- the private side. In terms of their appetite because we have not seriously gone down the road with -- with any of them in terms of serious negotiations because we don't believe this is the right time. It's effectively do a deal like that on the mixed use assets. When we looked at ourselves and where we see the growth in the portfolio, I think I've said this for the last four or five, five quarters, our mixed use stuff is outperforming the other stuff. And it's growing and it's growing fast. So we'd like to get this stuff to have that trajectory continue, I would like to see over the next year or two the capital markets, yeah, solidify themselves. Obviously, we're just in the very early stages of figuring out what the -- what that means in terms of capital markets with the country. And so, I don't have much more to add with respect to any specific group of private joint venture, investors because we really haven't had in-depth conversations with them at this point. I don't know. Jeff, anything? Jeff Berkes : Yeah, Don. I don't really have anything meaningful to add to that. Sorry. Donald Wood : All good. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yeah. Thanks. Just wanted to quick follow-up maybe with Dan G. on the guidance. When you kind of look through the building blocks, just maybe help us think through which ones have kind of the most leverage maybe to the upside and the downside. And maybe just a little bit more color on the POI growth ex prior period rents and term fees, it's about 100 basis points slower around three and a quarter versus the four, three, so maybe just kind of walk us through there. Is that really all kind of bad debt driven. Or is there something else kind of pulling that growth rate down? Thanks. Donald Wood : Yeah. It is guidance. And I think there are a lot of things that go into now in particular that go into the FFO guidance. I mean as it relates to specifically, the comparable y-o-y growth with 2.5% to 4% occupancy levels and how aggressively and how quickly we can up towards 93%. I think, how much percentage rent. And we continue to collect parking revenues and we control property level expenses the way we have which has been a big help. Term fees, I guess don't apply to that metric but that's going to drive FFO. Although it will necessarily drive the of POI metric excluding that, how quickly and how we can get development POI up. And I think one of the things that going to be a big driver as we look we purposely have $600 million of floating rate debt, quickly SOFR comes down. I think we're pretty conservative in terms of our assumptions for where interest rates will go. And so that's -- that will have an impact. And then, I think what we've done an exceptional job at which probably drive some of the POI growth is just getting tenants open sooner, keeping tenants inpossession. Longer -- keeping tenants in that would be expected to leave. I think that's a -- that's a another driver. I think they all contribute throughout the range. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I like to turn the conference back over Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Brady : Look forward to seeing many of you in the next few weeks. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference, y'all. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead, ma'am. Leah Andress Brady : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Federal's Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Berkes, President and Chief Operating Officer; Dan G., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Jan Sweetnam, Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer; and Wendy Seher, Executive Vice President, Eastern Region President. As well as other members of our executive team that are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.  A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes that expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations, and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained. The earnings release and supplemental reporting package that we issued tonight, our annual report filed on Form 10-K and other financial disclosure documents provide a more in-depth discussion of risk factors that may affect our financial condition and the results of operations.  Given the number of participants on the call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have additional questions, please requeue.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our first quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, it's a new year and Federal continues to charge forward. With a very solid $1.64 recorded in the quarter, along with 3.8% same-center growth when excluding term fees and [indiscernible] repayments and an all-time first quarter record 567,000 square feet of retail leads to 9% higher rents. The answer to the often asked question of do demographics matter post pandemic become quite evident, that sure do.  The level of leasing activity in the quarter is particularly notable. Our record retail leasing was impressive, but maybe more so was the 190,000 square feet of office space leased at our mixed-use properties. Supplementing the long-awaited 141,000 square foot lease to accounting consulting firm PwC at One Santana West, bringing that building to nearly half leased was an additional nearly 50,000 square feet leased elsewhere in the mixed-use portfolio, including two deals at 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, bringing that building to nearly 80% leased.  The remaining vacancy at 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose and 1 Santana West represents considerably less than 2% of the value of the company. Tenant interest in the remaining space at both buildings remain solid.  All in all, for the quarter, we signed 117 commercial leases, retail plus mixed-use office for over 775,000 square feet of space with strong economics, not including our residential portfolio, which itself generated record first quarter property operating income of over $17 million. Make no mistake, our product, primarily retail, but also including complementary office and residential is very desirable in the marketplace and a huge positive differentiator. Now obviously, higher interest rates take away some of that operating positivity when you get down to the FFO line, but we still grew at over 3% in the quarter and at $1.64 at the higher end of our guidance range. We did 104 comparable retail deals in the quarter that cumulatively were written at 9% higher cash basis rent than the final year of the previous tenant or 20% on a straight-line basis.  And just to pound the point home one more time, those cash-based rollover increases come on top of leases that have had what we believe to be the highest contractual rent bumps throughout their term in the sector making that roll over all the more impressive. Contractual rent bumps for the deals done in the first quarter were roughly 2.3% blended, anchor and small shop. The weighted average contractual rent bumps for the entire retail portfolio, not just 1 or 2 or 3 quarters worth, approximates 2.25% and higher when considering the office leases, best in the business as far as we can tell. The sustained leasing volume and related economics bode well for the future, especially the contractual rent bumps.  Now I spoke last quarter about the upside in our occupancy, especially with respect to shop space and felt that another 100 basis points over the 90.7% that we reported at last year -- at year-end was doable. In the first quarter of 2024, we picked up 70 of those 100 basis points bringing our small shop lease percentage to 91.4%. There's more to come here. Our anchored lease percentage is 95.8%  is another 200 basis points to come there too. Those two components combined at 94.3% leased overall. Pretty strong, but as we're demonstrating, room to grow. We take a very proactive approach to leasing and often lease space well in advance of an existing lease expiration or vacancy. All in the name of improved tenant health and merchandising mix and as an insurance policy towards potential gaps and future cash flow. We've got some impactful anchor renewals coming up later this year and early next that should continue the positive trajectory. In terms of a tenant watchlist or other indications of a shift in demand, there is nothing out of the ordinary that we can point to. We have little exposure to those tenants that are most talked about these days, Express, Big Lots, JOANNs, Family Dollar and 99 Cents Only, as they tend to cater to a lower income demographic, our tenants have been largely been able to pass on cost of goods and labor increases to their customers. Those customers may grumble at the higher prices, but thus far, they've been both able, and more importantly, willing to pay them.  In addition, our retail tenant base is very well diversified by both in terms of tenant concentration as well as property type. And while we'll always have one-off tenant failures that's just part of the business, portfolio-wide collectability issues haven't been and are not expected to be outside our historical experience or specific 2024 guidance. Business looks good.  The last topic I want to address before turning it over to Dan, relates to external growth. While we've turned down the dial a bit on immediate development projects, the residential development of Bala Cynwyd with shopping center notwithstanding, we turned up the dial and level of intensity on sourcing acquisitions. It's an interesting and unique time in the acquisition marketplace right now. While there is a limited supply of Federal Realty type opportunities out there, there's also less viable competition for those centers than there has been historically. We look for shopping centers that are generally larger in size than the average center, with opportunities for remerchandising, redevelopment, higher rents, and yup, potential site intensification. We look for shopping centers in markets that have strengthened significantly over the past 15 years and especially post pandemic.  Markets like Phoenix, Central and South Florida and Northern Virginia, among others. We look for shopping centers that are immediately accretive to earnings based on the -- based on our cost of capital advantage, but even more importantly, produce returns meaningfully above our long-term cost of capital.  We look for shopping centers that will be immediately financed through the combination of other asset sales and our largely undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility and then refinance for the long term subsequent. We've begun our due diligence process on one such large asset currently and have a growing pipeline of others. Obviously, it remains to be seen if and how much success we'll have in this buy versus build cycle, but using both our operating strength and reputation as well as our balance sheet strength and flexibility is a specific focus of ours for the balance of this year and next.  That's all I wanted to cover in prepared remarks this afternoon. So I'll turn it over to Dan to provide more granularity before opening up to your questions. Daniel Guglielmone : Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.64 for the first quarter was up 3.1% versus a year ago and came in at the upper end of our quarterly guidance range of $1.60 to $1.65 which we provided on our earnings call back in February. Property operating income was up 5.6%, also above our expectations, highlighting the overall strength of our real estate. Primary drivers for the strong start to 2024, POI growth in our comparable portfolio, up almost 4% excluding prior period rents and term fees driven by resiliency in our occupancy levels, continued strength in our residential portfolio and stronger contributions from specialties and temp leases.  This was primarily offset by lighter term fees than forecast and some timing noise with respect to collection. We have an expectation of reversing that over the balance of the year. Comparable POI growth, excluding the impact of prior period rent and term fees was 3.8%. Comparable minimum rents grew 3.6%, and comparable total property revenues were up 4.1%. Portfolio occupancy levels show greater resiliency than we forecast as our lease rate increased up to 94.3%, and our occupancy rate staying at the 92% up, both metrics better than expected as retail leasing volumes hit record levels with our leasing and tenant coordination teams getting tenants open sooner and keeping tenants in place longer, testament to our ability to grind out revenue growth at the property level while curating best-in-class tenant liners.  Given the tremendous start to the year from a leasing perspective, coupled with a strong pipeline of lease deals in process, which are some of the highest levels we've seen post-COVID, we are extremely well positioned to drive our occupancy metrics over the coming quarters. It's too soon to increase our targeted year-end occupancy levels, but we are in a good spot at this point in the year. Another part of our business worthy of note is our residential portfolio. It continues to be a source of strength. Same-store residential POI growth was 6% in the first quarter on the heels of a similarly strong fourth quarter. This was driven by 5-plus percent revenue growth against 3% expense growth, leading to results well ahead of forecast.  While we are dialing down new development starts are still substantial in process development pipeline continues to make meaningful contributions as lease-up continues at these projects. Darien residential continues to exceed expectations and is 99% leased. Darien retail is over 90% leased with several store openings set over the coming quarters. Huntington Shopping Center is 94% leased with Whole Foods and other set to open by third quarter. As Don mentioned, 915 Pike & Rose Street and One Santana West continued solid progress at almost 80% and 50% leased, respectively. Note that global Foodservice giant Sodexo moved into its new North American headquarters of Pike & Rose during the quarter. Now on to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. All of our refinancing requirements for 2024 were handled at the very start of the quarter with our $485 million, 3.25% exchangeable notes offering. This leaves us with no material maturities until 2026. We stand with over $1.33 billion of available liquidity from our $1.25 billion credit facility and cash on hand, and have redevelopment and expansions spend remaining of only $100 million for the balance of 2021.  Additional funding sources this year approach almost $0.5 billion and include expanding leverage-neutral debt capacity as EBITDA comes online in the $150 million to $175 million range. Free cash flow of $50 million to $75 million as we approach pre-COIVD levels and a sizable asset sale pipeline under consideration. Our leverage metrics continue to be solid as first quarter annualized net debt-to-EBITDA stands just inside 6x. That metric is targeted to improve over the 2024 to 5.7x by year-end and to 5.5x in 2025. Fixed charge coverage was 3.5x at quarter end, and that metric should also improve as incremental EBITDA comes online over the balance of 2024. Now with respect to guidance, with a first -- solid first quarter behind us, leasing demand continuing at a stronger pace than expected, we are tightening and raising our 2024 FFO guidance from $6.76 per share at the midpoint to $6.77, with a range refined upwards to $6.67 to $6.87. This represents 3.4% bottom line FFO growth at the midpoint and almost 5% at the upper end of the range. Keep in mind, this is being done with the realization that interest rates will likely remain higher for longer and provide roughly $0.02 to $0.03 of greater headwinds in 2024 than we originally forecast 90 days ago. This upward revision in guidance is driven by stronger underlying portfolio performance than expected as leasing and occupancy metrics outperform expectations as well as a more optimistic outlook for such difficult to forecast items such as parking, specialty leasing and percentage rent.   Add to that, some of our first quarter headwinds are expected to be timing issues that should reverse themselves in the coming quarters. As a result, we are also revising our comparable growth outlook upward. Comparable growth is now forecast at 2.25% to 3.5%, up to 2% to 3.5% and our comparable growth, excluding prior period rents and term fees is now forecast at 2.75% to 4%, up from 2.5% to 4%. While we made significant progress at One Santana West, the 915 Meeting Street, in the first quarter, none of those leases are expected to impact our forecast in 2024. We will see the impact in 2025. More to come on that outlook as the year progresses and additional leases get signed. All other guidance assumptions as outlined on Page 27, our 8-K remain unchanged, although please note, we do not include prospective acquisitions and dispositions activity in our guidance. We will update our forecast for that activity as it gets completed.  Now before we go to Q&A, I'd like you to please listen up for, this is important, with the first quarter in the books at $1.64 per share, our quarterly FFO outlook for the second quarter is $1.63 to $1.69. Again, $1.63 to $1.69 for the second quarter. Consistent with the cadence presented on our call in February, the third and fourth quarter should increase sequentially from there reflecting the continued momentum we are seeing across our business.  With that, operator, you can open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Good afternoon. Thank you for the time. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the acquisitions and the funding. I think, Dan, you said that there was a fair amount of product that you're looking to maybe monetize. So hoping you could give a little more color on the dispositions and what kind of values you could get there, cap rates and the spend the spread in terms of what you're thinking on some of these assets that you're looking at in some of these [indiscernible] south markets? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Look, we have -- as I've mentioned kind of throughout the beginning of the year, we've got upwards of $300 million to $400 million of assets that we currently have under consideration for sale, kind of the initial cap rates or yields on those assets are kind of in the low 6s. And if we include maybe a couple more assets there, it probably dips below 6% on an initial yield basis. So attractive, and more importantly, in our view, the long-term IRRs are very attractive relative to where we feel we can deploy capital in the acquisition market. So a very attractive source of capital. We'll see whether or not all of that pool under consideration will get executed. But we've broadened the pool, and we'll use that effectively as a source of capital. Operator : Our next question comes from Dori Kesten of Wells Fargo. Dori Kesten : You had a strong quarter in small shop leasing. Can you give us a sense if this was more driven by national or local tenant demand and then what the blended rent escalators were on that. Daniel Guglielmone : You want to take that? Wendy Seher : I mean, we did have a very strong quarter on small shop leasing, and we were able to move the needle, I think, 70 basis points. So very pleased with that with what the team has been able to pull together. It's really broad-based when you look at kind of the deals that we're making for the quarter in the small shops in terms of national, regional and local, the categories that we're seeing, as you may guess, our restaurants in nature, we have full-service restaurants less of the fast food because it's typically not the demographic that we're attracting in some of our centers. But certainly, [indiscernible] and the specialty restaurants have been very active. Apparel has been active, both in value apparel and in full service and full price apparel and our -- where we also have a tremendous amount of activity is when you talk about health and wellness and you talk about beauty and anything in that wide category is very active today. So a lot of good categories that are really helping us boost the overall sales and production of our small shops. Donald Wood : Yes, Dori, the only thing I would add to that and really just to make the point that Wendy made, it's broad-based. As you know, we own all different kinds of open-air shopping centers and really across the board and certainly including the mixed-use stuff, we've had a very strong broad-based demand on shop space. Daniel Guglielmone : And just to add further, the rent bumps on the small shop right in the 3% range, on average. And more importantly, we've done exceptionally well on anchors, where it's across the board. And I think that's a differentiator. That's not appreciated. And so -- and add into that, which Don alluded to, we get 3% or better on the office, which brought our blended up into the mid-2s across the almost 800,000 square feet of leasing that we did in the quarter. Really, really pleased with that. Operator : The next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI. Samir Khanal : Dan, can you talk more about your guidance same-store, you're certainly tracking at the higher end, right, close to the top end. And everything you've kind of talked about and Don has talked about, it feels like you're probably tracking even above budget in many segments of the business, there is a lot of tailwinds. So help us understand what's kind of dragging that growth lower as we kind of think about the midpoint of your same-store or even the lower end. Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Look, I think we -- our credit reserve, we kept it kind of where it is this quarter. And so we're hopeful that that's something that we can do better on and so forth. Look, it's early in the year, and it's one quarter behind us. Typically, we don't move guidance up even when we beat in a quarter. And so look, we'll look to be -- see how the rest of the year unfolds. And hopefully, we can be up towards that upper end and we'll see how second and third quarter does. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Michael Goldsmith : We've heard from the industrial REITs that retailers are deferring large capital investments in large warehouses. So have you seen any of that pressure of the capital investment required for retail stores in your shopping centers. Have you seen any of that pressure leak into your space recently? Donald Wood : Yes, Michael, this is Don. From my perspective, there is capital pressure from retailers to build out stores, but that's something, frankly, I think we've been talking about for 10 years. I don't see a difference over the past couple of years with respect to that. In fact, frankly, I think we've been pretty successful in limiting capital necessary.  So as a result of the industrial space that you're talking about or frankly, other characteristics, the demand-supply characteristics in retail right now are such that, that we've been able to keep capital under control. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Unknown Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Greg McGinniss. Cisco [indiscernible] still have replaced Splunk as one of your top office tenants. I know Splunk had a couple of years of term left. Can you talk about what happened there? Donald Wood : Yes, you know that Cisco bought Splunk. They -- and I say just closed within a month or 2 ago. And what they're -- they've assumed the lease so immediately, our credit, which I thought was pretty good with Splunk is a whole lot better with Cisco for the remainder term of that lease. They have not given us any indication at all in terms of what's their long-term plans are, other than in their visits of Santana Row, it wouldn't surprise you to know that they love the place. And frankly, have made that comment while they were there touring at their new space. So what happens after 2027, I think, effect is when we're in, we'll remain to be seen. But I view that, that acquisition is a real positive for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Alexander Goldfarb : Thank you. Good afternoon. Don, a question for you as you look at acquisitions. I know you guys are pretty rigorous in the way you approach acquisitions. But curious, because of what's going on now in the retail environment, dwindling availability, all the good stuff that we talk about. As you look at assets at your team underwrites assets on a, let's say, next 3-year period, are they coming out at higher returns than what you would have seen sort of pre-pandemic or because of natural issues like existing lease roll and time for entitlements and all that stuff that when you're underwriting today, you're not really seeing the benefit of the tighter environment as you underwrite it stuff that comes more once you take hold a meet that occurs over time versus, hey, because of what's going on right now in the next 3 years, we're able to outperform 50 bps let's say, versus what would have been pre-pandemic. Jeffrey Berkes : Alex, it's Jeff. The acquisitions market is interesting right now. There's probably a lot of people that would like to sell or have to sell. But wish the Fed would provide some clarity on where rates are going and [indiscernible] office sidelines. That said, we really leaned into the acquisitions market over the last 6 months or so. And as Don indicated on his opening remarks, we've had some great success over the last few months.  And we're seeing, quite frankly, a fairly good range of deals where we think we can apply all the things that we're good at, most of which Tom mentioned. But just to reiterate, our leasing and merchandising skills or redevelopment skills. The fact that we don't look at real estate, shopping centers, super specifically, we're agnostic as to format and more concerned about the strength of location and all of that. And right now, with our cost of capital advantage, there's just not as much competition out there to buy and with our cost of capital advantage. We're seeing some really good opportunities. And yes, they do produce higher returns because not everybody has that advantage and there are buyers out there today. So we're pretty happy with what we're seeing, and we're pretty happy with what we're finding as we're underwriting in terms of our ability to get into a property and work the rent roll and really move the NOI going forward. So all good so far. Donald Wood : Alex, you asked a very interesting question in there about how we underwrite and what the actual results will be once that underwriting effectively happens, and it's been something that I can tell you, I personally look at very hard because over the past several years, we have very much exceeded the leasing underwriting that we've done in the acquisitions that we've made.  And I would expect, frankly, that to happen, that's to continue to happen. There's an inherent conservatism, if you will, in looking at a new property, even within your existing markets, et cetera, that is different once this company gets out there and does what it does. And I do think the combination of our context, frankly, our reputation and our understanding of what it is that we can do with an asset often results in actual results that are above the underwriting.  I would expect that to continue to happen. And I'm not sure it's anything about -- specifically about the marketplace today as it is more about the specific shopping center that we would be acquiring and our optimism with respect to what we do with it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman of Citi. Craig Mailman : Not to beat a dead horse here with acquisitions. But I guess another question I have is just as you guys are looking at what's out there today, is it all just operating assets that you guys could over the next 3 to 5 years, kind of remerchandise or densify and that's the play? Or are there opportunities out there like you guys have done in Assembly or Santana that are that decade to 2-decade play for the company long term to harvest value? Are any of those available? Or is this just going to be kind of some near-term stuff that you see some opportunities, but maybe the upside isn't as kind of long tail then and big as some of the other kind of bigger mixed-use projects you guys have done in your history. Donald Wood : Yes, Craig, that's a great question. And the answer is in the middle. No, you should not be thinking about our acquisitions turning into the next Assembly Row or Santana Row or Pike & Rose.  Frankly, having those assets are in each of our major markets that we do business in is really important to this company. And each of those assets has a whole bunch more to go and do. Having said that, what we've learned in terms of being able to -- I think we're -- what I call is residential experts, but we're pretty darn good on the residential side and even specifically on specified narrow band of office. I think we're pretty darn good.  So when we sit and look at the reason we want a bigger piece of property is yes, to do all those things you said which you're implying are easy and boring, my words, not yours, in terms of improving the merchandising, growing those rents, which is fundamentally critical. I also want a plus to those assets. And the plus to those assets could be incremental residential entitlements. It could be intensified retail plays on other parcels within it that -- the thing I love about this company is all arrows in the quiver.  We're not a one-trick pony. So the ability for that lands and that shopping center to be enhanced not only with merchant remerchandising and higher rents, which is critical to it, but with other ways is something we always look at, even if we can't underwrite it on day 1. Operator : Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of Truist Securities. Ki Bin Kim : So Don, as perhaps new development as far as not to start to take a little bit of a less prominent role in the near term versus acquisitions. I'm just curious, some of these projects, maybe you made some choices on leasing, shorter-term deals or maybe give up a couple of dollars in rent for control because eventually you want to do something bigger with it. I was just curious if -- how often is that the case. And if some projects take longer to start, are there some near-term opportunities that maybe you held up on that might -- that we can expect in the near term? Donald Wood : Ki Bin, let me make sure I've got what you're really asking. I can tell you that, first of all, and I wanted to make this point on the development side of our business, there will be a development cycle again. And so the notion of us not -- while yes, we're turning down the dial on construction starts. Effectively, we are as active and even more active in terms of entitling and in terms of design of future development projects on our existing properties.  Now if you're asking existing properties, that means we give up rent, and we do things so that we can entitlement so that we can construct in the future, the answer is very rarely, very rarely do we do that. Now occasionally, we will when we see at an opportunity at an existing shopping center negotiate within a lease, the ability to effectively get out of that lease in exchange for paying back the unamortized CI or something, something like that or the money that we that they would -- I would say, yes. But that happens very rarely.  So no, I don't think you should think of us from the development side is giving up money today, if you will, for the future. Wendy is looking at me. Wendy Seher : So I just wanted to kind of add a little bit of color to that. We've always been sort of very strict about how we want to be able to control the property from a merchandising standpoint, from a redevelopment standpoint. So we've always highlighted that with our negotiations in this marketplace now with really demand exceeding supply, we can lean in on that a little bit further in terms of getting some of those controls that we absolutely need.  And believe it or not, the discussions that we're having are easier to have with national and regional tenants because they know us. They know how we execute, they know how we invest and how we ultimately improve the property. So all of that is happening kind of concurrently at the same time. Donald Wood : And Ki Bin, if I'm not answering your question, we're not answering your question, please give us a follow afterwards. I'd love to be happy to go through it more. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : So Dan, given the traction on office and development leasing that you're having, and how the focus seems to be more in acquisitions as opposed to development starts. Can you give us some sort of high-level color on how you see capitalized interest trending, say, through year-end '25. Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Look, I think we've given guidance on 2024, and I think that we're keeping that kind of constant. I think all the leasing that we're doing is not going to impact anything in 2024, some of the recent leasing. And I think I really -- we need to see how additional leasing gets done and really kind of how the timing of possession, timing of build-out and so forth before we can I think, give any color with regards to 2025. And so more to come on that later in the year. Donald Wood : And the only thing I would say to you, Mike, on that is the [indiscernible] 3 out of 4 from the Yankees. Congratulations for the first place on May 2. More to come, just like '25. Operator : Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Ravi Vaidya : This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel. I just wanted to ask about the TIs. I noticed that for the new leases, there were about $10 higher foot this quarter than last. Is there anything in particular with regarding any of the recent bankruptcy backfills or anything any other activity with leasing that may have driven that? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Look, it is a little bit of a volatile number with the number of new leases that get signed per quarter. Now generally, it's somewhat in line with kind of the last -- maybe not in the last 4 quarters, but certainly the last 6 or 8. I wouldn't read anything into that, except just the general mix. And I don't think that is a trend actually. Our view is that it's probably even coming down more so than heading the other direction. This quarter, notwithstanding. Operator : Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point. Floris Gerbrand van Dijkum : Don, I heard you talk so eloquently about some of the leasing dynamics and about your portfolio and how it's positioned in the market? And why you think you have a competitive advantage? Can you maybe -- obviously, vacancy rates are trending lower, rents are trending higher. Could you maybe talk a little bit about some of the ancillary benefits of the leases that you're signing today. I'm looking forward at your lease expiration for example, and I see that next year, approximately 80% of your shop leases has no option, but there's 20% that does. And if I look at your anchor leases about -- it looks like about 60% of your anchor leases have options. As leases get to the end of your life, are you now agreeing no options on your new transactions? And maybe talk about the bumps that you're getting, not just on your shops space but also on your anchors, obviously, besides the fact that rents are going higher. Donald Wood : Gosh, Floris, you've got so much there to unpack. I'm going to give you a few things that eloquently you said that, and then I'm going to ask Wendy to jump in here. So the reason I speak eloquently about our ability to lease is it really does come down to in a period of time where everything, Floris, everything, cost 25% to 30% more than it did in 2019. The notion of when a tenant is underwriting for themselves, their sales and their profitability, they've got to be confident that they can push those higher costs through to the customer base. They're obviously more likely and able to be able to do that in places with more affluence and with effectively the customer base that is willing to pay additionally. That -- all of those dynamics, in fact, what happens in the negotiation of a lease and certainly small shop, but anchor too. And so when you think about what that does for us, if we had our way, we would hardly -- we would never give an option because an option is one way. An option is for a tenant to say yes or no, not for the landlord. So if we had our way, we wouldn't give any. That's just not practical. So there has to be a balance here, and we do balance with by looking at the credit of the tenant, the desirability of that tenant in the space, how important they are to the merchandising mix of the entire shopping center. And when we look at all that, that's how we determine what it is on an individual basis, what we're trying to do with terms of the contract that we're getting with them. In nearly all the cases from a small shop perspective, we get very good bumps, 3%, 4%, maybe 2.5%, maybe something a little modified from that, but very good bumps. On the anchor side, as Dan alluded to on his call, are you going to be able to see in this industry broadly defined 3% bumps with anchors generally.  No. No. It's not market. It hasn't been market, but the difference is the ability to get 15% after 5 years versus 7.5% is huge when you look at the math, and go through it. We've been able to improve, and that's what Dan was referring to, the anchor leases at a rate that has been -- I've been very happy with relative to what's been able to be done before COVID. So, so I hope that answers most of it. I don't know if there's anything more to add to that, Wendy, but feel free if there's something there. Wendy Seher : I think I would echo what you just said. The only thing that I will say that I get excited about is when I hear someone say you've got X amount of small shops coming up near term because what we found from a historic standpoint is if we can just get to the real estate, we do better. So, so I think it's a very positive thing that we're getting to it soon. Operator : Our next question comes from Lizzy Doykan of Bank of America. Elizabeth Yang Doykan : I was just hoping to hear a bit more about the acquisition of the remaining joint venture interest in CocoWalk done in April. And are there more near-term JV buyout opportunities for you guys on the horizon? Or was this more of a one-off opportunity? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. Look, this was a joint venture that started back in 2015, 2016. It was to redevelop CocoWalk, it was hugely, hugely successful in terms of what we accomplished there in terms of trend forming that asset into what it is today and the returns that we achieve we had mechanisms in the joint venture to buy out our partner where they buy us out. And we bought them out, and we think, a very attractive yield for us. I think that there's probably a one-off. I don't see additional opportunities. We don't have a lot of joint ventures like that, but we'll be opportunistic when the opportunity arises. And we just felt like it was important for us to take 100% of the ownership of CocoWalk and to be able to operate it and run it and maximize the cash flows that we would achieve without having a partner in there getting fees. Operator : Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Deutsche Bank. Omotayo Okusanya : Good afternoon. In terms of the mixed-use development projects, I recall at a certain point there was some interest in having a life sciences component to some of the assets. Is there still a thought around that at this point? Donald Wood : So we'd love to add life sciences to Assembly Row or maybe even Pike & Rose. The math doesn't work today. It just doesn't work today. So the -- you certainly know what's in that industry. You certainly know what's happening in terms of supply in Somerville, Massachusetts, for example, and even here in Montgomery County. So there is some real and that we're sitting with here but whether it is life sciences eventually or whether it's more retail eventually or whether it's more residential or likely. Going forward that land and our ability to move entitlements and get what we need is very strong. So I wouldn't think about life sciences in the near future that way because I think they'll be higher and better use most likely. Operator : Our next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Linda Yu Tsai : You provided guidance for 2Q in the midpoint of 1.66 implies a smaller sequential increase in FFO than usual. Is there anything driving that? Daniel Guglielmone : Yes. And I think the previous question with regards to comparable alluded to, when we think about it, we have a tough comp in the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter of 2023, we had all of our Bed Bath in possession, rent paying, [ SOFR 1 ] plus, obviously, we had the headwinds. We had really a more optimal balance sheet. We refinanced our debt in the second quarter of last year, $275 million at 2.75%. So some of those headwinds are really what's driving, I think, the more moderate growth year-over-year in the second quarter. And we're really seeing the acceleration in FFO per share and probably in comparable as well. And -- and I know I'm talking to Linda, I'm addressing [ Samir ] previous question. So we see a greater acceleration in the third and fourth quarters and a little bit of a flatter second quarter because of that more difficult comp. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now hand over back to Leah Brady for closing remarks. Leah Andress Brady : Looking forward to seeing many of you in the next few weeks. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's event. Thank you for attending, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over Brenda Pomar, Senior Director of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead. Brenda Pomar : Good evening. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our second quarter results. Don? Donald Wood : Thanks, Brenda, and good afternoon, everyone. So here are the highlights. All-time record quarterly FFO per share at $1.69, exceeding internal expectations, analyst consensus, and a very tough comp one year ago. All-time record second quarter comparable leasing volume at 594,000 square feet, within 4,000 square feet of the most comparable leasing volume ever in any quarter. Strong occupancy gains on both a lease and an occupied basis, the 95.3 and 93.1 respectively, up 100 and 110 basis points respectively from the last quarter, levels not seen since the 2017-2019 time period. Quarterly residential operating income on our stabilized REDI properties up 6.7% versus last year, 9.5% when including the new Darien Connecticut products. By the way, the apartments at Darien Commons are 99% leased with a waiting list to get in. Strong transactional activity in the quarter with the $215 million acquisition of Virginia Gateway and the $12 million buyout of the minority interest at CocoWalk, not to mention the sale of our remaining assets on Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica for $103 million. The momentum continued in July with our $60 million acquisition of Pinole Vista Crossing in Pinole, California. Yes, this was a very strong quarter, top to bottom, and based on what we see with our deal pipeline, this leasing environment is expected to continue to at least the balance of the year. Let me give you a little more color on leasing and its impact on our financing. 122 comparable deals at an average starting rent of $37.72 per foot compared with the final year of the previous lease of $34.29. 10% more rent to start, and that's great. By the way, those numbers include 98% of our deals, so they are truly representative of the entire company's results. But what makes that particularly impressive is that the rent on many of the previous leases has likely been growing at 3% or so over the last five or 10 years, and there's still room to increase the new rent to start the next five to 10-year cycle. It's actually 23% more on a straight-line basis because of those very important contractual bumps. Contractual rent bumps on all of our commercial deals on this quarter averaged 2.4% and sit at roughly 2.25% portfolio-wide, very likely the best portfolio-wide in the business. This isn't new for us. It's why in the last 20 years, this company has grown its bottom-line earnings, 18 of them, with only the great financial crisis and the global pandemic momentary setbacks. In this second quarter, 2Q year-over-year growth is muted, largely due to the bed-bath stores that were all still open in the second quarter of last year. Yet we still expect the whole-year growth over 2023 to be right at the top of the sector. Compare FFO for share growth over the past one, three-year, five-year, 10-year, 20-year periods against any other large retail portfolio that has a long history, and you'll see why we're so committed to our way of doing things. The impact on occupancy on both a leased and fiscal basis has been steady and impressive over the last three years, but never more so than this quarter. Both small shop and anchor occupancy growth stood out. In the 2024 second quarter, we picked up 100 basis points in overall lease percentage, bringing it to 95.3. Great result, thanks to record-setting leasing volumes, the acquisition of a well-leased Virginia Gateway, the sale of a less well-leased Third Street Promenade, and by the planned redevelopment of places like Andorra Shopping Center. Our anchor lease percentage gained 90 basis points alone since last quarter and sits at 96.7%. There's another 100-plus basis points to come here. Let me talk for a moment or two about the transactions this quarter, starting with the sale of Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica. First of all, what a great investment this has been for the Trust over the past 25 years. A 13% unlevered IRR over that period and a springboard for this company into relationships with a type of tenant that benefited every mixed-use and lifestyle-oriented project we did. Over the past few years, we lost confidence in the future income growth there for a host of reasons and sold to a local developer for $103 million, on in $20 million when including a one-off sale there late last year. Reinvesting those proceeds in a dynamic asset like Virginia Gateway with far more future growth possibilities seemed like a no-brainer. We've spoken about Virginia Gateway at various events and meetings over the past couple of months, so I won't use this time to repeat them. Suffice it to say, our Virginia management and development team is all over it and excited to have the new raw material to create significant value over the next few years through releasing and selective placemaking and redevelopment. Earlier this week, we closed on the acquisition of Pinal Business Shopping Center in Northern California for $60 million, which will generate an initial cash-on-cash return in the low sevens and will grow from there. This dominant 216,000 square foot grocery-anchored regional shopping center sits on 19 acres and was purchased at $277 a foot. Not bad. The center fits in nicely with our West Coast portfolio complementing Crow Canyon Commons and East Bay Bridge in the East Bay and will be managed from our West Coast headquarters at Santana Road. We're not done on the acquisition front either. Lease-up at Santana West continues with a newly signed deal with an AI-powered cloud database provider for 24,000 square feet on the first floor of the state-of-the-art building. Active negotiations with other prospective tenants for much of the remainder of the building should enable us to continue to report on new deals. And in Lower Merion Township outside Philadelphia, the longstanding Old Lord & Taylor building at our Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center has been fully demolished and construction is underway on our $95 million residential development of 217 apartments with ground floor retail that will be integrated with and complementary to one of federal's most successful shopping centers. We expect a 7% stabilized yield here. It's nice to see that development economics can still work in the right locations. You might be interested to know that in addition to Bala Cynwyd, we have over 3,700 residential units with active design or entitlements in process at a dozen of our existing assets. As construction costs continue to stabilize, as they've been doing, and rents continue to rise with inflation, as they've been doing, these projects are getting closer and closer to pension. Stay tuned. By the way, for those New Yorkers listening who may have reason to be out on Long Island around Huntington, please stop by our completely redeveloped and reimagined Huntington Shopping Center, where the brand new Whole Foods opened just last week and joined a new cadre of tenants, including REI, Ulta, New Dining Alternatives, and others. Set in a beautifully landscaped, comfortable setting, it really represents the best of federal realty thinking and execution. The $85 million comprehensive redevelopment brought in on time and on budget. The before and after effect is pretty striking. Huntington Shopping Center is now a worthy, grocery-anchored, open-air complement to Simon's powerful Walt Whitman Mall next door. As I was finishing up these prepared remarks earlier in the week, I was reading them to the senior team in preparation for this call. Our President Jeff Burke sat back reflectively and commented as to how significant the results of our capital allocation decisions have been over the past 90 to 120 days, given the relative size of this company. He's right. Collectively, they're meaningful and they move the needle in a 102-property portfolio. Between Virginia Gateway and Pinole, we've made nearly 900,000 square feet of acquisitions, deploying $275 million of capital at a 7-plus percent yield. We've completed a comprehensive and transformational $85 million redevelopment in Huntington, New York, began a new $95 million mixed-use development in Bella, and freed up $103 million of underperforming capital with the third-street promenade sale, all while executing 124 total leases for over 600,000 square feet of commercial space, cementing future growth. I'd say the future looks bright. That's all I wanted to cover in my prepared remarks this afternoon, so I'll turn it over to Dan to provide more granularity before opening it up to your questions. Dan Gee : Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share, $1.69 for the second quarter, came in at the top of our quarterly guidance range of $1.63 to $1.69. This result was against a tough second quarter 2023 comp, which was our previous record for quarterly FFO, highlighting the overall strength and operating fundamentals across the portfolio. Primary drivers for the strong performance? Simply POI growth in our comparable portfolio, driven by strong property-level expense controls, acceleration in our occupancy levels, and continued strength in our residential portfolio. Comparable POI growth, excluding the impact of prior period rent and term fees, was 2.9%. Now that's GAAP. It's 3.1% on a cash basis. Both numbers are above our expectation for the period, and you will see a revision upward in guidance as a result. Comparable total property revenues were up 3.1%, with comparable min rents up 2.7% on a GAAP basis and 2.9% on a cash basis. Solid results when you keep in mind that Bed Bath & Beyond was in possession of largely paying rent throughout the second quarter in 2023. Portfolio occupancy increased in the quarter to 95.3% leased and 93.1% occupied. Both metrics over 100 basis points increased since March 31. As a result, rent from signed leases not yet occupied in the existing portfolio stayed elevated at $26 million, with an additional $13 million of rent to come online from leases signed in the non-comparable pipeline. Also note that we continue to have a robust leasing pipeline with a significant amount of new leases being negotiated for currently vacant space. With a tenant watch list that is minimal, given our lack of exposure to troubled tenants, and our proven ability to get tenants open and rent paying for a tenant coordination team that is second to none, we expect our current spread between leased and occupied to move toward our target of 125 basis points over the quarters ahead. As we stood last quarter, we are extremely well positioned again to drive our occupancy metrics over the balance of the year and have increased our targeted year-end occupancy level to roughly 93.5%. The strength in leasing from a rollover and contractual rent bug perspective, with 10% cash rollover and 2.4% blended increases from combined anchor and small shop leases, resulted in a straight-line lease rollover of 23% and net effective straight-line rollover after capital of 15%, which highlights our ongoing focus on controlling tenant capital. Now to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. Given roughly $700 million of successful refinancing activity to start 2024, we have no material maturities until 2026. We stand with about $1.3 billion of available liquidity from our $1.25 billion credit facility and net cash on hand. This liquidity stands against redevelopment expansion spend remaining of only $65 million for the balance of 2024 and only $205 million remaining to spend on our needle-moving $850 million in-process redevelopment and expansion pipeline. With the completion of the sale of Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica for $103 million, access to the equity markets and the acquisition of Virginia Gateway and buyout of our partners at CocoWalk, along with meaningful growth in EBITDA this quarter, our leverage metrics at June 30 continue to show improvement. 2Q annualized net debt-to-EBITDA has decreased to 5.8 times that metric targeted to improve over the course of 2024 and reach the mid-fives in 2025. Fixed charge coverage increased to 3.6 times for the quarter. That metric should also improve as incremental EBITDA continues to come online. And with respect to guidance, with a solid first two quarters behind us and tenant demand continuing at a stronger pace than expected, we are raising our 2024 FFO guidance from $6.77 per share at the midpoint to $6.79, with the range refined upwards to $6.70 to $6.88. This represents 3.7% bottom-line FFO growth at the midpoint and 5% at the upper end of the range. Strong growth in the face of a higher interest rate environment that faced us in both 2022 and again here in 2023 and again here in 2024. This upward revision implies over 5% FFO growth at the midpoint in the second half of 2024. This upward revision is driven by stronger underlying portfolio performance than expected, as occupancy metrics outperform expectations, as well as the acquisition of Virginia Gateway and Old Vista Crossing, combined with the sale in Santa Monica, which only provides modest net accretion this year but will contribute more fully in 2025. Our guidance reflects only these three transactions. As a reminder, prospective acquisitions and dispositions will be reflected in our guidance when completed. We are also revising our Comparable Growth Outlook, upward comparable growth, excluding prior-period rents and term fees, is revised to 3% to 4%, 3.5% at the midpoint. We are leaving our Comparable Growth Outlook as is at 2.25% to 3.5%, given term fees year-to-date have lagged. As such, we are adjusting downward our assumption for term fees from $4 million to $7 million to $4 million to $6 million, as well as our assumption for G&A expense down to $48 million to $51 million. While leasing progress continues both at 1 Santana West and 915 Meeting Street, none of this incremental activity is expected to impact our forecast for 2024. We will see the benefit in 2025. More to come on that outlook overall as the year progresses, additional leases get signed, and clarity on delivery dates becomes more evident. We are maintaining our expected credit reserve of 70 to 90 basis points, and all other guidance assumptions can be found outlined on page 27 of our aid kit. Now, before we go to Q&A, let me highlight that yet again, Federal Realty's Board of Directors has declared an increase in its quarterly common dividend per share to $1.10, or $4.40 per share on an annualized basis, which represents the 57th consecutive year we've increased the dividend. In REIT industry records, we stand as the only REIT with the status as a Dividend King, which signifies 50 or more consecutive years of annual dividend increases. A 57-year record serves as a testament to our commitment to delivering a stable, growing cash flow stream for our common shareholders. With that, Operator, I'm going to open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thank you for the time. Just hoping, Don, you could talk a little bit more about the acquisition environment. Has the touch of assets you're looking for changed? I think before you're focused on kind of larger assets with less competition. And just general pricing expectations, great success year-to-date, but have cap rates come in at all or that low 7% is still kind of the bogey that we should have in the back of our minds? Donald Wood : Yes, no, Juan, it's a very fair question. We talked earlier in the year about a window and being able to jump through the window when the arbitrage kind of makes sense. I can tell you that if we signed up Virginia Gateway today, it would be more expensive than what we bought at Crystal Clear so that they have come in a little bit. As you would expect with assumptions of interest rates overall coming down. I mean, there's nothing more sensitive than that. Yet still, we've got some things working in the hopper that look like they can make some sense again, whether we close them or not, I don't know. But yes, you should absolutely, you should assume that there's a direct correlation between the product that's available out there and what the cost of money is. So frankly, the ones that we've built made so far where we hit that window right on, I'm feeling great about those two. In terms of the others that we were looking at now, still assume around the same places, maybe inside a little bit. But, let's see what happens with interest rates in the rest of the year with respect to how much product is available. Juan Sanabria : Great. And then just you mentioned kind of incremental leasing at Santana. Just curious kind of where that is leased today. If there's been any update from Splunk and Cisco and how we should think about capitalized interest in 2025 with the leasing progress you've made to date for that specific asset? Donald Wood : Dan, you want to take that? Dan Gee : Yes, sure. So Juan, the leasing at Santana West with this new AI-based tech company is going to bring us well above 50%. We have letters of intent. We're working back and forth, actually pretty rapidly right now, with about another 70,000 square feet of demand there. We may not be able to sign all of them. We'll see. But I would think that we'll start to get pretty well leased up by the end of the year, beginning of the first quarter of next year. So seeing pretty good activity. Smaller tenants, we're breaking floors. And that's where we're seeing really, really strong demand. And no update whatsoever on Cisco or Splunk or what their plans are. At least still a ways off. And we'll have to see what comes with that. Donald Wood : And with regards to capitalized interest, with regards to 2025, we have no change in terms of the outlook. I think we're getting better clarity. But I think we still need more things to pull in place before we'll provide any guidance on that front. Operator : And our next question will come from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dori Kesten : Thanks for taking my question. You previously talked about adding about 100 basis points of small shop occupancy this year and I believe 200 on anchor. And I think you're already there on small shop and pretty close on anchor. Can you give us an update on your perspective about where you may end the year? Donald Wood : Yes. I expected this question, Dori, because we blew through our assumptions with respect to what we assumed. And, as I said, I still think there's another 100 basis points or so to go more on anchor. I don't think it's this year. I think it's between, it's by the end of 2025, effectively there on small shop. Man, there might be a little bit more to go there too, which I was not expecting to be able to say. But the pipeline really looks very strong. So that's all good news. I don't know if I have a number for you. No, no. I mean, in my prepared remarks, I highlighted that we've revised upward our targeted year in occupancy level to roughly 93.5%. That's a bull mark estimate and obviously dependent upon, how quickly we can get folks open in terms of what deals we've got already executed. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Same property NOI sold [ph] sequentially in the quarter, though presumably that reflects the more difficult comparison, just given the guidance that applies like a return same property NOI growth back to that like mid-to-high 3% range. But can you just talk a little bit about the assumptions of like how you get there? Is that right that we're getting back to kind of like the that mid-to-high 3% range and just kind of like outline some of the expectations on how you get there through the back half of the year? Thanks. Donald Wood : Sure. I think it's really going to be driven by occupancy. I've got largely kind of it was a little back end of the quarter weighted in terms of the moves it move ins. So we didn't see, I think, fully the strength in occupancy growth during the quarter. And so we'll see that more fully in the third quarter. And I think we expect to be kind of in the mid to upper threes in the second half of the year. I think it's not a big stretch just assuming occupancy rates are elevated in the second half of the year. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good afternoon. Dan, I guess as you sit here August 1st, you got a lot of things that are kind of known and in the bag and you don't really have any that speaking of to mature the tier, I guess just help us think through the swing factors of getting to the low end of the FFO range and kind of the high end of the FFO range. Dan Gee : Yes, look, I think that we outline on our guidance page, I think all the different factors that can get us to the upper end and the lower end. I think occupancy is a big driver to get us towards the top of the range. I think other things that are on there, whether it be other revenue, whether it be parking or percentage rent, are probably kind of more middle of the road in terms of what our expectations have been this year so far. Term fees will lag based upon where we are this year because tenants candidly really don't want to get space back. So that's going to be end up coming in probably closer to the bottom of our range, given where we sit today. And I think we also look, we have a very conservative approach to revenue recognition in terms of, and some of it's just timing. Timing of when cash basis tenants pay, and that can cause some swings between quarters and so forth. So that's part of it. And it's also, I think, a big driver of getting us to the top of the range again is really, how successful we can be in continuing to get tenants open on time or ahead of time and beating our rent commencement dates. It's going to be critical from that perspective. And then to a certain degree is how many, we do have some floating rate exposure to get us further up is, are we, do we have one, do we have two, do we have three rate cuts? I mean, I think that's probably more going to be more impactful next year. But also that's a little bit of a swing. Operator : And our next question will come from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Hey, good evening. So based on retailer guidance, it appears tenant sales growth is under some pressure. And there's plenty of anecdotes out there about challenges facing the lower end consumer and potentially inching up the socioeconomic ladder as well. Are you seeing any of this leak into tenant conversations or willingness to be taking new space right now? Or do retailers just seem either immune or they don't care that this is happening? Wendy Seher : Yes, Greg, it's Wendy. We are not seeing that diminish in any way the leasing demand that we're seeing over our various different product types. So I think if you look at the tenants that are in our portfolio, that lower end tenant that's sensitive, whether it's Dollar Tree or Party City or some of the, those tenants that are even McDonald's as they just came out with some varied reports on the consumer and their impact on that lower end consumer. So we are not seeing that. In fact, we were having discussions with Starbucks the other day. And they've had some mixed results that you saw come out. And I was looking at all of our 40 some locations that we have with them. And we're not seeing any impact on their sales because our demographic in our markets is more of that affluent upper end demographic. So there is some fatigue showing in the $6 latte, but not so much in our markets. Operator : And our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : Hey, I'm not sure it's up in my name today, but it's Alexander still. Don, question for you on new supply. We keep hearing the same thing, which is that rents would have to be 35%, 50% higher to justify, new supply and mass. So I'm just curious, as you guys look at redevelopment and taking down portions of centers rebuilding, are you looking at the same rent math needed to do basic redevelopment? And if not, what explains the significant difference in rents needed to pencil between new supply and redevelopments? Donald Wood : Yes, no, Alex, you're, and I'm not calling you Alexandra, by the way, you're Alex to me, buddy. You've got a couple of things to think about, including construction costs. And let me start with that, because that is the first thing that, that it's been a long time since we've seen pressure on, on prices, construction prices coming down, and we are starting to see that. Now, whether that's actually the cost of things like lumber, which is under pressure, certainly to come down, given the lack of housing starts, whether it's, whether it's lack of work, so that the developers profit, is they're more willing to take less profit. There are incremental changes there that are very important to this, to the whole equation. And then when you come to, when you come to the rents and what rents are needed, it obviously not only depends on the starting rent, but it definitely depends on where you see your growth. And particularly when we're talking about a number of the things that we would redevelop, in particular, we got a lot of residential stuff that would be added to our existing properties, like, like Bell. And so you're -- we're sitting there saying, there, you clearly know that there's, there's, more housing needed throughout the country globally. And when you're sitting, you add them to mixed use, or to shopping centers to create more of a mixed use environment there. The -- what we've seen is the ability to press up, like I've told you on my residential rents. So the combination of where those rents are going, or are today, will be tomorrow and continue to grow coupled with, with construction costs are really important. And as I'm talking to you, Jeff Berkes is putting up his finger. So he's got something else to say, Alex, we're going to add that in. Go ahead, Jeff. Jeff Berkes : Hey, Alex. If you're thinking about this from a, are we concerned about more competitive retail supply coming into our trade areas? I would definitely say that, the vast, vast majority of the places where we're located, single story retail service parking is not the highest and best use of the land, which is what Don's getting to, our locations lend themselves to densification, maybe a little bit of ground floor retail and an apartment building or something like that. And we are starting to see those economics become more viable. But, in terms of us getting a lot of competitive new supply in the trade areas where we do business, we just don't see that. In fact, we see a lid on supply and maybe downward pressure on supply, which is giving us a lot of pricing power with retailers. Operator : And our next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Spector : Great. Thank you. Maybe, follow up on all the leasing that you've executed. Can you talk a little bit more about categories? And I know you talked, you had a comment about lattes, but there are a lot of questions on restaurants. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about again, leasing demand by category, what you're trying to fill at this point, and then any other, anecdotal comments you can share and what you're seeing throughout the portfolio in some of the categories like restaurants that people are concerned over? Thank you. Wendy Seher : Yes, I think in terms of categories, it's still pretty widespread in terms of what we see, again, in our different property types. So that remains strong. I was looking at sales from the first part of last year to the first part of this year, because when we're looking at what we're concerned about, our sales growing is one metric to look at, and AI is another metric to look at as to who's visiting our shopping centers. There's multiple points to kind of check the health and the productivity of our tenants. So I was looking, for example, fast casual restaurants is booming with us. And I think maybe what we're seeing is there's just more options out there. That's a big category that we've been focused on in many of our properties. Whole price apparel is doing quite well. Specialty foods are doing quite well. So those, all those and anything health and beauty related off the charts. So anything in those categories, they're growing like an 8% to 12% per year. And so when those sales are growing, we're still being able to push those rents. So, and that doesn't even get into with some of the retailers. Sales is one metric and that e-commerce distribution is another metric that we don't always have full eyes on that can be quite productive from a retailer perspective. Donald Wood : Jeff, I feel like I always have to caveat whenever a question comes up about categories. I feel like I always have to qualify it by saying, you have to look at the operators and you have to look at best-in-class operators in whatever the category is. Because as we see, I mean, I was just looking at sales numbers for our restaurants, for example, at Santana Row, at Pike and Rose Assembly Row, extremely productive. And part of the reason they're extremely productive is because there's some of the best operators in the space. If you've got the best properties, you've got the ability to be a little bit more choosy on who comes into those properties. And that applies whether you're talking about, apparel operators, shop, small, smaller shop, apparel operators, restaurant operators, gym operators, all of it. And when you look at a time where the consumer is, there is worry about the consumer going forward, I can tell you, mediocre businesses go away. Strong businesses find their way through. And so that understanding of the strength of the operator has to be figured into the mix when you ask about categories. It's more than just categories. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. Going back to development, redevelopment, whenever you decide it's the right time to flex up again the program, do you think it's going to be more retail focused or mixed use, resi focused at first? Donald Wood : I think it's going to, so what we've learned on, our mixed use properties is absolutely that the integration of the uses, and this actually applies to office too, that we'll be building office anytime soon. But that the integration of those units, whether you're talking about residential or whether you're talking about office or whatever you're talking about, is clearly much more impactful if it's near all the other amenities. It's the fully amenitized environment. So when you look at our shopping centers, you know that our shopping centers are in pretty darn good demographic areas where the rents for residential would largely be high enough or getting to be high enough to be able to make those numbers work. So when I talk in my comments about 3,700 apartment units that are either entitled or being entitled or being designed, that's probably where we'll start as evidenced by ballot in terms of where kind of big development happens. Now, if you go out to Huntington, that's a complete, retail redevelopment of a shopping center. And that opportunity came to us, frankly, before COVID. And we've worked through that. When I look now, I believe residential adding to our retail shopping centers is probably where you'll see us starting as evidenced by ballot. Operator : And our next question will come from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please go ahead. Craig Mailman : Hey, good evening. Just maybe a quick two part here. One, have you guys disclosed yet the cap rate on Santa Monica? And then two, I noticed you guys did issue some equity during the quarter. And I'm just curious, as you continue to acquire assets, potentially in the back half of this year into 2025, kind of the sources of capital, whether it be equity or would you sell more assets into the potential strength here with the 10 year coming in a bit, kind of what's the optimal mix as you guys look to redeploy capital, the most accretive methods? Donald Wood : What was the first part of the question? You got two questions in there. Craig Mailman : The first one was on Santa Monica... Donald Wood : The cap rate on Santa Monica is kind of a little bit of a hard one. I mean, kind of, it's kind of mid to upper sixes, kind of in place, but it quickly kind of goes down into the fives. And next year and the year after that, low fives. So, the unlevered IRR that we kind of penciled is kind of has a low six handle on it. So it's a really attractive source of capital. Not as accretive this year as we would like, but very much accretive over the longer term. The second piece in terms of, look, we acquired and put to work in the quarter $287 million of capital in CocoWalk buyout at Virginia Gateway, at Pinal Vista Crossing. I think raising capital, which we always do in a balanced approach that we fund the business. We have a multiple premium and an attractive multiple that even though it's not where we'd like it to be from an NAB perspective, it's still accretive capital. Where we deployed it, that $287 million, and it was in modest amount, about a quarter the capital needed there was to fund it. So I think it was very prudent in terms of how we approached it. With regards to going forward and future acquisitions, we'll be opportunistic. We have a big, full pipeline of assets under consideration for sale. That will be a component of it. I don't think it necessarily means we will sell. And then we'll look to I think opportunistically tap the equity market as we see it's an accretive, if we can accretively deploy that capital and grow FFO from. So that's kind of how we look at that. Operator : And our next question will come from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead. Floris van Dijkum : Guys, how are you? Good evening. Donald Wood : Hey, just one thing, Floris. One question, not a three-parter. Floris van Dijkum : No, I'm not going to cheat. I'm not. I just, you guys have historically always focused on the softer aspects around leases in terms of rent bumps and etcetera. A lot of your peers are touting the fact that they're now driving 3% rent bumps annually, etcetera, as well as less renewal options. Maybe if you could talk about what are the improvements that you're seeing in your lease terms? Are you able to drive what percentage of your leases that you're signing, for example, on your shop tenants are having rent bumps of 4% and maybe some more detail behind that? And also maybe talk about some of the other, the terms for anchors. Are you able to shorten the lease terms there or is there, at market upside at certain levels? Donald Wood : Yes, Floris, we announced kind of blended anchor and small shop that was 2.4%. Really, really strong. Nobody else I think is even close. And that's driven by significant percentage of our leases at 3% or better on the small shop side. And we get better rent bumps on our anchors. Probably kind of in the mid to upper ones. I think that was about where we were this last quarter. So, that blended gets us there. We continue to push that an important component, but we also look to push other components. The starting rent is an important part of it as well. And so the more qualitative aspects, I'll hand over to Wendy in terms of what are the things are we getting from tenants in this environment where we're getting better negotiating leverage? The other thing is I'd like to highlight to you is it's just also, we had a good quarter and we got a good couple quarters in terms of TI's. And we're starting to, I mentioned that in my prior remarks, we're focused on kind of controlling those TI dollars and limiting that. And that's why I highlighted the net effective straight line rents in the mid-teens is an impressive number and something I'd like to highlight. Wendy Seher : But I think the only thing that I would add to that would be the different components of that contract, whether it be options, whether it be increases, whether it be control rights, exclusivity, there's so many components that really hasn't changed with this high demand that we're going after them any differently than we've always treated them, which is every component is separate and every component needs to make sense on that particular aspect. So I would say we are having some success in getting some more flexibility on options, for example, which we don't like options. We just don't. And so we rarely give them if there's a, if we have to, and if there's a, you know, a capital allocation that's heavy from the tenant, we have to, we'll try to see if we can do it at a fair market value with a base and try, maybe we've done several, many actually, where you tie it to a sales volume that they can't exercise it unless they're reaching a certain level of production within the center. So yes, we are diving deep into all those like we always do and having more success. And it's a balanced approach, right? We're doing a lot of business with these national and regional tenants, so we want to make sure that we have a balanced approach. Donald Wood : The only thing I'm going to add to that, Floris, is I've always touted that I felt that our contracts were among the strongest, if not the strongest in the industry. And when I say contracts, what I'm talking about, not only lease bumps, which we can quantify, but certainly the qualitative things like redevelopment rights, like lack of sales kick outs, like lack of co-tenancy. All of that, I think our contracts are stronger today than they were a few years ago, even. And a few years ago, I think they were in the sector. Hard to prove it. Better locations give us more leverage. That's where I think we are. Operator : And our next question will come from Handel [Indiscernible] with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Ravi Vaidya : Hi there. This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Handel. I hope you guys are doing well. I've got a quick follow-up to the guide here. Why maintain the 70 to 90 bids for bad debt at this point? The portfolio seems to have minimal credit issues. What's on your watch list right now for the back half of the year? Donald Wood : Hey, look, I think 70 to 90 is still operative. I mean, I think we were at the lower end of that range in the first half of the year, the way we look at it. And I think that it's proven to kind of keep that same leverage. I'm hoping we'll end up towards the bottom end. And certainly if we can end up towards the end, obviously that enhances our ability to outperform and get towards the upper end of our range of guidance. But I'm fine given where we were. I think the first half of the year, we ended up kind of at the lower end of that range. And I don't think it's -- we don't see a reason at this point to change that out. Operator : And our next question will come from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Hi, Dan. You mentioned earlier you're doing a better job of controlling TI dollars. What does that process look like and what are those conversations, how do those go? Wendy Seher : I guess I will start with the anchors. Many of these anchors we have longstanding relationships with and they're eager to figure out how to make more deals. So it's not -- we're getting into the details of the space and really digging deep and they're getting creative on how they'll take that space. So -- and what condition that space needs to be in. So that speaks to the demand and the quality of the real estate. On the smaller shops, we have probably the most ability to influence that conversation. So yes, we are using that to maximum. And we also want to understand how much capital they're putting into the space as well. So many discussions and having some good progress. Dan Gee : Yes, Linda, just to make that really clear, I think the biggest thing there is the -- what a tenant and what we as a landlord are willing to do to be able to get that tenant in the space and operating. Whether that means hanging on to an AC unit that you would have wanted replaced ideally. Nah, let's give that five years and let's see how that goes. Whether it looks at -- whether it works on a storefront that a tenant particularly wants that we'll put a limit on and so they'll pick up the incremental cost of a particular storefront they get in. Things like that. What it is a willingness to work together because of the heavy supply demand where we are in demand supply of the space to accept space differently than they were before. Operator : And our next question will come from Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please go ahead. Paulina Rojas : Good evening. The retail environment is clearly very solid. So what do you think this environment will translate in terms of market rent growth in your markets for the next 12 to 14 months? It seems to me that investors are generally very hesitant to forecast market rent growth above, let's say, 3%, 4%. And I wonder if you agree or disagree with this view. Donald Wood : What I would say first, Paulina, about that is take it back to the tenant. That tenant is pushing through -- is doing two things in order to be profitable in their business. One is they're trying to push through the inflationary costs that are obviously 35% higher than they were pre-COVID. So they're trying to push that through. The more successful they are, the more willing they are to be able to pay more rent. I have an obvious thing there. What's a little less obvious is the work that they're doing on their margins to try to make their businesses more efficient so that even to the extent they're unable to push all the cost increases through, they're trying to increase their profitability. That goes into what they're willing to do for space. So if you take a tenant that is having success with the consumer and you take a lack of choices that that tenant has as to where they're able to move, that's where you can get some pretty good-sized rent increases. Importantly in that absolutely is the contractual bump. And I know you hear us say it every single day, but we have to say it every single day because it's an important part of the economics. So I don't know that I have a percentage for you. When you see us able to move overall tenant increases to 10% from the new stuff versus the last year of what was in there, on top of those bumps, let me tell you, that's really strong. That's worth 23% with a, on a straight line basis. So I don't see that changing over the next 12 to 14 months. And that's where I think you should expect us. Operator : And our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good evening, everyone. Congrats on the great quarter and the outlook. Don, curious, and I'm not sure if this is a fair question, but curious what your thoughts are on this news out there of Blackstone potentially buying ROIC and specifically just what you think the implications are for the broader shopping center group and maybe, FRC in particular, if any. Donald Wood : No, of course, Tayo, it's a very fair question. And what you're going to hear is an opinion because I have no inside knowledge of it. But when you sit and you think about, looking forward at the demand for retail space over the next five years, I think you should feel pretty good about that. I think Blackstone feels pretty good about that or there wouldn't be negotiations that way. I think that is all about the not only the supply demand characteristics that we've all been talking about here, but also the valuations and the choices in other sectors, which are not as robust as maybe they were over the last couple of years. So when you put all that together, it doesn't surprise me. There are whatever we've got, 17 companies in the shopping center index or something like that. Many of them are smaller companies. I think you should always expect that to -- companies like that to be under pressure of sale. Now, whether those deals happen or not, we'll have to see. But I've never thought of Blackstone as being a company that really stretched. So I suspect they see a lot of value there. Operator : And our next question will come from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : Thanks for taking another question. Dan, I apologize if you address this in the opening remarks. I just couldn't remember. But what's the expectation on bad debt embedded in the same store and has that changed at all? Dan Gee : That's still the same 70 to 90 basis points we had originally. And that's kind of outlined in our guidance and in the prepared remarks. I don't think we're shifting it around. We ended up in the first half of the year in the lower end of that range. And hopefully we can remain in that lower end of that range. And that's reflected in the same store outlook. Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brenda Pomar for any closing remarks. Brenda Pomar : We look forward to seeing many of you in the next few weeks. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode for the duration of the call. [Operator Instructions]. On today's call, we ask that you please limit yourself to only one question during Q&A. You may re-prompt if you have additional questions. Also, please be aware that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead. Leah Brady : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call are Don Wood, Federal's Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Berkus, President and Chief Operating Officer, Dan Gee, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Jan Sweetnam, Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer, and Wendy Seher, Executive Vice President, Eastern Region President, as well as other members of our executive team that are available to take your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. A reminder that certain matters discussed on this call may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any annualized or projected information, as well as statements referring to expected or anticipated events or results, including guidance. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, Federal Realty's future operations and its actual performance may differ materially from the information in our forward-looking statements, and we can give no assurance that these expectations can be attained.

Given the number of participants on the call, we do kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question during the Q&A portion of our call. If you have additional questions, please requeue. And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don? Don Wood : Thank you, Leah, and good afternoon, everyone. Look, it's a really solid quarter for us, with a continuation of incredibly productive leasing, some strong occupancy gains, and an all-time record quarterly FFO per share at $1.71. The leasing productivity continues to outpace even our own elevated goals, with 126 leases for comparable space this quarter, totaling 581,000 square feet, and makes 11 of the past 15 quarters since the beginning of 2021 with comparable leasing productivity above a half a million square feet. As a frame of reference, the 15 quarters immediately preceding the last 15 averaged 413,000 square feet. There's no better indicator of demand for your product than that, somewhere between 25% and 35% more volume consistently over nearly four years. This quarter's comparable leases were written on average at $35 a foot in the first year of the new lease, 14% better than the rent paid in the last year of the old lease. And by the way, those numbers include 98% of our deals, so they are truly representative of the entire company's results. But what makes them that particularly impressive is that the rent on many of the previous leases has likely been growing at 3% or so over the last five to 10 years, and that there's still room to increase the new rent to start the next five to 10 years near cycle. It's actually 26% more on a straight-line basis because of those very important contractual bumps. We're also demonstrating a strong commitment to efficiently managing tenant leasing capital with net effective straight-line rollover after capital of 16%. And again, that's on all leases company-wide, not a non-representative subset. The weighted average contractual bumps inherent in all the leases done this quarter, small shop and anchors combined, was 2.4%, even better than the weighted average contractual bumps in place in our entire portfolio of 2.25%. Very likely the best portfolio-wide bumps of any large shopping center company and by a considerable margin. Of course, all that leasing had better translate to higher occupancy, and as you would expect, that continues to be the case. We ended the third quarter with a portfolio 95.9% leased and 94% occupied, up 60 and 90 basis points from the end of last quarter. And we still have room to grow on both the anchor and incredibly the small shop side where we ended up the quarter at 93.1% lease. When we look toward the future, the open air retail market remains supply constrained, and from what we're seeing, our consumer continues to spend. I don't know how many of you saw the October 11th Bloomberg article entitled, U.S. Consumer Spending is Increasingly Driven by Richer Households, but it's worth a read. The article chronicles the findings of a Fed study that has found an increasingly divergent spending pattern between the affluent customer, the ones who frequent Federal Realty shopping centers, and the less affluent. There was nothing at all surprising in the findings from our perspective, as it's been the thesis of our business plan for decades, but it's particularly relevant as inevitable cracks begin to show in consumer spending patterns. One of my favorite lines from that article goes like this, higher income households are enjoying a wealth effect from gains in housing and stock markets, and also receive more interest and investment income during periods of higher interest rates, all providing a stimulus for a sustained level of spending. Whatever happens with regard to consumer spending over there, out there over the next year or two, it's reasonable to think that Federal will compare favorably. Separately, but also worth noting, is that our apartment business is particularly strong. About 3,000 units concentrated at the big mixed-use properties and Darien. Year-to-date, our residential operating income on our stabilized resi properties is up 5.5% versus last year, 8.2% when including the new Darien Connecticut product. The Darien project, by the way, is impressive, with apartments fully leased, with a waiting list to get in, and unusually high initial retention rates, with retailers and restaurants that continue to open. For those of you that live up in that neck of the woods, check out the work we've done with that very successful development. Transaction activity during the quarter was limited to the previously disclosed $60 million acquisition of Pinole Vista Crossing in Pinole, California, although after the quarter in October, we're deep into negotiations for a couple of other market-dominant shopping centers. Due diligence is underway, and assuming all goes as expected, we hope to close on one or both of those over the next few months. Stay tuned. Also, I know a number of you were able to see Virginia Gateway, the 665,000-square-foot regional retail hub on 110 acres in Gainesville, Virginia, on one of the several tours over the past several weeks. But for those who haven't, just a couple of data points. First of all, it's looking like our acquisition timing was excellent, as our going-in cap rate of seven and a quarter likely couldn't be duplicated today for such a dominant asset. It would probably trade 50 to 75 basis points inside of that. And secondly, it looks like our leasing underwriting assumptions were too conservative and are following in the same vein as our earlier acquisitions. For example, we've done 22 deals at Kingstown Shopping Center in Alexandria, Virginia, since our 2022 acquisition, at an average 25% higher rent than projected. Similarly, at Pembroke Gardens in Florida, we've also done 22 deals since our 2022 acquisition, at an average of 16% higher rent than projected. And while it's only been a few months, Virginia Gateway seems to be trending the same way. We believe this pricing power reflects not only a supply-constrained market, but also our reputation with retailers who want to be in our properties because they know we'll make them better places for their businesses to be successful. In any event, these assets will likely generate cash-on-cash returns and IRRs materially greater than approved by our investment committee at the time the deals were done. In other news, productive activity toward lease-up at Santana West and 915 Meeting Street at Pike and Rose continues, with those buildings expected to be 70% and 90% leased respectively by year-end. And construction is well underway, and so far, on time and on budget, at Ballet-Kenwood Shopping Center on our 217-unit residential over retail development that we expect to yield 7% once completed and fully leased up. Also, we're continuing to make progress on some of the residential development opportunities we have at our existing assets through the combination of selective value engineering, more aggressive construction pricing, and higher forecasted rent growth. This company-wide effort to add apartment product to our best shopping centers is an important arrow in our quiver for sustained growth in the years to come. Stay tuned. Okay. Well, that's all I wanted to cover in prepared remarks this afternoon, and so I'll turn it over to Dan to provide more granularity before opening it up to your questions, and go Yankees tonight. Dan Gee : Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.71 for 3Q came in just above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range of 166 to 175. The fact that it is our highest quarter of FFO per share ever provides further evidence of the strength in our underlying operating fundamentals across our portfolio. Primary drivers for the strong performance include stronger occupancy, driving rental income higher and lower G&A costs, which was offset by lower term fees than we forecast and higher property level expenses. Comparable growth excluding the impact of COVID-era prior period rent and term fees was 2.9%. That is a GAAP number. On a cash basis, it is 3.4%. Both numbers are essentially in line with our expectations for the period. Comparable minimum rents were up 3.3% on a GAAP basis and 3.8% on a cash basis. Solid results driven by continued leasing demand and surging occupancy. Let me jump now to the balance sheet and an update on our capital position. We stand with over $1.4 billion of available liquidity from our undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility, forward equity raised and net cash on hand. This liquidity stands against redevelopment and expansion spend remaining of only $180 million on our significant roughly $850 million in process redevelopment and expansion pipeline. We were active through the ATM program during the quarter, issuing over $145 million of common stock at a blended price of $113.27. These proceeds were utilized to partially fund the $287 million of investments year-to-date. In addition, we sold an incremental $82 million on a forward basis at 116 million to share roughly and we stand well positioned to fund a future acquisition pipeline which looks very promising. As a result, our leverage metrics continue to improve. Third quarter annualized net debt to EBITDA on a consolidated basis pro forma for the forward equity raised is 5.5x. Essentially at the upper end of our mid 5x level targeted level, several quarters earlier than we originally forecast. Fixed charge coverage increased to 3.7x for the quarter and that metric should continue to climb given the strong momentum in rental income and occupancy growth. These metrics combined with our significant liquidity leaves us with substantial dry powder to drive growth through external investment for acquisitions and/or new development and expansion projects. Now let's head to guidance. With three quarters of the year behind us and tenant demand continuing at a stronger pace than expected, we are raising our 2024 FFO guidance at the midpoint to $6.81 with the range tightened and refined upwards to $6.76 to $6.86. This revision implies FFO per share growth for 2024 of 4% at the midpoint. It also assumes FFO per share for the fourth quarter of $1.77 with a range of $1.72 to $1.82 per share. Comparable growth for the fourth quarter should be roughly 4%. This upward revision and guidance is driven by stronger underlying rent growth than forecast as occupancy metrics have outperformed our expectations. With respect to other assumptions, we've revised our outlook for term fees to $4 million to $5 million down from 4 to 6. While leasing progress continues both at 1 Santana West and 915 Meeting Street, none of this incremental activity is expected to impact our forecast for the balance of 2024. We will see that impact in 2025 and 2026 and more color to come on that outlook overall in February when we introduce formal guidance for 2025. Our capitalized interest expense forecast for 2024 has been refined to $19 million to $21 million up from 18 to 21. And we are maintaining our expected credit reserve for the year at 70 to 90 basis points. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we are at roughly 80 basis points. All other guidance assumptions are outlined on page 27 in our 8-K. Now, before we go to Q&A, let me provide some preliminary color for our 2025 outlook. First, prior period rents from COVID-era deferral agreements will wind down to essentially zero in 2025 from $3 million in 2024. Second, as tenants are reluctant to give back space in the current environment, term fees should be light for a second consecutive year, essentially flat to 2024. Capitalized interest will fall to the mid-teens as we place more of our significant $850 million development pipeline into service over the year. And we expect our credit reserve to be more normalized for 2025, given the expectation of a moderating economy. Use our historical average of roughly 100 basis points as a placeholder for now. Although currently, we do not see any significant near-term risks in the watch list as of today. On the positive side of the ledger, as outlined previously in our remarks, occupancy growth should continue upwards, likely towards 95% over the course of the year. Additionally, rent growth from sector-leading contractual bumps and strength in rollover should continue, as well as upside from recent acquisitions and contributions from the delivery of space in the redevelopment pipeline. All of these will more than offset any headwinds and fuel continued momentum in our bottom line FFO per share growth into 2025. And with that, operator, you can open the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Andrew Reale with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Reale : Occupancy and lease rate both took a nice jump sequentially, both on the anchor and shop side. Could you just speak to the drivers of that velocity? Any particular tenant categories standing out, commencement happening quicker than expected? Anything else that surprised you to the upside? Don Wood : Yes, Andrew, let me start. And Wendy, who's in a different office, I want her to add to this to the extent there's something to say. It's a really good time to be in this business. And that comes from a number of things. Obviously, the demand is there. And in many cases, it's more than one or two or three tenants looking for a space. So that there is the ability to push that rent. And importantly, not only the rent, but the other terms in the lease. And what among those things is the things that control, the things that we can control and the tenant can control with respect to getting that space open. We have been able to improve the time it takes between the signing of a lease and the day rent starts pretty significantly throughout 2024, which I expect to be able to continue. It's a shortened process that is very helpful. But in addition to that, from a category perspective, there's no doubt in our minds that whether you're talking about a grocery-anchored shopping center that's well located, a mixed-use property that's well located, a larger regional shopping center with some boxes that position the proper space, there's a very broad coalition of demand. And that's what you're seeing in the returns. Operator : And our next question will come from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : And definitely, let's go Yankees. You made a comment about acquisitions having a couple of opportunities at the end of the year here. Could you just talk to what kind of assets they are, quantum of dollars we're talking about, and if you've already seen some cap rate expansion or contraction, I should say, in some of those opportunities relative to where we were in the summer? Don Wood : Juan, I will say a couple of things about it, but I don't want to say too much about it because I want the deals done, if you know what I mean. So first of all, we do tend to look for bigger assets, as you know. So in the ones I'm referring to, they are larger assets in excess of $100 million a piece, for example. So there are things that move the needle for us. There is a little window now. It's an interesting time where we are seeing some good product that is out there and being talked about a little bit that hopefully we can come down and make the deals on. There's the stuff we like, some of it in the mid-sixes, some of it 7%, 7% or so in that type of range with the growth, most importantly, that we require. I do think that's inside a little bit of where it was early or in the year, but we need IRRs, man. We need IRRs that make sense relative to our cost of capital. And so when you can honestly look at it and be up in the eights and the upper eights, even 9%, those deals look very attractive to us. Operator : And our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alexander Goldfarb : And Don, we'll look for you on TV at the game. Just getting to external investment, when we were down with you guys, I guess last month, you were talking about development and how, maybe you're coming to the time where you could restart at like a Pike and Rose or some of the other mixed use where those incremental developments would be highly accretive given the critical mass here that you've already done at the same time acquisitions provide current income, but you have to deal with the existing in-place leases and the amount of time it takes you to go through the property and get it to the way that you want. So how do you balance the two and how close do you think you are to announcing a new development versus in the near term focusing more on acquisitions? Don Wood : Thanks, Alex, for the question, especially for the way you've set it up, because what you're setting up is you're kind of validating for us the notion that having all of those arrows in the quiver, having the ability to develop, to redevelop, to buy at scale and with respect to intensifying the use of a shopping center, that those are critical skill sets that we have. And the development, the new buildings, if you will, the new stuff that we're looking at is likely to be largely skewed toward residential because adding apartments to a really high quality shopping center creates that notion of a mix of uses, not necessarily mixed use, because I think that's different, but a mix of uses, which allows you to get better rent generally in those apartments than in a more generic property type. So, and I think I said this in my remarks, the combination of construction costs, which are not generally rising in total any longer and in certain markets are coming down, mostly because of the profit margin that the subs are requiring, just good old-fashioned strong value engineering inherent in that, and an outlook for rents that look to be growing better than I would have thought a year ago or so on these are making these things closer. Now, I'm not ready to announce the next development that we're going to do yet. You know we're underway on Ballot and the way that one's going is very, very encouraging. So, I would hope over the next quarter or two that we'll be able to add another one or two additional projects like that. That's a good piece. And look, whether it's a development, whether it's a redevelopment, whether it's an acquisition, whatever it is, it's competing for our capital. And the notion of that competition for capital is how you balance. And that's frankly the judgment that you're paying for when you're investing in us to be able to know from a risk-adjusted basis what, where that capital should be deployed. The fact that we can deploy it in a number of different ways is a huge advantage in my view. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Goldsmith : Dan, the implied guidance range is pretty wide at $0.10. I think last year at this time it was more narrow at $0.08. So, is there just like a wider range of outcomes where we sit today versus maybe prior years as we head into the fourth quarter? Thanks. Dan Gee : Yes. I think we wrestled with that. I don't think there's anything to look into that. Look, there is probably a little bit of variability heading into the final quarter, but nothing more than that. I think we were at $0.18 kind of at the end of the second quarter. Narrowing it to $0.10 kind of felt, reasonably appropriate but things can happen in a quarter. And so we've left that, I think, a little wider, but there's nothing to read into there. Operator : And our next question will come from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please go ahead. Craig Mailman : Dan, I know you mentioned there's nothing on the watchlist here. We should just assume that 100 basis points for next year. Is that just in the retail portfolio? Is there anything in the office portfolio that we've talked about, bluebird bio in the past? Anything specifically on them to worry about as we head into next year? Dan Gee : Yes, look, they're on our, and when I say near term, near term is fourth quarter and into 2025. bluebird, for example, I think probably has enough runway. We've got enough of a security structure in place that should get us comfortable into 2026. Other than that, our credit quality, except for maybe one or two others, is really, really strong. Really, really high quality household names. And so we feel really outside of bluebird Bio, very, very comfortable overall with the balance of the office portfolio. And look, I don't think that there is probably Buy Buy Baby, which obviously, I think we were hoping to get more than one year out of that. We would expect that we'll get those stores back probably at some point over the next kind of few quarters but they don't pay a lot of rent. And we've already got backfills kind of teed up. So I think we're in a good spot. Operator : And our next question will come from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Greg McGinniss : The leasing has obviously gone very well. Occupancy up more than expected. I'm just trying to understand the maintain same-store NOI guidance, though, and whether there's any offsetting factors we should be considering. Dan Gee : Yes. I think that from -- we have a lot of, keep in mind with occupancy, it is a point in time. It's the last day of the quarter. It doesn't necessarily reflect the weighted average occupancy over the period. During the third quarter, a lot of our activity on move-ins and so forth happened candidly post-Labor Day. So the weighted average occupancy was not close, really, to 94%, which is where we ended up for rent pay. Just to highlight just for the quarter, look, we had and we expect this to be temporary, but we had some expenses that hit. We are bringing online, but the expenses actually for the comparable piece, expenses were up and I think we want to make sure that these are kind of one-timers. And so I think we were probably a bit conservative on the same-store guide. We will have, I think, a pretty strong fourth quarter as a result of kind of, I think the pickup in occupancy, and we'll recognize in the fourth quarter that the benefit of being at 94%. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Don and Wendy, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and how the conversations are going with retailers, both on the small shop side as well as on the big box. And given where your lease percentage sits, I'm just wondering how those conversations might be changing in your favor. Don Wood : Wendy, would you mind taking that? Wendy Seher : Sure. Steve, we continue to see, as everybody has suggested, that the demand is exceeding the supply, no question. I think, I always look at it as it relates to the health ratio and the amount of sales that a tenant could do and how we can drive that. So we're seeing some great advantages into that. For example, when you think about the restaurant category or the QSR category over our mixed-use properties, we have full-service restaurants doing over $900 a foot on average, $1,100 a foot on average in our QSRs. So there's room to grow some healthy rents there. On the rest of our properties, very strong as well, $900, over $900 a foot average on our QSRs and $600 in our full service. So we're having the ability to push that. In addition to the economics and the kind of rent rollover that we're getting, where, as Don has mentioned, we've gotten greater bumps to our contractual, to our contract, which has been positive. And then also, just as importantly, we're able to, we always concentrate on what kind of controls and what's really in that loop. And I say that we're having even more success on limiting any controls that a retailer may have gotten in other deals that we no longer see viable for this particular location and limiting the restrictions that we have to live with sometimes for a longer period of time. So it's collectively been very positive. Operator : Our next question will come from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead. Floris van Dijkum : Don, I'm rooting with you for the Yanks, but things don't look great, by the way. Don Wood : Thanks for the commentary, Flores. Floris van Dijkum : Yes. My question is on, you're essentially getting, I mean, you sold your forwards at $115 a share, or just over $115 a share, almost $116 a share, which is an excess of your NAV. So you're getting, you're essentially having a green light to grow externally. How, you did, you indicate you've got, two larger deals in the works, and hopefully we'll get some updates over the next month, month or two on that. But are you thinking about stepping up your pace, or is it difficult finding acquisitions? Maybe you can talk a little bit about the environment out there, and then also about your ability to do OPU transactions. What is the appetite from sellers to do those kinds? Because they tend to, particularly where your stock is today, that could make it be more accretive for you as well. Don Wood : Thanks, Flores. I'm going to turn this over to Jan Sweetnam and to Jeff to talk about the acquisitions in a minute, but I am going to correct something. I don't accept the premise that we are above our NAV at the price that we issued. I think we are, when we look at the price that we issued those shares, we like very much the trade for that versus what we did with that capital or are doing with that capital. And that is certainly accretive and makes all the sense in the world. But the basic notion that, this company is trading at NAV, I just disagree with. So let me just turn that over, then turn it over and answer your questions to Jan and to Jeff. Jan Sweetnam : Thanks, Don. Hi, Flores. Jan speaking. Yes, the acquisition market feels like it's going to be picking up and our capital has done relatively well in the near term. And it feels like we're going to have an opportunity to get a few of these over the next several quarters as they start to roll out, starting with one or two that we've got in the pipeline right now that are both, they're larger, they're impactful. The bidding pool tends to be a little bit smaller at $100 million, $200 million acquisitions. And it feels like the acquisitions are going to be accretive from day one and still have pretty good growth prospects for us. So we view it as a good vehicle for us in the next several quarters and we'll kind of see how it plays itself out. We have the OP unit structure in place. We're not negotiating anyone right now, but we've certainly had sellers that are interested in tax protection. We'll probably see more of that in the future and we'll see if we can get one of those done or not. Jeff Berkus : Yes, and hey, Flores, it's Jeff. I agree, obviously, with everything Jan's saying. I still think we have a lot of people sitting on the fence with the treasury around four and a quarter and, with their fingers crossed, hoping that that's going to continue to cut rates and the treasury will come down. They will sell at a better period of time. But we're starting to see some people capitulate and realize that, that's probably not going to happen in a meaningful way and bring their properties to market. So there's more on the market right now. Our pipeline is fuller than it has been in a while and we expect it to get better as the clarity on long-term rates improves. Operator : And our next question will come from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dori Kesten : Don, you just said you don't believe you're trading near NAV. I know you've said that before. Where do you think your NAV should be? And I guess, what do you think we on this side are missing? Don Wood : Oh, Dori, I'm not going to give you a number for Pete's sake. You should know that. But what I am going to say is, when you look at our portfolio, particularly if you look at the big four, that there is an awful lot of development, basically by right, because we've done all the work on the entitlement side historically, to be able to create significant value down the road. Now, can we start on it and make sense of it completely today? Of course not. But the notion of does that stuff have value given what we've done at those places? I don't even think that's debatable to any real estate person. And so that is the primary thing that I'm talking about here. But also in some of the rest of the portfolio, the ability to effectively do intensification on over a dozen of our shopping centers with residential development potentially down there has value to real estate people and that I don't think is being recognized today. And I'm not even sure it necessarily should be in the public market. That's up to the public market to decide. But certainly with respect to, I can tell you this, if we were ever to sell any of those assets, we certainly would get paid for that opportunity. So that's what I was referring to, Dori. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Yes. Hi. This, I guess, is a similar question to what was just asked. But I mean, just thinking about retail driven redevelopment and new development, I mean, considering how robust your leasing has been, the rates you're getting in new leases, I'm just curious, like, how, I guess, how close are you to pivoting your bias from resi driven developments to the extent that you start to ramp them again back to retail? Don Wood : Yes. I don't think it's a pivot, Mike, the way I think about it. It's another potential opportunity that is competing for the capital of the company. And when we look at what those opportunities are, I suspect you will see a number of residential development opportunities. I know you will see a number of acquisition opportunities that would grow. And I don't think they're mutually exclusive. I don't think one goes away when another one goes on. They compete for our capital. I will say, and I think I've said this before, I do see us getting closer to being able to make numbers work, frankly, on the residential side for the reasons that I've cited. Because as you know, over the past number of years, that switch has been turned off effectively. So you know and I know that's not staying off forever. And it will have to compete for capital with the acquisitions. Dan Gee : And retail redevelopments, I think are also, you should see some of those added over the next several quarters. And so stay tuned on that perspective. And also keep in mind in our markets where we have really high barriers to entry, the land values make single story retail development really difficult to pencil on a risk adjusted basis. And so that's why we haven't seen that currently. Operator : And our next question will come from Linda Tsai with Jeffries. Please go ahead. Linda Tsai : Yes. Hi. How do you think about the contribution of development to earnings next year? Dan Gee : Look, I think that we have, I think a number of projects which will be contributing in a reasonably reasonable way. Huntington, for example. Darien, we're finishing up. We've got some others. We've got 915 Meeting Street. Obviously, we'll be finishing out the leasing hopefully there over the course of the year. We could see some drag just as we begin to deliver spaces and reduce our capitalized interest number as I highlighted in my guidance assumption. And we're going to try and do a good job in matching up the rent commencements. We may not be able to do that perfectly. But as I said, I think that all other systems, whether it be from the comparable pool, will offset any modest drag that we have from that perspective. And so I think that we will have very, very solid growth next year, I think, and hope to be sector leading again. Operator : And our next question will come from Paulina Rojas with Green Street. Please go ahead. Paulina Rojas : Your cash releasing spreads were strong this quarter. Given the strength of retailer demand and your targeted consumer, should we expect releasing spreads to inch higher in 2025? And related to that, can you share your thoughts on OCR, where they are versus historical patterns, and the degree to which you can push rents even more aggressively going forward? Don Wood : Yes. Paulina, let me give you a couple of points of view. First of all, in any one quarter, you're talking about the specifics of the deals that were done in that particular quarter. In the third quarter, there were a number of deals where we had some really strong rollovers at properties that old leases effectively coming up that allowed us to push rent significantly in the quarter. That's a good thing. That resulted in not only great rollover, but an awful lot of volume at that great rollover. I think that's a variable that you will see often in the high single digits or low double digits on a cash basis because of the bumps, nearly double that on a regular basis for the straight-line piece, which I think is really, really important in understanding that. I think that should stay strong based on everything that we see. That doesn't mean every quarter is going to be 14% and 26% on a cash straight line basis, but it does mean that the ability to push rents is really important. In terms of OCR, there's a couple of things to say about that. First of all, we don't get the sales reporting for as many tenants as I would like throughout the portfolio. The mall business used to be able to get it for almost everybody. We get, gosh, a third or so of those tenants reporting. But having said that, we also have lots of conversations with tenants. It seems to me that our OCR, if I were to guess, and this is just a guess, is something like 9% or so. When you look at a number like that for most businesses, that suggests that there is room to grow. If you take a look at what we're writing new leases at versus what the overall in place rent is in the portfolio, you'll come to the same conclusion, that there is room to go. This is certainly a strong leasing environment. It's been so for a couple of years now. I would hope that that would continue into 2025. Operator : Our next question will come Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Haendel St. Juste: Yes, go Yanks. Don, I guess a question for you. I was curious on how you're thinking about dispositions versus new equity here as a source of capital. The IRRs and some of the opportunities you're probably looking at may very well exceed the future returns expected from some of your lower tier, lower growth assets. How do you balance the merits of a capital recycling strategy to improve the long-term growth profile versus tapping the equity market? Thanks. Don Wood : That's a great question, Hendel. It's a great question. It's why we always, and this is not a once in a while thing for us, we always are evaluating the balance between what the growth of our lower X percent, whatever that is, of the portfolio is at versus what we could get paid for it and the depth of the particular market for that particular shopping center. Every year, we're doing some. The question is, should we do more? Should we do less? That does come down to the overall balance and competition between the uses of capital that we have, where our earnings growth should be, all of that. I would point you to the past to determine the future in terms of capital recycling. It's a really good portfolio, Haendel. Certainly, there are assets in that portfolio, like any portfolio, that are at the lower end from a growth perspective. But it is, in managing it for the long-term, we're going to make sure that we're selling a number of assets per year to the extent we can, sometimes more, sometimes less, based on what the market will allow. The same process for acquisitions, the same process for development. Operator : And with that, we will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Leah Brady for any closing remarks. Leah Brady : Look forward to seeing many of you over the next few weeks. Thanks for joining us today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a great day.",
