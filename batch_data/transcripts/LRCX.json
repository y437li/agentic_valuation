[Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Martin. Douglas R. Bettinger: Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As you may have read in our press release today, September 2013 marked the highest revenue quarter in the company's history, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. We grew operating margins by nearly 200 basis points, sequentially, demonstrating a strong execution throughout the company. Additionally, we've made progress towards our strategic growth objectives, winning key production tool decisions across various technology inflections and shipping new products, including our next-generation clean system and latest 3D NAND etch capability into leading-edge customer engagements. Overall, the quarter was more than satisfactory and reinforced the substance of our vision objectives and our strategies and capabilities to execute. The September quarter marked the close of an important transition period for the company as we successfully concluded our major integration activities. Singularly focused, we now present one face to our customers for all products and services, and we enjoy the full complement of a well-aligned employee population. Aligned, not just to our business objectives and plans, but to our stated culture and values. Related, I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every employee for their contribution to these outstanding accomplishments, which would not have been possible without their hard work and dedication. As stated previously, I regard acquisition integration capabilities at Lam as a competitive differentiator within our industry. The aspiration to be the most collaborative semiconductor equipment company grows in our consciousness as we look forward to planning our actions in calendar 2014. Turning now to the industry environment. As we enter the final months of the calendar year, we are able to narrow our 2013 wafer fabrication equipment spend forecast to $29 billion, plus or minus $1 billion. This outlook is largely consistent with our views throughout 2013, though there are some well-publicized moving pieces that I'll highlight for you now. Starting with the Logic segment. We now project WFE spends close to $6 billion for the year, slightly lower than our prior view, as certain customers have been able to reuse more of their existing equipment to support their leading-edge production needs. In Foundry, at least one customer has started to ramp 20-nanometer capacity and the pace of those investments has accelerated in the second half of this year. We still expect overall foundry spending around $12 billion, albeit with slightly less trailing-edge investments than previously expected. We see healthy demand and a positive profit and spending trajectory from memory customers and maintain our WFE forecast of approximately $11 billion for that segment for the calendar year. NAND manufacturers are making the transition to the 20-nanometer technology nodes and below for planar devices, and consistent with our expectations, total shipments for the first phase of 3D NAND's production are beginning, as we speak, and extend into the first half of 2014. Depending on qualification and time to yield this capacity, we assume, would likely begin contributing to NAND's bit supply in the mid-2014 timeframe. Overall, we project bit growth in the mid-40% range for 2013, with relatively stable supply and demand balance headed into 2014. In DRAM, contract ASPs have surged by 10% to 20% over the past month driven by tight supply conditions. Due to the well-known short-term supply chain disruption, we've lowered our estimates for 2013, bit supply growth by a couple of points to the mid-20% range and expect a balance between supply and demand to remain extremely tight and disciplined through 2014. Over the past couple years, WFE spend has been driven primarily by mobile electronics. Media tablets have grown at a compound annual rate of greater than 130% since 2010, and we expect smartphones will represent about half of total cellphone units this year versus around 20% in 2010. While annual unit growth rates for tablets and smartphones are intuitively starting to decelerate, off the much lighter base, continued demand and density expansion for mobile products supports our preliminary view for 2014 wafer fabrication equipment spending to be in the range of $32 billion, plus or minus $2 billion, assuming a flattish GDP. Actual spending levels are likely to vary, of course, around customers' investment supporting technology inflections, and in the coming months, we expect customers will continue fine-tuning their plans and outlook. We will share more information as this becomes available. It has been nearly 1 year since we introduced our growth strategy for the broadened and newly formed Lam Research. This strategy is founded on market expansion and share gain opportunities derived, in large parts, from technology inflections, such as multiple patenting, 3D device transitions and advanced packaging. Having completed our merger integration slightly ahead of schedule, we are now singularly focused on executing against those strategic growth objectives. We shared with you, previously, our view of success relative to the transition from planar to 3D NAND. While we continue to work hard strengthening competitive differentiation and protecting positions established, we can report today that we are pleased by the initial production tool decisions. In etch, we sustained strong and above our overall average market share, securing critical dielectric high aspect ratio applications. We expect our new capacity addition, served available market, or SAM, to expand by 30% to 40% over the planar baseline. In the deposition segments in which we compete, we believe our new capacity addition, SAM, grows by 60% or 70% compared to the planar baseline. Further, we believe we've made sizable share gains, winning critical applications in both CVD and tungsten CVD. Our focus over the next 12 to 24 months is on achieving a similar outcome with each of the remaining NAND manufactures, as and when they transition to 3D device structures, in high volume manufacturing. Overall, we estimate it will cost more to add new 3D NAND capacity versus the same amount spent on equivalent wafer starts in that final planar generation. Based on our market size and market share expectations for high volume manufacturing when 3D NANDs become mainstream, we believe that Lam's stands to realize more than 1/3 of the transition opportunity, representing incremental revenues in etch and deposition combined, of approximately $25 million per 10,000 wafer starts at capacity added, or more than 60% market share on the incremental SAM. Equally important are the production tool decisions for the foundry, 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer technology node. Compared with the 20-nanometer node, this initial FinFET transition represents a SAM growth opportunity of 5% to 10% for LAM's markets and conductor etch is a key beneficiary of this transition. The complexity of the transistor increases exponentially with FinFET structures and the need for precise control of etch processes has grown accordingly. This plays well into Lam's strength as a leader in conductor etch, with the ability to control CD uniformity to within a few assets. We believe that we are well-positioned here to maintain our critical share positions and benefit from market expansion. This FinFET transition also creates opportunities for our deposition markets over the next couple of technology nodes. Process steps requiring highly conformal dielectric films are growing. These processes have historically been very slow in nature, requiring a single heir to be deposited at a time. We are partnering with customers to develop high productivity solutions, targeting these applications. With the need for thinner barriers and low resistivity film stacks, we are leveraging our production experience and technology leadership in tungsten deposition to further prevent metal applications. We have a strong engagements with the leading foundry and logic customers in each of these areas and are encouraged by our progress. In terms of shipped market share, based on our current outlook for 2013 WFE spend and the associated customer mix, we stand to gain a couple of points in Etch this year. We successfully won application decisions in logic and DRAM and expect to benefit from additional patterning steps in both foundry and DRAM. We've also defended above average in the initial 3D NAND's transition. In deposition, higher than expected equipment reuse has been headwind for shipped market share this year. However, we still expect to gain a point or so, supported by application wins in 3D NAND and through-silicon via copper fill. Looking ahead, we anticipate that our application wins combines with the message around SAM expansion is a great story for Lam deposition. In single-wafer clean, we anticipate shipped market share in the upper teens this year. We've successfully defended most, all our positions in the back-end-of-line this year and continue to focus on growth opportunities in front-end applications. We have started to ship our next-generation clean tool for evaluation with a leading customer and have focused on making these customer engagements successful. As we've shared in the past, we would expect to have a better understanding of the tool's performance in the first half of 2014, with the potential for early revenue towards the end of next calendar year. While it is still too soon to specifically quantify share growth projections for 2014, I'm encouraged by the solid progress we're making across each of our product segments and the level of customer engagement across a broader set of applications. We remain fully committed to our stated long-term share goals, our resolve against competitive threats, never stronger. As we have said on a number of occasions, this is a period of significant change for our customers and significant challenge within the wafer fabrication equipment industry. That fact is further illustrated by the recently announced plans to merge our 2 largest competitors. We believe the consolidation can be an opportunity to create value for our customers to the extent that it allows for the sustainable competition necessary to fuel innovation throughout the industry. As an example, our acquisitions of SEZ and Novellus Systems allowed us to leverage process adjacencies, but to stay committed to our mantra that the customer deserves the best-in-class technology and productivity solutions. That's the bases of competition today. We do have the opinion that it is possible for consolidation to reach a size and scope that goes beyond those value-creating fundamentals, and that conversation is active with our customers, real-time. We continue to believe customers remain invested in Lam's success and we will only strengthen our collaboration with them. It is very clear that our vision of being #1 in customer trust has never been more important, or valued, than in this environment. Prior to turning the call over to Doug for a review of the September quarter's financials, I'd like to share with you a celebratory event that occurred earlier this month. We renamed our Fremont campus, the James W. Bagley campus, in honor of Jim's many contributions to Lam Research across his 16-year tenure with the company. Among his accomplishments, Jim established Lam's mission, vision and core values, which reshaped our culture and continue to serve as the guiding principles for how all of our employees engage in business today. He also provided the inspiration and leadership to our decade-long etch segment leadership journey. I had the pleasure of working under Jim's leadership for many years and strongly believe the principles he established are the genesis of Lam's value-based culture and innovation spirit, which both differentiate the company competitively, I believe, and enable a rich and ongoing tradition of customer trust and collaboration going forward. With that, I would like to hand the call over to Doug for his prepared remarks. Douglas R. Bettinger: Thanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. In the September quarter, as Martin has already told you, we delivered record revenue for the second consecutive quarter, topping the billion-dollar mark, which was a first for Lam Research. We achieved gross margin performance at the high-end of our guidance range, with both operating margins and earnings per share exceeding our expectations. These results demonstrate what I believe are solid execution against our cost synergy objectives as well as our discipline in managing expenses. Shipments for the September quarter came in at $987 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range and down a little bit, sequentially. Our results were impacted, somewhat, by delays in shipments to certain memory customers, as well as a slight decline in spares levels, driven by lower overall utilization in the industry. Partially offsetting these declines were stronger-than-expected shipments to foundry customers. Specific to our systems business, excluding spares and services, the combined memory segment accounted for 48% of our system shipments versus 46% in June. NAND represented 28% of system shipments compared to 18% in June. DRAM was 19% of system shipments, with approximately 1% attributed to other memory shipments. On an absolute basis, memory shipments were slightly down for the June quarter. Foundry represented 36% of total system shipments and that compares with 43% in June, and the remaining 16% was comprised of logic and other shipments. And as I've noted earlier, we recorded more than $1 billion in revenue, which was in line with our expectations and was up 3% sequentially. September gross margin was 45% and at the high end of our guidance range. This represents a 50 basis point improvement from the June quarter, as we delivered margin performance, in line with our published models, a bit earlier than expected, reflecting a richer mix, as well as an acceleration of our factory and manufacturing efficiency plans. We were obviously pleased to see the benefits from the supply chain cost synergies that I've spoken about before. And as we've shared in the past, our margin performance is a function of business volumes as well as overall mix and we would expect to see fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter depending on those factors. Operating expenses declined to $292 million, or approximately 29% of revenues, and this compares with $297 million in the June quarter. The decline reflects the timing of certain R&D program activities which can be lumpy at times. Importantly I think, the activities necessary to complete our targeted annualized cost savings of $100 million are now largely complete, and we expect to realize the remaining savings as we exit the December quarter. Looking ahead, we will continue to seek operating efficiencies while investing in new technology and capabilities that are necessary to fuel our future growth. Let me now turn to operating income. The combination of higher gross margin and lower operating expenses resulted in operating income of $165 million and operating margin of 16.2%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Taxes for the quarter were approximately 12%, a little bit lower than we expected. For the fiscal year 2014, I'm now expecting a tax rate in the low teens for the year. Our expectation for the December quarter was for a tax rate in the high-single to low-double digits. Can I just point out you, that if the federal R&D tax credit were extended prior to our fiscal year end, which is in June, the annual rate would be reduced by a couple of percentage points. Based on a share count of approximately 171 million shares, earnings per share for the September quarter totaled $0.81, and that was up $0.01 from the June quarter and it exceeded our guided range. Can I just point out to you, the dilutive impact from our 2041 convertible notes was 5.6 million shares based on an average quarterly share price of $48.83. And as planned, we began executing against our $250 million share repurchase authorization during the September quarter. We spent $96 million and took delivery of approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock. We plan to complete this authorization by the end of calendar year 2014. We ended the quarter with gross cash, short-term investments, including our restricted cash, of $2.6 billion, and that compares with $2.7 billion in the June quarter. Of this cash, roughly 25% was onshore and the remaining 75% was offshore. We had deferred revenue of $334 million, and this excludes approximately $84 million in shipments to Japanese customers that will revenue in future quarters. Those Japanese shipments remained as inventory on our balance sheet. DSO increased to 64 days, as shipments for the quarter were more back-end loaded than last quarter, something we expect to see recur in the December quarter. And I point out to you that many receivables are paid on the last day of the calendar month, which, last quarter, was 1 day after our September 29 fiscal quarter end. Had those end-of-month payments been received in the quarter, our DSO performance would have improved by several days. Inventory turns were 3.8 and that's down from 4.1 in the June quarter, as we increased on-hand inventory to support our growing December quarter outlook. Cash from operations was $52 million, and that's down from $175 million in the June quarter. Operational cash was depressed this quarter, primarily due to the receivable growth and inventory build activities that I just mentioned. Calendar year-to-date, distributed [ph] cash flows from operations are comparable to operating income, as a percentage of revenue, and this would be a valid planning assumption for the December quarter as well. Company noncash expenses include, among other items, $23 million for equity comp, $42 million for amortization and $32 million for depreciation. We incurred $24 million for capital expenditures in the quarter. And finally, we exited the quarter with approximately 6,500 regular full-time employees. So let me now turn to our guidance for the December 2013 quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect shipments to be $1.125 billion, plus or minus $30 million. Revenue of $1.1 billion, plus or minus $30 million. Gross margin at 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating margin of 18.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And earnings per share of $1.02, plus or minus $0.05, based on a share count of approximately 174 million shares. So let me just briefly summarize. Overall, we were very pleased with our solid execution in the September quarter. Our September performance, as well as our December quarter outlook, reflect, what I believe, reflect our achievement against our near-term financial models and demonstrate our focus on delivering against our long-term business objectives. As we've shared many times, there are always puts and takes within any given quarter. Looking into 2014, we remain focused on achieving our published models and still view them as the best proxy for modeling our financial performance. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I have a quick one. Martin, have you seen any impact in the December quarter from the recent Hynix file? And if so, how much of that is added to your shipment forecast for December? Martin B. Anstice: Krish, I think that it's fair to say that, as a company, to the extent there's an impact that's reflected in our guidance and, indeed, there are some systems that are included in our shipments forecast, but we're not going to specifically disclose that number with you, with respect to our customer. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : All right. So could I just have a quick follow-up. Martin, you highlighted how 3D NAND is going to be much more expensive. Is there any way you can quantify, from an industry standpoint, going from planar to 3D, how much more it would cost per 10,000 wafers for the industry, if the planar was around $400 million or something, how much would it be for 3D NAND? Martin B. Anstice: I've come to appreciate, maybe I'm getting old, maybe I'm getting wise, but the best person to answer that question is the customer. Inevitably, Krish, we've got a very comprehensive understanding of the segments that we participate in, which is why the disclosure in my prepared comments biased etch and depositions segments. Whatever happens in clean is the byproduct of the yield experienced through pilot lines in the early phase of production. But we consider the opportunity in etch and deposition to be significant. We've ranged that historically in the 30% to 50% range, incremental, compared to planar baseline, and we've provided more commentary here today. I think the $25 million reference point per 10,000 wafer starts, we believe, is a significant component of the cost increase, and I think, I read in the ASML transcript that they stated LIFO intensity, in 3D, equivalent to planar. So I think you can probably connect some dots and figure that one out yourself. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Martin, the question I have, you touched upon the consolidation happening in the industry and you talked about that it can reach a point where it's not very productive. If you can elaborate on that, and also, if you can include if you have seen a reaction from your customers on how they are viewing the consolidation in the industry, and will that change your view in going after the next acquisitions? Martin B. Anstice: I think, the -- just to kind of state the obvious, there is, inevitably, a review process associated with every deal. And so, there is a limit to the disclosure that I can make. And certainly, I don't intend to encroach on the disclosure that our customers might make. But the headline that I conveyed in my prepared comments, I think, is an important one. We do believe that size and scope can risk value-creation and, frankly, our voice in this process is a very small one, and it's not the important one. The voice, that's the important one, is the voice from the customer and the voice for the regulator. Relative to our approach to acquisition and collaboration, I would say, nothing has changed. We believe that we have a very clear vision today, to be a leader in the etch and deposition and clean markets, and to the extent that we execute any deals or collaborations or partnerships or licenses, according to the definition of today's strategy, that frames around accelerating our growth in those markets against stated plans. And the primary definition of success that I always hold us accountable to, is the value creation for the customer. And if you can articulate that, not just as a company, but as an industry, and I think the values of our company causes to do that really well because we all think and process and make decisions oriented to customer, company and then, individual, then I think you make the right decision in the end. So I think you have to talk directly with customers, at this point, to get a sense of what their opinion is. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just a quick question on operating margin, Doug. Can you describe, you have a significant upside in gross margin and operating margin for the September, as well as December quarter. Are these a permanent impact or do you have some moving parts, or lumpiness, which goes away in the March quarter? So just, if you can separate the permanent facts and some timing-related items on the gross margin and operating margin, that will be helpful. Douglas R. Bettinger: Sure, Mahesh. Happy to do it. I think and I tried, actually, to stick in my prepared remarks a couple of different times, that was financial models that we put out are still the best planning or working assumptions, in terms of managing and modeling our financial performance. So we're thinking about those things when we make decisions here and you should think about those models when you put your numbers together, so that's my first guidance. Within gross margin, there's always puts and takes, ups and downs, mix of different tool types matters. How hard running a factory matters, the types of think going on in the factory can impact utilization and things like that, so that's important to understand. There's puts and takes, always. And as I explained, with our spending in this quarter, oftentimes, you can get spending profiles that can be lumpy, there can be big programs that happen in 1 quarter or push from 1 quarter to the next. The total spending, across multiple quarters, probably doesn't change but within any given quarter, there can be ups and downs. And you saw that, a little bit, sequentially, in September. And when you go do the math on the December quarter, you see we get back to a spending level that is kind of more in line with the previous quarter, so there's always ups and downs. To run your models, please think about those financial models that we put out in the past. Operator : Next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowan and Company. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : A couple of questions. I guess, first, Martin, just a follow-up on the questions around the Applied/TEL deal. I mean, it sounds like, at least one big customer is definitely not very happy about it, and I'm wondering if you've seen any near-term changes in the share dynamic, i.e., have you seen any share come your way, as customers try to maybe plan around this, if it actually happens? Martin B. Anstice: The best way I can answer that question, Tim, is somewhat similar in my prepared comments. I believe that our customers are invested in our success, and I believe they understand and appreciate the value of the stated objectives for the company. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, all right. Maybe let me ask a question then, on earnings guidance. And I think I asked you the same question, last quarter. But you've beaten -- the last 6 quarters, you've beaten, by about an average of a dime, on the earnings line. So I'm wondering, have you sort of changed the way you guide or are you still guiding to what -- at least the last 6 quarters has been a fairly conservative view, and I'm just sort of wondering how to handicap that, because now you've pretty consistently begun to beat by about $0.10 per quarter. Martin B. Anstice: Thank you for asking the questions, Tim, I'm glad you did. And I'll repeat, somewhat, the answer I gave you last time we talked about this. One of the things, I hope, everybody appreciates is the complexity associated with bringing 2 companies together. I mean, at the high level, there are integration challenges, there are product portfolio challenges, there are business process integrations, SAP systems and there is getting to know the financial performance of the company. And in every respect, we've gone through a tremendous learning curve in the last 12 to 18 months, and that includes, relative to financial performance, our guidance for the last 15, 18 months, and our guidance today is defined, in exactly the same way it has been in every year of the 13 years that I've been in Lam Research, it's our best view of our performance. And the fact that we've beaten this is sometimes the byproduct of we're kind of getting to know the company and learning how its inflows are influenced in the short term. Some part of it is, we've had changes of behavior from customers and we've had positive surprises that we've been out to exploit, competitively. And the headline that Doug conveyed, right at the end, I think, is a very important one. There is a reason why we have the long-term models of the company, they're intended to be the best commentary we can give you on financial statements and what I would not want to happen is for everybody to go, \"Oh. Every time they've beaten for the last 6. Therefore, we're going to add that $0.10 to every forward-looking guidance, because that would be inconsistent with the message that we're trying to communicate. But we're doing our very best to communicate through the eyes of management, sometimes we get positive surprises, sometimes we're more effective managing the company than we originally anticipated. But the guidance and the framework of long-term models is the very best commentary we can give you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Martin, if I could ask you to kind of characterize the dynamics of around memory spending, first, I guess, there was the comment that's some memory spending slipped out a little bit. But then based on their memory shipments, slipped out a little bit. But based on the guidance, I assuming that just slipped into the fourth quarter. So first, if can you confirm that? And then, secondly, is this a dynamic where the writing capacity exactly as they need it? Is it a dynamic that the writing capacity based on the technology transitions? Or is it a situation where one customer is kind of looking around and, seeing another customer, a competitor of theirs is adding capacity in a tight environment, and then wants to add their own capacity, so they don't lose share? Martin B. Anstice: First question is easier than the last one. I do think that, in general, it was a very slight push from September quarter to December quarter. So your hypothesis was correct there. I think there are a couple of things that DRAM and NAND have in common and there are some things that are slightly different. So in common, I think, is the discipline of our customers relative to spending. I'm not seeing any evidence of extravagant spending behavior, almost any time a customer talks to me, or us, about market share, they're incorporating the word profitable market share into the conversation. So I think the awareness and sensitivity to the value of discipline is now well-established in the industry, and I have no expectation of that changing anytime soon. The DRAM story, obviously, there was some short-term disruption in supply chain that caused some pluses and minuses in the short term. And the principal spending outlook is oriented to upgrading capacity to the most leading-edge device. And I think the pace of the customers willingness to do that is defined around their profitability levels and their outlook for the industry. And as you know, a 3D NAND, it's a little bit more complex because you have a very fundamental device transition. And you have 4 customers that will talk about it, but their timeline for adoption by public disclosure today are significantly varied. And I frankly don't know any better than you do, whether the second, third and fourth customers accelerate plans, or keep plans as currently stated, based on the performance of the guy that's going first. So I think we are going to have a big learning experience in the first half of next year, not least for the customer that is going first. They're going to learn and impact in the marketplace. They're going to learn yield in a production environment, and that will contribute to answering your question. It's a really big question and one that is tough to answer right now. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : If I'm allowed one, on top of that, it would just be, the bear case on Wall Street around companies are all around the 3D NAND transition. People say 3D NAND doesn't work. It's not going to work. We're not going to see all the memory spending that you, Jim, or some of the other companies think we're going to see. What do you say when people say that, to you? Martin B. Anstice: Well, not so many people say that to me, but if they did say it to me, I would say, \"Our customers that are articulating transitions are pretty smart people. They are convicted, and when they have established plans, previously, and in the transitions in the industry, they've kind of -- they can execute it in the way they thought they would. As I said, in the last call, until I have evidence to the contrary, I'm going to believe the statements from our customers. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Martin, always appreciative of your willingness to kind of give us macro actual numbers. I'm kind of curious, when you look to the $32 billion in WFE next year, can you give us some broad ranges of how you think that plays out between memory, logic and foundry? Just a sense of how you're thinking about those 3 buckets relative to that $32 billion WFE number? Martin B. Anstice: Yes, I'm happy to do that, John. I would kind of just ask that you allow me the flexibility of kind of, slightly, a broader percentage range on these numbers because it is really early to be having a segment based conversation. But based on our understanding today, we would tend to presume that the single largest investment segment, next year, is foundry and a $13 billion to $14 billion range is probably a reasonable placeholder. The next biggest is memory, and we would see memory in the $12 billion to $13 billion range. And I think DRAM and flash are probably as close to 50-50 as they've been for a while since the dollars of invested capital and the balance is microprocessor, logic and other for us. So that $6 billion or so there. But there's a $4 billion range on the overall number I gave you. So please, remember that, as you think through the answer I've just given you. John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : That's very helpful. And then on -- Just to drill down on the foundry section. I think you've talked a little bit this year about 20-nanometer, you kind of given ranges between 30,000 and 50,000 wafer starts of investment, and I think, last quarter, you said the low end of that, one, has that changed. And as you think about foundry growth next year, how important is the 20-nanometer buildout? And does your number need FinFET build next year to get hit? Martin B. Anstice: A certainly think there's traction on the FinFET 14, 16 node. I believe, every customer is publicly articulating some plans and I believe in the most recent CS&C earnings release that would say a specific statement on their timing. We have 2/3 and 1/3 is the relationship we're assuming right now, in terms of 20-nanometer capacity expansion next year versus the 14, 16 kind of a pilot and early phase production investments. And again, we got plenty of time to learn whether that's reasonable or not, and adjust it. I would say, as I said previously, for an equipment company, there's not a huge difference between the 20-nanometer spend and a 14, 16 spend. In fact, I think I saw a communications from customer in the last month that said, they have about a 95% equipment overlap between the final planar and first FinFET. And we've never been quite so precise in our quantification, but when the customer is articulating that and when, as I said, previously, when they visit with us, they've almost don't distinguish between the 20-nanometer ramp and the 14, 16. Hopefully, that is -- that's helpful perspective as well. Operator : The next question is from the line with the Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just a follow-up on the WFE view in 2014, Martin. Just wanted to see if you could share any early thoughts on how you're planning to manage the company and perhaps the first half of calendar 2014? Are you kind of managing, maybe for first half shipments, to stay at similar levels that we saw here in the second half, the calendar 2013? Or maybe something different? Martin B. Anstice: I'm presuming you're not prepared to accept the answer, \"I plan to manage the company well.\" But I think, relative to shipments, for example, our job and the philosophy of their running this company is, \"We're going to ship to customers, when they need it. We're going to take orders off the street, when they're available to take off the street.\" As I think about running the company, there is a very clear commentary of discipline today, and I think that's probably an industry statement, but it's, for sure, a company statement. We take a lot of responsibility for the investment choices we're making. We are invested in the long-term success of the company, but we recognize that being responsible, supplementing the investment profile of the company, is really critical, and the best we can articulate, at a high level, is the financial model that Doug presented some time back for '13, '14 year and 15, 16 period. So that's really the framework for answering the question. We're not planning to go crazy spending more money next year. I suspect our customers are going to put lots of pressure on us, relative to the price of what we sell and, I suspect, the competitive dynamic will be as intense as ever. And I hope that the performance of the company, in the last 12 to 15 months, gives you some level of confidence that we are able to manage that. And certainly, that's the basis of our forecast ongoing. But I don't sit here and try to plan linear -- linearizing the calendar year. I would like us to take orders when they're available, ship when customers need it, get at revenues and qualify it as production capacity as fast as possible and collect cash. And then, start all over. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And maybe just a quick follow-up question on the December shipment guidance, can you share any color on how you think that'll split across, I guess, memory, foundry, logic? Douglas R. Bettinger: Yes, I mean, Steve, we talked about $1.125 billion. Within that, I think memory is probably up a little bit. I think, we're seeing reuse in the logic space, so it's likely that, that's down a bit. Foundry, maybe a push to slightly up. I think you're going to see some spending in 20 and maybe some of the legacy stuff nodes behind that, down slightly. And then, spares. We do ship spares, which we don't talk all that much about. But that is driven by utilization, at times, and I think you probably know, utilization in the industry is down a little bit, so we're probably shipping a fewer spares next quarter. Operator : Next question is from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : On the last call, you mentioned push outs by some foundry suppliers to make the move to 20 nanometers. What are you seeing in your pipeline from those customers? Are they potentially pulling the trigger this quarter? Or are they stepping up the transition to 20 nanometers, in maybe more like first half of '14? Do you have visibility into when these customers are going to transition? Martin B. Anstice: Actually, Harlan, I don't think that the story is much different today than it was 3 months ago. I mean, at least, qualitative, I described the fact, last call that, having originally anticipated 2 customers investing at 20 in a significant way, we were seeing evidence that it might be one and, in fact, the quantified reset of WFE is made on that basis today, with our narrowed range. And there's a big debate and I don't know the answer to the debate at this point. Again, it is not so impactful to us. Is it a 20? Or are they skipping to go to 16, 14?I will tell you that the FinFET transition is a very tough one. It has a lot of complexity to it, in terms of technology transition and has a lot of complexity in terms of yielding, and it isn't going to be easy. But we have very capable customers around the world and, I believe, that they believe there are performance [ph] benefits in the end-device and cost benefits in terms of their business. And so, my presumption is, if the fabless community is on the same page, everybody's going to want to get there as fast as possible. But for an equipment company, we may be the last to know because it isn't so important. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes. Makes a lot of sense. When we think about the complexities of next-generation manufacturing technology as we typically tend to think of things like higher selectivity, some thickness uniformity, et cetera, but we were just talking with a large memory supplier the other day, and they were pretty frustrated about the significant increase in manufacturing cycle times with some of these next-generation technology migrations, especially in NAND and DRAM. I think they were talking about something like a 40% increase in process steps and 30% increase on average cycle times to the fabs. So as Lam competes for PTOR on some of these new process modules, how much of the decision centers more around connectivity, i.e., cycle time? And is this a major differentiator for you on some of your next-generation tools and etch step in clean Douglas R. Bettinger: That is a really good question. I would say, as a general theme, and it's one of the reasons that the mission statement of the company doesn't just say, \"We want to be an innovator of technology.\" It says we want to be an innovator of technology and productivity solutions. I mean, the economics, for everybody, is such that we kind of deliver more to the customer around the productivity for many reasons, including the ones that you cited. That would be my general answer. At a specific level, particularly, when you get very significant changes in the definition of SAM and the most obvious example is deposition in 3D NAND. Productivity is a huge play. It isn't the only play, because there's a lot of complexity to the deposition process, high aspect ratio, reentering profiles, a lot of complexity there, in metals and in dielectric. But one of the themes of the deposition business of Lam Research is a multi-sequential station deposition architecture. And so, I believe, we have the most competitive offering in terms of productivity throughput solution sets and also clean room density, which is hugely relevant to the costs and the issues that you're describing. So I believe you're right. And I believe that the product and technology roadmap of Lam Research is structured to contribute the most value to the customer and to reinforce the legitimacy of the share gains we're pursuing. Operator : The next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicholas. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Martin, first, in terms of the discussion you had about the 3D NAND and the increasing SAM, related to both etch and deposition, specifically on the etch side, given your current positions in silicon and dielectric, where do you see the biggest incremental opportunities as this industry transition is being made? Martin B. Anstice: Where do I see the biggest opportunity in etch? Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : In etch, yes, between silicon and dielectric. Martin B. Anstice: I would say the bigger opportunity is in dielectric. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay. Then maybe... Martin B. Anstice: I mean, but they're both -- obviously, they're both very important, not just in terms of growth, but they're both are important it in terms of defense. So they're getting a lot of our attention, but the biggest opportunity gain is, I would say, is in dielectric. And the success, frankly, that I would describe, the planar NAND share for the company is significantly above our average, kind of going into this transition. So that's a really fabulous result for the company, if it's exactly the same, and if it's better, that takes very good to very, very good, I guess. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay, now that's helpful. Maybe for Doug, on the OpEx side of things. You guys did really good job this quarter and you did mention that there is some R&D timing issues related to when projects are. Just on a going forward basis, now that you've completed the integrations with Novellus, what are some of the other levels that you can play around with, in terms of the OpEx line, as you go forward? Douglas R. Bettinger: Patrick, there's always tons of opportunities to do things more efficiently and better. And in the technology industry, you have to do that every year, and we will be doing that as we get into the next calendar year. In terms of thinking about it, Patrick, I'd encourage you to go back those financial models that I referred to. We've kind of got a certain level of spending baked into those models and that really is how we're thinking about -- running and managing the company is making sure we achieve and attain those models that we've committed to you guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : On the foundry segment, when you talk about 2014 expectation, do you see any kind of seasonality and foundry spending next year? Or do you think that this year -- next year is going to be different, given that only one customer is having 20 nanometer, and given a piece of technology [indiscernible]. And I have a follow-up. Martin B. Anstice: I think I gave my best shot at answering that already. I -- clearly, there is one customer that, at least today, is leading the investments and the public commentary from them supports that. And clearly, there are a number of companies invested in creating an opportunity for competitive advantage with the FinFET transition. So maybe that's the slightly different story. But all things being equal, we would say, at this point, that the 20 nanometer is reasonably concentrated but broadening a little. And the 14 and the 16 FinFETs node is very early, obviously, and I think the foundry community wants to be -- everyone of them wants to be there first, for fairly intuitive reasons. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And just of the foundry shipments, what percentage of your shipments would be to the 28? Or excluding the 20 nanometers, what percentage of your shipments will be to some of the other customers? Martin B. Anstice: For next year? Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : For the fourth [ph] quarter. Martin B. Anstice: I'm not sure. I don't have that to hand, unfortunately. I can't give you that right now. Douglas R. Bettinger: Yes. We typically don't break it at that level of detail, Vishal. Carol Raeburn : Operator, we have time for 2 more questions, I think. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : First question, on foundry shipment. Do guys see any pull within -- you mentioned shipments would be higher in the September quarter, and it's sounds like December, it remains strong. Any risk that business is going pulled in from the first half of '14 into the second half of this year? Martin B. Anstice: I guess, the only honest answer to that question is, there's always risk, but we don't see it today. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : I see. Okay, that's fair. And then, maybe moving on to 3D NAND. You mentioned you're beyond the one large customer that -- obviously, if you a NAND customer who was working towards that and you're targeting a similar option in those customer, have any -- when we listen to this customer, they talk about 3D NAND being, frankly, some of them talk about 2 years out, right? Martin B. Anstice: Yes. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : How realistic are those opportunities being a 2014 opportunity? Or are lot of that still quite far out? And in terms of customer decision, are they getting close to making a decision? Because typically, they have to make the decision ahead of time, right? Are they close to a decision for equipment choice or are they still pretty far along? Martin B. Anstice: I think, it varies enormously by customer. And it's one of the things we talked about in the analyst meeting and, again, in the last call. There are timelines of PTOR decisions and they range by, probably a year, from first customer to last customer, and there are PTOR decisions for customers that range, I think, 2 years, probably. And so, whether it's resting on our laurels or not, we've got to manage the risk that when we think we've won, that we can protect that win, all the way through the adoption. And when we haven't won, that we can turn it around for a production buy. So I would say, generally, the 3D NAND environment is still, significantly, in flux. Certainly, when it comes to high-volume manufacturing, and that will probably be true for a reasonable period of time in calendar '14. Operator : It's your final question. It's from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a very quick single question. I, obviously -- commented on EUV push outs. I want to understand your perspective of what's going on there, and whether you're seeing any feedback from customers, specifically, with regard to roadmaps that used to be EUV versus traditional multi-patterning? Martin B. Anstice: Well, it's a question I always ask the customer, and I have a sense that the answer that they give me is very similar to the answer that they'd probably give you. So I don't to have too much to add. Obviously, it shows up for us, in a tangible way, around patterning opportunities. And I would say, today, the recent disclosures we would only see as a positive, relative to an opportunity for Lam Research, principally in etch, but also, to some extent, in deposition. And I don't see downside to the SAM as we know it today, or the increased patents that we shared with you in our recent 2 analyst meetings. So for me, our job is to support the needs of the customer, and where they don't have any real alternative to patterning, they're going to look to us. And our job is to do that as economically as we can. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Martin, you said you don't see downside to multi-patterning. Do you see upsides based on recent developments? Martin B. Anstice: I guess, I can always be hopeful of that, and the reason I'm, perhaps, I'm hesitant is because, if I do, there are upsides that would show up a couple of years from now, right? When you've kind of gone beyond double and you're into quadruple and I even saw a presentation with octuple, the other day. Now whether that ever plays out, that's a number of years away and a lot can change on an EUV roadmap or a customer's device architecture between now and then. So we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Operator : And that's all the time that we have for Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Martin B. Anstice: I like to say thank you, all, again, for your continued interest in the company. As you likely can extract from our discussion today, we're very pleased at the continued progress against our mission and vision objectives. We remain excited about our future opportunities and customer partnerships. Based on our current understanding, we expect an expanding WFE market through 2014, and believe that Lam is nicely positioned in the areas of technology transition. The legacy strength of the company bodes well for the generally anticipated memory investment expansion. The new products across each of our businesses continue to strengthen our competitiveness, and the culture and values of our new company are firmly established. We believe that action speaks louder than words and hope the demonstration of financial performance reported today, that's consistent with our model, is recognized generally as validating our vision and our strategies and execution capability broadly. Thank you, again. We look forward to meeting with key shareholders in the coming quarter to discuss these themes more. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We'd like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Lam Research Corporation December 2013 Quarterly Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Shanye Hudson, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Shanye Hudson : Thank you, Katia. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the December 2013 quarter and our outlook for the March 2014 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed over the wire services shortly after 1 :00 p.m. this afternoon and can also be found in the Investor Relations section of the company's website, along with the presentation slides accompanying today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A will include statements about our expectations and beliefs regarding certain future outcomes and including our guidance.

All statements made that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements based on current information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. We encourage you to review the risk factors in our disclosures and public filings, including our 10-K and 10-Qs. The company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 p.m. Pacific time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. So with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Martin. Martin B. Anstice: Thank you, Shanye, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll start by sharing the highlights of 2013 company performance and then discuss our outlook for 2014, which provides our perspective on Lam's opportunities and areas of focus over the next 12 months. Doug will then follow with our financial results and guidance commentary before turning the call to Q&A. 2013 was an extraordinary year for Lam Research that establishes a platform for our future and unifies more than 6,500 global employees around the achievements of an exciting vision. We achieved nearly $4 billion of revenues and delivered in excess of our targeted gross margins for the 2013, 2014 timeframe of approximately 45%, representing an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. We grew operating profit dollars twice as fast as revenues, illustrating our ongoing focus on strong operational execution and profitable growth. We delivered on time our committed synergy targets, with $100 million in annualized cost savings and approximately $130 million in revenues, both achieved with strong collaboration and ownership across the company. Accelerated by our reenergized commitment to installed base performance, we closed the largest service contract in the company's history, tailored to support a broad range of customer-specific needs. And we defended our positions or gained market share in all of our business units through a period of evermore challenging customer requirements and competitive intensity. Combined, our performance in 2013 enabled us to outpace industry growth by a healthy margin, with system shipments up about 10% year-over-year for Lam and Novellus combined, compared with wafer fabrication equipment spending up around 3% to approximately $29 billion. This 2013 performance demonstrates solid execution against our near term financial models, at a pace that we consider slightly ahead of schedule. As we move into 2014, we're continuing to aggressively pursue opportunities to drive further efficiencies in support of our growth objectives. We continue to position next-generation products targeting increased competitive differentiation and lower cost, both critical for the achievements of next level profit performance defined by our 2015, 2016 financial model. We kicked off a multi-year plan to consolidate our real estate footprints, which we expect will drive incremental operating improvements. These plans also serve to increase the efficiency of our R&D activities and further promote collaboration across the organization, a key differentiator leveraging our culture and core value of customer, company and the individual. We also established comprehensive 3-year plans across our integrated manufacturing and supply chain, which are based on an in-depth assessment of performance over the past 18 months. Our plans are built on our sustained commitments to pilot line and high-volume manufacturing strategic locations and strategic partnerships, outsourcing and localization. We target cost, quality and service benefits through these plans, which serve to increase our focus and strengthen competitive differentiation going forward. In summary, through performance that meets or exceeds commitments made and the establishment of plans for execution for our future vision, 2013 was an extraordinary year and one which we hope serves to continue to compel our full stakeholder community, our shareholders, our customers, our suppliers and last, but not the least, our employees to invest in Lam for the long-term. With our guidance and commentary today, we believe that we are off to a great start this year, and look forward to discussing more with you in the months ahead. Our growth outlook for 2014 is enabled by our customer transition to next-generation logic and memory devices that make the much-anticipated inflections tangible and expanding opportunities for the company as customer adoption broadens through 2015. We continue to forecast 2014 WFE spending of $32 billion, plus or minus $2 billion, with an incrementally broader participation of customers assumed relative to 2013. More than ever, the landscape of this year's investment pattern is influenced by the timing of inflection-specific activities. Although overall, we expect a reasonably balanced year, first half compared to second half, we do see variability quarter-to-quarter, resulting from the influence of a consolidated customer base and remaining uncertainty around the ultimate scope and timing of spending at the 4 inflections : FinFET, 3D NAND, patterning and packaging. In the foundry segments, we saw the pace of 20-nanometer investments accelerate at the end of 2013, signaling a robust commitment in the demand for devices using 20-nanometer technology. As of today, spending is more heavily concentrated between a couple of customers, with capacity additions and conversion activities plans, primarily for the first half of this year. In the recent period, the foundry space has arguably grown more competitive, with new entrants challenging the delineation of traditional pure-play foundries and logic manufacturers. For foundries, the race to develop FinFET devices has led to multiple pilot line projects starting in the first half of this year. We expect those investments to continue through the year with total capacity additions dependent on end-user demand and the pace at which production ramps yield. Taken together, our prior forecast for foundry spending between $13 billion and $14 billion, still seems reasonable for 2014. Similarly, we maintained our forecast for microprocessor and other logic spending of around $6 billion or relatively flat with 2013 levels. Continuing the 2013 theme embedded in our forecast is the expectation that significant leading-edge logic production capacity can be satisfied through equipment reuse and capacity conversions. Looking at the memory markets, we continue to see stable pricing conditions and tight supply entering 2014, with customers who continue to exhibit due rigor in evaluating their capital spending decisions. DRAM manufacturers are accelerating transitions to the mid-2x technology nodes and their broader participation of customers are entering 20-nanometer pilot production. We forecast this supply growth in the low 30% range, led by mobile device demand, and this is accomplished largely through equipment upgrade, albeit, with capital intensity higher than prior generations. In the NAND segments, remaining planar capacity additions seem clear and the initial 3D NAND production ramp is progressing largely in accordance with our expectations. Over time, as the 3D devices move to structures with more layers, our customers appear to anticipate cost and performance benefits that support a broad industry conversion, which underpins their plans this year. We currently project between 80,000 and 100,000 wafer starts of 3D NAND shipped capacity will be installed by the end of calendar 2014. In addition, in recent weeks, 2014 planar NAND investment plans to transition the 16-nanometer devices have solidified for more than one customer. Overall, we still expect supply bit growth to be in the low 40% range. On a combined basis, we forecast memory spending will increase by 10% to 20% year-over-year, with wafer fab spends between $12 billion and $13 billion, representing an increasing proportion of WFE year-over-year at approximately 40% of the total. Adding this all together, our outlook for 2014 wafer fabrication equipment spending, with a midpoint of $32 billion, would represent the fifth consecutive year with relatively healthy and disciplined equipment spending. It's always important to note that visibility beyond this quarter and especially into the second half is clearly more limited than the near term. Where we ultimately end up in our WFE range will largely depend on production readiness and market acceptance of the technology inflections just highlighted. In this positive industry environment, which for Lam, is supplemented by inflection-led addressable market-size expansion and target market share growth, I'm very encouraged by our industry outperform opportunity. With the transition to 3D NAND, we've gained strong production tool decisions, maintaining our lead in etch while driving significant gains in deposition. Our pipeline of new products were key to our success, including our next-generation dielectric etch module, our new highly productive dielectric deposition platform and our differentiated tungsten CVD system. We are well-positioned with each of the 3D NAND pilot lines, we believe, and are focused on achieving, at a minimum, the same degree of success as production tool decisions are finalized. We believe that we have additional opportunities to gain applications through the transition to second and third-generation 3D NAND devices, where the increased number of alternating films also proliferates the complexity of the etch and deposition processes. We're actively engaged with the customers to address those challenges. In the area of multi-patterning, our conductor etch business is benefiting from the increased number of multi-packing steps required with the transition to smaller device geometries. Although device dependent, we see emerging evidence of slightly more than our early estimates of 8 to 10 new multi-packing steps in a 20-nanometer logic device for foundries, compared to a 28-nanometer baseline and the 12 to 13 steps for 16- to 40-nanometer devices. In DRAM, the number of multi-patterning steps more than doubles with the transition to 20-nanometer going from 3 or 4 in a mid-2x device to between 8 and 10 at 20-nanometer, with the same evidence of upsize on number of passes. You should expect more specificity from Lam on this in the coming quarters. This transition also presents growth opportunities for our deposition business. Many of the spacer-based, multi-patterning deposition steps can be done with batch variances [ph] today. However, customers are evaluating or starting to transition these steps to single wafer atomic layer deposition, or ALD tools, as the film conformality and uniformity requirements increased. We're engaged with multiple memory manufacturers with their offside ALD tool and, based on the feedback received so far, believe with continued hard work we are well-positioned for production tool decisions expected this year. In logic, we often talk about the transition to FinFET structures and the complexity around the transistor. However, the complexity in the back-end is growing at a rapidly accelerating pace also. As transistor densities in these devices increase, the wiring schemes required to connect these transistors become more and more complicated. Starting around the 32-nanometer node, customers introduced a metal hard mask x scheme for a couple of wiring layers. The number of layers has grown with each successive node and Lam stands to benefit as the clear market leader for this application. To maintain device reliability and performance, customers began adopting film treatments and other processes that play into a few of Lam's strengths. Our solar, ultraviolet thermal processing tool is the market leader used to improve the integrity of ultra low k films, predominately for leading edge logic devices. The number of layers required in UV cure of low k dielectric films is also increasing with each successive node; again, a positive opportunity for Lam. With thinner and more closely packed films, reliability of top lines is becoming more of a challenge. Lam has developed a unique film pretreatment module which enhances reliability and reduces resistance, a factor in device speed. Our solution was recently selected for next-generation logic devices and we expect to ship production tools through this year. In single-wafer clean, we will have shipped our third next-generation spin clean system as planned in the next couple of weeks. These tools are being installed at leading memory and logic device manufacturers and are being evaluated for a broad range of applications, including front-end-of-line. It's still early, but the initial progress and process data we have received is in line with expectations and the intensity of managing yields to a higher definition access for our customers, clearly very relevant for evaluating that opportunity. We would expect to have broader reliability and process data towards the middle of the June quarter to begin making assessments on how the tools are performing relative to our customers' requirements and our competition in the second half. As we embark on 2014 and beyond, we believe the opportunities available to Lam Research are significant. We're focused on exploiting those opportunities to their fullest by continuing to strengthen our competitiveness. We're increasing the magnitude of new product releases and customer engagements, particularly in the areas of dielectric etch, atomic layer of deposition and single-wafer clean. We're starting to execute newly developed operational plans to drive efficiencies across many aspects of the business, targeted at achieving our 2015, '16 performance ambition. We're reducing our emphasis -- sorry, we're reinforcing our emphasis on customer trust, broader collaboration and strategic relevance to our customer in light of semi equipment consolidation trends. Today, we are very focused on achieving our long-term growth objectives, competing as one integrated company. We have tremendous strength in the capability and commitments of the whole Lam Research team and I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every employee for their contributions last year, and wish them success in pursuit of our 2014 vision, a year where, at the $32 billion WFE level, we anticipate increasing our operating income over 2013 at twice the rates of our revenue growth; further, growing cash from operations year-over-year at twice the rates of operating income. With that, I will turn the call over to Doug to discuss December quarter financial results in more detail and provide our guidance for the March 2014 quarter. Douglas R. Bettinger: Okay. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We finished calendar year 2013 on what I believe is a very strong note. Shipments for the December quarter reached an all time high. We achieved record revenues for a third consecutive quarter. We grew operating profit more than 2x as fast as revenue, and we delivered earnings per share above our expectations. This financial performance comes partly as a result of us delivering on the promise of bringing Lam and Novellus together. Let me now provide a little more detail of our December quarter. Shipments increased by 15% sequentially to $1,139,000,000 which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with our expectations, we saw strong growth in memory shipments, as well as a sustained level of foundry spending. The combined memory segment represented 64% of total system shipments and this was up from 48% in September. NAND system shipments contributed 36% versus 28% in the prior quarter, and includes shipments to the first 3D NAND production facility. We saw a sizable increase in DRAM shipments, which represented 28% of system shipments, which was up from 19% in the September quarter. Foundry shipments were 28% of total system shipments, and this was down from 36% last quarter. On an absolute dollar basis however, foundry shipment system -- or foundry system shipments were relatively flat, supported by ongoing investments for the 20-nanometer node. The remaining 8% was made up of logic and other shipments. Revenue for the December quarter was $1,116,000,000. This also was slightly above the midpoint of our guided range and was 10% higher than in the September quarter. December gross margin percentage came in pretty much as we expected at 48.5%, which was stronger than our 2013, '14 financial models. This was an 80 basis point increase from the September quarter. We benefited from a favorable product mix during the quarter. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margin performance is impacted by many factors, including product mix, customer mix and overall business volumes. Increasingly, as we're running at close to full utilization, the impact of volume is less important than the product and customer mix changes. Nonetheless, we will see quarterly fluctuations in our gross margin performance depending on all of those variables. For the calendar year, our gross margin performance of approximately 45% was fairly consistent with our financial model, and we continue to point to our financial model as the best proxy for our financial performance, including the timing and WFE reference points. Operating expenses for the December quarter increased to $302 million, consistent with our expectations. On a percentage basis, our December quarter expenses were 27% of revenue, and this compares with 29% in the previous quarter. R&D as a percentage of total operating expenses was 58%. We continue to invest in next-generation products and technologies to strengthen our competitive position for the long-term success of the company. Operating income increased by 27% to $209 million in the December quarter and this compares with $165 million in the September quarter. Our resulting operating margin was 18.7%, pretty much as we expected, and I think shows the operating leverage in our financial model. Other income and expense came in with a positive impact of several million dollars relative to our original expectations. This was primarily due to a strong stock market in the quarter and its resulting impact on our deferred compensation investment portfolio. Our tax rate for the December quarter was approximately 9.3%, which was consistent with our planning assumptions. And I continue to expect the tax rate in the low to mid-teens will carry through the remainder of the 2014 fiscal year. Based on the share count of approximately 172 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter totaled $1.10. This result was better than forecast coming into the quarter. And I should point out the share count includes the dilutive impact from our 2041 convertible note of approximately 6.6 million shares, and that was based on an average quarterly share price of $52.52. And I'll just remind you that we include a schedule on our IR website that shows the impact of this note to help you in your planning. During the December quarter, we spent $40 million on the repurchase of approximately 760,000 shares of common stock with an average price of $52.20. At this point, we have completed more than half of our current $250 million authorization. This level of buyback will help us accomplish our objective of managing the dilution from our employee equity plans. I'd also just point out, we're well on track to complete this authorization in calendar 2014. Let me now take you through the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with gross cash and short-term investments, including our restricted cash of $2.7 billion and this compares with $2.6 billion in the September quarter. Our cash balances remain roughly 25% onshore and 75% offshore. We had deferred revenue of $405 million, which does not include the $54 million in shipments to Japanese customers, which will convert the revenue in future quarters. DSO for December was 74 days and this compares to 64 days in the September quarter. And as I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we expected shipments to be back-end loaded in the December quarter. Due to the timing of customer projects, this profile was somewhat more pronounced than we originally anticipated. Inventory turns came in at 3.8, and that's flat with the prior quarter. Cash from operations was $129 million or 12% of revenue. This was up from $52 million in the September quarter. Our operational cash generation was impacted by growth in accounts receivable. Over half of our quarterly shipments occurred in the month of December itself. This translated into less of our receivable balance being due before the end of the quarter. When business volumes are ramping as we are today, it's typical to see growth in working capital, and we did see that. Our current quarter outlook for the March quarter reflects a much more linear shipment profile and I expect operational cash flow to more closely approximate operating income next quarter. And I thought I'd just mention, I expect 2014 will be a very strong year for Lam Research's cash generation. Company noncash expenses include, among other items, $23 million for equity comp, $41 million for amortization and $33 million for depreciation. In the quarter, we incurred $38 million for capital expenditures and we exited the quarter with approximately 6,550 regular full-time employees. Let me now turn to our guidance for the March 2014 quarter. This is our non-GAAP guidance, I should point out. We expect shipments of $1,250,000,000, plus or minus $30 million, reflecting continued strength in the memory segment and ongoing investments for 20-nanometer foundry capacity. We expect revenue of $1,215,000,000, plus or minus $30 million. We currently expect higher customer concentration in the March quarter, with nearly 80% of our system-related sales derived from our top 3 customers, versus approximately 60% in the December quarter. We expect gross margin of 45%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. In the March quarter, we have a higher proportion of newly introduced etch and deposition products, which has a slightly negative impact on gross margin, while those products are in the early phase of their ramp. We forecast operating margins of 19.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $1.15, plus or minus $0.05, based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would now be pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great job on the quarterly execution. On the 3D NAND side, I think the team has mentioned previously, your views that it's predominantly one guy in the market this year. I know that at least 2 of your memory customers that have recently talked about some 3D NAND activity later this year or early next year. Just wondering if you're seeing this now in the product pipeline for the second half? Martin B. Anstice: Thanks for your comment at the introduction there, Harlan. The answer to your question is yes, we are. I expect, still, one customer to be the dominant kind of emerging out of pilots to production. And to the extent that other customers are investing in 3D NAND, which we do expect, there are pilots-oriented investments. But it is more than a one-customer assumption set that's embedded in our $32 billion, correct. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And then on your significant installed base, your services business, how do you expect the growth here relative to your overall businesses this year? Industry utilizations, I would think, are trending higher, and so what are -- and then on top of that, what are some of the specific initiatives both sort of top line and cost and expense front that the team is going to be focused on this year with respect to services? Martin B. Anstice: I think on the utilization front, kind of, time will tell. I mean, instinctively, I agree with the hypothesis of your question but it's not as if, with some rare exceptions, utilization levels are -- they're kind of not -- are kind of low there. They're pretty active. I mean, certainly in the memory space, that's a true statement and I think the technology nodes, given the flexibility the foundry community have, utilization pretty high there as well. But indeed, to the extent utilization goes up, that's one source of growth. Another source of growth is the installed base of the company. So there's a natural expansion of the growth consistent with the output of the company. And you can see evidenced by our actual performance and forecast, we've got some nice momentum on outputs of systems into the installed base and that bodes well for sustainable growth this year into next year. And as we talked about in our Analyst Meeting and a little bit in the last 2 earnings calls, the installed base business of the company, the spares, the service, the upgrade, the training, the refurbishments, are tremendous opportunities to contribute value to the customer and that being a core strength of the history of both companies. But I would say it is fair to characterize that we're reenergized around that today. And in the context of responding to complex challenges from our customers, to not just deliver technology but to deliver cost. That's an opportunity for us to strengthen partnerships with our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : A couple of things. Relative to WFE for 2014, we're sort of exiting December at this sort of $33 billion run rate as an industry. I'm not sure if you think that, that's the right number but that's what I calculate. So if the year is going to be sort of $32 billion, I think you're saying, and if the first half is going to be better, does that sort of imply that the year is going to be front-half loaded or you just don't have visibility into the back half? And if it's better, then the year would be higher than your $32 billion number. Martin B. Anstice: Well, I think as I said in my prepared comments, we obviously have less visibility in the second half than first, but we do have some assumptions, which are based in that $32 billion. And I think reasonable balance between first half and second half is kind of an overall commentary I would offer for WFE in total. But I would say one segment that stands out in that kind of picture is DRAM, where I think there is a higher profile of first-half investment compared to the second. And I don't know if that's a 60-40 or a 55-45 or a 65-35, time will tell. But that is the segment which stands out, at least at this point, as being slightly more biased to the first half. Now, a lot of things could change in either direction and, clearly, to the extent that prevails, that's an opportunity for Lam to outperform, given kind of memory concentration in the first half compared to the second half as far as peer comparisons are concerned. Although as I said, I do expect outperformance in the calendar year period. So that's the best I can offer you at this point, Tim. Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just as a second question, you had a pretty big quarter for NAND obviously, in December. Do you have a sense of what the shipment mix is going to look like in March? I would assume memory is going to be maybe down a smidge and foundries up, but can you give us a sense? Martin B. Anstice: No, I think actually that we've got memory expansion in shipments December to March and foundry, fairly stable. Douglas R. Bettinger: Yes, that's exactly what we're expecting. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And likewise, congratulations on a great 2013. Martin, first, in terms of kind of big picture looking out over the next couple of years in terms of your market opportunity, with the continued delays in EUV, have you made any revisions to your, I guess, target models in terms of both etch and deposition over the next few years, particularly as you look at 2015 and 2016, given the pushouts that have occurred? Martin B. Anstice: That's a good question. Thank you for your comments at the beginning as well. We have not chosen to revise the models for '15 and '16 yet. I think, clearly, we would be looking for incremental opportunities to the baseline that we established if indeed the EUV picture, as recently characterized, plays out that way. And we've got a lot of time between now and then in terms of positioning for 7-nanometer logic, particularly into the extent there is any interception at 10. Frankly, 10-nanometer positions are still out there in many respects, as well. So we haven't changed the model per se, but I would expect us to be chasing a broader set of opportunities as a result of this. Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Great. And maybe as a follow-up question to some of your prepared remarks about the DRAM opportunity, particularly for double patterning at 20-nanometers, you talked about the different layer opportunities that increased. Can you maybe go a little more specific in terms of where you see the greatest opportunities within etch, kind of on a more granular detail, as well as the opportunities in deposition? Where specifically do you see the greatest incremental opportunities as you move to 20-nanometers from DRAM? Martin B. Anstice: Wow, that's really specific. One of the things I don't want to do, frankly, is get a little bit ahead of ourselves on the number of extra passes, which is of the most tangible area of growth for us in the DRAM conversion and -- because I want to see more evidence that, actually, the emerging messages that I communicated to you today actually show up on a continuing basis. But we're really focused on high aspect ratio opportunities. We're really focused on -- in the x space, we're really focused on packaging and ALD with conformality and uniformity challenges being more significant in next-generations. That's the area for us. I mean, it's all about inflections and it's all about emerging technologies to support narrowing kind of requirements on process windows that are tough to deal with. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Martin, just a clarification first. You said memory up 10% to 20% this year, that was including both DRAM and NAND? Martin B. Anstice: Yes. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Any chance of giving us a breakdown in terms of how you think each of those markets grow this year? Martin B. Anstice: Indeed, I could probably give you some reference on that. If you have a follow-up question, why don't you ask that first and I'll do a little bit of research while you're... James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Sure. The follow-up would be understating your comment about 60% of the business coming from the top 3 in December and 80% from the top 3 in March. Within NAND, specifically, are the -- is the remainder of the 40% and 20%, respectively, are there other NAND players in there as well or is NAND very top-heavy loaded? Martin B. Anstice: Well, I mean, there are only kind of so many players, obviously, in the NAND space. And the mixture of spending has kind of 3 components to it. It has a 3D investment, which in '14 is different than '13 by virtue of more people engaged in a pilot line space. So that's one investment type. Another investment type is whatever additions are going to be made in the context of remaining planar investments. And then a significant investment in NAND flash comes from conversions. And that's obviously a play in a dominant conversation for the customers. So if I looked at additions, I would say the additions via 3D NAND, and if I look to upgrades, it's all about kind of planar investments. And I would not expect this year to be the year where, all in, 3D is the majority of NAND investments. So if I look at the sum of additions and upgrades and conversions, I would say calendar '14 is still likely to be -- it's getting closer, but it's still likely to be a planar majority year. So the answer to your first question is, obviously, the baseline for NANDs WFE in '13 is a little higher than DRAM. We assume about $6 billion for NAND last year and $5 billion or so for DRAM. I believe there's about $1 billion or so of growth in NAND year-over-year. And frankly, something similar to that level in DRAM as well. So reasonably equal growth increments, slightly different baseline. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I guess my first question, you talked about 2 dampening impacts to gross margin in the March quarter : new product ramps and customer concentration. I'm kind of curious if you could help me quantify what kind of hit those 2 dynamics are having in the March quarter and how we should think about those dynamics throughout the year as we think about gross margins? Douglas R. Bettinger: I mean, I'm guiding you down -- John, this is Doug -- 80 basis points from what we just delivered. I'm not going to quantify the specific impact of each of those, but they both contribute, obviously offset a little bit by slightly higher volumes. But as I tried to indicate, the volume bit is getting to be less and less important because we're running the factories pretty full right now. So the upside from that is less today than it has been in the past. Martin B. Anstice: And I would add, I think an important point relative to the interpretation of the financial models. So if you kind of go back to what we presented at SEMICON West last calendar year, you get a '13, '14 model and a '15, '16 model. And the fact that we had 2 models was intended to be important because it does take time as well as volume to execute cost reduction plans in terms of developing new products for lower cost profiles, et cetera, et cetera. And it does take time to execute and implement strategic plans to improve the performance of the company, however good we are in terms of competency and capability and execution. So the '13 and '14 model had a 45% placeholder and, within reason, that's a great place to be in terms of kind of modeling. And just occasionally, we're going to pop up above it as we did in December. And maybe just occasionally, we popped below it. It's much less about volume at this point. We need time to kind of get us through this period of the penetrations on the inflections. So we come out of the gates and you launch a new product, it's usually at its lowest profitability point in that first 6 months to 1-year time horizon. And the inflections are becoming a greater proportion of the output of the company. And '15 to '16 is a great placeholder for when the majority of that inflection and the majority of the new products associated with it, which should be firing on all cylinders from a cost point of view at that point, have their impact on the company. So I'd ask that you all think through not just the volume, but the timelines that were defined in the models that we communicated last year. John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : That's helpful. And then, Martin, as my follow-up -- I appreciate the detail, as always. As we think about EUV getting pushed out, I think one of the things we're seeing is the chip companies are getting more efficient on multi-patterning. The largest foundry guy was not expecting a density improvement at 16; now he's talking about it. The largest logic guy is talking about being able to stay on Moore's Law, even without EUV for a lot longer than we thought. And I guess my question to you is, I'm trying to understand if they learn to be more efficient with multi-patterning, does that actually take market opportunity away from you? Or are they becoming more efficient because of what you're providing? Martin B. Anstice: I mean, I'm sure all of you have obviously asked that question. I mean, the perpetual challenge in this industry is bringing technology to the customer at lower cost, bringing capacity and outlook to the customer at a low cost. And so I am sure and hope, quite frankly, that we're enabling not just technology roadmaps to customers, but cost reduction roadmaps to customers because I think we all recognize the complexity of our customers' industry and our customers' customer industry for that matter. So we have to run Lam Research with a long-term perspective in mind. And so I always think it is very artificial to try and bias performance in the short-term by not delivering solutions to the customers that in the long term will allow them to be most successful. So I'm sure we're part of enabling and, indeed, the customer by virtue of consolidation and influence over the equipment industry, brings a pretty big back to the table as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Just one follow-up question on WFE. If the industry spends more than your initial view of $32 billion, where do you think the upside would come from? Do you think it would be higher foundry or would it be on memory side? Martin B. Anstice: I think it's kind of a couple of things. There's a demand story, so I don't think $32 billion is the most aggressive view of kind of GDP in consumer confidence. And if that kind of trended up, there's -- I think, there's a little bit of upside there. The other part of it, to your point, frankly, is emerging evidence of cost and performance benefits of inflection-led device transition. So if the industry sees cost and/or performance benefits, I guess, the industry of our customers' customer sees the benefits, then there's likely to be an acceleration, if history is a relevant indicator of our future. What the probability of that is at this point? I have no idea, which is why I gave you $32 billion, plus or minus $2 billion. Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes. Okay, and there wouldn't be any -- it wouldn't be like memory over foundry if there was some upside? Martin B. Anstice: I think I wouldn't characterize, one way or the other at this point, which one I thought was more likely to happen. There are clearly independent variables on the supply side. They're very dependent on the demand side, so I don't know. It could go either way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Martin, I had 2 questions. Number one, in terms of the 3D NAND on the etch side, is your market share similar or better or lower compared to planar NAND? Martin B. Anstice: It's at least as good and I would expect in some of the selection spaces, slightly better. Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. That's very helpful. And then one other question. In terms of your industry outlook, you said that you're seeing a lot of reuse of equipment on the logic side, which is kind of not a big surprise. The question I was trying to find out is are you seeing with capital, in terms of in the foundry, is still very high? Are you seeing more reused inventory from the foundry customers or do you think that's going to happen going forward? Martin B. Anstice: I think it will be an emerging trend. I think it's a very hard thing to execute and, at some level, the need and the expectations for it are obviously embedded in the numbers we've given you on WFE. But I think the economic realities of scaling for the foundries make it much more important than ever. And the challenge obviously, is if they have sustaining commitments from their customers, so the legacy geometries how do they ever free up the capacity to make it kind of happen on scale. So I think it shows a -- more how big it ultimately is. I think time will tell. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : My question is for Doug. Do you have any plans to help increase the cash onshore as a means to increase shareholder return? Douglas R. Bettinger: Mehdi, I kind of described our approach to cash is we've got a plan in place at least through 2014, which is the $250 million buyback authorization. Yes, we're always looking at opportunities and whether they're -- crude guidance I've provided is roughly 20% of the prospective cash we generate is onshore. We may be able to tick that up a little bit. In fact, I think we will. We're always looking at a couple of different things and we'll communicate with you kind of year-by-year or quarter-by-quarter as we work our way through this authorization, what the concrete plans of the company are as we go forward. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : And my brief follow on is for Martin. Do you have any market intelligence, especially from downstream players to help us understand the application for 3D NAND use, especially with the 80,000 to 100,000 wafer per month capacity that you were referring to? Martin B. Anstice: I think we do, but I'm going to reserve the right to keep that to our ourselves and respect the interest of our customer. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Can you talk around it or qualitatively talk about some of the general use of the 3D NAND? Martin B. Anstice: I know you don't like me doing this, but I am going to resist it because I feel like we put a lot of information out and, just occasionally, I got to stay honest and protect some of what we spend lots of time building, which is relationships with customers and customers' customers, so that we have a good a sense of where the industry is headed. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : And you're saying that this 80,000 to 100,000 would be installed by September so that it would -- the shipment would start by December? Is that right? Martin B. Anstice: No, it's a statement of physical shipments to customers. So by the end of the calendar year, that is the number I gave you. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : I show that because the Korean customers have both told us... Shanye Hudson : Mehdi, we're going to move on here now. Could we get the next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Martin, a question on the foundries, the linearity of 20-nanometer ramp up. You talked about the ramp base dependent on the availability of the technology. Where do you think the 20- and 14-, 16-nanometer are in terms of readiness? And from that, what can you tell us about the ramp profile of these technologies? Martin B. Anstice: Well, I think, kind of back to my earlier statements, the assumption that we're making today based on our conversations with customers and our own modeling is that foundry is a reasonably stable year. It's going to have, obviously, a majority forum 20-nanometer for first half and 14, 16 emerges in the second half as kind of pilot lines. So you're going to see a different node of spending in the calendar year. And if nothing changes in terms of commitments of the customers' customer to FinFET devices, then the rates by the foundry to kind of get whatever early share momentum is available tends to suggest a pretty kind of convicted spending to that plan. And I don't think this is the year where a 14 to 16 investment is particularly subject to risk on yield because it will be too early, it's not enough. I mean, it will be a much more relevant conversation in calendar '15. If 14, 16 yields aren't where the customers want it to be, then I'm sure that will be relevant to the pace of the add capacity, but I don't see that as being a particularly big factor in calendar '14. Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. That's very helpful. And then you made comments regarding space or double patterning driving ALD. My question is, is there a significant adoption of spacer-based double patterning in the DRAM and the logic devices? I know NAND is 100% space to double pattern, but are you seeing a lot of interest from DRAM, as well as logic devices? Martin B. Anstice: DRAM, yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Northland Capital Markets. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : In terms of the reuse, can you characterize the amount of reuse for your equipment, 28- to 20-nanometer and 20 to FinFET, and kind of split that between etch and CVD? Martin B. Anstice: You need to ask that question again because you're breaking out. Sorry. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : If you look at the equipment reuse between 28-nanometer foundry logic and 20-nanometer, and then similarly 20 to 16 or 14 FinFETs, what's the difference in the amount of your equipment that can be reused? And is there a difference between etch and CVD? Martin B. Anstice: Okay. The etch and CVD conversation's a little bit premature for me to have. And the first one -- the first piece, it's a little difficult, but the best I could give you probably is that I think in general, the equipment set for 20-nanometer generally is much more overlapping with a 14 and 16 equipment set than was true for 28 to 20. So I would say, intuitively, it would seem there are more opportunities for reuse 20 to 14 to 16 than existed 28 to 20. Now, that's a line availability statement as an -- or ease of transition. That doesn't take off the table, the challenge I described a little earlier, which is if you got demand from a customer and you have legacy demand for some years, how do you free enough capacity to go do it? But intuitively, I think that the reuse opportunity for the foundry is greater 20 to 14, 16, presuming you have 20 investments of a sufficient amount than was true at 28 to 20. Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And my follow-up is that you talked a little bit about the customer concentration. For 2014 calendar year, do you expect the same customer concentration as 2013? Douglas R. Bettinger: No. Actually, I think it will be a little bit less. When we look at it, I mean, the March quarter is pretty concentrated. I think the whole year is actually going to be the same or maybe even a little bit less than '14 relative to '13. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : First question regarding the industry. Just on your foundry, WFE a little [ph] up 10% to 20%. I was wondering how much of that comes from kind of increased capital intensity in your foundry versus broadening of customer base? We heard from one of your peers talk about they saw some trailing etch to the order pushed out at the foundry side. I was wondering if that had an effect on how you think about the foundry position. [ph] Martin B. Anstice: I don't think that dollars invested in '14 and '16 will be as high as 20% in the calendar year. That's the assumption that we have at this point and we have said -- and we're much more able to speak to this for deposition etch and cleans than we are wafer fab as a whole, but we've kind of sized the increment in SAM to the 5% to 10% level, I think, for the comparison of final generation planar, first generation FinFET for foundry. So that's kind of the best I can give you on capital intensity. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : All right. I see. Okay. That's fair. And then I think you mentioned about one of the largest service contract you signed on the quarter and try to focus on the service area. Any way you can kind of quantify how much of your business is service right now, how do you think that will transpire as we go, look beyond this year, let's say '15, '16? Do you expect a greater growth in that area? And any kind of metric you can add that does kind of measure that? Martin B. Anstice: Yes, I think actually, we gave a pretty good shot at answering that question in the Analyst Meeting at SEMICON West last year, so I'd kind of refer you back to the July 9 presentation. There's kind of more substance there than we have time for today. But just so we're not confused, it's not just kind of a service play. It's an upgrade play. It's an installed base utilization play. It's a reliability play. It's training. It's everything that's available to us as an equipment company, supporting our customers' installed base improvement expectations. Service is one part of that, but it's not a growth plan limited to service. Shanye Hudson : Operator, I think we have time for 2 more questions. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Actually, 2 quick ones. First, you gave the 80,000 to 100,000 3D NAND installed capacity by the end of '14. Can you just help us understand what that number was end of '13? Martin B. Anstice: I think we had like 20,000 to 25,000 as the communication at the end of last year. Douglas R. Bettinger: Yes, I think we said 20,000, Terence. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, terrific. The second question is on customer concentration. Starting at 80% in that first quarter, it implies a pretty sharp broadening in the second half of customer shipments. Can you just explain to me how you expect that to develop sequentially and, again, remind us what '13 was? And I ask that because with the context of understanding whether conviction in those shipments and the timing and assurance of those shipments is higher or lower than with the larger customers? Douglas R. Bettinger: Terence, I think the most concentrated quarter is going to be the March quarter. I'm not going to get into the specifics of each quarter after that because things move around, but it will broaden out our view as we get through the remaining quarters. Martin B. Anstice: I don't know, to the kind of soft part of your question, is it a higher risk or a lower risk to have more people participating? Who the hell knows. I tend to feel that the reasons for more people investing and there are more reasons around -- technology inflections inherently have more conviction than kind of genetic capacity additions, so I actually feel pretty good about that. And I also feel like the environment, the supply and demand balance and the fact that we come into the year pretty tight, the fact that pricing levels for memory, the fact that the profitability levels for semiconductor companies generally is -- maybe they would argue not as good as they'd like it to be, but it's far better than it has been. And so I tend to feel better about it. I do think that you should, we should continue to expect variability quarter-to-quarter. I mean, it is really hard to predict the output of these companies when 2 to 3 to 4 guys can represent everything about the performance of your company. One guy can move left or right and you've got a different picture. And we've kept our ranges pretty narrow on our guidance and we'll keep them that way as long as we feel like we can manage it. But I would say it's getting much more difficult to manage variability of kind of individual customer movements than ever before. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Chad Dillard on for the line of Vishal. From the industry's perspective, can you talk about how you see the amount of 20-nanometer being installed for 2014 from a wafer start perspective? Martin B. Anstice: Yes, given the concentration of a couple of customers, I'm going to kind of resist that level of specificity. It's, as I said, I do expect the -- maybe you got to triangulate a little here. We are forecasting in the range of $13 billion, $14 billion of WFE. I think kind of the public commentary and analyst commentary on 20-nanometer cost is approximately $1.25 billion, $1.3 billion per 10,000 wafer starts addition. And I kind of said I expect that the 20-nanometer addition is greater than the 14 and 16 addition. I think if you kind of work with those data points, you're going to find out a pretty reliable answer to your question. Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. And maybe you could just unpack the foundry shipment, the number in December. What was the mix of 20-nanometer versus the rest? Martin B. Anstice: We don't -- that's disclosure above and beyond what we have customarily done, I'm sorry. Operator : Thank you, and I would like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Shanye Hudson : Wonderful. We truly wish to thank you all for spending the last hour or so here with us today. As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. So on behalf of the entire management team here, we would like to -- we appreciate your interest in Lam Research. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

Finally I would like to announce plans to host our investor and analyst event on Tuesday, July the 8th. This event will be held in San Francisco in conjunction with the SEMICON West Industry Conference. You can expect to see further details in the coming weeks on our Investor Relations website. With that I will turn the call over to you Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Shanye and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll start today\u2019s call by sharing highlights from the quarter and then update you with a short commentary on the industry environment before concluding with our perspective on Lam\u2019s opportunities and progress against our growth objectives. Then Doug will summarize our financial results and provide guidance for the June quarter. Lam Research is off to a really great start in 2014, hence we\u2019re pleased to report another quarter of strong execution across key areas of the business. We delivered great financial performance in the March quarter with results topping the mid-points of our guided ranges across all metrics and meeting or exceeding our long-term models in absolute terms as well as in timing. Our business models are focused on driving profitable growth. Consistent with expectations we grew revenue by 10% sequentially and grew operating income nearly twice that pace with excellent cash from operations performance at 24% of revenues. We are very busy with new technology and product release activities taking advantage of industry transitions and increasing support from our key customers. We continue to solidify to solidly gain traction across each of our targeted market segments and enjoy increasing market share in etch and deposition, both a claim recently endorsed by independent industry research. In 3D NANDs production qualifications are underway for our high productivity dielectric deposition platform, our latest generation dielectric etcher and our tungsten extreme fill tool. These transistors are defined by uniformally depositing alternating films using our PECVD system. Next these transistors are connected by precisely etching a very high aspect ratio down through the entire film stack using our dielectric etch tool. Finally that hole is filled with tungsten using our CVD system which electrically connects the transistors in the device. Essentially from selections made by our customers every critical step in the all-important transistor formation in 3D NAND is addressed by Lam equipments. In DRAM, contemplating our strong etch position in the area of multi-patterning we secured production application wins with our dielectric ALD tool for 20 nanometer technology node. Importantly we have demonstrated the ability to achieve our customer\u2019s stringent uniformity requirements without compromising productivity. In the area of advanced packaging we were successful with two new systems, two new customers for our 3D copper electric planting tools thus extending our lead in copper fill. And in our clean business we have leading edge joint development activity now with three leading device manufacturers to evaluate our next generation clean system and we\u2019re pleased to report that one of these systems has been released for production for multiple front end line applications. While we\u2019re still in the early stages of assessing these tools production capabilities we are of course encouraged by our early progress and remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead. We continue to focus on delivering technology and productivity solutions that enhance the value we offer to our customers. The ability to do so correlates directly to our long standing focus on unit process excellence, customer trust and industry collaboration leadership which we believe are differentiators of substance for our company. This differentiation is more important and more valuable than ever in an environment which is being impacted by the scale of customer and the equipments industry consolidation at the same time that customers are demanding very best supports to their most complex and pressing technical challenges. We believe the results we report today further illustrates how customers are demonstrating their commitment to Lam as a technology and productivity solutions partner for their most critical challenges and inflections. Turning now to our industry outlook, we continue to forecast wafer fabrication equipment spending at approximately $32 billion in calendar 2014. The headline here is we\u2019ve seen some strengthening in DRAM largely with multi-patterning and technology conversion, some slight delays in 3D NANDs to our earlier expectations and a sustained commitment in logic and foundry to 20 nanometer and FinFET adoptions and multi-patterning integration schemes. Starting with the NAND segments we saw very strong investments in the March quarter, both for Planar and 3D NAND devices. We continue to expect WFE spend for Planar devices will represent the majority of spending this year and remain relatively steady as customers transition to the sub-20 nanometer technology node. Specific to 3D NAND the timing of second generation device ramps appears now more likely to extend into early 2015 for some. As a result we now estimate that the cumulative amount of 3D NAND shipped capacity exiting 2014 to be at the bottom end of our prior range of 80,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month. This shift has not impacted our outlook for 2014 NAND supply bid growth which remains essentially in the lower 40% range. In DRAM we saw an acceleration of investment plans in the March quarter to convert capacity to the mid-2x and 20 nanometer nodes. We expect similar DRAM investments to continue through the balance of calendar 2014, for Lam, more than offsetting the delays I just mentioned in 3D NAND. As a result we have maintained our projections for memory WFE spend in a range of $12 billion to $13 billion in 2014. Finally, in both the foundry and broader logic segments our outlook remains pretty consistent with what we outlined in our January call. Although it seems there is a perpetual debate around pulls and pushes, the ramp plans for 20 nanometer foundry and 14 nanometer logic appear from our perspective to be progressing largely as expected through the first half of this year and we started to see initial pilot capacity installation for foundry FinFET. Overall we estimate that approximately 25% of total WFE investments this year will be directly associated with inflection technologies including 3D NAND, FinFET devices for foundries, multi-patterning and advanced packaging. Our customers are motivated to transition to these next generation devices because they can offer a competitive advantage in their markets in cost and/or outperformance. Again, based on the importance of these technology inflections and the current pace of pilot and production ramps we\u2019re still projecting overall WFE spending within a $32 billion range. We assume spending is relatively balanced between halfs with memory investments slightly stronger in first half and logic foundry slightly stronger in the second half of this calendar year. For Lam, we believe we are well-positioned with these inflections and have the opportunity to outpace the industry growth once again in calendar 2014 as our customers begin to transition to these devices. More, if we execute to our plan this outperformance should accelerate as a greater proportion of total spending relates to these inflections in the next two to three years. Further adoption of multi-patterning schemes is a sizable cornerstone of sustainable growth to the company. We are continuing to benefit from the ongoing investments in leading etch foundry capacity. However these trends may be most pronounced currently in the DRAM segments. With the transition to the 20 nanometer node, the number of multi-patterning passes increases from four or so steps at the 25 nanometer node to 15 or 20 steps at 20 nanometer. These critical applications play to our leadership position in conductor etch and have supported equipment bias. We are already benefiting from the initial 3D NAND production bias and have further strengthened our development share positions which bodes well for the company as other NAND manufacturers commence technology transition to 3D devices in volume next year and beyond. In addition, LAM\u2019s exposure to each of the industry segments is more balanced today than ever in the company\u2019s history. In the last 18 months we strengthened memory positions for deposition products particularly NAND positions and ALD technology broadly. We have also fortified positions for etch in microprocessor and foundry both. Noteworthy, across the sum of our product portfolio in calendar 2014 I believe our global market share in foundry is expected to be within five percentage points of our market share in memory. In addition, year-over-year 2014 versus 2013 our logic shipments market share, including microprocessor, general purpose logic and packaging is likely to increase by 10 percentage points, approximately two-thirds coming from deposition and one-third from etch. At the end of the day we believe Lam exited 2013 having gains two to three points of ships market share in etch and point or so in deposition with essentially no change to our positions in claim. In a world that at times offers confusing or conflicting industry claims on growth and market share perhaps there is no more fundamental measure than relative revenue growth. In that regards we established an industry benchmark in calendar 2013 with year-on-year revenue growth that outpaced the industry and all of our primarily direct competitors by a significant market. We are increasingly confident in our product positioning and particularly the support we are receiving from customers at this time. In addition to the beneficial deposition and etch market expansion opportunities available for the long-term, particularly with multi-patterning and 3D transitions we are poised to gain another one to two percentage points of shipped share in both etch and deposition this year. Our strong performance within the quarter and outlook underscore Lam\u2019s unique value and growth opportunity we believe. We are executing at a high level and believe our customers are very invested in Lam addressing their most critical challenges long term. With that I will turn the call over to Doug. Douglas Bettinger : Thank you Martin. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you today when I know is a busy earnings day for all of you. And I\u2019ll reiterate a little bit of what Martin said. We are starting 2014 with some very positive momentum. We continue to execute on our growth plans and to deliver solid performance very much in line with our financial model. Shipments for the March quarter again hit an all-time high. We achieved record revenues for the fourth consecutive quarter. Operating income continued to outpace revenue growth this quarter by almost double the rate. Gross margin came in towards to the upper end of our expectations. Earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance and we clearly demonstrated the cash generation ability of our business model by more than doubling our operational cash flow on a sequential basis. Shipments in the March quarter were $1.264 billion, which is up more than 10% compared to the December quarter and again above the midpoint of our guidance range. Memory shipments continued at a healthy pace. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the quarter DRAM upside compensated for slightly softer NAND spending. The combined memory segment represented 66% of total system shipments, about flat in percentage terms with the December quarter. Of that NAND shipments contributed 36% The build out of initial 3G NAND production capacity made up a large portion of NAND shipments in the March quarter. I would point out however that we still expect planar NAND node conversion spending to represent the majority of NAND investments for the full year. DRAM shipments were 30% of system shipments. These shipments were targeted at 25 nanometer conversions and initial 20 nanometer pilot production. We are benefitting disproportionately in this area due to our strong market position in multiple patterning applications. Foundry shipments were 28% of total system shipments, flat on a percentage basis compared to last quarter. However in total dollar terms up sequentially by nearly 15%. In addition to ongoing capacity expansion for the 20 nanometer node we are starting to see shipments for FinFET pilot production. And finally logic and other shipments comprised 6% of total system shipments which was down from 8% in the prior quarter. Revenue for the March quarter was $1.227 billion, representing a 10% increase from the December quarter. We saw revenue growth significantly above 10% sequentially in both etch and deposition driven by share expansion in the memory space. March quarter gross margin came at a little better than expected at 45.5% and again was in-line with our financial model. And I will just remind you that we expect to see quarterly variability in our gross margin performance based on multiple factors such as product mix, customer mix and business volumes. We continue to manage our operating expenses which were within expectations for the March quarter at $311 million. This spending was 25% of revenue compared to 27% of revenue in the December quarter. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in SG&A in order to enhance funding for strategic R&D investments. R&D grew to 60% of total operating expenses in the March quarter while we slightly lowered SG&A expenses. The incremental R&D spending supported areas like the 3D copper electroplating, ALD and tungsten CVD that Martin mentioned earlier. We delivered solid operating income in the March quarter at $248 million, which was up 19% from the $209 million in the December quarter. Our operating margin came in at 20.2% near the high end of our guidance range, again reflecting leverage in our model. The tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 12% .I expect the rate to hold steady in the low to mid-teens for the balance of the fiscal year. And the resulting earnings per share for the quarter came in at $1.26 exceeding our expectations. Majority of the upside is attributable to our operating performance and to a lesser extend a more favorable tax rate. Our earnings per share were based on a share count of roughly 172 million shares. The share count includes the dilutive effect of 6.8 million shares from the 2041 convertible note. And let me just remind you that the schedule for this note is posted on our investor relations website to assist you with your modeling. We generated very strong cash from operations in the March quarter at $290 million which was about 24% of revenue. Our operational cash generation more than doubled from the $129 million in the December quarter due to a very strong focus on collections [Technical Difficulty] repurchased approximately 930,000 shares of common stock. At year-end we had completed about $186 million or approximately 75% of our current $230 million authorization at an average cumulative share price of $15.19. We are anticipating share purchase under authorization in near term. You should expect us to update you on our long plans in this area as we complete this authorization. We remained committed to a prudent return of available cash to our shareholders. So now let me turn to balance sheet. We ended the quarter with gross cash and short term investments including our restricted cash of $2.9 billion. This compares with $2.7 billion in the December quarter. We had deferred revenue of $432 million which does not include $57 million of shipments to Japanese customers which will convert to revenue in future quarters. Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1.150 billion plus or minus $50 million. We expect revenue of $1.240 billion plus or minus $50 million. Our expectation for gross margin is 46% plus or minus one percentage point. We are forecasting operating margins of 20% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $1.21 plus or minus $0.07 based on a flattish share count of approximately 172 million shares. Based on our current outlook we expect our shipment profile to be relatively balanced between the first and second half perhaps with a slide bias towards a little bit stronger first half. We are seeing a slight pause in shipments during the middle part of this year. Consistent with the prior remarks we would expect variability quarter-to-quarter given our consolidated customer base and the ongoing uncertainties about the scope and timing of investments for next generation devices. Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would be pleased to take your questions now. Operator : Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Farhan Rizvi : Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is for Farhan asking the question on behalf of John. I was just wondering like you talked about your multi-patterning opportunity and it seems like there is a huge growth for you going from 25 nanometer to 20 nanometer. I wanted to know relative to the previous guidance that you have provided at the analyst day, how do you see your SAM growth in terms of percentage on a per wafer basis when you go from 25 nanometer to 20 nanometer DRAM? Martin Anstice : Yeah, we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t actually kind of get to precisely answer that question in the context for SAM expansion of the company obviously includes the DRAM transition but there is kind of much more to SAM expansion than that but I guess at a very high level, if you look at the inflection in DRAM from the mid 2x node to 20 nanometer we would expect SAM expense in the 30% to 40% range. And a big part of that obviously relates to patterning and as best we can tell and I think today\u2019s results are a decent amount of evidence so that the share momentum for the company is positive. But the headline I would ask you keep in mind is that inflection sits in the context of 4 or 5 and the total SAM expansion opportunity for the company is in a $1 billion range. Farhan Rizvi : Got it and thank you. And then talking about the shipment mix in terms of your June quarter, how do you see different mix by different segments? Douglas R. Bettinger: Yeah, I mean obviously regarding this is Doug by the way, we are guiding shipments down a little bit. Within that your memory is down a little bit, NAND probably down and DRAM is actually flat to slightly up. Logic is up a little bit and foundry is flattish, may be flattish to slightly down. Farhan Rizvi : Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Covello : Great guys good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Can you talk a little bit about the breadth of the DRAM activity is it just one or two guys or is it the more than one person who is driving the changes there? Martin Anstice : Well there aren\u2019t so many customers left in our world, so\u2026 James Covello : I guess really is the just one or is it two? Martin Anstice : No, it\u2019s more than one. So there is I mean there is a decent amount of conversion activity happening today and my expectation Jim is that there is probably in the range of 500,000 wafer starts of DRAM conversion going to take place in the calendar year kind of all in. And that will mean that we kind of if you place out that way they will still be in the range of 400,000 wafer starts at capacity at kind of 3x or greater, in terms of kind of technology node. So a decent amount of conversion but at the end of the year even with that assumption there is still a fair amount of capacity still adds 3x or above. James Covello : That ultimately could still be converted next year right? Martin Anstice : Exactly. James Covello : And on the 3D NAND, is your view there that the reason that that the changes you are seeing in that market is that because of yield on those products or is it because may be we already have what we need for NAND right now before we add any more, what\u2019s the color on what the changes are being driven by? Martin Anstice : Yeah it\u2019s obviously a question that at the end of the day the customers you want to really answer. I am sure everything that has been written is probably relevant in some way to this. I mean there is continues to be evidence of really good discipline in terms of supply and demand balance in memory period and that\u2019s really NAND as much as it is in the DRAM. As we\u2019ve talked about a number of times the transition from planar to 3D technology in Flash memory is extremely challenging and clearly this is the year where our customers are making in varying levels of commitments investments in that evaluation and obviously there is one kind of big I that\u2019s a step ahead in terms of their commitments. But frankly as best we can tell everybody is in investing at some level beginning to evaluate the technology. And the commentary from customers today is very similar to the commentary a year or so ago, there is up to a kind of two to three year timeline associated to transitions to 3D device depending on the customer. But I am sure the complexity of building a device, yielding a device delivering performance in a device and to the committed discipline of customers to only add capacity when it is matched by demand are all relevant in answering your question. James Covello : Really helpful, thanks so much, good luck. Martin Anstice : Thanks Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of American. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes, great thanks for taking my question. I had two quick ones, one Martin I noticed that in your etch market segments when you talk about \u2013 you mostly focus on dielectric etch, kind of curious, is the incremental opportunity mostly in dielectric etch because which you\u2019re kind of maxed out, you already have a high conductor etch it or is there something else going on? Martin Anstice : Well by virtue of market share in dielectric etch being lower than conductor etch I would all say that the opportunity again is greater. I would not agree that we are maxed out in conductor etch, I mean we have a set of business objectives to grow in all segments of our business that\u2019s clearly more difficult when you have a very strong leadership position but it\u2019s not impossible. And frankly we\u2019re making investments to grow both of etch but we have been approximately a 35% market share company for some time in dielectric and as I\u2019ve talked about a number of times, particularly evidenced by market share momentum in memory already and we\u2019re seeing some really nice signs of pick-up in support from customers in logic emerging as well. I believe we have a product to this point that is very competitive and for the first time in the long time I think we\u2019re very optimistic about the growth potential in dielectric. Krish Sankar : Great, that\u2019s very helpful and then a quick follow up, just in terms of the capital investment obviously you have a lot of free cash oversea and looks like you guys got investment grade status recently. So I\u2019m kind of curious what\u2019s your appetite for debt, getting on debt as of this point given that you have a delicate balance between debt and the investment grade status? Douglas R. Bettinger: Yeah, Krish we\u2019re working our way through the current buyback authorizations. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do until that\u2019s completed at which point we\u2019ll develop a new plan and communicate to you what we\u2019re going to do. I wouldn\u2019t tell you that raising debt is completely off the table but I think we\u2019ll be able to develop a pretty good plan and have a pretty good cash return opportunity without doing that. But having said that we still have an ability to take debt on if we choose to do so, haven\u2019t made the decision yet. Krish Sankar : That is terrific, thanks a lot guys. Martin Anstice : Thanks Krish. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Great, thank you for taking my question and solid job on the quarterly execution. As a follow up to Jim\u2019s question, the equipment spenders have been fairly limited in the first half but with your balance kind of first half second half outlook, do you also see a pipeline of more customers and program spending in the second half versus the first half? On the NAND side as you mentioned you know you\u2019ve got the transition the 15 nanometer planar by one or two of your customers, you\u2019ve got 20 nanometer DRAM transitions and an initial ramp-up of 16 nanometer FinFET by foundry customers. Does that spender base continue to broaden into the second half? Martin Anstice : Absolutely yes, I think in every segment that\u2019s a true statement. We, as I mentioned in the question from Jim, concentration is in efforts of the high \u2013 but the first quarter of our year is the most concentrated. We\u2019re about 70% of our outlook to three guys and that three guy reference point probably drops to the 60% level, 50%, 60% level for the rest of the year. So macro level definitely more diversity at a specific level NAND transition more participant in second half to first half for sure, DRAM pretty stable while the foundry is definitely opening in the second half of the year and I think that\u2019s very consistent with kind of the comments from TSNC around their concentration spending in the first half. And the microprocessor world obviously is overwhelmed in investment terms at least by one customer and their strategy which cannot play that last year in a big way is still very relevant to them but original equipment bias in emerging theme as we step through the year for them. Harlan Sur : Great and then solid job on the operating margin expansion in the March quarter and holding it here in the June quarter. Obviously the team had a lot of new development initiatives ongoing. As WFE spending growth plays rather as you would expect how should we think about the OpEx profile as the year enfolds off of the June quarter base? Martin Anstice : I think the most important guiding principle is we\u2019re not going to compromise a long-term success of a company for a kind of a short-term if any. But having said that we\u2019re not sitting here today with a belief that we have kind of fundamental disconnects between investment levels and opportunities. Always there\u2019s an appetite to do more and to spend more and I wouldn\u2019t expect us to look very different frankly from the rest of the capital equipment given in terms of increasing investments in the year. I think more or less we track together today, none of us are really kind of shocking in terms of disproportionate increases or decreases in investment. Douglas Bettinger : Yeah and Harlan if you do the math on the guide for the June quarter you\u2019ll know that spending is picking up a bit. It\u2019s the timing of our annual merit cycle as well as new equity grants I wouldn\u2019t you shouldn\u2019t expect that to occur again for the remainder of this year, that\u2019s an annual pipeline so that\u2019s the reason for step up right now I wouldn\u2019t expect that to continue. Harlan Sur : Okay. [Technical Difficulty] qualitative mentioned you expect a little more bias of foundries in second half of this year, well obviously do you see spending of 30 nanometers or do you see on the next generation of 16 nanometer in the coming year? Martin Anstice : That\u2019s really [Technical Difficulty. So I\u2019ll try and triangle it for you a little bit. I do believe for the year that the 20 nanometer and investments all represent only 80% or so ending and I do believe that for the year there were \u2013 20 nanometer investments to FinFET investments probably kind of 60 :40 something in that range. So you\u2019re going to have to work with that because I don\u2019t that I expect specificity at the half level to kind of take you beyond that at this time. Harlan Sur : No it\u2019s fair enough. You mentioned that you got some new clean products out in the market place that you are trying to get some attraction back in that area. Should we look at 2014 as kind of the ceding year and 2015 as the year where you expect to generate some more revenues and market share gains in that business segment? Martin Anstice : Yeah I think it\u2019s fair to say that, the whole of the plans of the company is the one in the long-term that\u2019s the more hockey sticks and that\u2019s a byproduct of being disadvantaged in a couple of ways in the last three or four years we were not competitive in terms of productivity. We believe we now are. We have a 16 chamber configuration which has mechanical throughput capabilities that I think are very competitive and the process and chamber offerings we\u2019ve designed to allow us to participate in the front end of the line clean segment in ways that we were not able to historically. But as I will always state getting penetration in a segment of the industry which is not feature creating. It\u2019s all about yield obviously, is a very tough proposition and we respect our competition enormously. So this is a very important year for us, no question and we exit the year with one of two products, either a lot of confidence around the plans of the company and spending level consistent with that or a redefinition of the outlook for the business but we certainly as we sit here today the customer engagement is very positive and in fact we\u2019re getting kind of more pulls than we\u2019re actually satisfying today. Couple of customers are interested in the product and we\u2019re holding back a little until we validated some of the offering in the existing engagements. Harlan Sur : Great, thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Harlan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. A couple of things guys first of all Martin I wanted to fit what you said about a pause in mid-year, you said there\u2019s going to be pause in mid-year but then you also talked about shipments being only a little bit front half loaded this year. So I guess you probably don\u2019t want to give guidance for calendar Q3 but that would sort of imply that the September shipments are not going to come down much if they come down at all, that\u2019s the first question and then I had a follow up. Martin Anstice : Your assumption is right, I\u2019m not going to give guidance on September and good try though. The answer obviously for September is by product not just of June but also December and so really is kind of early for me to be calling a quarter at this point. I would not expect September to be up. I think it will be about flattish or down a little. But I might be wrong and there\u2019s a lot of weeks between now and the real kind of decision point I think relates to September and December uncertainty. At a revenue level, again it\u2019s an imperfect science for us to be articulating a view for the calendar year but I would say that our expectation is that second half quarters \u2013 if we are going to track to this $32 billion WFE number, that we believe is the case, the second half quarters will have a revenue level that\u2019s kind of plus or minus $100 million of the average of the first two quarters of this year. So that\u2019s our kind of reference point for the second half as we see it today in revenues and obviously some part of that is answering your question because revenues are byproduct of shipments. Timothy Arcuri : Perfect, awesome. As always, thanks for that. And then, just a question more for Doug. So clearly, you guys were taking a lot of WFE share this year. If I go back to the slide you put out at SEMICON West and you have your long-term financial model, you are basically at $5 billion revenue run rate right now and gross margin 46%, operating margin 22%. So you are pretty already at your 2015, 2016 model. So is this your sort of one-time mix issues that helped too in December and March or should we think that there is headroom to that model particularly given the huge second generation 3D NAND you have? Thanks. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, Tim, I am not changing that model as we sit here today. We are not quite at that $5 billion. It\u2019s kind of high fours. And part of the margin improvement from where we are today, we are a little bit shy of that 22% and approaching the revenue level prior to its time in terms of maturing products and getting everything ramped in manufacturing. Could there be headroom? Maybe, but, it\u2019s too early to call it right now. SEMICON and our Analysts Day are too far away. We may be updating some things for you them, but there is time for that now. Martin Anstice : So, just to kind of supplement to that, I would say a couple of things. It isn\u2019t kind of mix thing and just looks good for the quarter. I mean there are very fundamental, SAM expansion opportunities that are relevant to our company. As I said a number of times, I don\u2019t think, there is a better positions company in the equipment space by virtue of what we have in the product portfolio and what we don\u2019t in the product portfolio to exploit four or five inflections. I think we are at the right place, at time with the right products. The patterning expansion is very real and as I mentioned in the last call, we were positively surprised by the scale and scope of that in DRAM and we\u2019re only just at the beginning of it in the kind of Logic kind of rollout and all of commentary that I read at least says that, that opportunity is an increasing opportunity and substance for us through at least the 10 nanometer technology node and the longer that installed base gets positioned, the more challenging the intercept points are easy relative to kind of greenfield trade off. So that\u2019s a very real opportunity. I think, one thing to keep in mind in terms of calling it too early or calling it too late in terms of whether we revise models is, let\u2019s not forget the intensity of the conversation from the customer on cost, right. One of the most important complexities that we have to walk through as an industry and as a company in the next number of years, all of these inflections are getting more expensive, right. Capital intensity almost in every transition is either not going down as much as it used to or quite the reverse, it\u2019s going up. And so, we have tremendous SAM expansion opportunities. We are at least flat or positive in market share in these transitions, but the industry and part of the industry is going to see increasing pressure I am sure over the next several years as this goes from kind of pilot and technology evaluation in the case of 3D NAND into ultimately HVM manufacturing. But may be kind of finish off the thoughts, let\u2019s just kind of go back to first principles. In our last Analyst Meeting, we articulated [Technical Difficulty] to our market share we are about a 40% market share company in the segments that we compete, about a 50% share company in etch, mid 30% in deposition and high teens, low 20s in clean. And through the decisions that customers have made to-date, we believe that our market share around the inflections exceeds the 50% level. So, let\u2019s say kind of 10 point increase in market share before and after inflections. And so, one of the most important headlines for everybody across the company is, if we continue to execute and that isn\u2019t easy, the challenge from competitors and expectations from customers are incredibly demanding, but if we execute to the plans of the company, the result is that, the outperformance you are seeing today is going to accelerate as a greater proportion of spending of customers is associate with these inflections and that\u2019s not a guidance statement, that\u2019s a statement of understanding and belief. We have got a lots of work to do to pull that off but that\u2019s what this company is focused on executing. Timothy Arcuri : Wonderful, Martin. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Sorry for the long answer, but I felt like time for me to make that statement. Douglas Bettinger : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. Out next question is from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Weston Twigg : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just real quickly wanted to ask a little bit more about shareholders expectations. It sounds like you do have some level of conviction in a rebound in the second half largely weighted towards foundry. But, I\u2019m just wondering related to FinFET from the conversations you are having with your customers, does it feel to you that they are really moving full steam ahead or that there seemed to be some risk or some hesitation perhaps to second half spend and just kind of gauging a level of conviction on that spend. Martin Anstice : I sense conviction. It seems a very important transition for established community I think a lot of the date around custom performance for the 20 nanometer node tends to suggest that there are significant opportunities for performance improvements on both of those definitions in a FinFET device and architecture and not surprisingly it\u2019s a very competitive space for the foundry. So at least as far as the interactions that I have, there is a lot of conviction to be successful through this inflection. Weston Twigg : Okay, good. And then just a similar question on 3D NAND, now you are indicating that there may be 80,000 wafer starts might be installed by the end of the year. And I\u2019m just wondering if you think there will be may be more downside risk or upside potential to that number at this point? Martin Anstice : Really hard to tell. I don\u2019t know that there is a lot of either frankly and I don\u2019t think there is a tremendous amount of downside because the 80,000 wafer start level that is a pretty minimalist investment in the industry to evaluate that technology. And it\u2019s a critical period for evaluating that technology. I think every NAND customer is talking about evaluating the technology and they have their own timelines and own roadmaps in terms of HVM adoption. But I don\u2019t think any one of the NAND flash memory customers can afford to be only outside looking a technology transition. They will make their own choices about what the right point of intercept is, how many layers in a device makes sense in terms of cost comparisons, but I sense there is very minimal downside to the number that we have shared today. Weston Twigg : Okay. Good. Very helpful. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Weston. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mahesh Sanganeria : Thank you very much. Martin, just want to follow up on your SAM expansion with multiple patterning comment. The conventional wisdom has that with multiple patterning lithography expands the most. But looking at your results and comparing, it looks like you are benefiting a lot more than some of your competitors for some of your segments. Is there something we are missing here? Is that something in the technology that is helping you more than others in terms of SAM expansion in multiple patterning? Martin Anstice : Well, I think the \u2013 I don\u2019t know if there is anything that you are missing. You just described the substance, the opportunity, the strength of the company\u2019s position in etch and deposition both and the specific integration scheme in DRAM is very beneficial to us. And certainly with the predominance of investments in DRAM except for kind of patterning probably being upgrade related, you\u2019re going to see a bias and a waiting to the etch and deposition space by the very nature of that scheme. Mahesh Sanganeria : Okay. And then the second follow up on your clean tool is the opportunity or the veneer or gearing, is it specific to \u2013 is it more towards foundry logic or it\u2019s memory can you give us little bit more color on where you are and what kind of results you are getting by device? Martin Anstice : It\u2019s the engagement is memory and logic both, the win is memory. And the win is front end of line which is an important kind of test for us because that\u2019s the area of the Single Wafer Clean segment there we had been least competitive in the last three to four years. So I feel that it is an important statement from a customer but it\u2019s one. And that is not the definition of success, definition of success is establishing market share leadership in all of the products of our company and we\u2019re not there yet by a long way. Mahesh Sanganeria : All right that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Northland Capital Markets. Please go head. Benedict Pang : Thanks for taking my question. On your 32 billion WFE if I understand you correctly the only thing that\u2019s changed on your forecast from the beginning of the year to now is that 3D NAND is lower and DRAM is higher but foundry is pretty much the same, is that right? Martin Anstice : More or less, yeah I mean there is plus or minus $100 million here there but that\u2019s the headline. Benedict Pang : Okay. And what\u2019s the lead time for your products right now for just the dep and etch? Martin Anstice : Well the expectation from the customers typically is they place an order today and get the product tomorrow. And just occasionally we get somewhat close to that. But the typical lead times for the products in our segments are going to be inside of a quarter. And then sometimes there will be less than eight weeks and sometimes more than eight weeks. And one of the important transitions for us in clean one of the reasons why going to next generation clean is so important to us is the lead times on the clean systems are the longest in our company today, with be old generation and new generation they will be very competitive with the deposition and etch portfolio. So we are much shorter lead time play than the bulk of them if that\u2019s your question. Benedict Pang : Okay, is it fair to characterize the majority of the business in a quarter, is it trans business there? Martin Anstice : We turn a decent amount of our business absolutely in the quarter and that\u2019s through from order placement to shipments and shipments to revenue. We can run shipment revenue turns of 60%. Benedict Pang : Perfect, thank you very much, good quarter. Martin Anstice : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Martin during the January conference call you were talking about the 20 nanometer foundry to be more of the first half and then 16, 14 since that kicking it in the second half. But today\u2019s commentary suggests that may be there is a little bit of 20 nanometer foundry push out into the second half since you described 20 nanometer as 60% of the foundry\u2019s spend. Could you clarify or reconcile the January commentary with today\u2019s commentary and I have a follow up. Martin Anstice : Yeah, No, I didn\u2019t say 20 nanometer was 60% of foundry spending, I said in the relationship between 20 nanometer and FinFET investment there will be a 60-40 split. So there is still an investment in foundry at the 28 nanometer node and even a little at 40. So and there are some upgrade and technical node transition as well as original equipment body. So I actually don\u2019t think there is much to reconcile here. I think evidenced by the commentary from TSMC about their first half concentration at the 20 nanometer and the plans that the industry has for second half pilot line adoption at least the math that I do today would kind of refresh and repeat what we said in January. I think we just provided more color today but basically the same headline and certainly no message to the investment community about delay. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. And then going back to the share gain how should we \u2013 should we assume that the share gains coming against the larger competitors that are consolidating or is that against a smaller one, especially DRAM looking at the competitive landscape may be customers would prefer you gaining share because the larger two competitors may be becoming too big. And this I something that keeps coming up in the conference call but your results showed [Technical Difficulty] any industry, any customer and see significant scaling through consolidation of their supply chain is their staff the risk associated with that and absolutely do I see that opportunity for [inaudible] yeah I see that short term opportunity and the long-term opportunity. And so we\u2019re going to work very hard partnering with customers to make sure that we have the opportunities as a \u2013 it doesn\u2019t kind of detract from the headline that I shared before which is we take our competition very seriously big, companies, small companies, the companies that survive today are generally very capable and very competent. And so we\u2019re going to have to kind of keep working as hard as we are and partner with customers and I have every confidence that the partnership of Lam Research and the customer is always going to sustain the economics and story we\u2019ve characterized today. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it, thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Mehdi. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group. Please go head. C. J. Muse: Yeah hi thanks for taking my question. I guess first question I think you talked about second half being slightly down than first half and I was hoping to see if you can put some numbers around, is that around 55 :45 or how should I think about that? Martin Anstice : Yeah it\u2019s pretty well balanced C.J. it\u2019s high 40s, low 50s, it\u2019s plus or minus our forecasting ability on this so I would call it flattish C.J. C. J. Muse: Okay. And then in terms of your relative outperformance at least how I am modeling WFE versus your number what do you think you are seeing in terms of rising capital intensity, etch and deposition this year as well as share gains that you\u2019ve mentioned on the call as well as the 40 nanometer logic that\u2019s coming in? What do you think those three things add for you that other guys are not seeing? Martin Anstice : Well honestly speaking I don\u2019t spend a huge amount of time focused on capital intensity in the way that the industry mentions it because I think it\u2019s like really misleading. I have no idea what the value of correlating leading investment levels to current year revenues is for the industry and it\u2019s just a bizarre data point from my perspective. But there is clearly SAM expansion for etch and deposition clean and we\u2019ve kind of sized that at about the $1 billion level. And there is clearly market share expansion that we\u2019ve kind of framed multiple times including our analyst meeting and again today. So I believe that the SAM expansion opportunity is bigger than the market share but the market share is pretty big as well. And if we can continue to execute from the positions that we\u2019ve established we\u2019ve got a 5 to 10 percentage point gain in share here through these inflections which is a really important headline for the company. And we don\u2019t kind of go out there with kind of guidance but I mean connecting the dots that we\u2019ve described today and we\u2019ve talked about kind of flattish revenues first half, second half and I try to frame for you the plus and the minus around the average in the second half. In calendar \u201814 we are targeting to outperform the industry. And I would expect if there is a $32 billion wafer fabrication equipment year which is up may be 10 to 12 percentage points or so, depending on the kind of your baseline, I would expect that our revenues grow year-over-year by approximately 20% and if you do the math on that you are going to kind of answer a lot of your question. And if we execute 20% year-over-year growth that means we\u2019re focused on targeting upward income growth twice as much as revenues and delivering cash from operations growth twice as much as operating income. And if we do that we\u2019re going to generate $1 billion cash from operations this year. So that\u2019s how it will kind of walks itself through the financial statements, if the $32 billion year prevails. C. J. Muse: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Shanye Hudson : And then I think we\u2019ll try to take two more quick questions if we can. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go head. Edwin Mok : Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. So the first question is on if I look at logic out of shipment buckets I\u2019ve seen that that has been trending lower over the last few quarters. How do you kind of think about that business is it just a customer not spending there? And I understand I remember a few quarter ago you guys talked about share gain in that area right how you kind of think about long term? Douglas Bettinger : Yeah I mean Edwin one thing you are right it\u2019s ticked down a little bit. There is a lot of [Inaudible] go on in the space especially in deposition so that\u2019s one of the things that is impacting our shipments. It\u2019s not so much that anything has been moving around from the application standpoint is being reused. And obviously you heard me talk about our expectation for June is that\u2019s ticking up a little bit and I would expect that probably does that again in December. Edwin Mok : I see, okay that\u2019s helpful. And then talk a little bit about the ALD when you have on a DRAM. Do you see opportunities for ALD and NAND? That\u2019s the first question. Second part, I understand the ALD part is very different from the one that we had seen in a logic side to the extent that what you have done in logic do you think you have option to grow in logic for ALD? Douglas Bettinger : So I think yes and yes I mean we are going to see emerging opportunities for atomic level control period through traditional scaling and 3D architecture. And the most prominent win that we communicated today to your point is ALD in DRAM that we have active engagements ALD logic, a different dielectric but very active engagements and I would expect that, that continues to be true for us. So a lot of focus and big guys, small guys will try to take share from everybody. Edwin Mok : All right thanks Doug. Douglas Bettinger : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Tom Diffely : Yeah, good afternoon. I was hoping that in your slide deck you talked about some wins in events packaging. I am just curious how big advance packaging is today and how do you expect to grow to ramp over the next couple of years? Edwin Mok : It\u2019s the smallest SAM for the company a $150 million something like that and it\u2019s the fastest growing and it might be the most difficult to predict, I think the 2.5 and 3D in the road map is still subject to some debates. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve clearly prioritized in the company as an important growth opportunity and its being presents with competitive action deposition clean products to pursue that is our objective. But it\u2019s the smallest of all by a long way and it\u2019s growing very quickly but from a small base. And now \u2013 go ahead sorry. Tom Diffely : So have you seen the leaders land space or the drivers being more in the memory or the logic side of this point? Martin Anstice : I think it\u2019s more a logic play then anything today. Tom Diffely : Okay. All right, thank you. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Gentlemen at this time I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks. Shanye Hudson : Great, thank you. A webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website and on behalf of the entire management team I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us here today. We do really appreciate your interest in Lam Research. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

This call is scheduled to last until 3 PM Pacific time and as always we ask that you limit questions to one per firm with a very brief follow-up so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that I will now hand over call over to you Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Carol and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll start today by commenting on our performance in the June quarter and 2014 fiscal year, then provide a little more color on our view for the outlook for wafer fab equipment spending in the second half of calendar 14 and the full year 2015 before transitioning to Doug. I will conclude with thoughts on Lam growth and describe areas of focus for the company, that should provide you with helpful context. In the June quarter Lam continued a trend of outperformance and we delivered another quarter of strong execution across the business. Results topped the midpoint of our guided ranges across all metrics, reinforcing our confidence in our recently updated long term financial models. The June quarter marks the end of our fiscal year, a truly remarkable year for Lam. In a period of transformation within our company and the industry generally we reported record revenues in each successive quarter and operating income that more than doubled year-over-year. We believe that a major theme for Lam in our recent year and more importantly in our future is the opportunity for sustainable out performance. This is made possible through our position and focus on markets leadership in the segments of WFE that we serve, our critical applications growth strategy targeted to deliver leading edge solutions through significant technology inflections and our demonstrated ability to execute predictably meeting commitments to the full community of stake holders. These strengths all combined to provide a path for Lam to create value of substance for shareholders over the next several years, value creation that should accelerate with continued execution in our markets as they represent expanding proportion of WFE due to the primary technology inflections, most notably in areas related to patenting, 3D devices and advance packaging. Overall, we estimate that approximately 25% of total WFE investments this year will be directly associated with the inflection technologies and based on the importance of these enabling transitions to our customers and the current pace of pilots and production ramps we maintain our view of WFE spending within a $32 billion range. For our company due to the complement of our strengths with the spending bias of our customers we continue to remain optimistic that the second half of calendar 2014 can achieve a revenue level reasonably similar to the first half of the year. Although much can change at this time it would be fair to characterize that we expect December to be stronger than September. Now to the segment details, starting with NAND flash memory we continue to see balance between supply and demand of bits as sustainable profitability continues to be a strong customer focus. We believe that customers are supplementing and converting capacity in a very rational manner with WFE spending relatively consistent with earlier expectations. Investment is focused on 16-nanometer and below planar conversions as well as initial 3D NAND capacity. As noted at our investor and analyst event recently we continue to expect planar investments to represent the major of NAND\u2019s WFE spending this year, representing approximately two-thirds of the total. Our outlook for 2014 NAND supply bit growth remains in the lower 40% range. In DRAM we saw continued strength and investments in the June quarter. Strong DRAM ASP with a supply constrained market are underpinning an industry focus on realizing healthy returns on investments made. Accordingly investments are primarily being made to enable the transition to mid 2x and below technology nodes, transitions which we believe offer meaningful value to customers from a very efficient upgrade oriented spending. Projections for DRAM bit growth are approximately 30% this year. Overall in memory we maintain our projection for 2014 WFE at $12 billion to $13 billion. Lastly in both the foundry and broader logic segments our outlook remains more or less consistent with the prior view. The ramp plans for 20 nanometer foundry and 14 nanometer logic appear from our perspective to be progressing largely as expected with a foundry focus on 20 nanometer investments in the first half of the year and the second half of the year weighted to early FinFET purchases and a broadening of participants. Restating my earlier message we expect WFE at the $32 billion level in calendar year \u201814 and revenues at Lam to materially outperform to that baseline year-over-year comparison. For 2015, we continue to believe that WFE spending levels are biased to be stronger than \u201814 with key opportunity and risk being defined by success of latest generation devices, utilizing new enabling technology measured by performance and cost benefits in their markets and the conviction of participants to grow profitably in an increasingly consolidated and competitive semiconductor industry. For Lam we believe that the share of WFE that would be attributed to markets that we serve will increase as technology inflections become more mainstream and represent perhaps approximately one-third of total spending next year by our customers. Combined with this sound growth outperformance, we believe our technology inflections applications market share is in excess of 50% across the portfolio of deposition edge and clean products. We remain excited by this unique opportunity and work hard each day to make our commit \u2013 to meet our commitments and continuously strengthen the trust that our customer place in our company and the individuals who work here. This commitment, out performance and execution is evidenced in our reported 90% success rate in targeted penetration and defense activities in the first half of calendar \u201814. This is one of the most fundamental measures of the trust in Lam and the quality of our people, our product and technology roadmap and our ability to execute. Our momentum, particularly in the most challenging critical applications is enabled by our commitment to invest in the inflections for the long term and emphasis on customer collaboration in pursuit of solutions to their most critical challenges. Execution in these areas is underpinned by the fact that we have shipped 17 new product configurations in the last 12 months, marking perhaps the most active period of innovation in our company, in a company that has long prided itself on its innovation at the leading edge. Our focus areas are on the critical path for our customers and this shared value proposition is providing significant growth opportunities for Lam. Illustratively our leadership in the patenting area is aligned with customers\u2019 need for scaling solutions in advance of next generation Litho, our leadership in back end of line clean is aligned with customers critical yield initiatives. As we discussed in some detail recently we are also focused on expanding our engagement with customers related to their installed based partnering to achieve the level of performance they need to be successful over the long term. An opportunity exists for Lam to differentiate itself through comprehensive and configurable lifecycle solutions, partnering with our customer to innovate through the economic challenges of scaling. That is a key focus for our customer service business group. The capability to rapidly address customer challenges with innovative and cost effective solutions, combined with increasing level of support we are receiving from customers globally is fundamental to executing our vision. Neither the outperformance we have delivered to-date nor the opportunities presented here would be possible without successful collaborations with our customers and partners more broadly through the industry. We thank them all sincerely and are delighted by the recognition we have received for our efforts. As we shared a couple of weeks ago, the next six months are a very busy period for us at the customer interface, supporting them with critical ramps and focusing on the significant number of equipment selection decisions outstanding for this year, staying aligned with our customer on their needs, planning and executing accordingly. As you might expect, for a company that is targeted to grow between 20% and 25% year-over-year in calendar \u201814, in turn creating approximately $1 billion of cash from operations, for a company with a vision to grow meaningfully, through a multi-year technology inflection period, Lam leadership is committed to successful scaling of our company in a manner that is transparent and value creating for our customers and shareholders. In conclusion and notwithstanding the formidable strength of our competitors we continue to believe we are well positioned to outperform in the coming years. We plan to execute to win key applications and with a $2 billion SAM expansion opportunity through calendar 2017 we are very excited about a future of growth. Last but not least I would like to recognize the Lam, the full complement of 6,700 employees globally who worked tirelessly through a complex and transformative period for the company, who believed in the opportunity and prioritized their role modeling, our values of customer first, company and then individual and achieving our vision objective of being number one in customer trust above all else. Many thanks to everybody. With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Doug. Douglas Bettinger : Okay, thanks Martin. Good afternoon everyone. And I want to thank you today for joining us during what I know is a busy earnings season for your guys. Let me just begin by saying we are very pleased with the results from our June quarter which topped off very strong performance for fiscal year 2014. Operating income continued to outpace revenue growth, growing at roughly twice the rate both in the quarter as well as in the year. Gross margin and earnings per share both came in above the midpoint of our guidance demonstrating the strength of our business model. We continue to execute on our plans to outperform the industry around the key technology inflections as well as to deliver on our financial commitments. Shipments in the June quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.160 billion, which was down about a $100 million sequentially but up slightly when you compare to the December quarter. The memory segment represented 59% of total system shipments and that was down from 66% in the March quarter. Within that NAND shipment contributed approximately 20% of total system shipments and I\u2019ll just point we still anticipated the planar NAND node conversions will represent the majority of NAND investments for the full year and we do expect to see an increase in planar investments in the back half of the calendar year. DRAM shipments were strong at 39% of system shipments. That was up from 3% in March quarter. With healthy pricing in the DRAM market and supply remaining tight relative to demand we have seen an increase in spending to support both 25 nanometer and 20 nanometer node conversions. Our successfully product positions from multi patterning applications continue to be a tailwind with respect to the DRAM segment. Foundry shipments were 30% of total system shipments and this was up from 28% in the prior quarter. We expect to see a strengthening in foundry investment in the second half of the calendar year with a broadening of the customer base investing in FinFET pilot production as well as additional investment in the 28 and 20 nanometer nodes. And finally logic and other shipments comprised 11% of total system shipments and this was up from 6% in the March quarter. Revenue for the June quarter came in at $1.249 billion setting a new high for the fifth consecutive quarter. June gross margin percentage came in at 46.4%, an increase of about 90 basis points compared to the March quarter. And as we shared with you in the past business volumes and overall business mix contribute to the variability in our gross margin performance and we expect to see fluctuation in gross margins on a quarterly basis. Our operating expenses were within our expectations for the June quarter at $322 million holding steady at about 26% of revenue. We continue to prudently manage SG&A cost to allow us to appropriately fund strategic development programs that are expected to generate growth in future revenues. Our R&D spending is focused at the leading edge technology nodes as well as the technology inflections that you heard us talk about during our investor meeting earlier this month. We are spending on products and etching our position that will move us further into atomic scale processing. We are spending on products in clean to deliver next generation yield solutions for our customers. Operating income delivered in the June quarter was $258 million and this was up about $10 million from the March quarter. Our operating margin came in at 20.6% above the midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting the leverage in our model. The tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 15% .I do expect this rate to raise somewhat as we move into our 2015 fiscal year. I would be modeling a rate in the high-teens for the near future. This increase is driven by a more significant amount of our revenue being generated domestically where tax rates are a little bit higher. I should point out to you that this tax rate estimate does not include any benefit from the potential extension of the R&D tax credit in the United States. If that tax credit is extended it would lower our rate by two to three percentage points. The resulting earnings per share for the quarter came in at $1.25 and that was above the midpoint of our guidance range. The majority of the upside is attributable to our improved gross margin for the quarter. Our earnings per share were based on a share count of roughly 173 million shares. The share count includes the dilutive effect of 8.2 million shares from the 2041 convertible note. And I\u2019ll just remind you that the dilution schedules for this note as well as now the 2016 and 2018 notes are posted on our investor relations website to help you with your modeling. As our share price has ticked up in the last quarter modeling the dilutive impact from our converts now requires looking at all three of the notes. Cash from operations was robust at $246 million, generated in June quarter and this was about 20% of revenue. Cash from operations benefited from continued focus on working capital metrics. Day sales outstanding improved in June to 58 days and that compared to 61 days in the March quarter. Inventory turns did decline slightly as we added a little bit of inventory for future business growth. Now let me turn to balance sheet. We ended the quarter with gross cash and short term investments which include our restricted cash of $3.2 billion. This was up 11% from $2.9 billion in the March quarter. Cash in the quarter was bolstered by $135 million from the sale of some non-essential real estate assets. We had deferred revenue of $362 million which does not include $34 million in shipments to Japanese customers which will convert to revenue in future quarters. And I\u2019ll just remind you on April 29th we announced that the Board of Directors approved a $1 billion capital return program which consists of an $850 million share repurchase authorization along with the first quarterly dividend in the 34 year history of the company. During the June quarter we spend $36 million on the repurchase of approximately 624,000 shares at an average price of $56.89. We expect to complete the balance of the share repurchases over the next two years. The quarterly dividend was initiated at $0.18 which was paid out on July 2nd. The scope of the capital return program demonstrates the confidence we and the Board of Directors have in the cash generation capability of this company. Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We expect shipments to come in at $1.110 billion plus or minus a range of $50 million. We expect revenue of $1.150 billion again plus or minus $50 million. Shipments and revenue reflect a sequential decrease in total memory spending offset by a growth in foundry spending. We expect gross margin to come in at 45.5% plus or minus one percentage point. We are forecasting operating margins of 17.5% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $0.92 plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 177 million shares. And I\u2019d just like to pause for a moment and point out to you that within the midpoint of this EPS guidance is the impact of roughly $0.05 from the incremental dilution from the converts as well the increase in tax rate. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go first to C. J. Muse with ISI Group. Please go ahead. C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, in terms of the implied guide for second half revenues consistent with the first half, it looks like you\u2019re looking at revenues growing roughly 15% sequentially into the December quarter. And I guess the question there is one, can you talk about visibility? And then two, how much of that will be an increase in shipments versus a drive down of deferred revenues? Douglas Bettinger : Well, I think the first to thing to say is the visibility for something six months away isn\u2019t as good as the visibility three months away, but we certainly, we do our best C.J. to kind give you an appropriate linkage between commentary from the customers and the opportunity for the company. I will remind you that I said approximately similar, not precisely the same. So first half, second half side, I\u2019d be sensitive to being a little too precise in the calculation here but for all intents and purposes we believe we got a revenue expansion, revenue opportunity and expansion between September and December that will be approximately equal first half and second half. We don\u2019t typically disclose our backlog and orders in a conversation like this. Obviously we have to file a 10-K and there will be a backlog number in there. But I will comment the backlog for the company, the difference between the orders received from customers and shipments made to customers has built by more than $200 million in the last two quarters. So we\u2019re kind of building backlog. And frankly speaking the relationship between shipments and revenues is reasonably consistent from one period to another. So in answer to the second part of your question, is it a draw down, it would only ever be draw down if the circumstances of the customer were causing us to respond to their request that way but there isn\u2019t a fundamental message on shift in revenue turns that would kind of undermine the outlook that we\u2019ve shared with you. C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group : That\u2019s very helpful. And then Doug if I could ask you a quick question here. In terms of greater tax generated here in the U.S. how does that change your thinking in terms of perhaps being more aggressive on buybacks and/or upside to that $850 million? Douglas Bettinger : It doesn\u2019t really. The two are not related in my mind, C.J. I mean we announced a capital return program before I really modeled what I expected the tax rate for the next fiscal year to be. So in my mind it\u2019s not inter-related. And again the uptick just to clarify in the tax rate has a lot to do with the fact that we are shipping more systems into the U.S. which has higher tax rate than when we ship them elsewhere. But the two things are independent in my C.J. C. J. Muse \u2013 ISI Group : Okay, thank you. Douglas Bettinger : Thanks C.J. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks a lot. Just Doug a question on calendar Q4. I know that you don\u2019t want to talk too much about it but if you just look at your guidance to grow the revenue between 20% and 25% for the year and you take the midpoint, certainly it suggests that the revenue in December is going to be a little bit better than what it was in June. And I am wondering from a gross margin perspective is there anything abnormal in the shipment concentration and what\u2019s likely to ship in December that would make gross margin or the profile any different because that would argue that your gross margin should be better in December than it was in June Thanks. Douglas Bettinger : You know Tim, I am not going to answer that question. We\u2019re not going to get into giving hard guidance more than one quarter out. I think you\u2019re thinking on the topline is probably directionally right. I haven\u2019t quite gone through where all of the mix would fall out. I would kind of take you back though to the financial model that we out as the best guide post for how I would be thinking about the profitability and the gross margin of the company, Tim. Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay, great, Doug. Thanks. And then Martin can you talk a little bit about are there concrete examples? I know you probably don\u2019t want to get too much into the specifics but are there examples, when you talk your customers that you have gained share or you\u2019ve gain a slot as a result of the ongoing proposed merger that\u2019s happening out there with your larger peers. Are there any examples of you absolutely gaining share as a result of that merger? Thanks. Martin Anstice : There is a lot of evidence that we\u2019re gaining share. Whether it\u2019s precisely a byproduct of the customer\u2019s reaction to a planned merger or not is a conversation I don\u2019t waste my time having with a customer honestly. So I am sure that the value proposition, to the extent the customers are not positive and you will need to talk to customers directly to figure out whether they are or are not. But to the extent that they are not positive about that time \u2013 my personal opinion is that the benefit is more a kind of medium and long term benefit to the company, not short-term. So the simple reason that it takes a long time to make changes to market share of this company and when you get selected or you\u2019re working on a selection they tend to stick pretty well. So I am sure there is an example or two along the way where we might be able to claim that was because of reaction but frankly speaking I think it\u2019s not a conversation that we tend to have. We just focus on delivering the best solution that we can and focusing on established differentiation in the critical application space and we try to articulate that in our forward-looking targets and we try to articulate it at the most recent analyst call by reminding everybody that in the patterning space we\u2019re addressing two-thirds of all the multi-patterning critical steps. And in the 3D NAND conversion we have 90% position on the critical applications across all memory customers and more than 60% on all applications. So gaining share and growing our company is all about critical applications focus and inflections. And if along the way, whether it\u2019s associated with the reaction to a competitor\u2019s merger plan or not, if we gain other business by building customer trust, than we are excited about that opportunity as well. Timothy Arcuri \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks very much. Martin Anstice : Thanks. Douglas Bettinger : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Our next question will come from John [Fitzer] with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess Martin my first question just relates to some incremental news on EUB that was out in the market today, that clearly impacted, I think your stock and some of peers\u2019 stock. I am kind of curious from your perspective if the timing of EUB in your mind has changed all that much. I know you addressed this at Analyst Day but I will be curious again to get a better understanding from your perspective if EUB gets inserted quicker than we think what that might do to that $2 billion TAM opportunity that you\u2019ve talked about? Martin Anstice : Hi, very, very simply my view of the intercept point on the EUB is no different today than it was the last time we were in public domain. And relative to the impact of EUB insertions to the 2017 $2 billion SAM expansion, little or nothing of impact. And that\u2019s just a commentary that I would extract from the statements of our customers. Our customers have almost without exception stated no intercept to 10 nanometers in logic and maybe there is a back haul opportunity but it\u2019s one or two levels, one or two passes. So I think fundamentally no change in view of intercept and no impact of substance to the $2 billion SAM expansion we articulated. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. Then maybe as my follow up, I know you talked about directionally WFE being up in calendar year \u201815. I am wondering if you could attempt to qualify that or at least if not quantify, kind of qualify the puts and takes within the broader buckets of NAND, DRAM and FinFET. And I guess I\u2019m particularly interested in FinFET because the sense I get is this time last year looking a year out the visibility on 20 nanometers seemed to be a lot more tangible than the visibility on 1614 is for the next 12 months, maybe you can address that, that will be helpful. Martin Anstice : Yeah, I am going to resist the temptation to respond quantitatively, it feels too early to do that but as I said in the analyst meet I think there is two or three levels to the conclusion on [BIAS 2] growth next year \u2013 statement of capital intensity. I think in each of these transitions whether it\u2019s kind of patterning, the incremental patterning steps that we articulated or in logic and DRAM whether it\u2019s the incremental SAM expansion that exist in the NAND flash. And even in litho I believe there is an opinion that there is capital intensity increased in a planar to 3D transition. So capital intensity I think is part of the story. I think the general commentary on demand for electronics consumer and enterprise and IC units, if you kind of begin with a GDP commentary is a little bit more positive in \u201815 than it is in \u201814. I think the competitive dynamic that exist in a consolidated semiconductor world tends to deliver two things to us. It tends to deliver discipline in spending and it creates very high risk reward opportunities for growth for our customers. And so I think there is a tremendous amount of conviction associated with establishing market share leadership positions through these technology inflections and clearly calendar \u201815 is the first year of substance when we are going from private line investments into an HVM regime. So I kind of \u2013 I look at the sum of all of the data points that are available to us and none of them seemed particularly negative if negative at all and we will kind of part [inaudible] and maybe by the time we get to the October earnings call put a number out to you but I would say at this point, we expect WFE to be stronger and we expect our share of that expansion to be a positive story as well, remember our view of proportion of WFE that inflection related goes from that 25% in calendar 14 to approximately one-third in calendar 15. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks guys. Martin Anstice : Thanks John. Operator : And our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan: Hi, good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. At your analyst day you mentioned inflexion technology spend of about third of WFE spend next year versus 25% this year. Looking at at a lot more granular level, it seems like you still expect 3D NAND to kind of exit this year at about kind of 6-7% of total installed NAND capacity. Can you just give us some numbers on why you expect 20 nanometer DRAM mix to be in terms of the installed capacity exiting this year and what I am trying to get out is or get a sense for, what is the upgrade tail wind as we look into 2015? Douglas Bettinger : When you say 29 nanometer, did you say 20 nanometer DRAM or 20 nanometer (inaudible). Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan: 20 Nanometer DRAM. Martin Anstice : Well I think the opportunity for kind of sustainable upgrade is pretty significant. I mean our estimate for the end of calendar \u201814 is that there is probably 450,000 wafer starts per month capacity at 3X or above which is a pretty significant number and our estimates on the 2X proportion by the end of calendar year is still a pretty low number. So I think conversion opportunity down to 20 nanometer is going to be a significant part of the story for a calendar 15 and even more so for the company because of the transitions in terms of double patenting. I will remind you that there three to four steps of multi-patterning in a mid 2X technology node, there are 15 to 20 steps of multi patenting at 20 nanometer and 30 to 40 steps at 1X. And as David Hemker, our CTO explains in the analyst meeting there are multiple process for each one of those steps. So I think the story in terms of sustainable investment through upgrades is going to have a very prominent theme for WFE next year and I think it will be even stronger for the company for the reasons that I just stated. Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan: Yeah. Makes a lot of sense and then Martin within our balance first half, second half shipping outlook, last quarter you had anticipated about in and out of the spenders in the second half, looking at our shipment guide for September and kind of the pipeline for the second half of the year, is it unfolding this way, I know you mentioned a broader base of spenders in logic and foundry. Are you also seeing a broader set of customers spending in memory as well here in the second half? Douglas Bettinger : Yeah, Harlan, this is Doug, I will take that one. The memory cap spending it\u2019s the same guys. In memory, when we look first half, second half is maybe a little bit first half weighted. Conversely is foundry logic is a little bit second half weighted and broadening out that we described to you a quarter ago we\u2019re absolutely still expecting to see \u2013 you are seeing a broadening out of people spending out in FinFET, we are seeing some investment at 28 and 20 nanometer as well and it\u2019s more substantial in terms of the number of people spending in the second half than the first. Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan: Got it. Okay thank you very much. Douglas Bettinger : Yeah, you are welcome, Harlan thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great, thanks so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. Martin I hate to go back to kind of the noise of the day, but I think it was important as John Fitzer suggested relative to some of the stocks. Could you offer us your perspective just from a technical standpoint on if indeed the wafers that IBM was talking about processing were processed without any photo resist on them, what exactly that would mean in terms of what kind of test that would be from an industry perspective and a technical perspective? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I don\u2019t think, I mean I can kind of give you some fairly superficial commentary. We are not the experts here, we are not qualified and we don\u2019t know enough about what they stated. I mean I read a bunch of reports. James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs : I promise you, you know more than I do. Martin Anstice : That may be true but the basic headline for the company is the multiple patterning opportunities of growth for us are fundamental. They are real and they are not likely impacted in the 2017 timeframe by any EUB conversation. There is a tremendous amount of learning still ahead of the industry, relative to EUB, very clear and every year that passes, that builds an installed base of alternatives, in terms of etch and depositions systems for spacer based DRAM multiple patterning or emergent litho and X systems in logic, every year that passes, the bigger the installed base is, the motivation for reuse is very significant. And so the economic tradeoff on the intercept actually is even more challenging, not less challenging as every year passes. So I don\u2019t know the people are really processing that but clearly the long term benefit for the customer if the productivity performance that is being described by SML is achieved in a production environments is a good thing for the industry in sustaining Morse law. But in the meantime, we got a lot of things to focus on and certainly in the 2017 timeline I don\u2019t think there is much of anything to talk about today. James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Helpful thank you. As a follow-up you and a lot of folks have talked a lot about the broadening out of a foundry spend and the second tier foundry customers starting to spend a little bit more money. Can you walk us through a little bit of differences in timing on when you may see orders and deliver shipments of some of the second tier foundries versus some of the other peers in the industry and how that could impact you know have one and growth and even how that might affect your visibility into the early part of 2015 shipments to the extent that maybe some of those orders are coming for you in the back half of 2014 whereas some of them whereas some of those orders from the second tier foundries might have come to some of your peers in the earlier part of 2014. Martin Anstice : Yeah, I mean not to be semantic but I mean to the best of my knowledge there aren\u2019t so many equipment companies with a big back log today. So, it\u2019s much less about an orders conversation and it\u2019s much more about the quality of conversation and the demonstrative performance of the customer in that conversation to plan and commitments communicated to us. And there is an expectation in our first half and second half that as Doug said, the foundry business and the proportionate shipments in foundry have a meaningful increase and relative to concentration you know just take a kind of quick look at numbers, there is not a customer in that population that\u2019s outside of the biggest guy in that list is 30%-40% of our shipments. So it\u2019s a fairly diverse participation level and it\u2019s happening at a time when there is a very unique and very critical opportunity to establish market share leadership in a FinFET device marketplace. And so when I think through kind of risk as I said multiple times this year, I think the risk profile for calendar \u201814 is actually pretty low. I mean there is always some adjustment a little bit here or there but that\u2019s in the scheme of things there is noise, where things get a little bit more unpredictable is being able to articulate a view on transitions out of privates line to HPM. I mean headline is there are only so many customers today for the equipment industry, there are only so many semiconductor company spending money adding leading edge capacity and it is critically important that they validate their capability to do that. So that when someone is in the marketplace whether there is going to be a follower or a leader with a competitive device in terms of performance of cost, they can move quickly. And so I actually don\u2019t feel like there is tremendous amount of exposure to the commentary of the company in the second half of the year. I might be wrong but that\u2019s how I feel. I feel like calendar \u201815 is much more challenging to predict. James Covello \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Very helpful. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Jim. Operator : And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hi thank you taking my question. First one Martin just wondering if you could take a \u2013 you highlighted how a third of WFE next year would go the inflection, if you were to take a slag which should be the biggest bucket of spending among that will it be FinFET, 3D NAND or multi patterning DRAM? Martin Anstice : Well, wow I thought you were going to ask me a slight different so \u2013 I next year I mean I have got an answer for the question for the three year yeah, I don\u2019t I am going to rather take a kind of flyer I am going to kind of hold off. I mean clearly in the $2 billion context we have said that the foundry logic transition which is a mixture of patenting in the FinFET device of the single largest portion for us. Next is NAND Flash 3D NAND and the third in this is multi-patterning DRAM. And the fourth is advanced packaging. I guess it\u2019s a reasonable commentary from I just said to conclude that the foundry implications in 3D NAND are greater than DRAM next year but for our company we clearly have very strong participation in DRAM as well. Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then question for Doug if I look at the margin structure, are there any other level for improving the margin or even to be floating around the mid-40\u2019s gross margin and maybe mid the 20\u2019s margin is it purely a function of revenue from here or do you have other levers to improve the margin? Martin Anstice : The thing I understand Chris when you are running a company the scale and scope of Lam Research you got to be driving cost reduction everyday every year you have to be making sure your efficiencies and things like that in the manufacturing and supply chain are being pushed as far as they can be pushed. We got do it year-over-year and we are absolutely doing that this year as hard as we did last year and we will do it just as hard next year, because we have expectations from our customers that they are going to get some pricing reduction. You got to at least drive cost as fast as just mostly in place. Douglas Bettinger : I think I would then take you to Chris is go back to the financial models that we just put out at the beginning of this month. That\u2019s the way you should be thinking about the profitability level of the company we put in the \u201814-\u201915 model gross margin at 45 going over the next three to four years to 46 and approaching 47. That\u2019s a way you should be thinking about things and there will be puts and takes quarter by quarter around those numbers but we constructed those models and tried to be very thoughtful about how the portfolio of the business was going to look. Martin Anstice : And just to add to that, if you don\u2019t do what Doug say if you don\u2019t just float you drown. So it is correctly important to focus on the totality of the thing that influence the gross margin and the operating expenses of the company and we have two levels simply stated in gross margin, one of them is cost and one of them is revenue and the pricing consequences are all byproduct of a competitive environment and differentiation, which is why we make such an investment to position the product and technology portfolio to be as strong as it can be it and it can always be stronger, but it can [in some] differentiation. And the last thing that we think about when we position profitability in our long-term model is what we think is a fair distribution of profits over the supply chain and what do we think is defendable sustainable position to take with customers. As best I can tell economics still represents a significant component of risk relative to Moore\u2019s law in just physics and if you get that long-term positioning wrong you create a customer trust exposure which in my opinion is really high. So we try to position profitability levels in ways that we feel comfortable, just defining at customer interface. And in that context we believe we\u2019re positioned for best customer trust and ultimately best partnership, best collaboration and if we execute in the way that we intend to ultimately out performance of revenues and profits as well. Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, thank you. It\u2019s very helpful, thanks Martin and Doug. Martin Anstice : Thanks Krish. Operator : Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead. Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura: Thanks, great job on gross margin. Doug I noticed the incremental gross margin in the quarter was extremely high. It was roughly 100%. Was there anything one time worth highlighting here in the June period? Douglas Bettinger : No, there was nothing one time. I mean as I tried to describe the impact of different kinds of mix characterizations, different customer mixes, different tool mixes, not everything here has the same profitability. We benefited from pretty favorable mix last quarter and it\u2019s kind of coming back to where it was in the previous quarter in our current guidance. Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura: Okay and then how are you thinking about the share count going forward with the authorization you have in place? Douglas Bettinger : With the $850 buyback authorization we are only just starting on it. We are going to execute that buyback over approximately the next two years and you should assume we will consistently be in the market buying that back. What\u2019s moving against us a little bit right now is the dilution from those convertible notes and even though we were in the market last quarter share counts ticking up and it\u2019s really all about what happening from an increasing share price and the impact on those converts. So we will continue to be aggressive with the buyback. What I can\u2019t control is kind of the note dilution right. Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura: Thanks Doug. Douglas Bettinger : Yeah, thanks Romit. Operator : We will take the next question from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the foundry spending in the second-half. If we can make an attempt at 25 the broadness of the foundry putting in two buckets, 28 nanometer and higher and 20 nanometer lower, can you break down your expectation for the second half in those two buckets. Martin Anstice : Yeah, more of it is at the leading edge Mahesh. The 20 nanometer in the FinFET investment is more substantial than 28 by a decent amount. Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and the second on, I think on the memory, memory has been very strong this year and your first-half is about 55% on average. We have seen a wild fluctuation in memory investment in last three years. Now with the increased capital density will you be able to make a guess at how do you see a normalized percent spending of memory going forward like is it 40% you expect or 50% or 30% in that range? Just a very high ball park number, that will be helpful. Douglas Bettinger : I wish I can help but we are not going to. Frankly you it is getting for those folks who have conversations about memory or cycles again it\u2019s really hard to do that because I don\u2019t know how to do that anymore, right. What I can see is a community of ten customers or 15 that each have their own cycles, that are spending consistent with their windows of opportunity and they are being very disciplined and very effective in terms of operating and the pace at which they add capacity, keeping supply and demand in balance. When I think about extendibility and sustainability of spending I focus on profitability levels of customers and as best I can tell in memory today that\u2019s pretty good. And I focus on the proportion of capacity that is still available for upgrade to known near term technology road map transitions. And as I already said in the DRAM world we exit this year even with a significant level of spending but probably 450,000 wafer starts per month of capacity at 3x or above and in the NAND flash world we probably exit his year with maybe 500,000 wafer starts per month of capacity at 20 nanometer or above. So there are known upgrade pause of near-term significance and those are both opportunities that on their own represent the same type of spending level that exists in calendar \u201814. That\u2019s how I think though sustainability. I don\u2019t spend much time trying to correlate the spending of customer this year which is intended to support revenues next year and beyond with the revenues of this year, I have never understood that. Mahesh Sanganeria \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Douglas Bettinger : Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Mahesh. Operator : Our next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I have a question regarding your comment I heard that you talk about logic be more back half this year I was wondering is that to do with more to do with your share gain in the logic space or is it the customer is not ramping investment. I am just trying to get some color on that. Douglas Bettinger : Yeah, I mean my comment was around our shipments being a little more back end back half loaded. I think WFE and this kind of eye balling it here right now is maybe a little bit back half loaded. It\u2019s not significant headwind but it is a little second-half weighted and memory conversely is little bit front weighted. Martin Anstice : So we have an assumption that in about a $13 billion foundry WFE is the first-half at six and the second-half at seven. Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company: Just to clarify it on the logical foundry or both there is \u2013 I thought you mentioned in logics specially, just give me a little bit update? Martin Anstice : Yeah, that was foundry and in the world of microprocessor and other logic we are to Doug\u2019s points reasonably balanced. Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company: I see, okay, great, thanks for clarifying that. And then any further update you can provide on the Clean products I understand you have it in the marketplace now and you probably start to get customer data on that any update on that when you expect [inaudible] share of the product and how do we start to think about that as potentially a growth driver for you guys. Martin Anstice : Yeah, the first update is we still have one. The second update is we have really nice engagement with the three customers we have talked about I think we have been very pleased with the kind of validation, the productivity, the reliability of these systems some really can performance in fact I would say we saw that up and the performance we had in start-ups has surpassed expectations frankly for products of this maturity. So that\u2019s really good. The process learning is kind of the focus of the company in the second-half of the year and that\u2019s why everything comes together because now are delivering results from a wafer and you are yield, validated yield improvements for the customer. So that\u2019s kind of a critical phase and we have kind of pulled from two further customers and I believe we are scheduled for shipments in the September quarter for the second too who will receive the early our next generation clean system. So I feel as good as we could at this point but I would kind of register that obviously there is a significant amount of process learning ahead of us and as far as modeling is concerned, I\u2019ll remind you that although in percentage terms the clean market share growth plans are the largest in the company. They are the 5% to 10% clean market share over the timeline 316 and 317. There also the market share growth plans which are most hockey stick. So in your modeling please don\u2019t linearize the growth of the company in clean. Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company: Great. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Patrick Ho \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you very much. Martin, in one of your comments and I think to one another question, you talked about how unpredictable it is to get the timing of pilot to high-volume manufacturing. Maybe as it relates to 3D NAND, as you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing more planar conversions in the second half of the year. How fungible, how balance can you be if the customers decide to accelerate 3D NAND versus doing planar conversion how do you react to any of those type of changes? Martin Anstice : Well, as we articulated there is \u2013 I mean we have a great participation in both of them but we have higher share in 3D NAND than we do Planar and we have a significantly greater SAM in 3D than we do in Planar as well. So, I mean the consequence of acceleration of 3D NAND is we got a lot more output leaving factories which means we need to be proactive, ensuring we got capacity in factories to build things. We got capacity in supply chain to buy things and we got capacity in the field service organization to install systems. So because of the uncertainty we end up kind of running a level of kind risk management and has some level of cost in the company we try to keep it manageable but there is a cost to uncertainty. And what we clearly got to do is be able to execute because we put a lot of time, effort and money into creating the opportunity to outperform and so we got to be resource sufficiently to execute it. As best I can tell, in every, every one of the four NAND flash today has invested in some level of planar scaling and also 3D NAND expansion and every one of them has some fairly specific plans of substance emerging in the back half of this year and obviously calendar \u201815. And I do expect the calendar \u201815 is obviously a big year for demonstrated performance and cost benefits of the 3D device. Patrick Ho \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe a question for Doug. In terms of the services opportunity that you talked about at the Analyst Day. What are some of levers for both the cost of goods line as well as on OpEx line as it relates to services business that will help you keep the corporate margins where they are or at least at their targeted model? Douglas Bettinger : Patrick we had \u2013 really the slide that I had, I am sure that showed out performance in terms of top line growth from that services business. I mean that success there is comprehended in that model. So \u2013 and I think you know typically the gross margin a little bit lower in that business but the operating income is actually quite good. So the success of that part of business is comprehended in those financials models that we \u2013 Martin Anstice : So I\u2019ll add one thing and that is a commentary on mix. So and this is kind of where the rubber meets the road in terms of economy of the company. If our focus is on percentage of profitability than selling more upgrades to customers is the right answer because the upgrades business of the company is very highly profitable business for the company in relative terms. But the downside of that is it\u2019s a much lower door than on original equipment sales. So, we try to focus on the long term financial performance which means doing what is right for the customer in the long term is the guiding principle. So, we\u2019re not going to \u2013 flow between new system sales and upgrades on a win trying to manage percentage versus dollars. We\u2019re going to do the right thing for the customer relative to straight off. That\u2019s an important lever but one that responds to the needs of the customers more than it does a particular orientation of the company. Carol Raeburn : Operator we have time for one more call. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from Sandip [inaudible] with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the call. As we think about a potentially large migration of end customer business from one big foundry to another next year what level of capacity build do you expect to see over the next 12 to 18 months and what portion of it would be new greenfield capacity versus upgrades to existing capacity particularly in 14 nanometer FinFET? And as follow up to that, given the competition in foundry has increased dramatically do you think there is a chance of an overbuild of foundry capacity near term? Martin Anstice : I am going to start with the back end of your question first. I think there is tremendous discipline and I don\u2019t think there is a material risk of over capacity. And my frame of reference to that is that\u2019s 28 nanometer technology nodes there is probably 350,000 waters starts of installed capacity. And even with the competitive environment that you just described I believe that by the end of this year the sum of the 28 nanometer Planar and first generation FinFET 1614 is going to be in the range of 120,000 to 140,000 water starts capacity. So it\u2019s doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s anywhere close to a high kind of risk profile. In answer to your question how much capacity to get there, that\u2019s a little hard to tell but frankly speaking most of the last three years have seen capacity editions in one node or another at foundries all around about 100,000 water start per month level. And certainly I would expect that to be directionally relevant for calendar \u201815 maybe a little stronger. And as we mentioned many times because of the multi patterning effects of the company and the positioning in terms of share we shared some out performance potential in that context. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Martin Anstice : Thanks Sandip. Carol Raeburn : That concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us. A webcast of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website this afternoon. That concludes our comment. Good bye. Operator : Thank you. As a reminder that does conclude today\u2019s call and we thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Carol. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll start by commenting on our September quarter results then provide some color on our outlook for wafer fabrication equipment spending in the remainder of calendar \u201814 and discuss some trends that we consider relevant to 2015. Before transitioning the call to Doug, I will share some updates on Lam\u2019s key initiatives that we feel essential to understanding the narrative of outperformance as a major theme for Lam in 2014 and beyond. The September quarter marked another period of strong execution for Lam. Executing on our commitments with results in line with the midpoints of our guided ranges across all metrics continued to the theme of outperformance relative to the semiconductor equipment industry with an anticipated greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth versus an industry baseline of 10% for calendar year \u201814. Performance for Lam Research is ultimately measured by our ability to deliver value across the full community of stakeholders. At the customer interface, this value creation is focused on the leading edge where Lam is helping to solve the most critical, technical and economic challenges related to a set of technology inflections that will define the next several years of our industry, most importantly, multi- patterning, FinFET, 3D NAND and advanced packaging. It is also increasingly focused on the life time performance improvement opportunities for our customer fabs across many technology nodes. That priority is the essence of a focus in our installed base, spares and service business unit. As discussed at our analyst investor events in July, the technology inflections for calendar \u201817 provide a $2 billion market expansion opportunity for the company and a substantial portion of our growth over the medium term is defined by our ability to succeed through these device architecture and process flow transitions. We continue to believe that our market share of the technology inflections is approximately 50% across the portfolio of deposition, etch and clean products. This strong position is particularly important when considering that roughly one-third of WFE spending in calendar \u201815 will be focused in these areas at a time when next generation technology node conversions from memory and logic are just getting underway. Notably, by calendar \u201817, we expect half of WFE spending to be in these categories, hence the conviction we have regarding the opportunity for Lam to deliver a compelling growth story as the targeted market expansion occurs. Our objective is to realize this outperformance opportunity with a clear strategic vision, disciplined operational performance and thoughtful scaling of the company, positioning us to deliver profitable growth in line with the updated financial models shared earlier this year. At the same time, we continue to utilize the strong cash flow generated from our growth to reinvest and further strengthen our product and services portfolio, to strengthen our market position and make possible sustained performance around opportunities as they are created. We remain committed to create value for our shareholders through this investment and also through share repurchases and dividend ongoing. As we enter the final quarter of calendar year \u201814, we expect the second half to unfold largely as we had projected with customer spending relatively balanced between the first half and second half. Spending by segment is largely tracking the projections that we shared through the year with memory slightly stronger in the first half and the second half having more broad-based logic participation. The WFE spending environment continues to feature a healthy degree of discipline from customers and what is today consolidated industry, reflecting what we believe is a continued trend toward reduced cyclicality. Speaking to segment trends more specifically starting with NAND flash. We continue to see a balance in overall supply and demand for bits. The majority of investments for NANDs have been for planar conversions focused below 20 nanometer. We expect installed 3D NAND wafer starts capacity to conclude this year at approximately to 60,000 wafer starts per month level and see a focus and broad participation in 3D NAND\u2019s developments and deployments at various stages in line with customer stated plans. Our outlook for 2014 NAND supply bit growth remains in the 40% range. In DRAM, we see continued strength in investment plans from our customers with strong market demand driven largely by mobile and enterprise DRAM growth. Pricing remains stable. Investments in DRAM are primarily being made to enable the transition to the mid 2x nanometer on below nodes. These investments continue to be from our perspective very efficient, with a focus on upgrades and maximizing installed footprint capability. Projections are up for DRAM bit growth of approximately 30% this year. Overall in memory we maintain our projection for 2014 WFE at $12 billion to $13 billion. The foundry and broader logic segments have also more or less progressed in line with our expectations. The first half of the year was focused on 20 nanometer foundry investments. The second half of the year is more weighted to early FinFET purchases with a broadening of participants and some planer technology investments by a number of customers at the 28 nanometer technology node. In summary, we see the industry largely in line with expectations and maintain our outlook for calendar \u201814 at $32 billion plus or minus 1. As we look forward to 2015, our bias remains in favor of a growth year. While there are many factors supporting this such as publicly stated customer investment plans and nets positive macroeconomic indicators related to consumer electronic adoption trends and global GDP, it is always fair to say that much can change. While we plan to provide more detail on the anticipated 2015 WFE spending level and composition in January, we can\u2019t say today that from industry analysis customer and peer commentary to-date at WFE growth rates in the 5% to 10% would be a reasonable starting assumption. As always, the opportunity here is defined by the successive latest generation devices utilizing leading edge technology in the marketplace and also the ability of the ecosystem to supply these devices in a timeframe and price points that the market will sustain. We consider that our opportunity in calendar \u201815 is greater than WFE baseline due to etch and deposition markets growing faster than the average of other segments, combined with the relative strength of our product portfolio and sentiments of customer support for which we are sincerely grateful. As mentioned at the start of my prepared remarks today, we would like to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on some of the company\u2019s strategic initiatives that have supported our growth this year and will in our opinion continue to drive our future. The focus on solving customer\u2019s toughest problems puts a premium on commitments to significant investments in leading edge solutions and to our customer trust and collaboration level. I mentioned earlier that our execution level so far has translated into what we estimate is a market share of approximately 50% of the inflections, planning multi-patterning FinFET 3DNAND and advanced packaging for Lam Research. With respect to overall market share, we shared with you at our SEMICON West Investor Day this year that we were performing at roughly 90% success rates for our targeted penetrations in defenses in the first half of the year. And that there were many more decisions outstanding through the end of the year. I\u2019m very pleased to report that through a busy September quarter, we have executed well and remained at that same magnitude of customer decisions in our favor. For this reason, we maintained our conviction about the opportunity to realize our targeted market share gains, short and long-term. From our standpoint, the commitments to investments in leading edge innovation will reinforce trust, leadership and cycles of differentiated learning for the company. We focus on technology leadership and productivity which assumes capability and cost are equally important to our customers. One measure of our success is the milestones we are able to achieve and we\u2019ve had several of them recently. The shipments of our 4,000 deposition system from our Oregon facility, the shipment of our 2,000th VECTOR PECVD Module and our 100th 2300 Syndion Chamber shipment for Deep Silicon Etch which we announced earlier this week. The Syndion product allows for the very high aspect ratio of silicon etches essential to the production of image sensors, interposers and through-silicon vias, a market inflection just emerging. We also expect to hit another milestone by the end of this year with the shipments of our 250th Flex FX product for memory high aspect ratio application. Our Flex systems showcase why we continue to build our market share in etch, delivering innovation and achievements with our proprietary [pulsing] technology and best-in-class uniformity tuning contributing capability to sustain our delivery of differentiated results on the wafer. We are continuing to deliver the next generation of solutions that define the leading edge such as atomic layer deposition capability for applications such as spacer-based patterning schemes and atomic layer etch for high aspect ratio etch process steps. These technologies have long suffered from under adoption in the industry because of productivity concerns, but Lam is now changing that paradigm with frequency of new product releases and engagements with customers that are designed to enable continued scaling for our customers. As we move into calendar 2015, we will further emphasize by our actions the priority of staying close to our customer at a strategic and tactical level both, partnering with them on their technology introduction and ramp plans, sizing and allocating our R&D investments accordingly. We remain highly focused on delivering sustainable growth today, efficiently scaling our business, maintaining a strong cash generation profile, and managing our balance sheet to enable execution on broader strategic goals. All of these efforts as well as our capital return programs are designed to enhance value creation for all stakeholders. With the focus of the company as outlined, we think it is hard to find the better position semiconductor capital equipment company to capitalize on emerging industry trends. That is a byproduct of many years of hard work, continuity of leadership, strength of culture and values, clear strategic vision, and solid execution. We truly have one integrated and very capable team at Lam which is inspired to achieve more than ever and contribute to the success of our customers long-term. Let me conclude by thanking them all, the dedicated employees of Lam Research, without whom our performance would not be possible to achieve or sustain. With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Before I share the results from our September quarter, I\u2019d like to pause for a moment to recognize and thank Carol Raeburn, who\u2019s done an excellent job temporarily heading our Investor Relations team, in addition to her role as Corporate Controller. Carol will be handing over responsibility for the team to Audrey Charles, who is stepping in the Senior Director of Investor Relations. Audrey has been with Lam for over 18 years and brings to the role a broad-base of experience in both customer as well as technology management. I\u2019m pleased that she will now be applying her talent and leadership to our Investor Relations team. I think you guys will enjoy getting to know Audrey. Now on to our September quarter performance. We posted another solid quarter, delivering results at or above the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics and extending our positive momentum heading into the second half of the calendar year. In the September quarter, shipments came in at $1,111 million, pretty much right at the midpoint of our guidance range. Relative to system shipments, systems for the foundry segment increased substantially in the September quarter accounting for 45% of system shipments and that compares to 30% in the prior quarter. As we anticipated there was a broadening out of customer spending in the foundry space for a wide range of projects across multiple technology nodes. And I\u2019d just point out that this percentage of foundry shipments is the highest percentage for us since the March 2013 quarter. The combined memory segment made up 44% of system shipments and this was down from 59% in the prior quarter. NAND shipments actually grew and represented 26% of the system shipments which was up from 20% in the June quarter. NAND spending reflected the continued focus on planar node technology conversions. DRAM shipments were down as we expected after the very strong levels we saw in the June quarter. DRAM shipments came in at 18% of system shipments and this was down from 39% in June. And finally, logic shipments held steady at 11% of system shipments. September quarter revenue came in at $1,152 million and has been now running at a level of $1 billion for five consecutive quarters. Gross margin for the period came in at 45.8%, which was a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance and a little bit ahead of our near-term financial model. Our gross margin performance is determined by many factors as I\u2019ve told you before such as business volumes, product mix and customer mix. We should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter, particularly in quarters with high or low customer concentration. Operating expenses were flattish at $321 million. SG&A declined sequentially while R&D spending increased both in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of total operating expenses. We continue to invest in R&D programs to ensure we\u2019re ready for the current as well as next set of technology inflections, which is critical to enable our revenue growth. This R&D spending is focused in areas like ALD and ALE which Martin referenced earlier. Operating income in the September quarter was $207 million with operating margin of 18%, which again was a little above the midpoint of our guidance. The tax rate for the quarter came in at 18%, which was up sequentially due to the geographic distribution of revenue for the quarter with more revenue being generated in the United States. For the December quarter, I would be modeling a rate in the middle teens and for the remainder of the fiscal year, I would be modeling a tax rate in the high teens. And I\u2019ll just remind you if the federal R&D tax credit were to be extended, the impact would be a reduction of a couple of percentage points on the tax rate relative to the numbers that I just referenced. Based on a non-GAAP share count of approximately 175 million shares, earnings per share for the September quarter were $0.96, which again was above the midpoint of our guided range. Recall that with the increase in the share price, the share count now includes dilution from all three of our convertible notes offset by the impact of the note hedge that we put in place. The net dilutive impact from all three notes on a non-GAAP basis is approximately 10 million shares. And I\u2019ll remind you dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling. We made good progress on our $1 billion capital return program. During the quarter, we spent approximately $300 million and took delivery of approximately 4 million shares at an average purchase price of $72.40. We executed these buybacks partially through open market purchases and partially through an accelerated share repurchase program, which will not close until the December quarter. On July 2nd, we paid our $0.18 per share dividend which consumed $29 million. We\u2019re pleased with the cash generation capability of the company and continue to be committed to returning a meaningful level of net cash to shareholders. Let me now move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash of about $3 billion. This is down from $2.2 billion in the June quarter with cash generation in the quarter being more than offset by our ongoing share repurchase and dividend programs. Deferred revenues were $357 million and this excludes $34 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remain as inventory on our balance sheet. Cash from operations was $141 million, down from $246 million in the June quarter. Cash from operations was lower primarily due to the lower revenue. Additionally, we\u2019ve built some inventory in preparation for an increase in shipment output over the next couple of quarters. DSO also trended higher by 10 days due to the shipment profile in the September quarter. And finally we exited the quarter with approximately 6,600 full-time employees. Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect shipments of $1.240 billion plus or minus $50 million. We expect revenue of $1.230 billion plus or minus $50 million. We\u2019re forecasting gross margin of 45.5% plus or minus one percentage point. We forecast operating margins of 19% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $1.12 plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares. So let me just summarize. We\u2019re pleased with our performance delivering another core of solid operational execution. It results in line to our objectives and attracting to our targets as outlined in the financial model. With that I will conclude our prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for Martin and I to take questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question, I have two. Number one, Martin, when you look into 2015 it looks like you are pretty optimistic on FinFET and DRAM. I\u2019m just kind of curious, it looks like this year most of the NAND selling was on planar. Do you expect a similar trend in 2015 or do you think 3D NAND would increase as a percentage of the mix? And I also had a follow-up. Martin Anstice : I think next year we\u2019ll continue to see planar investment levels being greater than 3D. Obviously there is a decent amount of installed base available and I think without exception today every customer is committed to scaling and committed to 3D NAND transition. And as you know there has been a various timing available from a customer. My expectation is that NAND flash investment continues to be very disciplined and in fact I would say it\u2019s probably the tightest of any of the segments in terms of the balances supply and demand next year. And I think we\u2019ll see a meaningful addition of capacity of 3D NAND, but we would still expect planar spending to be higher than 3D. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, kind of curious on the status of your Single-Wafer Clean product for the front-end-of-line. Have you seen any traction or is it a product or is it a strategy you are going to pursue even on just focus on BEOL at this time? Thank you. Martin Anstice : No, I mean the front-end-of-line is kind of largest market expansion opportunity, I mean the company is very competitive in back end of line; we have kind of great position and through the last several technology nodes we\u2019ve been very successful at defending those positions. So the investment levels in clean and the growth opportunity in clean for sure has some back end of line growth opportunities. But in large part this is a front end of line expansion opportunity and we continue to be very engage with customers. Since the last earnings call, we have at least kind of one more engagement to my knowledge. And I would still say that\u2019s the initial revenues for kind of the new products, although there is some evidence of that today in a material context that\u2019s really still a 2015 event for the company. And there are kind of two parts of the decision making process relative to a new product, one of them is the decisions of the company to stay committed to investments and we\u2019ve clearly performed and executed with in mind in calendar \u201814 and then ultimately set decisions by customers to adopt to technology and we\u2019re kind of in that critical phase where in many respect the decision making about the health and the direction of our clean business is more in the hands of the customers than the company. I think we\u2019ve done what we should have done, we delivered a productive platform, we have a clear strategy around kind of difference here, the solutions offerings and it will either demonstrate differentiation of added the customer and call them to adopt our product or not. And I think the next kind of 6 to 12 months is kind of critical for the company in that regard. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks Martin. Martin Anstice : Thanks Krish. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from C. J. Muse with ISI Group. C. J. Muse - ISI Group : Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, when you look back at or I guess we\u2019re still on 4-K. But when you think about outpacing the market, basically going two times, how do you think about the key drivers there? Is there way to rank order by end market or by FinFET or [SAPB] for DRAM in terms of what really drove that outperformance. And then as you think of 2015 and your outlook for WFE, what will be the key drivers there? Martin Anstice : I think really kind of nothing new from the company on this point really, C. J. I mean the outperformance of the company is now kind of a two year work product. I mean we had revenue performance greater than WFE for two years in succession. And I believe we\u2019re going to enjoy the same performance benefits in calendar \u201815 and hopefully beyond. We\u2019ve got a lot of execution obviously. But certainly the set up is very healthy in that regards. And the growth opportunity is defined principally by SAM expansion by the markets of deposition and etch going faster than the average, and the multi-patterning opportunity in DRAM and logic, both the 3D NAND transition and ultimately advanced packaging are kind of the critical areas of segmentation that present that. And we\u2019re working really hard to compound that opportunity by actually executing market share growth in each of our businesses as well in the long-term and the short-term performance from my perspective makes the long-term objectives rational and credible. So the largest opportunity in the inflection continues to be multi-patterning, second largest, 3D NANDs and both of those are heavy etch and deposition intensive process flows and device architectures. So I think the future is build upon the same outperformance elements as our recent history. And as I said in my prepared comments, the success of the company in terms of market share and positioning products and services which is kind of demonstrated outperformance in the last couple of years is kind of building momentum at the proportion of WFE spending by us as the inflections. So this year, I think the inflections see about 25% to WFE; next year we\u2019re kind of at approximately a third; and by 2017 probably 50% of WFE spending will be directly related to the inflections so providing the outperformance potential on SAM expansion and market share for the company. C. J. Muse - ISI Group : That\u2019s very, very helpful. I guess as my second question, you basically saw pretty similar trends first half versus second half. How do you think about 2015 in linearity of spend, particularly on the foundry side given some of the commentary that it\u2019s going to be first half weighted? Martin Anstice : Yes, the only conviction I had is there will be a first half and second half. It\u2019s really hard to answer a question like that. I mean we\u2019ve got kind of a pretty wide range on our WFE number; it feels really too early to answer that question. I do think consistent with Doug\u2019s comments on our inventory builds which you see in our balance sheet in September, we do expect a strong first half of next year and quite how strong it will be is kind of still to be determined but for sure, the visibility through the March quarter would imply that will what will be the case today. And it is really difficult when you\u2019re kind of nine months away and 12 months away to start a timing with any substance on the second half. I\u2019ll take a shot at answering that question if I may in January. C. J. Muse - ISI Group : Sounds good. Thanks so much. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks C.J. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Sundeep Bajikar with Jefferies. Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First one is related to foundry. So, how much 14 nanometer capacity roughly do you think we should expect to see in the industry exiting 2015? And when do you think we start to see more optimized versions of multi-patterning and foundry? Basically something like spacer-based patterning or Intel\u2019s approach, both of which would be more deposition and etch? Martin Anstice : Well, I think to the latter part of the question the kind of spacer-based approach is kind of definitely a trend which is accelerating. I\u2019m not going to directly answer your question in terms of capacity at the 40 nanometer nodes because frankly we don\u2019t spend a huge amount of time getting precise to one node, we\u2019re kind of grouping 20 and 16 and 14 together because to a very large extent the equipment selection for the customers are relevant for kind of all three kind of nodes or half nodes if you want to characterize it that way. But we would expect that according to the assumptions that I\u2019ve kind of given you this up 5% to 10% WFE number, we would expect that kind of the 15% ends with about 210,000 and 220,000 maybe 230,000 wafer starts per month of capacity at 14, 16 and 20. Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies: Great. That\u2019s extremely helpful. A quick follow-up there seems to be a lot of talk around strategic capacity expansion in semiconductor manufacturing in China. Are you starting to see this in terms of discussions around equipment purchases or do you think we\u2019re still sort of in a very early stages of planning a potential build in China? Martin Anstice : No, I think there is actually a meaningful investment and there are kind of a number of expansion plans in China. And clearly in light of the kind of government and region specific agenda, I think everybody is developing and finessing their kind of China strategies and I would certainly say that\u2019s relevant for Lam Research as well. So, we have a very strong team, we have very closed engagement with the customers and I think we are participating well in the spending as it\u2019s going to flatten in the next year or so. Relative to the big on unasked questions where does the government investment end up between device design, device manufacturing or even materials and equipment supply. My sense is in those four areas, there is a meaningful investment level in the device manufacturing, but I think design is going to take a lot of that money, that\u2019s my instinct today. Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies: Thank you very much. Martin Anstice : Thanks Sundeep. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you very much. Martin, maybe first off big picture in terms of a lot of the recent chatter on EUV from one of your peers. How do you see your roadmap relative to some of the comments out there? Has it changed any or do you believe that things are still on track based on a lot of the comments you\u2019ve highlighted in your previous Analyst Day? Martin Anstice : Yes, I think our position with EUV is like almost identical today as it was at the Analyst Day. I mean the customer comments continue to reinforce; the 10-nanometer insertion is not the plan record for EUV. And I\u2019m even reading kind of custom commentary that talks about non-EUV assumptions or non-EUV possibilities for 7-nanometer logic flows as well. Our assumption is that 7-nanometer insertion -- first of all, it\u2019s not relevant to the calendar \u201817 models of the company. So it\u2019s a \u201818 influence if at all. And we think it will be implemented with multiple patterning. And so one of the things I\u2019m struck by some of the external commentary that I read is this kind of like debate in the investment community around EUV and a very simplistic commentary on ASMI winning, Lam losing or Lam winning and ASMI losing. I think that dramatically oversimplifies things. When we look at kind of the base EUV roadmap and the assumptions that we think are relevant in modeling, the impact of EUV on our business at the 7 nanometer technology node, we think kind of two to three passes is kind of a relevant insertion magnitude for EUV. And if you want to be more aggressive, then maybe you\u2019ll see in five or four or six or even eight. But even in that more aggressive scenario, what it does for our SAM and remember the context for our SAM. As long as there is multi-patterning, there is a SAM expansion opportunity for the company. And if you look at the 10 nanometer technology node from the material that we\u2019ve previously presented to you, there is a meaningful expansion of SAM opportunities for the company from first generation fabric FinFETs to the second 10 nanometers. And we still believe that SAM expansion go into 7 nanometer even with the aggressive adoption that we\u2019ve kind of characterized. So, if you want to be extremely conservative about the impact of EUV on the SAM of Lam Research, you\u2019d may size the impact of couple of hundred million dollars. But it is not any more than that from the perspective that we have on insertion even with a 6 to 8 pass assumption at the 7 nanometer technology node. Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus : Great. That\u2019s really helpful Martin. A question for Doug as my follow-up. In terms of the gross margin outlook for December, what\u2019s the key variable for your outlook there? Is it more customer concentration mix or a product mix given that the volumes obviously are higher in terms of both shipments and revenues? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I mean it\u2019s a little bit of all of that. Customer mix actually might be the biggest one every quarter Patrick. But to the extent that things unfold the way we expect going in to this quarter through the December quarter, I feel pretty good about the 45.5 that we put out. Interestingly, if you look at the last quarter, the quarter unfolded pretty much as we expected almost to every single customer. And if that happens, I feel pretty good about that gross margin forecast. Martin Anstice : Just to kind of add a little bit to that and this is as much as you\u2019re going to get on March. I think the deposition portfolio which has a greater magnitude in new product releases which are kind of maturing in terms of demonstrating value and also kind of cost reduction to company, definitely there is a greater proportion of deposition products in our mix in December than in September, so that\u2019s two points kind of part of the story. But the concentration of the business in December is actually not so very different from September from a customer point of view but from March it will be very concentrated. So our outlook right now for March is the top three customers will represent for us maybe kind of two-thirds of our system shipments and that compares with about the 45% level for December. So concentration of customers is definitely going to be a relevant part of our conversation in the March quarter based on what we see today. Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus : Great. Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Patrick. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mark Heller with CLSA. Mark Heller - CLSA: Thanks for taking my question. Martin, I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color as far as the node spending trend within the 45% for foundry during the quarter, are you seeing a lot of FinFET within that and can you also give some geographic trends as far as where you\u2019re seeing spending strengths within the foundry? Doug Bettinger : Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start and then -- this is Doug, Mark, I\u2019ll let Martin on balance. We saw decent amount across a lot of different programs, a lot of different customers, we saw spending at 28, we saw little bit of 20, and we saw some at first FinFET node, 16 FinFET. So, it was pretty broad in September and we expect that\u2019s going to continue going into December as well. Martin Anstice : I have nothing to add. Awesome. Mark Heller - CLSA: And maybe as my follow up, Doug then, can you maybe give us an estimate for the shipment split in December as well? Doug Bettinger : I\u2019m not going to get into specifics; I\u2019ll give you a little color at least directional stuff. I think we\u2019re going to continue to see strong foundry shipments and I think it\u2019s going to continue to be relatively broad based. Dollar wise, probably not all that different than what we saw in the current quarter. I think memory is going to be up a little bit. And probably that\u2019s a statement more around DRAM than NAND; given how strong NAND was in the current quarter. And I\u2019m guessing or I think logic actually, not guessing, logic should be up a little bit as well. So, that\u2019s a little bit of color to think about. Mark Heller - CLSA: Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Mark. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company : Hi guys, thanks a lot. First question Martin; I know you don\u2019t want to say too much about March. But I try to ask you this pretty much every call. So, if I look at the inventory build, it would suggest that you are planning on a shipment increase in March of somewhere in the range of maybe 10% to 15%, maybe I\u2019m not calculating that right, but I wanted to ask you that number one. Martin Anstice : What you think my reply is going to be if you\u2019ve asked me this question before? Yes, I\u2019m not going to give that right now. We are -- I think we\u2019re looking at a strong March and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s strong if there wasn\u2019t kind of more than $100 million bucks or $150 million bucks or $200 million bucks, which is kind of the range that you are kind of talking about. But that\u2019s as good as you can get for now. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company : Okay, great. And then Doug also a question on margins. So, maybe it\u2019s sort of picking a little bit, but the guidance is a little bit below the financial model just a smidge below and that\u2019s due to the factors that you already talked about. But are those going to remain in a fact giving the concentration in March. Should we expect the margin in March to also be below financial model because of the customer concentration issues? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Well, Tim actually 45 isn\u2019t below at least from a gross margin standpoint, the model. If you remember the \u201814, \u201815 model, 45% was the number. So, we\u2019re kind of right there. I think the directional color Martin was giving you as we expect customer concentration in the March quarter to be more concentrated and everything else equal that will be a little bit of a headwind from a margin standpoint. Having said that, if we\u2019ve got stronger top-line that should offset a little bit at the operating income line. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Tim. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations as well and thanks for letting me ask a question. Martin I want to go back to an answer you gave earlier around your expectations exiting next year for wafer start capacity at 2016 and \u201814. One of your peers sort of talked about a 175K number exiting this year, which relative to your \u201815 expectation would mean a lot of that spending was already done. I\u2019m wondering you could just give us your review on that 175K number or help us understand how to put your end of \u201815 into perspective for the calendar year \u201815? Martin Anstice : Yes. Our end of \u201814 number is 130 to 140. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : That\u2019s helpful. And then\u2026 Martin Anstice : So, I mean maybe the difference is the timing of someone\u2019s order placement or its order commentary versus ship commentary, I mean we\u2019re all of that ship commentary as you know. So, hopefully that helps. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : And then relative to Doug\u2019s answer around shipment breakdown for December, is it too much to read into sort of the view that maybe the March quarter or the first half of next year going to see kind of a significant step up in memory spending? And when you look at the foundry strength in the back half of this year for you, how much of that is at the industry level versus you guys perhaps gaining some share? Martin Anstice : Well, it\u2019s relative to kind of the foundry performance for the company. It\u2019s kind of a bit of everything. I mean it\u2019s the level of investments as 20-nanometer expansion kind of occurs as first generation FinFETs get invested and committed broadly across the industry and there is this kind of 28-nanometer kind of play as well. So we definitely get to kind of floats with the rising tide. It\u2019s a very specific commentary from the company around SAM expansion through multi-patterning and also 3D device architecture and logic. And we\u2019ve got a little bit of a share gain in the mix as well. So, as I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times I think the primary story for the company is kind of the SAM expansion story. The market share is definitely a bonus for us, but a very important part of what we\u2019re investing to achieve. You had a second part to the question which I\u2019ve forgotten I think, sorry. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : Memory trends into the first half of next year, it sounds like we can set up some pretty good memory in the first half of \u201815? Martin Anstice : Yes, I think so. Remember we\u2019re not going to give you first half, second half specifically. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thanks guys. Martin Anstice : Thanks John. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs : Great guys, thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. Question also on the financial model, Tim had asked about the model relative to March, I would ask about the model relative to the full year 2015. At the top end of your WFE range, assuming we come in at $32 billion this year at the top end of the guidance for next year, we\u2019d be in that $35 billion plus range. Your financial model contemplates to certain earnings number; I believe that was for 2016, 2017 at 35 billion wafer fab equipment. How different do you think your earnings might be in 2015 if we get to that $35 billion number compared to what you would have had in the model in 2016 and 2017 if you could help us out that\u2019d be great? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Martin Anstice : Yes. Doug Bettinger : We both could give this good effort. All I was going to say and then feel free to add on, Martin, Jim is the time component of that model as well as just the level of top-line also. Martin Anstice : Right. Doug Bettinger : This has maturated some new tools that gross margin gets better as we mature the product line. So there is a time component in addition to just volume, so it won\u2019t be as good where we\u2019d get that spending level earlier than the \u201816, \u201817 profile, should probably be partly in between the two models. Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean I think in terms of the output of the company and the business done from the company, we\u2019re kind of tracking ahead of \u201814 and \u201815 kind of revenue level as many of you guys have kind of made that point. But to Doug\u2019s point, timing is a very significant part, or passing time is the very significant part of the \u201816 and \u201817 model. And it\u2019s not just about that kind of maturing products which is very important but it\u2019s about the magnitude of WFE which is an inflection, it\u2019s about the success of market share, growth plans in the company of multiple years. So, \u201816 to \u201817 really does mean \u201816 to \u201817. So my advice relative to kind of modeling \u201815 is use the \u201814, \u201815 model that we\u2019ve given you and flex it through the WFE assumption. That\u2019s what I would do. And more or less, the 25% operating expense level that\u2019s defined in \u201814 or \u201815 is a legitimate reference point for the company. Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs : That\u2019s really, really helpful. I appreciate that. And then just one follow-up, I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to make sure. Based on your comments you said for March, you would expect the book-to-bill in December to be above 1? Martin Anstice : Yes, I would. But it doesn\u2019t trouble me, if it isn\u2019t, because the magnitude of backlog in this industry today is insanely low and it\u2019s about versatility and flexibility to respond to short term demand. So the magnitude of order placement to shipments in short order is high and these days the conversion of shipments to revenues is pretty high as well. Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs : Very helpful. Thanks so much. Congrats. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Jim. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Martin thanks for the preliminary WFE spending outlook for next year. I know you have talked about 32% mix of inflection technologies. But can you just give us a sense on the relative contribution to the growth NAND versus DRAM versus foundry and logic next year? Martin Anstice : Yes, I feel I\u2019m going to be pretty miserable responding to that honestly. I think I had a version of that question on the last call. And we\u2019ve kind of given you that answer for the \u201817 horizon, the \u201816, \u201817 horizon. And I\u2019ll just kind of refresh that as a reference so everybody has it. So in the context of a $2 SAM that we defined we\u2019ve kind of said that $800 million plus or minus a 100 is in the kind of foundry logic space which includes device architecture and multi-patterning. 300 plus and minus 50 is in the DRAM space which in large part is a multi-patterning. 600 plus and minus the 100 is kind of NAND in large part 3D NAND. And the advance packaging opportunity is 300 plus or minus a 100. And big part of that is obviously kind of 3D transition, three silicon via. So that\u2019s kind of the reference point. Now what is going to be prevalent and most dominant in that context in calendar \u201815, I think the answer to that questions is multi-patterning and logic in DRAM, since that device transition, and we will see a continued deployment of 3D NANDs, but I think calendar \u201816 will be a much stronger play than \u201815 for 3D NAND HVM. I mean I think there will be a meaningful addition of 3D NAND capacity in \u201815, but I don\u2019t think it will compare to the additions in \u201816. And the advanced packaging I would say is going to show up, but it\u2019s probably again more of a \u201816 play in substance than \u201815 at this point. Hopefully that\u2019s some color that you can work with. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan : Yes, I appreciate that. What are the interesting dynamics in the memory segment and that as you transition to these inflection technology nodes, there is actually a loss of capacity, right, for fixed area floor space. So obviously this is true for the migration to the 2x nanometer node for DRAM. I think we\u2019re hearing as much as 15% capacity reduction. Are you seeing the same impact on the NAND supplier as they transition to 16 and 15 nanometer point planar technologies? And second question is are your tools and flows or how are your tools and flows helping your customers to kind of alleviate some of these capacity challenges? Martin Anstice : Well, I definitely think that the impact on outputs for square foot of clean room in the DRAM space is a very relevant conversation and certainly to the extent there are additions of capacity forecasted assumes for DRAM next year. They don\u2019t take the baseline of available capacity up in any meaningful way for the reason that you\u2019ve just described. So, I think we\u2019ve got about 60,000 wafers our assumption for 2015 adds, but those adds just simply keep available capacity almost flat to kind of year-on-year. In the NAND space, my instinct is the conversation is much more relevant in the planar to 3D transition that it is in kind of traditional planar scaling. I\u2019m sure there is some elements, but I haven\u2019t seen it show up permanently in conversations with the customers where it\u2019s huge customer interface is in kind of planar to 3D transition in NAND flash. That\u2019s a big one in terms of complexity of line layout and density of process chambers in a clean room. Harlan Sur - JP Morgan : Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Harlan. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS: Thanks. Hi Martin and Doug. I had a follow-up question, Martin, on the market share at the technology inflection. Do you think the market share at these technology inflections can go higher than your 50% target if there is still uncertainty between this merger, between Applied and Tokyo Electron? Martin Anstice : Well that will be our plan. I mean we\u2019re working really hard to take advantage of every opportunity including any opportunities provided by competitors being distracted in any way shape or form. And if that distraction happens to a merger, if a merger is approved because integrating companies is not an easy skill to acquire it, it\u2019s extremely difficult. We are going to work hard to exploit every single opportunity to grow this company and that\u2019s a time expansion, Stephen and it\u2019s a market share Stephen. And then we\u2019ll see how it plays out, but that\u2019s the plan. Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay. And then just I also have a follow-up question on the financial model. Does the model include higher shipments to a large logic customer? I was just wondering if these logic shipments start ramping into December, if that is also in this long-term model. Thanks. Martin Anstice : All of the share gain opportunities that [Jupiter] has talked about before are comprehended in the model. Say it differently, yes. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Julian for Mahesh. Thanks for taking my questions. Martin, we appreciate that you provided color for 2015 WFE, but 5% to 10% is going to be a broad range I know you don\u2019t want to comment specifically on this at the movement, but we\u2019re wondering can you talk qualitatively, which segments are going to grow towards the higher end of the range which segments are sort of below the range just qualitatively any quote will be helpful. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Well, I think it\u2019s kind of very similar to the answer I gave few moments ago. I think that planar scaling in NAND flash is clearly the majority of spending next year and that\u2019s a very tight specs, I mean supply and demand balance is really tight there and you can kind of see that evidence in the kind of pricing stability and the profitability levels of our customers. I think the investments in DRAM next year to a very large extent is very efficient, it\u2019s about technology conversions. There are performance benefits associated with the shrink, but there is meaningful cost benefits to the shrink. So, I think the motivation of customers to take advantage of an opportunity to invest to improve their financial performance with the cost benefits of scaling, it\u2019s clearly a very important part of their commitment. And there is a pretty aggressive raise to the FinFET foundry opportunity. So, I mean those are the influences that I think are relevant to answering your question for the industry. For the company, our big growth trajectories are kind of multi-patterning and logic in DRAM. And 3D device architecture is very beneficial for the company and that\u2019s valid in the logic space and it will be valid in the 3D NAND space as well. But again to my earlier point, not to the extent that I expect it to be relevant as people transition, as everybody transitions, I think had a pilot into HVM in the kind of \u201816 time line. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Carol Raeburn : We have time for two more callers. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First just on the 3D NAND piece, I\u2019m wondering if you are seeing customers de-commit a little bit from what you expected earlier this year. I think previously you were looking on maybe 80,000 wafer starts, now you\u2019re talking 60,000. And earlier this year you were thinking that 2015 would be the volume ramp year. So just curious your thoughts on customer activity on 3D NAND. Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean, I think all of our customers have kind of more or less said the same thing, right. I mean they have said they are working really hard to extend planar for as much as possible and as long as possible. But I think they are all invested in the legitimacy of a 3D NAND transition and there is kind of commitment by all of them to developments and kind of deployments. I had expected, if I kind of look at beginning of this year, I had expected the performance and the cost benefits of 3D device to have matured sufficiently by the end of \u201814, but the kind of market dynamics accelerated the stated timelines of all four customers that have kind of engagements. And it hasn\u2019t kind of played out in quite that way. And so I think the original commentary from customers around kind of two or three year timeline difference between first adopter and kind of last adopter is probably as valid today as any reference point. So I think HVM transition is relevant in calendar \u201815, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant for everybody. So I think the HVM relevancy for everybody in 3D NAND is going to be a 2016 play. Now all bets are off, if someone is in the marketplace with the significant performance and cost benefits and kind of deployments gets kind of pulled in which was my hypothesis before and maybe that cheers up and if it does, I think life will get pretty exciting pretty quickly. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just thinking about this a bit further. So you identified double-patterning and 3D NAND as your main SAM expansion drivers over the next couple of years. But you have also indicated that foundry spend is still fairly heavy at 20-nanometer right now and that the NAND productions are still focused planar extension. Is there some risk maybe developing around your ideas on SAM expansion in 2015? Martin Anstice : No, I don\u2019t think so. I think we feel very comfortable with the assumption of kind of one-third of WFE being inflection based next year, I think the 28 nanometer investments is kind of supplements all and takes what already was in nodes that was in the 330,000 wafer starts per month range and makes it even a little bit bigger. It\u2019s a lot cheaper obviously for our customers to add 20-nanometer capacity than FinFET capacity. So in spite the fact that it\u2019s a decent number of wafer starts, it\u2019s kind of economic consequence is lower. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities : Okay. Thanks a lot. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Wes. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our last question from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities :  Yes, thanks. Doug, is 50% to 60% incremental gross margin still the right way to think about the model potentially for next year in light of some of the customer concentration you expect to see in March? Doug Bettinger : Romit, I would just redirect you back to the financial model which in \u201814, \u201815 shows 45% gross margin and roughly 20% operating income is the right way to be modeling the business next year. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities : Okay. And then just one final question on the current environment. I guess if I take the midpoint at December, it would imply that revenues for the second half of the calendar year come in about 100 million below your guidance of flat. And at the same time you seem to be more positive on March. So, I\u2019m just wondering if there was any dynamic here with the particular customer program that\u2019s influencing your guidance for December as well as how you\u2019re thinking about the March period. Martin Anstice : Yes, with kind of due respect I went in awful of trouble last quarter to say not precisely flat. And I think a 51-49 profile which is kind of the mathematical derivative of the midpoint is pretty consistent with what I tried to position in the last earnings call. And obviously relative to kind of running the company and making choices about investments in the future, in the growth of the company and positioning to exploit SAM expansion, market opportunities as they exist. When we get these kind of ebbs and flows, and I realize the $100 million is a lot of money but when we get to these ebbs and flows, they\u2019re not actually very material to us in terms of how we think about running the company. And the difference between December and January is not worth of huge amount of anything to us, it\u2019s important to be aware of, it\u2019s important to be transparent on, our commitment to continue to try to do the best we can in that context, so. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities : Got it. Thank you Martin. Carol Raeburn : Thank you for joining us today. Please visit our investor page at lamresearch.com for further information on our company and to hear a playback of this call which will be available later this afternoon. This concludes our call. Operator : Thank you everyone. That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Audrey. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019ll start by speaking to our December quarter results, supplemented by a review of calendar 2014 millstones with comments on their relevance to the future growth and opportunities for the company. We will then segue to provide an update to our outlook for wafer fab equipment spending in 2015. Then more specific to Lam as we enter a New Year that marks the 35th anniversary of the company we want to take this opportunity to outline our focus for the year and provide some context for the multi-year out performance potential that exists as a result of the company\u2019s vision and execution. I will then hand the call over to Doug for a review of our financial and operational performance. The December quarter concluded with results in line with our expectation showing strength across all metrics and reinforcing our outperformance trend for calendar \u201914. Within the quarter we grew our backlog by greater than 20%. Additionally, our deferred revenue balance has increased, which we expect to continue with the shipment strength anticipated in the first-half of 2015. December was the sixth consecutive quarter of greater than $1 billion in revenues and concluded a record breaking year for the company with total annual revenue reaching $4.9 billion. Our revenue growth rates we believe outperform the industry by a factor of two with profits expansion at more than twice the pace of our revenue growth. The strong December quarter marks the end of a very rewarding year for Lam that featured the delivery of record setting performance, execution on our market share gain and SAM expansion opportunities that exceeded expectations and a high level of focus on increasing innovation in everything that we do. In turn, we believe that the differentiated culture, values and management system of the company have enabled effective scaling necessary for making profitable growth sustainable. In 2014, we made meaningful progress against our market share targets, introducing new products and services to participate in the market expansion opportunities of the various technology inflections, including multi-patterning, FinFET, 3D NAND and advanced packaging. We believe we exited calendar 2014 with an inflection-based market share across the portfolio of deposition, etch and clean in excess of 50%, a double-digit increase compared with our total company pre-inflections baseline. Our strong early position, combined with our unwavering commitment to customer trust and value enhancing collaboration positions us to continue to drive our theme of outperformance over the next several years. Evidenced by our relative revenue growth these last two years and further underpinned by our March quarter 2015 guidance today we accelerated our achievements towards 2017 market share targets which call for a 4% to 8% increase in deposition market share, 3 to 5 percentage points in etch and 5 to 10 percentage points in clean. As previously shared we maintained a 90% success rate across all plans, penetrations and defenses in 2014 and as such we believe that our corporate market share has increased by 200 basis points to the 42% level in calendar year \u201814. At least as importantly we conclude that we increased our available market size from approximately 26.5% of WFE to 27.5% of WFE in 2014 through the successful introduction of new products. We\u2019ve always judged our ability to lead and execute predictably to be one of Lam\u2019s core competitive strength. We feel that the results presented today again are evidence of very strong execution but even more noteworthy perhaps a demonstration of execution capability through a period when we are scaling the company real time, preparing for an even more exciting future. For example last year we expanded our investments in fundamental research and C&F activities. We added a significant number of resources in the factory and in the field; we ramped all manufacturing facilities to multiple shift operations, shipped a record number of systems on-time and at quality standards that are ever more critical to our customers, all while continuing innovate at perhaps the highest level in our history, delivering more than 20 new product and service offerings to our customers. Delivering value to all stakeholders was and continues to be a strong theme and we believe a highlight for 2014. We collaborated closely with our customers and suppliers on innovations, designed to meet the considerable technical and economic challenges of the industry. Notably we delivered products such as the VECTOR ALD Oxide deposition system targeted at extremely thin and uniform layers critical to advanced patterning and the Flex FX dielectric etch system necessary for critical high aspect ratio etch. Both products are experiencing unprecedented momentum in the marketplace. For example our VECTOR ALD Oxide system output likely comes close to tripling in calendar 2005 year-over-year, driven primarily by patterning-related application wins. We augmented our strong earnings performance with the establishment of a $1 billion capital return program, which included the institution of our first ever quarterly dividend program. We\u2019re on track relative to our financial model and are very pleased to note that in recognition of this strong financial performance we were recently added to the NASDAQ 100 Index. WFE investment for 2014 was largely in line with the views we expressed through the year. We estimate spending by our customers in 2014 WFE was approximately $32 billion. As we enter 2015 we maintain our outlook of a growth year for WFE investments. The predicted trends in semiconductor consumption, including demand of the leading edge and the publicly stated plans of our customers we believe support this growth outlook, but as is customary I would add that this is predicated on a positive macro environment and healthy industry fundamentals. Our initial 2015 market outlook is as follows for the key segments starting first with memory. In the DRAM segments we see continued strength in demand and a supply constrained market entering the year. Strong market demand continues to be driven by mobile and enterprise DRAM growth, pricing remains stable. This year we see DRAM investments to be focused primarily on conversions to 20-nanometer. Projections are for DRAM bit growth of approximately 30% this year. In the NAND space we believe there will remain a healthy balance in overall supply and demand. NAND ASPs as you are aware declined somewhat over the last quarter but is generally expected to stabilize over the course of the year, reinforcements of continued spending discipline across the industry. We anticipate that NAND WFE investment will include planar conversions and 3D NAND capacity additions in 2015 with the 3D investment being more second half weighted and for the first time the spending level more or less equal to the planar capacity components. Our outlook for 2015 NAND supply bit growth remains in the high 30's. Overall we're projecting 2015 memory WFE spending in the range of $14 billion to $15 billion. Now turning to the Foundry segment; investments in 2015 will be focused on FinFET enablements at a number of customers and some 28 nanometer capacity additions, responding to increased demand for these devices. Our current view of foundry investment is that it will be up slightly from the healthy spending levels we saw in 2014 and again reasonably distributed across customers with consistency compared to fabless company stated growth forecasts. We expect logic spending of $6 billion to $7 billion, more or less flat with 2014, reflecting a balanced and some slightly positive news on PC volumes and a sustained commitment to technology conversions with optimized reuse of the installed base by the customers. Overall, we are modeling 2015 WFE in the range of $34 billion plus or minus $2 billion for the year. At this point our visibility for the strong first half is better than the second as you might imagine and we believe the scenario of a relatively balanced first half and second half is not unreasonable. Of course we will know more as the year progresses and update you as appropriate. Now turning to our goals and objectives for the business; execution and in turn sustaining outperformance remain the guiding principles for Lam in the New Year. We managed the company with a strong focus on the fundamental drivers of profitable growth, value enhancing products and services, scale and operating effectiveness. In that regard our 2015 focus is clear; differentiate on customer trust and customer experience; execute on the opportunities already won to make sustainable platform of growth; gain market share with a focus on atomic level control in deposition and etch processes; prioritize employee organization and business systems development to enable efficient scaling; and deliver profitability requires to fund growth. Putting the $2 billion market expansion opportunity, we described previously in context, LAM's standalone etch and clean product portfolio competed for 19% of WFE. Subsequent to the addition of the deposition portfolio we competed for 25% of WFE at the date of the Lam- Novellus merger closing. On the three year anniversary of announcing that deal we have a product portfolio that will compete for approximately 28.5% of WFE in 2015 and we believe by 2017 greater than 30%. The significant market expansion, combined with accelerated market share gains in applications critical to the inflections demonstrate what we consider very good progress with exciting upside. Before handing the call to Doug I would like to express my genuine appreciation for the recognition Lam has received for our hard work and achievements over the last year. Lam was recognized for its leadership and collaboration by multiple stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, investors, industry analysts and peers. This recognition serves as a powerful affirmation and acknowledgements for the 6,900 Lam employees who unite around the objectives of the organization to make all of this possible. On behalf of the entire Lam team I would like to express our appreciation for the support and opportunity given us in 2014. We look forward to sharing our performance against our goals and opportunities with you again this year. Doug? Doug Bettinger : Thanks Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. As Martin mentioned in his opening comments calendar \u201814 was a year of fundamental outperformance for Lam Research. The focus on market share gains and product positioning to take advantage of SAM expansion, combined with strong execution I think was clearly demonstrated in our financial results. We delivered record levels of shipments and revenue. We grew revenue at more than double the rate of WFE growth and we grew operating income at more than double the rate of that revenue growth. We generated $942 million in operating income for the year, which represented nearly 20% of revenue and we returned approximately $486 million to our shareholders through the initiation of our first dividend and our continued share repurchases. Specific to the December quarter shipments, revenue and gross margin were in-line with the midpoint of our guidance and earnings per share were at the high end of our range. In the December quarter shipments came in at $1.247 billion, which was up 12% sequentially. The combined memory segment made up 53% of total system shipments and this was up from 44% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments were strong and contributed 43% of system shipments, which was up from 18% in the prior quarter. DRAM investments continue to be heavily focused at the 20 nanometer node. NAND represented 10% of shipments and this was down from 26% during the September quarter. The Foundry segment remained steady in the December quarter, accounting for 32% of system shipments versus 45% in the September quarter. Foundry shipments were relatively broad based with investment for sub 20 nanometer FinFET being completed by 28 nanometer outlays. The Logic segment grew and made up 15% of system shipments, and this was up from 11% in the prior period. We delivered $1.232 billion in revenue in the December quarter. Revenue increased 7% from the prior quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter with revenue above the $1 billion mark. Gross margin for the period came in at 45.4%, essentially at the midpoint of our guidance and pretty consistent with our near-term financial model. And as I previously mentioned you should expect some quarter-to-quarter variability in gross margin due to a number of factors such as product mix and customer concentration. I think our financial model remains the best way to think about our ongoing financial performance. Operating expenses increased to $330 million but actually decreased as a percent of revenue compared to the September quarter. SG&A was flattish while R&D spending for items such as engineering program and associated materials for our next generation products increased. We continue to make the strategic investment necessary to successfully position the company for sustainable growth and will adjust our plans based on our ongoing assessment of these opportunities. Operating income in the December quarter was $230 million with operating margin of 18.7%, which was 30 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. The tax rate for the quarter came in at 9%, and that compares to 18% last quarter. The December tax rate benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the United States as well as a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income. A tax rate in the middle teens would be reasonable for you to include in your forward-looking models. Based on a share count of 174 shares earnings per share for the quarter were $1.19, and this was at the high end of our guidance primarily due to that favorable tax rate. I would like to remind you that the share count includes dilution from all three of our convertible notes at this point. The net dilutive impact is 12 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. With the first of our convertible notes maturing in 2016 and given the current favorable interest rate environment we will be evaluating our alternatives to refinance this note. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 converts are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference In the December quarter we spent about $46 million and took delivery of approximately 590,000 shares at an average price of roughly $77. We also took delivery of 278,000 shares from the accelerated share repurchase that we executed during September quarter. And we made pretty good progress on the $850 million share repurchase authorization that we announced in April 2014 with greater than 40% of it completed during the first eight months. And finally we've returned $0.18 per share in dividend distributions to our shareholders. Let me switch gears now and move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short term investments, including our restricted cash of $3 billion which was about flat compared to the September quarter. Cash generation was partly offset by those capital return programs as well as capital expenditures. Cash from operations was $161 million, which was up from $141 million in the September quarter. With the increase in shipments account receivables and day sales outstanding grew slightly. We also saw growth in inventory to support the levels of shipments expected in the next couple of quarters, and I just mentioned that I expect the linearity of the March quarter to be even a little bit more back end loaded, and therefore expect to see a little bit of lengthening in accounts receivables and DSO. We exited the quarter with deferred revenue of $374 million and this excludes $53 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remain as inventory on our balance sheet. Company non-cash expenses include $31 million for equity comp, $40 million for amortization and $30 million for depreciation. We incurred $61 million for capital expenditures in the quarter. CapEx was up in the quarter as we increased our investments in lab and new product development capability. We exited the quarter with approximately 6,900 regular full-time employees. This growth of roughly 300 employees comes from supporting new customer sites, higher manufacturing volumes as well as increases in new product group development activities. So now looking ahead I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1.450 billion plus or minus $50 million. We're expecting revenue of $1.370 billion plus or minus $50 million. We're expecting gross margin of 44%, plus or minus one percentage point. We\u2019re forecasting operating margins of 19% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $1.30 plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 174 million shares. And I\u2019ll just remind you that as we mentioned during the September quarter call, the March quarter is impacted by both a mix towards more new tools, that haven't fully moved on the cost curve yet as well as a heavier customer concentration. These items are contributing to the lower gross margin percentage. I expect this to continue to and extend in the June quarter but I anticipate improvement in the gross margin percentage in the second half of the year. The right way to think about our financial performance over the medium and longer-term remains our published financial models. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator please open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And at this time we'll take the question from C. J. Muse, Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. C. J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess first question, was hoping to get some clarity from you on directionality, I guess the shipments just going into Q2 and the second half. Last quarter you talked about an uplift a quarter out, curious if you could provide some color on that front and what the key moving parts are and assumptions? Martin Anstice : I guess the answer to that question is once bitten twice shy. I think one reason I did share perspective today CJ around kind of backlog is I think it should kind of tell you something about the trajectory of the company and the industry spending kind of out, that we have but I am going to kind of avoid a level of specificity at this point in time for the June quarter. I do think and I think I mentioned in this in my prepared comments that the outlook for the first half is reasonably clear to us and pretty strong and there is still a lots of months left in the year for us to get really specific about the second-half. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable seeing we haven\u2019t a short reasonable [ph] balance this year. C. J. Muse: Okay, and I guess as a quick follow-up, Doug can - you talked a little bit about the up lift in OpEx, came in a little bit higher in the December quarter and then relative to the guide you know roughly $8 million to $10 million higher as well. So just curious are these one-off programs associated with specific customers or is this a slightly new trend line that we should be thinking about going forward? Doug Bettinger : No, I mean the right way to think about, kind of our levels of spending are what we perceived to be our sustainable level of profitability. Yeah, we were a little bit below that operating income but I don\u2019t think 30 basis points is too much. We are ramping up some of our R&D activity as I kind of indicated in my prepared remarks which is part of what you are seeing go on in the March quarter. But the right way to think about how we intend to spend money will be to be roughly consistent with financial models that we put out. And right now we do have a little bit of gross margin headwind that I described but the spending level is still pretty well within those models. Martin Anstice : I think as just to add, I think Doug\u2019s prepared comments that kind of describes the addition of headcount, also need to be put in context. And so I don\u2019t spend a huge amount of time talking about this because I think across the industry it\u2019s not a very easily comparable benchmark but for the company a revenue per employee trajectory is not an unreasonable reference for you to be thinking about. And in fact through the December quarter and the March guidance that we have given today, the revenue per employee is getting better not worse. So I mean I think the context for spending more money is the growth of the company is pretty significant and our focus as a leadership team is making sure we are effective doing that, before we start worrying about efficiency, which doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t try to do both. But the customer trust exposure for getting a ramp wrong is not a risk we are biased to take - we are biased to get this effective so that we can kind of really, really kind of deliver sustainability for the story that we are telling here today. C. J. Muse: Very helpful, thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks, CJ. Operator : At this time we will take a question from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. James Covello : Great, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congratulations on the good results. Obviously you guys don\u2019t talk about orders on the call but the shipments going up quite a bit would suggest order activity overall is healthy over the last couple of quarters. Can you talk about any pushes or pulls in order activity overall, obviously your guidance for shipments is a little bit stronger. Is there any movement within that one way or other in the various sub-segments? Martin Anstice : Thanks Jim for your comments at the beginning. I don\u2019t think that this anything new for us to communicate. I think the industry generally saw a little bit of a push on some foundry investments, saw a little bit of a pull on some DRAM investments and the rest of the industry more or less kind of played out in the way we had expected. I do think it is a little bit more concentrated shipment number for us from a customer perspective then even we were anticipating in the October timeframe relative to March \u201915. But I think those messages are messages that are well communicated right now by the rest of the industry. James Covello : That\u2019s very helpful. And I mean I guess it\u2019s always hard to distil the industry down, there a couple of things alone that we should be looking for, but is it fair to say that your memory margins are probably going to dictate, if we do get that balanced half on half, if memory margins stay high we would expect continued investments in that segment but if there was any deterioration there we would run the risk that the back half is a little softer. Is that one key thing that you would be looking at? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I think sustained discipline is something we continue to see, is something we continue to hear from the customers and it\u2019s something we continue to expect. But I think kind of history tells us if this gets ahead of itself in a significant way then there is always, at a minimum some kind of pause. Where, we don\u2019t expect that, we expect continued discipline in every segment of the industry and we kind of come into the year pretty tight almost everywhere. And from, as best I can tell, the inventory levels and the industry commentary are, from our customers on inventory kind of supports continued discipline that I think at some level is a byproduct of a consolidated industry. James Covello : Very helpful. Thanks a lot and good luck. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Jim. Operator : And at this time will take a question from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Martin, first in terms of overall memory spending in the year, do you see it biased first half versus second half in terms of DRAM, maybe potential be more first half weighted while you see DRAM flash more second half weighted or do you see kind of a balanced spending across both segments throughout the year? Martin Anstice : So I kind of have two answers to your question. One of them is kind of from the bottoms up forecasting and planning, which is always a little bit limited, when you start kind of focusing on something six months from now and nine months from now but our bottoms up analytics would tend to support what you just described, which is a slightly stronger first half for DRAM and a slightly stronger second half for NAND. But frankly when is all is said and done here I think we're likely to see a little bit of strengthening in the second half but time will tell, that may play out, it may not play out but the basic premise that you just described. And I guess the only other thing I'd supplement with is perhaps compared to the commentary from the company three months ago, where we articulated we expected planar spending in NAND flash to exceed 3D. We're kind of making the statement today that as best we can tell it looks more likely to be equal and the planar investment in NAND flash is biased the first half and the 3D investments in NAND flash is biased the second half. Patrick Ho : Great, that's really helpful. Maybe and my follow-up question, more for you Doug in terms of just kind of OpEx levels and how we look at the longer term business model. One of the areas you talked about at your Analyst Day was building out your installed base business and the services front. With IOT kind of gaining momentum a lot more verbiage out there, how do you see, I guess your growth in terms of that business segment and in terms of the OpEx that maybe needed to support the growth over the next few years. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, you may remember Patrick we talked about or I tried to talk about our objective with the installed base business is to grow at faster than the new equipment market, right. So there was a graph where I showed that. Consistent with that we are growing a little bit of spending in that business group this year over and above what was there last year to go try and take advantage of those opportunities. So that is part of the investments when I talk about opportunities that are out there. We do believe we see opportunities to generate returns and the spending is up there a little bit. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Patrick. Operator : At this time we'll take the question from Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, guys, thanks. I jumped on here a little bit late, but my first question is around the inventory. Doug if I look at, just look at days, days are up to like 125 and I am wondering if that portends some view on June. I know you don't want to say too much about June, but I am wondering if that portends some view that maybe June shipments are going to be up? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, I am not going to give you kind of what June looks like. I did describe purposely in my prepared remarks that we expect shipments to be strong in the next couple quarter, without giving you a direction from March to June. And we've built inventory in anticipation of that. So you should expect that those inventory levels come down in the back half of the year likely, but expect us to update that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, Tim. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, and then I just had two more quick ones. First of all Doug, just can you give us some sense of what you think the mix will be for shipments in March and then I wanted to know also, if all things equal, so let's just say shipments were flat in June, I just wanted to try to isolate the customer concentration issue that's bringing down margins in June. Would margins come right back up to the model in March, would margins come right back up to the model in June, absent this customer concentration issue. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, so I think directionally in the March quarter, memory shipments are going to be up as a percent, logic is probably flattish, maybe down a little bit and I think foundry will be down a little bit, when you put all that together and by the way those are system shipments. I kind of indicated, I think the customer concentration piece continues into the June quarter a little bit and then my expectation is in the back half of the year the gross margins move backup from where they are. It\u2019s hard to call things move around Tim, as you know in this business. But as we sit here today I think we are going to continue to see some concentration in June, might be a little bit less than it is in March but this stuff moves around quite a bit. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks so much. Martin Anstice : Thanks Tim. Operator : At this time we will take a question from a Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : Thanks, hi Martin and Doug, nice results last year too. I had a follow-up question on the 3D NAND spend in the second half of the year. Just curious if you think the spend on 3D NAND in the second half will be mostly driven by one customer, or you think it\u2019s equally spread across the customer base? It\u2019s been a long time since we have seen any meaningful 3D shipments too, I guess or starting [ph] customers, just curious on the diversity you are looking at? Martin Anstice : I would say there is clearly an expectation that one of the customers, well publicized is kind of in the lead from kind of an investment timing perspective. But we expect this year to have kind of a diverse spending and anticipate all four NAND flash memory companies participating in a meaningful way. So I expect the spending to be more distributed in \u201815 than it was in \u201814 and just to kind of give you a little bit of a number on capacity we expect to be shipped in. So I think in the last call I mentioned that we were thinking that we ended the calendar \u201814 year with approximately 60,000 wafer start, 65,000 wafer start, of shipped-in capacity 3D NAND. And as best we can tell that more or less kind of played out as anticipated and we think by the end of \u201815 that 130,000 wafer starts plus or minus 10 is not a bad kind of reference point to have. Stephen Chin : Okay, thanks for sharing those numbers. So it sounds like if Lam were to outgrow WFE again this year, it sounds like 3D NAND spend in the industry is strong in the second half of the year. That\u2019s probably one of the main ways that you outgrow the industry this year, does that - seems like that\u2019s one of the messages? Martin Anstice : Well from an inflection point of view the 3D NAND inflection is not insignificant, as we\u2019ve talked about before and from a timing point of view it plays a pretty meaningful role in the year-over-year comparison. But that\u2019s also true by the way for the multi-patterning transition as well. I would say the only inflection that doesn\u2019t kind of really get traction of substance to have kind of a material impact on the kind of outperforming characteristics of the company is advanced packaging, which isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t a positive story, because I actually think that the advanced packaging revenues of the company have [indiscernible] kind of doubling year-over-year but the scale of that compared to multi-patterning and then the 3D NAND transition is kind of obviously very different and meaningfully lower. So yeah, I think our performance is a commentary on the 3D NAND and FinFET and multi-patterning transitions in DRAM and logic both, and it is a commentary on market share momentum in the company which we are, I think accelerated, it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s slowing or stagnating, it feels to me like the market share momentum is actually accelerating. This is kind of something we\u2019ll work very hard to sustain. Stephen Chin : Thanks, Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : At this we will take a question from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg : Hi, just wanted to follow-up on the last comment related to DRAM multi-patterning as being one of the drivers. Wondering as the industry works through the 20-nanometer conversions and add the additional etch tools for multi-patterning, is there some risk to etch intensity for DRAM in the following years as they kind of - as maybe the incremental etch opportunity slows down given that they would have more etch tools for use? Martin Anstice : I think the reality is that even after the investment that we\u2019ve described in calendar \u201815 and our best estimate is approximately 400, maybe 400 to 440 or 410 to 430, hard to be specific at this point, is the kind of 1,000 wafer start conversion, approximately of the industry. There is much more than that at the end of calendar \u201915, still in need of conversion to the 20 nanometer technology node. So to the extent there is a risk in the form that you are describing it I don't think it shows up in calendar '16. It has the shortest showing up in calendar '17 but a lot is going to change between now and '17 relative to the roadmap of DRAM. So it's not something that's a particularly prominent kind a risk factor for us in the scheme of things. Weston Twigg : Okay so in other words the same drivers that you see today, the 3-D NAND, FinFET, the DRAM multi-patterning, you expect those to be pretty consistently strong over the next two years? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I mean I think the context to one of the earlier questions is the discipline and the balance, the supply and demand balance, but we had a number of years to demonstrate the performance on that. So I think we're getting to a point where trusting that is the legitimate assumption it is much more balanced. Weston Twigg : Great. Thank you very much. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : At this time we'll take a question from Sundeep Bajikar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sundeep Bajikar : Hi guys thanks for taking my question. First just following up your comments on heavier mix of new tools expected in the first half, can you say which end market these new tools are targeting? Doug Bettinger : Martin referred to 20 new tool introduction last year, I mean it's that. So it's obviously broad based. If I had to give you a little bit of color it's probably more biased towards our deposition product group then it is the etch product group in terms of new tools that are coming out, given some of these inflections that are happening there is a little bit more going on there. Sundeep Bajikar : Okay great. And then a quick follow-up on foundry. Are you continuing to see activity in the 14 nanometer node, and how much 14 nanometer capacity do you expect to see exiting the year? Martin Anstice : So the answer to the first part of that is yes. And I said before we are not kind of distinguishing the 14, 16 capacity additions from the \u201820 because there are so much of an overlap of the equipment portfolio, 90% to 95% of the equipment is kind of in a track [ph] from the last planar node to the first FinFET node anyway. So our assumption is that we exit 2015 with somewhere between 200,000 and 220,000 wafer starts of combined capacity 2016 and '14. Sundeep Bajikar : Thank you so much. Martin Anstice : Thanks Sundeep. Operator : And at this time we'll go to Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar : Yeah, hi thanks for taking my question. And thanks for the color on the SAM and share gains that you guys highlighted for last year. Two quick questions, first one, Martin in the past you\u2019ve spoken about a third of the WFE spending this year might be for tech inflection. Curious if that is still the view or do you think that would change given the challenges people are having at FinFET and 3D NAND? I also have had follow-up after that. Martin Anstice : No, I don't think there is a fundamental challenge. Instead of maybe 33, maybe we end up saying it\u2019s 31 or something like that, or 32 is the byproduct of the 3D NAND kind of assumption set, kind of delaying from '14 to '15 a little. But the fundamental message, I think is exactly same today as it was before and the kind of end gains to the extent we are describing one of calendar '17, the 50% kind of spending proportion on the inflection is still the assumption we're running with. Krish Sankar : Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick question for Doug. What is your mix of on-shore versus offshore tax and what do you think is the right amount of cash to run the business? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Krish, it's somewhere between 20% to 25% onshore, as we sit here today and obviously then 75% to 80% offshore. And as always we're thinking through how to fund that $1 billion capital return program and I previously said we can fund that with the cash that we have in that program. I think it's a pretty significant program in terms of returning cash. And once we get through the current authorization you will hear us talk about what are our plans as we go forward. So pretty comfortable with the level of cash. It's been pretty flat in gross terms over the last couple of quarters and that's because we've been returning cash to shareholders. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, thanks Krish. Operator : And at this time we'll take a question from Mark Heller with CLSA Equity Research. Mark Heller : Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the strong results. Martin I was just wondering if you could update us on the DRAM, the outlook for the DRAM sector in terms of new capacity additions this year. I think previously you were talking about maybe 50,000 to 60,000 starts. I am just wondering if that\u2019s still the case for this year. Martin Anstice : Yeah, I think maybe we would probably say more 60 than 50, but I think a number of customer have said most recently as well that addition frankly does not do more than keep the available output kind of constant because in the technology transitions from the 3x range to the mid-20 and to 20 there is kind of loss per kind of square foot of clean room in terms of output. So the assumptions that we are making is the investments of 60,000 wafer stocks or so is maybe it\u2019s a little higher, maybe it\u2019s 60-70, that range but it\u2019s not a 100,000 wafer stocks of additional or anything like that. It essentially kind of keeps the output potential constant year-over-year. Mark Heller : Got it. And then it looks like the shipments to Korea picked-up quite a bit during the quarter. I am just wondering if that\u2019s more weighted to foundry or memory spending. Thanks. Martin Anstice : In the interest of not being specific to any one customer we are going to kind of elect not to answer that question directly please. Mark Heller : Thanks. Martin Anstice : But Mark you can just listen to what I said in my prepared remarks and kind of get some level of indication from there. Operator : At this time we will take a question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. So a question on the foundry. I think I know you talked about visibility in the first half is good. How\u2019s your visibility in the second-half? And if a customer decides to go with FinFET this fall do you think there is enough capacity to handle that right now or do you think more equipment needs to be ordered from here? Martin Anstice : Well, that\u2019s a little hard to answer without kind of getting into a lot of details in terms of a demand statement for those devices. I guess the headline for us is we kind of trust the substance of communication from the customer. I think everybody is saying that in the interest of keeping everything in balance and so what we are communicating is our best understanding of their investment plans, which as I said it\u2019s in the kind of 200,000 to 220,000 wafer starts installed capacity by the end of this calendar year for 2016 and \u201814 combined. So. If the customer is underestimating the demand for that device then I think there will need to be more investment. It doesn\u2019t show to me like there is risk, that they are over investing it. I think it\u2019s pretty reasonable commentary on outlook as best we can tell. Sidney Ho : Okay, and a follow-up, maybe this one is for Doug, you talked about the customer concentration in Q1. Does it happen every Q1, is that - it just happened that the stars are aligned this quarter, or you think it\u2019s a byproduct of a more concentrated customer base? Martin Anstice : I don\u2019t know if there is seasonable profile to it per se, Sidney. I mean this is more concentrated then I can recall seeing it in the two years I have been with the company. So I think this is over and above where you would normally expect it to be. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Sidney. Operator : At this time we will take a question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on a great quarter. Martin, one question on the 2015 WFE, at the last quarter earnings call you had indicated WFE to be up 5% to 10%. Now it seems you are indicating it up flat to up 13%. Just wanted to understand why you are broadening the range? What are some of the factors that have kind of increased the variability in 2015? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I don\u2019t know that I kind of read too much into it. I mean I think kind of our headline is the outlook that we described in percentages three months ago is not so far away from the outlook we are describing for dollars. And it\u2019s kind of pretty customary for the company to start the year with a plus or minus $2 billion and it\u2019s kind of out in the middle of the year now in that range to plus or minus a $ 1 billion. So we\u2019ve just kind of done our best to translate the outlook of three months into a customary form of guidance I think what has changed is from the kind of public disclosure of the customer, some kind of foundry spending expansion and kind of DRAM more less the way it was and commentary from the micro-processor space of the importance of reusing their overall strategies. But the 34 plus or minus two is just a commentary on we\u2019re at the beginning of the year and lots can change and we are doing our best to tell you what we think the range is. Farhan Ahmad : Got it, thank you. And then one question on NAND. You mentioned the spending on the planar versus PD should be about balanced this year. I wanted to ask about the planar spending this year. How much of the capacity do you think will go through a planar node transition this year? Martin Anstice : Again, I've come to appreciate that, that level of specificity gets a little bit close to the sensitive disclosure of the customers, given there are only so many. So if you may allow me I'm going to kind of defer that question to our customers. Farhan Ahmad : Got it. Thank you. That's all I have. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : At this time we'll take a question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats for a great quarter. So first on the SAM expansion commentary, Martin you had - that you believed your SAM would expand about 30% of WFE by 2018. I guess two parts question, first is how much are you baking in, help [ph] greenfield 3D NAND investment versus converting excess planar to 3D? And the second part to it is does that factor in some kind of adoption of EUV? Martin Anstice : Well, first of all we said 2017, not '18 relative to last part of your question, EUV we don't believe has any relevance of substance in 2017 timeframe by virtue of the stated plans of the customer not to have an EUV kind of adoption until kind of the 7 nanometer technology node at the earliest. And I think we kind of gave you some color on that the last quarter. Relative to 30% as being a legitimate target for our company, from a proportion of WFE, that's available to us, there of course is some assumption associated with how the customer builds 3D NAND capacity, but we are not assuming a very grand, I would say conversion of kind of the planar installed base that sits at more than a million wafer starts from their capacity today. So and I think there is a lot of learning still in the industry to kind of know quite what 3D devices get targeted to in terms of end markets and how fast that conversion will play out. But we haven't kind of - we haven't assumed a grand conversion of the installed base. We're trying to estimate as best as we can an efficient way for the customer to establish that capacity. So we tend to bias a conversion assumption rather than an addition assumption for the industry generally, but as you know every customer is slightly different relative to answering that question and there are some that are very focused on addition, and there are others that are very focused on conversion. Unidentified Analyst : Great that's very helpful. And then just quickly touch on the clean side, you guys have a new product, just any kind of update on how that's coming along. And as that product assuming that's still later year part of this year which I think was your target right, where do we expect first initial adoption, is it foundry DRAM or NAND? Martin Anstice : So, frankly three months is a really short term period of time in the context of kind of new products and new markets. And I don\u2019t have so much more to say than I did - today than I did in October and maybe the one exception is for the kind of new product, the ES [ph] product we have had kind of repeat order of the penetrations that we made for one customer which is, I think, a meaningful statement of validation, but it isn\u2019t everything we need and so what we need is kind of an industry, to kind of make that choice as well as a couple of customers and this is the year where I think the decisions of the customers will define the legitimacy of this strategy and plans of the company. I think the company has done a really good job in delivering the productivity differentiation and getting us process capability for a front end of line clean growth opportunity. But just because the company does, it doesn't mean the customers are going to be invested in that selection of that adoption and we're doing our best and as you said this is the year that it kind of really plays out one way or the other. Audrey Charles : Okay, operator we have time for two more questions today. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Mahesh Sanganeria : Thank you very much. I had a question on the foundry commentary you made that spending is up flat to up slightly. TSMC guided for 20% increase in CapEx. So I'm assuming other customers are probably reducing the spending. Can you talk about where the cut is coming from, is that other customers, is it in the FinFET area or they\u2019re reducing the investment in mature technologies? Martin Anstice : I don\u2019t know that I can easily answer that question. I mean we are assuming that all of the foundry customers are making investments in this calendar year and we\u2019re assuming that at least two-thirds of the wafer starts in the industry are getting added at the 14, 16-nanometer technology node. And as you\u2019ve heard from two of those customers I think the 28-nanometer demand is not insignificant. So that\u2019s kind of in the mix as well. Mahesh Sanganeria : Okay, so my follow-up I just want to revisit the financial model you presented at Analyst Day mostly in terms of revenues at $32 billion, you were targeting 5.1. I think that was probably towards the end of 2015 and I don\u2019t think we have the right number - we don\u2019t have the precise number for 34. So according to that model where will you be at $34 billion revenue? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Mahesh I am not going to give you a new model, as I sit here right now but I will give you a little color around it. The one thing to think about is there is a level of WFE context in the model. There is also a time component to the model right, because there is a maturation of some of these new tools that are coming out. Both of those items are very important to the attainment of the financial model and if you recall we kind of showed a $5.6 billion, \u201816-17 model that got a percentage point better than the \u201814-\u201815 model and we are probably somewhere in between each of that once we get through some of these tool maturations but we need the time to get through those. Mahesh Sanganeria : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Mahesh. Operator : Our final question will be from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for squeezing me. Martin, going back to your DRAM bit commentary, what are the key assumptions for that 30% bit growth and I say that because earlier this morning Hynix talked about 25%. I think Micron is also talking about 25% bit growth. So I am just trying to better understand the underlying assumption in your view? And I have a follow-up. Martin Anstice : Yeah, I mean the assumption is when we kind of add up the collective disclosure from customers and kind of what\u2019s available to us kind of, from being kind of inside of the industry and participating kind of real time, that\u2019s the best assumption we can give you. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay, and then for the purpose of modeling, Doug how should I think about working capital requirement, how does the inventory changes from the December into the March quarter? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, just the fact that the denominator goes up even if inventory is flattish, which it probably is going to be. You will have inventory turns and days come down. Directionally inventory is going to trend down, I think as we go through the year, as we\u2019ve built into this level of shipments. So a little bit of color for you to think about as you model it. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay, thank you. Audrey Charles : Operator, I think actually we have time for a couple more. Operator : Okay, thank you. At this time we\u2019ll move to Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the $34 billion WFE outlook, Martin can you talk about the swing factor that can take it to $36 billion or the high end of the range? Which segment can take it to that range\u2026? Martin Anstice : Yes I guess anyone can in theory. I think the 3D NAND conversion is more likely to influence in a positive direction than anything and that\u2019s really a statement on the size of that transition and the implications of it and obviously the degree of uncertainty that exists in terms of kind of market penetration of that device at this time. So I do think kind of FinFET conversions can accelerate, if there is kind of momentum that it is in excess of stated plans in terms of going from planer to a FinFET device, but it feels to me like the upside is kind of greater in memory than foundry logic and greater in NAND than DRAM. But I guess in theory all of them can move in a positive direction. Atif Malik : Got it. And then on the timing of EUV insertion, one of the foundries has taken a pilot production, little tools [ph] and just curious if anything has changed to your thinking in terms of different node\u2026 Martin Anstice : Yeah, nothing really. I mean we\u2019re still thinking 7-nanometer as kind of the earliest and the only thing that I read in the last kind of three months kind of reinforced the complexity of the infrastructure around the EUV process itself as being kind of significant component of that question. And it didn\u2019t look like it got any easier, it looked like it got more difficult as best I could tell. Okay, Harlan you are up. Thanks Atif. Harlan you are the last guy today. Operator, next question please. Operator : Thank you. The final question will be from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Bill Peterson : Yes, hi, this is Bill Peterson calling on behalf of Harlan. Thanks for sneaking me in and congrats on a good December quarter. I want to clarify a few things relative to your commentary on logic, you mentioned about re-using. In fact to understand what will be different in logic relative to the foundries and the nature of that, some logic customers are already at FinFET and a lot of foundries are not, if you could provide some color on that, that would be very useful, thanks. Martin Anstice : You know, I think really it\u2019s kind of the age old, relative ease and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy but in relative terms it probably is, you know with the amount of kind of die concentration that exists in the microprocessor fab compared to the distributed die and customer reality of the Foundry, the conversion cycle really kind of is a big challenge. And so I think that\u2019s kind of principle reason that there is an emerging trend of some substance to conversion in foundry but it does not compare to what is available to the microprocessor world. Bill Peterson : So in terms of implications is that there should be more and more upgrade or what does it mean in terms of how do we think about it for implications for Lam and other equipment vendors? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I think it can be, when people do conversions, it can be upgrades from a hardware perspective and sometimes it is nothing because they find a way to make the hardware work and there is a process modification and you know with rare exception this industry doesn\u2019t get paid very much for process. It gets paid for the hardware that gets sold into a fab even though perhaps the value contributions in that is really made is the process contribution but that\u2019s a long story. Audrey Charles : Great. All right, thank you operator. That\u2019s all we have time for today. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : Once again this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

This call is scheduled to last until 3 PM Pacific Time and as always we ask that you limit questions to one per firm with a very brief follow-up so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Audrey. Good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining us today. In recognition of the competency capability and effort necessary to repeatedly deliver record levels of performance. I'd like to begin today by extending by sincere thanks to the employees of Lam Research, who strive tirelessly to meet commitments made, and built competitive advantage for the company. Defined by the substance of our culture, we are intuitively predisposed to find ways to contribute to the success of our customers through the delivery of innovative technology, trusted productivity and speed to solutions. It is in this context that we continue to be very pleased with the fundamentals and the trajectory of the company and are more inspired than ever by the long -term growth outperformance opportunity. Thank you, all.  At is customary, I will now review our March quarter accomplishments, highlighting the multiyear outperformance drivers and their relevance to our strong results and guidance today. We will then summarize our 2015 outlook for wafer fabrication equipment spending and conclude with some updates on our strategic focus.  The March quarter concluded with results generally in line with our expectations above mid point for all guided metrics. This represented our seventh consecutive quarter, a greater than $1 billion in revenues and was the highest yet reported levels of revenue shipments and operating income, each showing double digit growth from the same quarter last year. The delivery of this performance, we believe is a strong endorsements of our culture and values. The commentary on levels of customer trust and the validation of our ability to scale effectively. The combination of a strong March quarter and a stronger next quarter guide. And a perspective for there is some uniqueness to the market dynamics for Lam, provides the company opportunity for a strong second half.  We continue to believe our performance is the result of increasing levels of trust and support from customers broadly. Markets that are sustaining, sustainability growing faster than the average WFE baseline, a differentiated Lam product and service offering which when deployed in a true partnership with customers, are together facilitating the technology inflections of multi patenting, treaty device architecture and advance packaging. These inflections are at the core of semiconductor scaling, critical to our customers and to their customers' success as they respectively perceive competitive differentiation with higher performance, more power efficient and more cost effective devices. We believe that inflection spending continues to raise proportionately tracking to one third of WFE this year and reaching the 50% level in 2017. A view point that remains a major influence over our confidence in achieving multiyear growth outperformance. The multi patenting and 3D device architecture inflections are now well recognized as being etch and deposition intensive making likely the segment grow faster than the market for the next several years. This represents opportunity and risks both but the continuous strengthening of our product portfolio creates a growing SAM. The headline today is we now compete for 28.5% of total equipment spending and that number we believe will exceed 30% by calendar 2017. Lam's opportunity to outperform continues to have upside through market share gains. We previously reported a greater than 50% inflection based market share headline and further achieved applications defense and penetration performance so far this year above expectations at the 90% success level. Both data points reflect good momentum against our three year market share target of 4% to 8% increase in deposition market share, 3% to 5% in etch and 5% to 10% in clean . Over the last several quarters, we have talked about the success of our vector ALD product with a targeted tripling of business this year and an equivalent increase in breadth of customer engagement. Growth in our ALD presence well primarily driven by multi patenting application is being augmented by the successful expansion of our product to other applications such as high expect in ratio liners and image sensor devices. Our momentum in this fast growing market segment is enabled by our technology which is delivered with the productivity necessary for high volume manufacturing adoption. In conductor etch; we continue to extend our leadership with the most comprehensive product portfolio in debt development capability. We are extremely pleased with the market adoption for our latest generation Kiyo etch products, illustratively we recently secured another critical 3D NAND conduction etch position at a leading device manufacture and as a result, the Kiyo product addressing this market will now have more than double its install base in the first half of calendar 2015. This type of success builds fundamental capability and competitive advantage from demonstrated production performance. And it validates our conviction that for deposition and etch combined, we believe we have secured 90% of the critical 3D NAND's application selection so far made in the industry. We have long partnered with customers to demonstrate the value of our Kiyo with hydro technology which allows for localized fine tuning. Significant benefits are being seen for patenting and CD sensitive applications, the differentiated on wafer results are accelerating adoption of this unique and well patented capability. Tactically as we have stated many times, we don't win or defend everything successfully, but if we continue to more than not our momentum builds, strategically we recognize that our greatest areas of growth opportunity remain in dielectric deposition and dielectric etch, accordingly we prioritize investments and engagements to realize that vision. Now turning to our industry update. With the first quarter of 2015 concluded in line with our expectations and disclosure by companies in aggregates more or less consistent with our planning assumptions, we maintained our general outlook for WFE investment. The predicated trends in semiconductor consumption including demand at the leading etch, the value proposition of technology investments by our customers and the well established spending discipline, we believe together supports a growth outlook. The perpetual environment of change, pull and push, real and perceived is not new. Our focus on achieving long-term success a key guiding principle. We believe that the fundamentals remain strong for our company. This is an opportunity rich environment where our long-term commitment to customer trust across all market segments and all active technology nodes combined with a vigorous pursuit of technology leadership across our full and product portfolio never more important. In the DRAM segments, we see disciplined investment strength across multiple customers, notwithstanding the well publicized weakness in PCs. Market demand continues to be driven by mobile and enterprise DRAM growth, DRAM investments which have appear p4 biased to the first half of 2015 are very efficient, and focused primarily on technology conversions to 20 nanometer. For NAND memory, we believe that it will remain a healthy balance in overall supply and demand. We still anticipate that investments will include play and conversion and 3D NAND capacity addition in 2015, with the 3D investments being more second half weighted. At this time, we project 2015 3D NAND investment to be slightly greater than planar.  Overall, we anticipate 2015 memory WFE spending at or slightly above the $15 billion level. For the foundry segment, we continue to see that investments in 2015 are focused on FinFET enablement at a number of customers as they compete for opportunity in their market place. The previously noted 28 nanometer classes of additions are occurring as anticipated. Our view of foundry investments is slightly lower than the spending levels we saw in 2014, again reasonably distributed across the industry and the year.  We expect logic spending of between $6 billion and $7 billion more or less flat with 2014, reflecting a sustained commitment to technology conversions with optimized reuse of the installed base. This downward market pressure is offset at some level by mobile demand driven spending within the image sensor segment. Bottom line, we continue to model 2015 WFE at $34 billion, plus or minus two for the year. As we highlighted last quarter, execution on our current opportunities continually increasing customer trust, building strategic alliances with key customers, profitably growing the business and preparing for the next set of technology inflections are areas of strategic focus. Our commitments to R&D is the most fundamental element of sustaining outperformance for the company and as such we target to allocate more than 60% of operating expenses consistently to the delivery of innovation, fundamental research and concept feasibility evaluations, seeking to optimize both short term performance with our ambition for long-term sustainable growth.  We continue to realize the benefits of that focus in atomic level processing and control in deposition and in etch both which effectively leverages our established strength providing a credible and we believe executable technology roadmap for the future. As we continue our journey of growth, 2015 is a year which in many respects solidifies and expands upon our successes of 2014. It is the year where we target to build competitive advantage through an intense focus on execution. We are pleased by our performance so far, but believe our opportunity and potential are greater. We aspire to strengthen the foundation of success and ensure that our most enabling vision objective to make Lam Research a place where successful people want to work, is a long-term competitive advantage that builds with intensity and drives value for the full community of stakeholders. Doug? Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you again for joining us today. We are very pleased with our results for the March quarter. A quarter where we achieved record levels for shipments, revenue as well as operating income. Each of these items grew double digits sequentially. We delivered performance above the midpoint of guidance for all of our metrics and delivered earnings per share above the guided range. Execution from the company was clearly very strong in the quarter. Shipments for the quarter were $1,497 million, which was up 20% sequentially and again near the high end of the guided range. I just point out this was the fastest sequential shipment growth in the last seven quarters. Memory shipments continued to be strong in the quarter with the combined memory segment making up 67% of the total system shipments compared to 53% of the prior quarter. DRAM shipments represented 45% of system shipments which was up from 43% in the prior quarter. And NAND made up 21% of the shipments which was up from 10% in the December quarter.  The foundry segment was flattish sequentially in dollar terms accounting for 24% of system shipments. And I remind you that foundry in the December quarter represent 32% of system shipments. And finally the logic and other segment were slightly down contributing 9% of system shipments. And while we don't normally comment on bookings, this quarter I just mentioned that as we ended the March quarter, the book-to-bill was comfortably above one. We delivered record revenue of $1,393 million in the March quarter, an increase of 13% from December. Gross margin for the period came in at 44.7%, again towards the high end of our guided range. Better utilization from the factory and field in addition to a slightly more diverse customer base up gross margin. Also helping was the fact that we made solid progress in improving the manufacture ability of some of our new deposition tools. And as we shared before our excellent gross margins are a function of a number of factors such as business volume product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter.  I'll remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing performance in the longer term. Operating expenses in the quarter grew to $345 million but decreased 2% as a percentage of revenue to 25%. Spending was above the midpoint of the implied guidance primarily due to an increase in profit depended expenses during the quarter. R&D spending increased sequentially while SG&A declined. We continue to drive our spending profile to have an increasing portion of our operating expense in R&D versus SG&A. R&D represented a greater percentage of total OpEx in March compared to last quarter. These R&D investments are critical to preparing for the current as well as future technology inflection center industry. Operating income in the March quarter came in at a record level of $277 million, up 20% from the prior quarter. Operating margin was 19.9%, up from 18.7% in December and again at the high end of the guided range. Operating margin improved sequentially as we delivered leverage from the growth in revenue. The tax rate for the quarter was up slightly is expected to 11%. The tax rate of middle teens remains the right level for you to include your models. The March tax rate was a little below the normalized level due to more income generated in lower tax jurisdictions as well as a provision to return true-up. Based on share count of approximately 174 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $1.40 above the high end of our guided range. The primary drivers of this being the higher revenue and the above mid point gross margin. The share count at this point includes dilution from all three of our convertible notes with the total dilutive impact being 12 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. And I'll remind you that the dilution schedules for the 2016, 2028 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. During the quarter, we spent $112 million and took delivery of about 1.4 million shares at an average share price of $78.45. We also returned $0.18 per share in dividend distributions. At the end of the quarter, 11 months into our two year program, we had completed about 55% of the current $850 million share buyback authorization.  Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Cash and short term investments including our restricted cash increased notably in the quarter to $4.1 billion. We decided to take advantage of what we perceived to be a favorable interest rate environment and completed the issuance of $1 billion in principal value of investment grade senior notes. The issuance creates some flexibility for the company on a number of fronts. One of those being something I mentioned in last quarter's call. We have the first of convertible notes maturing in mid 2016 and we plan to use a portion of the proceeds from this issuance to refinance those notes. Cash from operation was $191 million which was up from $161 million in December. This cash generation ended up being a little better than I foreshadowed last quarter due to a little bit more linear shipments during the quarter. Day sales outstanding increased by two days to 68 days. Cash generation was partially offset by our capital return programs as well as capital expenditures. We exited the quarter with deferred revenues up $485 million which was up from $374 million in December. And I'll point out that this excludes $45 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remained as inventory on our balance sheet. Company non cash expenses included $33 million for equity comp, $40 million for amortization, and $31 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $32 million which was down from $61 million in the December quarter. CapEx in this business can at times be lumpy due to the timing of certain investment programs. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,000 regular full time employees. Now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1,600 million plus or minus $50 million. We expect continued strength in memory and slight growth in both foundry and logic. Revenue of $1,460 million, plus or minus $50 million. Gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Operating margins of 21%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally earnings per share of $1.46, plus or minus $0.07 based on a share count of approximately 174 million shares. And given we just issued new debt, I'd like to provide you some guidance on how to model the P&L impact from the 2020 and 2025 senior notes. On a quarterly basis we anticipate the incremental interest expense net of interest income and the tax impact to be between $4 million and $5 million. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I will now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We will take our first question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello : Great. Thanks so much guys, good afternoon and congratulation on the terrific results. Martin, when you made comments about the industry environment, I thought you emphasize the word in aggregate there has been no change. Obviously there has been a couple of high profile cut. Your use to the word an aggregate there and the fact that you haven't changed the overall result suggest there maybe some other-- some other customers that are actually spending a little bit more than they suggested earlier in the year. Is that a fair way to interpret your comments? Martin Anstice : Yes. I think that's fair, Jim. And the use of the word aggregate was deliberate. I mean one of the kind of reality is obviously when we're opining on what's changing in the industry outlook. Each of us have a baseline and just occasionally those baselines are the same, and just case they are different, sometimes we are anticipating announcement, sometimes we are not. But what has changed quite clearly is we've seen the public disclosure from the logic and foundry space that I think is well understood in the Industry for us, we've got some pretty kind of positive and meaningful offset in logic in or around image sensor application opportunity so that's kind of an offsetting positive. And the memory investments in 3D NAND is little stronger than we had anticipated in the second half. So I think now we've gone kind of three sequential earnings scores with slightly better outlook in 3D NAND so if you back up two we said we thought planar  0:24:59.0 was greater than 3D NAND. Then we said that we thought they were about the same. And today we said we believe 3D is slightly stronger than planar investments in the calendar year. So that's go little bit better. And in DRAM, the investment level is probably slightly higher than we anticipate it, but I would have say this slightly more efficient because the balance of conversions got slightly stronger and you remember the odds which we talk about in DRAM really not technically as because they are just a compensation of the consequence of technology transition. So we had some foundry and some kind of micro processor negative, we had some image sensor, some 3D NAND and some DRAM kind of positive. And at the end of the day, our WFE number I think is within $200 million or $300 million today where we estimated to be in January. Jim Covello : That's incredibly helpful, thank you. And if I could ask for my follow up, on the 3D NAND side, would you characterize that strengthening in the back half being driven mostly by one customer or is it a little broader than that? Thank you. Martin Anstice : I think it is pretty distributed, Jim. I have a sense at this point that everybody is kind of invested in the substance and the reality and the benefits of the transition and the investments are recurring at a difference pace obviously from one customer to another. But as best I can tell everybody is describing an ambition to have HVM capability in calendar 2016, which means they are investing in a meaningful way in the second half of this year to accomplish that objective. Operator : And we will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you very much. Guys, I wanted to ask a question about 3D NAND, and sounds like it is a little better than what you thought during the back half of the year. But you said last call that you thought you add about 70k, not you but the industry would add about 70k, I think going from 60k last year up to 130k closing this year. Does that mean that 70k is gone up a bit? Martin Anstice : I think that number is not a bad reference point today, these numbers are when you are talking about additions they are pretty big numbers for 5,000 or 10,000 wafer stock. So I am not sure I would extract a very meaningful headline today in terms of number of wafer stock. Similar commentary today. I do think that perhaps our view is that there is maybe 10,000 wafer stocks of capacity shipped in but it won't be kind of productive and installed by the end of calendar year. So we probably have revised our outlook in terms of what will be in process being qualified. But it doesn't play role at all in terms of supply and demand balance in the industry. So it is same message more or less. Timothy Arcuri : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, Doug, you said last call, you said that the bottoms up forecast was at the time, implying that -- technically, that the first half looked a little bit better than the back half. But now given that June is in fact that much better than what you thought at that time, do you still think that the first half, have we just pulled into the first half, or is the annual number in fact better than what you thought it was at this time last quarter? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim, as you know in this business you don't have perfect clarity in the second half when you are siting here at the end of March. But our expectation is as Martin described a strong second half. There are may still be a slight bias to the first half in terms of shipments, it is probably not loss on you that deferred revenue this quarter such that there might be more balance in revenue than shipments but honestly we are going to guide one quarter at a time. Still a bit early for us to give you definitive visibility in the second half but little bit of color anyway. Operator : Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on DRAM piece. Given that DRAM pricing falling and PC demand has been quite soft this year. Do you have confidence that this spending plan will hold up in the second half? I guess may be you can give us waiting just specific around DRAM first half, second half? Martin Anstice : Yes. It is little dangerous to say we are like really, really, really confident gives life doesn't ever work as exactly as you anticipate it. But I do think the headline of discipline in the industry that we talked about a lot now is a valid assumption for the rest of the year. I think the entire supply chain is invested and accomplishing that objective. None of us get excited about wild swings in the volumes of our business. And frankly one of the things that doesn't make me feel good today, the only kind of primary change that we are talking about today in DRAM is that they got more efficient. So it is a slightly bigger number of investments but the value delivered from those investments in the industry is greater than we originally anticipated because there is now a greater proportion of investments assigned to conversions than we originally kind of thinking. So that's a very positive headline from my point of view regarding sustainability. And let's not forget that even with the pace of investment we are describing here, by the time you get to the end of calendar 2015, probably two thirds if not slightly more of the installed base has yet to be upgraded to the 20 nanometer technology node. So that's and I think a multiyear sustainable statement. Weston Twigg : Okay, that's very helpful. And I just wondering on the R&D line, big step up in the March quarter. On absolute basis do you think R&D stays around that level or it just varies as a percentage of sales in there to keep it in that range? Doug Bettinger : It will hold steady, we said that revenues little stronger in June, total spending will tick up slightly less but it is probably in a pretty steady state level through the next quarter or so. Weston Twigg : Percentage wise or absolute dollar wise or both I guess to the year maybe. Martin Anstice : Absolute dollars Operator : Our next question comes from Credit Suisse, Farhan Ahmad. Farhan Ahmad : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is for Martin, in terms of the 3D NAND, DRAM particularly as you look to next year, how do you think the spending between the planar and 3D would be for next year? Is it fair to assume that maybe close to 90% or even more could be 3D NAND? And secondly as you rethink about spending mix between conversions from planar to 3D and 3D new capacity how does that affect your business? Just to -- you mention like from DRAM the conversion being stronger resulted in a lot high revenue for you, I would imagine like if there is more portion of the spending going to conversion, spending on deposition and etch would be lot stronger? Martin Anstice : Yes. I would say at jumbo [ph] level and it is kind of segment unspecific. The more efficient the spending for the customer the more sustainable their investment is and the more likely they are to be successful. So we actually in general are very positive when we see conversions and upgrades. Specific to the first part of your question, while I am not trying to that I could apply on a percentage per se for 3D NAND but I definitely think it is the majority of spending next year. And as best I can tell most of the plans of the customers is not Greenfield. Their existing facilities and their conversion based and the implications of that to while research are very good because 3D NAND transition is deposition and etch intensive as you know and so we care about sustainability, conversions are very good. And whether it is new or conversion the debt on ex component is going to be disproportionately and positively a big feature of that spending. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks, Martin. And just one question on the linearity of CapEx this year. Some of your peers have talked about foundry spending being kind of flattish through the year while DRAM is mostly first half faded. I just wanted to hear your thoughts like if you are seeing similar trends. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I don't that we got kind of perspective to that much different from the rest of the industry. So I think we kind of more or less aligned to grow up to that message. Operator : From Evercore ISI we have C J Muse. C J Muse : Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question when I look at your results implied in your first half guidance, can you comment on whether you are pulling in here your talking model for 2016, 2017 that it actually may absolutely come to fruition in 2016. I would love to hear your thoughts on that. Doug Bettinger : Yes. C J, I am not ready to update the financial model. You should expect to hear an update from us when we get to our investor event at SEMICON. Obviously, I feel good about what we are tracking relative to that model but I am not ready to give you any update today. C J Muse : Okay. Sure I guess maybe as part of then when you think about the right parts of the market that you lever too, what do you principally drive your outperformance, attribute your outperformance in the first half? Is it memory exposure, is it share gain in LDH, is it double patenting, would love perhaps rank order of what's driving this relative outperformance near terms and then perhaps looking to the back half of the year with 3D ramp, NAND ramping what the key drivers look like there? Martin Anstice : Well, the memory component obviously features in a pretty meaningful way as communicated by Doug's segmentation comments on March quarter and on the June outlook. Right so in terms of rank order first half of the year, there is a very strong message for us there. But the outperformance commentary from the company as a by productive kind of three inflections we've talked a lot about right so multi patenting, 3D device transition in memory and logic both and advanced packaging, these are the reasons we said we would with execution outperform and these are the very same reasons that we are outperforming. They are real and our focus is execution. I mean you heard me say in my closing that intensity of focus on execution here is kind of everything because we have at least by the decisions of customers set ourselves up for a greater than 50% market share of inflection based business. And as long as we execute that the story for the company is extremely positive. And so we got a little bit of kind of momentum on that obviously from a memory point of view in the first half relative to our model, it is clear and we talked about it several times, we are growing the company a little faster than we had originally anticipated in large part because of the multi patenting transition that we are accelerating particularly in DRAM earlier and faster than we originally modeled. And we are working really hard to make sure all the profitability of that growth kind of plays out consistent with our models and that's the reason why we don't change this model more than kind of once a year. So I feel really good about our growth and there are a lot of people in Lam Research really busy making sure growth is profitable. Operator : And our next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much and also congratulation. First off, in terms of 2015 and your comments about planar NAND versus 3D NAND and seeing I guess seeing the pick up and improvements on that front. Do you see any potential shifts in dollars from original plain or NAND investments that are not going to 3D, or has your number basically stayed static on planar or NAND or you are just seeing more 3D NAND in the second half? Martin Anstice : We have tweaked less planar conversion than we originally anticipated. But our assessment today has been in overall NAND WFE investment is greater today than we anticipated in January. So there are some adjustments but the dollars of investment today we believe are higher than we anticipated in January. Just a little bit, Patrick. Patrick Ho : Great, that's helpful. And maybe Doug on the financial side. There has been a little bit of discrepancy that's gotten a little bit larger between shipments and revenues over the past few quarters which does give you a little bit of visibility on the revenue front. However, is that more related to new tools that are getting after in the field that takes a little longer in revenues, or is this something different on the accounting side that we should be aware of? Doug Bettinger : There is nothing different on the economic side. It is a little bit of new tools. It is also the fact that we are shipping this to some new fabs and it can sometimes take little bit longer to get the acceptance in that situation. Operator : And our next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : Thanks. Hi, Martin, Doug also congrats on the execution. I also have a follow up question on 3D NAND. We've heard recently from some of the customers giving updates on the 48 pair for 3D NAND. Do you think the second half is also perhaps benefiting from 48 pair 3D NAND being significantly more capital intensive than perhaps 32 pair NAND was last year? Martin Anstice : May be we need to remind everybody we are actually not a NAND memory company. I guess we have perspective but our perspective is never as reliable as our customers on this point. It is a little hard frankly to applying on capital intensity from where we sit. We have a very good visibility to deposition and etch and indeed a 48 pair has more intensity of deposition and etch than a 32 pair and 60 have more than 48 and so on so forth. Now performance benefits and yields all have to kind of play out for the substance and validity of those plans to kind of emerge. So we are not really articulating a headline today that I think is the byproduct of the number of pairs and a device changing from our expectations in January today. I think more we are articulating that some of our customers have made to kind of some changes in their plans a little bit around the balance of planar and 3D investment. So I think that's more the message than the kind of layer account. Stephen Chin : Okay, thanks for sharing that. And then just a follow up question on the operating expense trends going forward. Now that some of these key inflection technology program, seem like they are well underway at customer such FinFET and 3D, can we think about Lam's OpEx spend normalizing a little bit lower -- or there are the big projects like FinFET and 3D that have come down to pipeline that we just don't know about. Doug Bettinger : Stephen as always in technology you have to be innovating your capability such that you are growing revenues two years down the road. The right way to think about the level of our spending, I would encourage you to go back and look that financial model that will answer the question for you. Operator : It is comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Hi, good afternoon and congratulation on a very well executed quarter. On your memory spending outlook for 2015 going higher this year, can you just breakout the rough mix DRAM versus NAND spent within that memory view? Martin Anstice : Yes. I can if I get a slide in front of me. Okay, here we go, so we have today an assumption of between kinds of I would say 8.5 and 9.4 DRAM. So you can answer the NAND's question. There is a little bit of other memory but 8.5 to 9 is our assumption on DRAM. Harlan Sur : Appreciate that Martin. And then for Doug, team is looking for solid 80 basis points of gross margin improvement here in June. How much of that is due to a more diverse customer base versus some of the cost improvements and new tools that are starting to ship. And given your pipeline and product visibility, does the buyer suggest that you can kind of maintain this sort of 45% plus range as you move to a stronger second half over the year. Doug Bettinger : Yes, hi, Harlan, it is pretty evenly split in terms of the sequential improvement gross margin between tool maturation one which is about manufacturability as well as the slight running out of the customer base. So it is a little bit of both. Relative to expectations beyond that, again the reason I point to the financial model it is how we are thinking about the profitability of the company and how we are trying to run the company. So we are kind of in the sweet spot where you would expect us to be. If you go back and look at those model so this probably steady as you go for the most part. Martin Anstice : So I mean we feel really good about the growth in the company. Hopefully that's kind of clear, we are working really hard to make sure we get the profitability expansion that we were targeting and the most stressful point as we talked about many, many times is the gross margin percentage is still one which is a very, very, very hard thing to execute to because you have kind of competing influences in terms of introducing kind of technology as fast as you can possibly get it to the customer and at the same time maturing it, so that in HVM buy in a high volume environment, the economics are where you want them to be and that's a really tough thing to pull off. And the long-term success of the company is more important than short term success. And our customers have high expectations of our industry that contribute to their business and so we are really focused as Doug just said on the long-term financial models that we've given you and we feel really good about growth and we are working really hard on profitability. Operator : And our next question is from Mark Heller with CLSA. Mark Heller : Thanks for the question and congratulation also on a good result. Doug, I was wondering if you could may be just give more color on the end market breakdown for June. I know you said memory would remain strong but can you give maybe some little bit more color on the percentages? Doug Bettinger : Yes. I am not going to give you the hard percentages. As I said memory will remain strong so that's plus or minus what we did in March likely and I said I expect logic and foundry both be sequentially stronger. I am not going to get into quantifying it specifically but that's a directional body language on it. Mark Heller : Okay. And then obviously cash flow generation is really been excellent. I was wondering if you could -- is there any target that you have for calendar2015 and aside from the debt refinancing which I think is for next year, what are the other expected uses of cash. Could we see a dividend increase or another buyback? Doug Bettinger : Well, we are not changing the plans of the company as we sit today. So I told you we are 55% of the way through the two year buyback authorization and we are about like end of the quarter we are 11 months into it, so that's got a ways to play out, I described part of that debt that we raised targeted towards refinancing the 2016 convertible notes. And beyond that our priorities for cash are first the profitable reinvestment of the business. We are absolutely committed to returning cash to shareholders. I don't have an update for you on the program that we got in place. And then you got to invest in CapEx and the business as well. So that's how we are thinking about there. Martin Anstice : The only thing that I would add is relative to we kind of target for cash from operations, we don't really and we kind of pulling out there for you guys but clearly the operating income performance of the company is a decent proxy in the long term for our cash from operations performance. And in practice when it is higher or lower that's much more to do with the direction of the industry and the company than anything else. So if business volumes are in a positive direction i.e. growing at the end of this calendar year then we will be much more likely investing in even more growth and so may be you don't drive cash from operation as strong as your operating income if the reverse is true then you drive better cash from operations. So that tends to be how we think about it over a multiple year horizon, the operating income percentage is a good proxy for us in terms of cash from operations performance. Operator : Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citibank. Atif Malik : Hi, thanks for taking my question, congratulation on good set of numbers. Martin, what if anything is different about equipment reuse especially at foundries migrates from 20 to 16 and down 10 nanometer. And if you can talk about either your end markets or any other end markets which are more prone to equipment reuse? Martin Anstice : Yes. I would say I mean historically the markets where reuse is featured significantly have had limited number of kind of dye in a fab and align and so microprocessor fab and memory fab have historically been kind of the perfect models of equipment reuse and our customers get better at that and we get better at supporting them and frankly it is in everybody's best interest in the long term that we are able to kind of execute collectively consistent but as it always the case there is two sides to every coin and one of the reality is as an equipment company is the profitability level measured by percentage of profitability is often greater on kind of the conversion the upgrade than the original equipment sale. And so you get a smaller dollar but you get better kind of leverage in terms of the percentages. In the foundry space specifically I would say where you have a really big customer with a much focused demand requirement in terms of the number of dye then you have an opportunity for reuse in ways that in a typical foundry with many customers and much dye you don't have. And we don't actually see any change today from the world that we anticipate it, maybe we were lucky or maybe we put a lot thought into anticipating it well but I think we've been saying for a year we expected the equipments for 16 nanometer foundry by to have 90% to 95% overlap with the 20 selection. There is a lot of reuse potential and our outlook today in terms of investments in foundry is just the same as it was before. Obviously, considering the recent announcement from at least one foundry customer. Atif Malik : Great, thanks, very helpful. And then in response to James' question you mentioned the NAND, incremental NAND wafer start per month for this year you think that's 70,000 ballpark, could you also verify at the DRAM wafer start for this year are still in the 60,000 to 70,000 wafer start range? Martin Anstice : That's fine. It is about the same, Atif. Operator : And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar : I have two quick questions. Martin, the first on is when you look at your ALD product, looks like you are getting pretty good traction but my sense is you are not developing that many layers that you compete in today. Is there a potential to grow that with the existing product or do you need additional investments to get more footprint on the ALD product side? Martin Anstice : I think from a hardware perspective we are in decent shape, Krish, as is the case of hardware it gets you about 25% of the --results on the wafer and the rest of it is kind of process and the material integration. And so there is always a lot of work to do in terms of precursor development and then process to get uniformity and selectivity and conformality that we are targeting as a level of yield performance that make sense for our customers and I think we are off to a great start. We are coming from behind as you know in ALD; pick a momentum of the company I would say is very positive. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments today, we are taking kind of a very focused foundation and platform of growth and we are trying to broaden the applications now, but we have got tough competition and we respect their capability as I hope just a little bit they might respect ours. Krish Sankar : Got it, that's very helpful. And then a question for Doug. What is your mix of onshore and offshore cash? Doug Bettinger : We have to raise the debt, its cost kind of evenly balanced. Operator : Our next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir. Shawn: Hi, this is Shawn [ph] in for Mahesh. Thanks for taking my question. Just one quick question. Martin, DRAM spending has been very strong for the past two quarters and I think you mentioned that efficiency of the investment is betterment than anticipated. So at the beginning of the year when you initially presented the 14 to 15 bit in memory, you said that spending would drive about 30% of bit growth and then now with the improving efficiency do you think that pie in DRAM will be higher that 30% you mentioned before? Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean I don't think that we have a position that is different from the industry on bit growth in any segment of the industry. We try to kind of triangulate as best we can and the high 20s and kind of 30 levels is I think where the industry is. And I think it is a very disciplined commitment by our customers. It doesn't serve anybody's interest for anybody to get ahead of this thing and you got a lot of discipline through consolidation. And capable as you know supply chain for that to continue. So I hope it does. Operator : And our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow up. Just want to clarify on the 3D NAND. You said that the dollar spending is a slightly higher than the planar NAND, and incremental capacity at is about 70, so does that mean that you still expect the NAND industry to be able to grow bit capacity by more than 30%? Or what I am missing here? Martin Anstice : Yes. The answer is yes. Mehdi Hosseini : So more than half of the CapEx for NAND 3D and so when we look into next year as maybe some of our customers are start to reuse the NAND, should we assume some sort of a slight decline in capital intensity or do you think this kind of capital intensity is sustainable for multi year? Martin Anstice : Well, I think we are not a very representative competitive to answer that question because our participation in this inflection is a deposition and etch participation, that's a very kind of powerful place to be. But we don't really to get applying on capital intensity for the industry. I don't think there is another company in the equipment industry; they are doing much better job than us doing that. But I would say we are very invested in the opinion that our customers are focused on sustainability of investments and they are going to do at least as much as you might want them to do in terms of conversions to make it efficient and sustainable. So what is that mean for us? I think it means we are in the right place at the right time with the right products and if we execute we can continue to strength together some outperformance. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. And then on image sensor, are these new customers or existing customers that have -- that are following new projects? Martin Anstice : Existing customers. Operator : And our next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company. Edwin Mok : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So on your comment about DRAM, spending more dollars on conversion for this year. Is that driving, is it a way you can break it down? Is it driving more incremental etch with deposition business for you guys? Martin Anstice : Yes is the answer to that. But I think that's just kind of headline on the intensity of etch from a conversion point of view. It is a very favorable transition for us. And it is a commentary on the patenting transition in etch and deposition both. So we believe that the total wafer fabrication equipment investment in DRAM is a slightly higher than we thought, we believe it is more efficient to my earlier point and we believe it should stay for the second of deposition and etch. Edwin Mok : Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then on 3D NAND, I am curious, have you started to see shipment, or are you expect to start seeing shipment in the June quarter? And then sorry, a slide on an earlier question, in your ALD product that you talked about, is that tied to the 3D NAND investment, or is it all the inflections that you mentioned? Martin Anstice : Let's try and answer the first part of your question. If your first part of question is 3D shipments, are they happening now or I mean they have been happening on a continuing basis. I mean there is always someone somewhere buying something for a 3D NAND application. So sometimes that's an addition to HVM capability sometimes that's a first phase pilot, sometimes it is second phase. I mean this four guys have different timing and different commitments to investment, but I think everybody is there as an industry. We have two more guys we are going to try and get to hear. So can we get to next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Sundeep Bajikar from Jefferies. Sundeep Bajikar : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the foundry side. If you would just give us an update on the total amount of 20 nanometer, 16 and 14 capacities that you are now expecting to see exiting 2015. Are you seeing a bigger sift towards 14 and 16 rather than 20? Also if possible share with us how you are thinking about the progression of this capacity into 2016. Thanks. Martin Anstice : Well, as I said before at least in the dialogues that we have for the customers we are not really distinguishing too much between 20, 16 and 14. I mean there is a huge amount of kind of overlap in terms of equipment. The basic message today we think is the one that was communicated to you publicly in the last couple of weeks that there is commitments to technology conversions and a little bit less today at the 14, 16 kind of node for the year from an industry perspective than was originally anticipated. But I think that the basic commitment to FinFET conversion first wave and then the pilot investment in 10 nanometer are there. So that would be my comments on foundry. And we are assuming by the end of this year that the capacity that has been shipped in at or less than 20 nanometer is in the range of 200,000 to 210,000 wafer stocks per month. Operator : And our next question is from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Tom Diffely : Yes, good afternoon. First, a quick clarification. Did you say you had won 90% of the 3D NAND critical etch and deposition steps? Martin Anstice : Yes. Which is disclosure by the way we made at SEMICON west a year ago. So I was really just kind of repeating that based on our assessment of critical and non-critical applications in that segments, we think the 90% headline that we communicated in SEMICON west is valid today. And in fact as I said in my prepared comments we had a nice kind of reinforcement of that in a selection this quarter. Tom Diffely : Okay. And then critical makes up what percent of the overall etch and dep for the 3D NAND? Martin Anstice : We don't actually make that disclosure. Tom Diffely : Okay. Then finally when we look at the competitive front, are you seeing any increased presence with local vendors in places like in Korea and Taiwan? Martin Anstice : No. I would say it is very kind of constant competitive threat and I don't think it is anything new. The reason by the way I said we don't disclose it is because the value of the critical position is much less to do with the percentage of the business. And it is a reasonable percentage; otherwise I wouldn't bother telling you. The value proposition of the critical win is you create cycles of learning for your company that your competition does not have. And if you do that long enough then your ability to be successful broadly in a market place is greater than their. So it is -- value is not the percentage, the value is the learning and the critical feature and capability that we developed broadly in the market place. Audrey Charles : All right. That concludes our call for today. Thank you very much for joining. And a replay will be available on the website. Martin Anstice : Thank you.",

Martin Anstice : Thank you, Audrey, and good afternoon everyone. We would like to thank those of you who attended or listened to our recent Investor and Analyst Event on July 14th in San Francisco. During that meeting, we described the drivers of our sustainable outperformance, reviewed our perspective on the industry, and updated our long-term financial model. As that update was just two weeks ago, we will keep our prepared comments today brief starting first with a review of our June quarter and fiscal 2015 results followed by a brief recap of key messages we shared with you during our Analyst Event, then providing an update on our near term industry outlook including with a reinforcement of the unique SAM expansion story for Lam. The June quarter reported results were in line with our expectations at or above midpoint for all guided metrics, and for the second straight quarter, we set records for revenue, shipments, and operating income. The June quarter marked the end of our 2015 fiscal year, a year where we surpassed the $5 billion level for shipments and revenues and generated more than $1 billion in operating income. We demonstrated our commitment to long-term profitable growth and returned value to shareholders with a 16% growth in net income fiscal year-over-year and $630 million or three times increase year-over-year of returned value to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. It's important to note that the substance of the outperformance trends that we're demonstrating is based on technology and productivity leadership, strength and execution across the entire organization, the values and culture of our Company, and the support we have earned from our customers through our focus on customer trust and collaborations aimed at helping them solve their most difficult challenges. As stated before, our opportunity to continue the outperformance trend is driven by a broad-based market participation in the now well-understood deposition and etch-intensive inflections of multi-patterning, 3D device architecture and advanced packaging. Focusing on one element of that headline today, at our recent Investor Event we discussed how the patterning market for Lam likely grows through the 5-nanometer technology node with or without EUV. An important dynamic within this segment is the increasing relevance of spacer-based patterning. Spacer-based quadruple patterning as we illustrated in our Analyst Meeting can increase the number of deposition, etch, and clean passes up to five times driving the need for process variability control and cost reductions. To address these challenges in logic and memory segments both, we are focused on delivering technically enabling capabilities at high levels of productivity such as the VECTOR ALD Oxide and Kiyo with Hydra technology products. With these offerings, we've been able to establish a very strong and we believe sustainable number one position in etch for multi-patterning and grow our ALD share dramatically in just a couple of years. With our assumption that approximately 60% of old foundry logic patterning steps are spacer based at 7-nanometer, our leadership in this segment is illustrative of the value we have already been able to deliver to the customer, and more importantly the opportunity that lies ahead. Now turning to the near-term industry update, with the second quarter of calendar 2015 concluded in line with our expectations, we continue to see discipline in the industry with recent puts and takes being directionally consistent with movements last quarter, i.e., strengthening in 3D NAND investments, foundry, and logic both slightly down. Investments by our customers is supporting a very strong September for the Company as evidenced by our guidance today. Although it is way too early to guide 2015 December quarter shipments, a September outlook that is materially higher than most expectations, ours and yours, our comments at the recent Analyst Event combined with the last couple of weeks of general industry tone suggests we will likely see a December quarter with shipment levels lower than our 2015 March quarter. In many respects, this is illustrative of the variability of business we described as the new challenge of the consolidated industry as the plans and investment decisions of any one customer or segment presents a more immediate and more significant short-term effect than ever before. With strong mid and long-term fundamentals for the Company and building deferred revenue balances in the first half of this year, we now expect slightly stronger revenues for the Company in the second half of 2015 compared with the first half 2015. Overall, we maintain our view for calendar 2015 WFE investment of $34 billion, plus or minus $2 billion, and as is customary, we would add that our view is predicated on a healthy macro environment. We are encouraged by the opportunity we see for Lam in the industry. Investments appear rational across segments and are largely consistent with our understanding of capacity needs and reasonable assumptions on rising capital intensity. From our perspective, there are positive and broad-based emerging indicators for demand at the leading edge with increased device designs, tape outs, and new product penetrations, plans to take advantage of targeted performance and cost benefits available from latest device architecture and process flows. In the DRAM segments, market's demand continues to be driven by mobile and enterprise DRAM growth. DRAM investments, which as we have said, are biased for the first half of calendar 2015, are very efficient and focused primarily on technology conversions to 20-nanometer. Investments appear to essentially keep the installed base wafer start level flat year-over-year with strong segment participation for Lam Research. For NAND, 3D NAND momentum has continued to increase through the June quarter. As we recently stated, we now expect that shipped capacity for 3D NAND will be approximately 150,000 wafer starts by the end of calendar 2015 with perhaps slightly more than half this amount being qualified for HVM device outburst. Overall, we anticipate 2015 memory WFE spending at approximately the $16 billion level. For the foundry segment, we continue to see that investments are focused on FinFET enablement at a number of customers. The previously noted 28-nanometer capacity additions this year continue to be a meaningful part of the foundry segment investments with healthy end demand. We reiterate our view that foundry investment will be slightly lower than the spending levels we saw in 2014. We expect logic spending of between $6 billion and $7 billion, slightly down from 2014, reflecting a sustained commitment to technology conversions with optimized reuse of the installed base. As noted last quarter, strength in demand for image sensors driven by mobile communications and share gains for Lam has provided some upside in the logic segment for us. Today, significant device technology migrations are fundamentally enabled by the most advanced deposition and etch intensive inflections of multi-patterning and 3D architecture which we aim to extend and make more productive for our customers each and every day. As we outlined at our recent Investor and Analyst Event, these inflections together with advanced packaging are driving what we now see as a $3 billion plus multiyear market expansion for Lam with multi-patterning and 3D NAND being the biggest opportunities, each representing approximately 40% of that total. We believe that continued execution of Lam combined with our market-leading deposition and etch positions in these segments is an undeniable relative and accelerating growth opportunity for the Company through 2018. As we enter the second half of 2015, we are excited about the long-term opportunities ahead and sufficiently confident in our ability to execute to recently update our growth targets and long-term Lam financial model indicating the potential for $8 plus annual earnings per share within the next three years. It is an exciting time in the industry and from the perspective that we have, Lam is better positioned than most for growth through multiple segment inflections over a multiyear period. Of course, being in a good position is not enough. Our focus on contributing to the long-term success of our customers must continue to be paramount, our ability to execute our opportunity only possible with commitments and hard work of more than 7,000 Lam employees worldwide who make this a special and rewarding place to work. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all for their commitments and continued focus on industry excellence. With that, I'll now hand the call to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay. Thank you, Martin, and thank you to everyone for joining us on the call today. We have what I think are some strong results to share with you today for both the June quarter as well as for our just concluded 2015 fiscal year. So I'll go ahead and just get started going through the numbers. It's an exciting time for Lam Research. We delivered record levels of shipments, revenues and operating income for the quarter and for the fiscal year. Each of these metrics achieved double-digit growth in the June quarter compared with the June quarter of last year. In the quarter, we performed at or above the midpoint of guidance for all of the metrics. And for the fiscal year we hit some impressive milestones crossing $5 billion in both revenue and shipments for the first time in our history and generating more than $1 billion in operating income, again for the first time. We believe these strong results and milestones clearly demonstrate solid execution against our opportunities. Our upward trajectory of shipments continued in the June quarter with shipments coming in at $1.616 billion, which was up 8% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. And as I just mentioned, shipments for the fiscal year topped the $5 billion mark. As we expected coming into the quarter, memory shipments were flattish in dollar terms and declined slightly in percentage terms during the quarter. The combined memory segment paid up 60% of total system shipments and that compares with 67% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments represented 37% of system shipments, which was down from 45% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments were largely being driven by 20-nanometer conversion spending. NAND and other non-volatile memory accounted for 23% of shipments, which was flat with 22% in the March quarter. NAND investment in the quarter was primarily directed towards investments in 3D NAND. Shipments to our foundry customers were at 26% of system shipments in the June quarter, which was up a little bit from 24% in the prior quarter. Foundry spending in June was a mix of FinFET investment as well as 28-nanometer capacity spending. The logic and other segment had a nice uptick accounting for 14% of system shipments compared with 9% last quarter. Strength here came from continuing investments in CMOS image sensors. Record revenues for the quarter were at a level of $1.481 billion, which was an increase of 6% compared with the March quarter. For fiscal year 2015, the revenues of the Company also exceeded the $5 billion mark for the first time. You've consistently been hearing us talk about our strong position around the technology inflections and our differentiation in the marketplace. I think you can absolutely see that position reflected in our shipment and revenue outperformance. Gross margin came in right at the midpoint of guidance at 45.5%, and as we shared with you in the past, we expect to see variability in gross margins on a quarterly basis as a function of a number of factors such as business volumes, product mix, particularly our newer products where we're still moving down the cost curve as well as relative levels of customer concentration. Operating expenses in the June quarter grew a little bit to $355 million but decreased as a percentage of revenue to 24%, which was down from 25% in the March quarter. In the quarter, 63% of the OpEx spend went to R&D which was about the same level as last quarter. The top priority of the Company is to continue to fund R&D programs and infrastructure to enable the future growth of the Company. These ongoing investments are crucial to being ready for the current as well as next set of technology inflections. R&D is funding development of capabilities like our Flex G Series dielectric etcher, our VECTOR ALD Oxide systems as well as our Kiyo conductor etch systems. Operating income in the June quarter was also at a record level coming in at $319 million, which was up over 15% from the prior quarter. Another first in the history of the Company, as I mentioned, operating income generated in fiscal year topped $1 billion. Operating margin in the quarter was 21.6% which was up from 19.9% in March and again above the midpoint of the guided range. Operating margin improved quarter over quarter with the growth in revenue along with the improvement in gross margin. And similar to my comments about gross margin, we expect to see variability in operating income with variability in gross margin as well as overall business levels. The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 16%, which was up compared to 11% in the March quarter. A tax rate in the middle teens would be reasonable for you to continue to include in your financial models. With share count of about 174 million shares, earnings per share for the June quarter were $1.50, above the midpoint of the guidance, driven by the higher revenue and the higher operating margin. The share count at this point includes dilution from all three of our convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 12 million shares of a non-GAAP basis. And I'll remind you that dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations Web-site for your reference. We spent $59 million and took delivery of 754,000 shares at an average share price of $78.80 during the quarter. At the end of the quarter we had completed more than 60% of the current $850 million share repurchase authorization. We also returned $29 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders and during the quarter announced a 67% increase in the dividend level raising the dividend at $0.30 per share each quarter starting with the payment made earlier in the September quarter. Let me now move to the balance sheet. Cash from operations was strong at $292 million, which was up from $191 million in the March quarter. During the quarter, cash and short-term investments including our restricted cash increased to $4.2 billion, up from $4.1 billion in March. The increase in the cash balance was primarily a result of the cash from operations, offset by those share repurchases and dividends as well as capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding decreased a little bit to 67 days versus 68 days in March. And as we mentioned in the Investor Event, we recorded in the June quarter an impairment of goodwill and intangibles on the balance sheet primarily related to our clean business. The total impairment of $89 million are treated as one-time expenses and included in our non-GAAP adjustments for the June quarter. At the end of the quarter, deferred revenues were $518 million, which was up from $485 million in March. This number excludes $164 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. And I'll just remind you that these Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on our balance sheet. Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following; $40 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $31 million for depreciation. Capital expenditure was up a little bit to $63 million which was up from $32 million in the March quarter. Investments in the quarter were largely attributed to lab tool investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,200 regular full-time employees. And I'll just take a moment to mention that the growth in headcount you've been seeing from us over the last few quarters will level out as we go forward. So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1.580 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Shipments will continue to be strong driven by 3D NAND. We're forecasting revenue of $1.6 billion, plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're forecasting operating margins of 22.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And I just point out, this operating margin includes some growth in spending that is of a discrete nature. I'd expect spending in the December quarter to come down somewhat from this level. And then finally we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.70, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 174 million shares. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would be pleased to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello : Congratulations on the very strong results and guidance. Martin, if I could just ask a question, since Intel cut the CapEx again on the last call and kind of made the comments about slowing down Moore's Law, slowing down some technology transitions which a lot of people think TSMC is kind of suggesting they will do as well, obviously that's not affecting you in the short term given the terrific results and guidance, but what do you think the long-term impact is this on your business of that? Martin Anstice : I think when we look at the totality of our industry and while it is true we have a consolidated industry and that means looking at 5 to 10 companies, everybody does have a slightly different story, and as an equipment company, our profile of business with any one customer is slightly different than others, and as many people have written, in fact the negative commentary from Intel from a cadence perspective obviously doesn't impact us as much as it does possibly for others. But we look kind of holistically here at the full spectrum of technology inflections and still feel very positive around medium-term and long-term business opportunities, and logic is in the mix and traditional shrink is in the mix, but there are many other market inflection opportunities for the Company and that's kind of what we're investing for and that's what we're trying to describe in terms of outperformance opportunity for the Company. So it takes all customers, all segments, all inflections and it's a lot of opportunity from my perspective to be innovative and creative, solving and contributing to the success of our customers long-term. James Covello : That's very helpful, thank you. And if I could just ask for a follow-up, similar kind of situation to last quarter where the market was very concerned about what your results and guidance would look like on the heels of an Intel cut and maybe some more cautious commentary from TSM and just like last quarter you guys delivered a terrific quarter and gave guidance well above the street, do you think this is just a function of that much less exposure to those customers or do you think there's some dynamic here of you gaining share even if some of the customers that might be slowing down a little bit such that your commentary is much more constructive and your numbers are much better than your peers even in the context of those customers slowing down? Martin Anstice : I mean let's not be confused, the outperformance commentary of the Company is not a commentary of being weak in places, so they are cutting investment. It is a fundamental commentary on deposition and etch and to some extent clean intensive technology inflections, which is creating a rather unique opportunity for our Company in our industry to grow and outperform, and the commentary that we've articulated today is a little stronger than we did a couple of weeks ago relative to revenues because as I hope all noticed, we said, we're now expecting revenues in the second half slightly stronger than the first half as opposed to kind of roughly balanced, and if we execute to that plan, we will be delivering our third straight year of 20% revenue growth in the Company, which is a tremendous commentary on fundamental growth opportunities that we think have traction for several years yet. James Covello : Terrific. Thanks a lot for the color and congratulations again. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Krish Sankar : I have two of them. First one, Martin, even though if December shipments are going to be down, it looks like your year-over-year shipments are still very impressive comparing where the WFE is going to be, so based on that my question is that if the growth, can you parse it out between how much of your growth is coming from SAM expansion and how much is it market share, is it 50-50, two third-one third, and then I have a follow-up? Martin Anstice : 1 don't know that I can answer that specifically for the year, Krish, but we have kind of characterized from the beginning of this inflection story roughly a two third-one third profile in favor of SAM expansion. So the market share story is indeed a meaningful component but it is the smaller of the two. And as a side note, we did recently increase our expectations to share growth in etch from the original 3% to 5% target to the 4% to 8% level. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. And then as a follow up, if I look at your September guidance and try to analyze it, you're kind of at the run rate that you gave in your target model on revenue side at a $36 billion WFE run rate, which obviously is not the case in September but it looks like you guys are running pretty well ahead of target, thanks to your model, the question here is that is most on the earnings power going forward going to be driven by the top line or are there any specific levers to pull on the OpEx side or customer mix that's going to drive the incremental EPS upside? Doug Bettinger : Krish, a lot of it is going to come from revenue growth. Having said that though, we're not going to grow spending as quickly as we believe revenue growth will grow which is how you get from kind of where we are today at call it 22%, up to the 24% or so over the next several years. So there's leverage in the model, little bit in gross margin probably and in the spending line. Martin Anstice : And just to supplement, we talked a lot about the focus on long-term growth, today's inflections, tomorrow's inflections, and the team has done a really nice job getting the proportion of operating expenses that's focused on R&D above the 60% level, and we've kind of repeated that again this quarter. And again to supplement Doug's point, the guidance today kind of really answers your question because today's guidance September over June is a 13% expansion of EPS on an 8% expansion of revenue's midpoint. So we're really focused on leverage and profitable growth not just market share and revenue growth. So we know the game. Doug Bettinger : Yes, we've been doing it for three years running now. Krish Sankar : Got it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Patrick Ho : Congrats on a really nice quarter and fiscal year. Martin, you talked about some of the spending trends that you saw in the first half of the year where DRAM was highly biased, you're seeing the emergence of 3D NAND spending as we head into the second half of the year. Are there any other segments that you're seeing the second half of the year that are picking up that's helping you deliver some of the outlooks both for September as well as the December quarter? Martin Anstice : I think we have a pretty good presence through each of the inflections in the segment as you know and with the recent disclosure, despite comments on this call, the recent disclosure in press release about our progress with the North America logic company, we feel pretty good about participating broadly in the spending habits of our customers. To your point, the view of the world today is not so very different in many respects to the view we had at the beginning of the year. We expected DRAM to be first half biased and it still looks that way, and we expected NAND to be second half biased and it's kind of picked up, and we expected kind of foundry logic to be neutral to maybe slightly stronger in the first half as well. So running this Company in this industry, all of that is relevant and certainly notable but we're much more invested in investing with a medium-term, kind of longer-term horizon for obvious reasons. $3 billion SAM expansion opportunity is very important for us to stay focused on executing. Patrick Ho : Okay, great. And Doug, maybe a question for you, something you've talked about on the Analyst Days and over the last few calls of the services business, some of the revenue opportunities there, that's always a business where you could always have margin improvement. What are some of the actions you're taking there to I guess further streamline that opportunity to help drive better leverage to the bottom line? Doug Bettinger : Patrick, what we're really trying to do more than anything is set that part of the business to grow faster than just the growth rate of the installed base. As you know, the profitability of this part of the business is pretty good. It requires some direct investment, not a lot. But really what we're doing is, innovating the business model, innovating in how we're delivering value to customers so that we can grow the top line and the bottom line falls through just as the top line grows. Martin Anstice : To be very direct, Patrick, it's all about value you can provide to the customer. If you can't provide much value to the customer, then you're not going to make much money selling it. So it's all about finding ways to understand their challenges and issues and support them as well as we can and we've got a lot of people invested in that agenda. Patrick Ho : Great, thank you very much. Operator : We'll next go to Timothy Arcuri with leads Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri : Couple of things. I guess, Doug, I'm just looking at gross margin and if I compare gross margin and I look at the guidance and I compare that to the end of calendar 2013, revenues are up about $500 million a quarter or roughly $2 billion annualized and model has definitely played out, there's no question about that, I guess the one thing would be that margins hadn't really gone up despite all that additional revenue, and I guess are there any things you can do from a high level to sort of address that? I know you've talked about doing some more one-off projects for some customers which seems to be [indiscernible] a lot more value to them, so I wonder if maybe there's some way something you can do to capture that value to cause margins to have some upside from here? Doug Bettinger : Tim, when I look at operating margin at least, we've delivered nice upside. We've gone from high teens a year ago into low 20s, right, so even though gross margin is kind of been level a little bit. The reason gross margin to level is, as we've talked about in the past, we've got more new tools coming out in the last 12 months than we ever had in the history of the Company, and in the first couple of quarters that new equipment is shipping. You don't have your cost as low as it's going to get and as you mature those tools and get them released into the high-volume environment, costs come down and margin gets better. That's really what is going on the gross margin line. Martin Anstice : And this is maybe an important point relative to the philosophy of the Company, our most important vision objective is to focus on customer trust, which means in all respects, and we have to be cognizant of the distribution profit to the supply chain, we have to target a profitability level that we think is going to support the sustainable growth ambition of the Company, and so the model that we've articulated historically has been a baseline and I think although we didn't report a gross margin percentage in the long-term model the other day, Doug described the fact that more or less the headline for gross margins was the same today as it was a year or so ago. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot for that, Martin. And then I guess my second question is on shipments and you're not guiding December shipments, Martin, but it sounds like shipments are going to come down maybe 200 million to 300 million versus what they were in September, and I'm wondering given all the issues in China and you look at semis, many of the semis are guiding way below seasonal for Q3 and there's some obvious signs that foundry is going to get softer, so I'm just trying to assess how much in the foundry segment in particular, how much is risk-adjusted in that down 200 million to 300 million shipment number from September to December, is that primarily 3D NAND coming down or is there some risk adjustment also for the foundry segment too? Martin Anstice : So you kind of gave me the answer in your question when you said you're probably not going to give guidance, and I'm definitely not, but to help you kind of triangulate, I mean some part of what will be our profile, and I have no idea if our profile is going to be the same or different than other equipment company, it's all a by-product of how you're participating and what your September is going to look like in terms of sequentials. Some part of December message we communicated is a by-product of what I think will prove to be relative strength of our Company in the September quarter. I think some part of the commentary is simply a statement of this new variability challenge we described in our Analyst Meeting. In a consolidated semiconductor industry, just in context, the top five spenders are going to represent let's say 70% of wafer fabrication equipment : spending. If you're a $6 billion company, which is kind of what we're run rating to right now, that means in any one quarter the average spending from one of those top five customers is $0.25 billion. So all it takes is an adjustment from one guy and you spring into the types of numbers that you talked about. Our focus is kind of obviously flexibility of business model to deal with that variability as well as we can but not to compromise the focus on long-term growth in the Company. So we've done our best to absorb the rumor and the substance of kind of industry tone in the last couple of weeks and obviously we spend a lot of time directly with customers trying to learn as much as we can and that's reflected in the guidance that we have given you. Operator : Next we'll go to Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad : Congrats on another set of solid results here. Martin, I wanted to probe you on the fourth quarter expectations just a little bit. You kind of quantified the upside on the shipments, like the maximum ceiling for shipments in the fourth quarter. I was hoping you can provide some color on what level of downside could there be. And secondly, like you've built deferred revenues of about $200 million over last three quarters. How should we think about the revenues in the fourth quarter? Could we still get like flattish revenues from September to December? Martin Anstice : I'm going to respectfully contain my comments on December quarter shipments which seem a long way away from our seat at this point in time to the answer I just gave to Tim's question, but certainly relative to revenues the message from the Company is very clear I hope. We expect slightly stronger revenues in the second half of this year than the first half of this year, and if we executed our plan, this will be our third consecutive year of 20% growth which I think is a remarkable commentary on the substance of the technology inflection growth opportunities we've described to you now. Farhan Ahmad : Thank you. And just a quick question related to your comment on NAND shipments, you mentioned the term 'NAND and other non-volatile memory' and considering that there was a new memory architecture that was announced yesterday, I just wanted to hear if you have started to see other orders or shipments in next-generation memory? Doug Bettinger : It's Doug. We spend a lot of time working with customers on all of their next-generation technologies and aspirations. I'm not going to answer a question about any specific customer except to say we're very well integrated with everybody in the industry. Operator : We'll next go to Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg : First just I know it's really early but wondering if you could just give us a little bit of your view on which segments might be up or down in your opinion in 2016 foundry, NAND, logic, DRAM, up or down, some early color? Martin Anstice : West Twigg, you are very optimistic today with your question. So I'll do my best here and I think it's more qualitative than quantitative. As we said in the Analyst Event, we are still biased to an expansion of wafer fabrication equipment spending in calendar 2016 over 2015, and frankly a big part of that is influenced by the SAM expansion conversation that we have most knowledge of. So asking any equipment company to really applying with substance on WFE is a bit of a stretch because none of us sell product into every single segment of the industry, so we're always kind of imputing a WFE headline. But I would say, the demand message holistically looks pretty descent I would expect and I see unit number next year that's probably a little higher than this year. I think that to the extent there are kind of inventory \u2013 I don't know if I would describe them as issues right now because I think it's pretty modest but there are certainly some evidence of minor industry corrections kind of playing out in the second half of the year. I think we go into next year with really good supply/demand balance in all segments of the industry. Next year is a very important year relative to transitioning from first phase investments and for some maybe second but primarily first phase investments in next-generation technology, and so the technology inflections of 3D NAND and FinFET transistor for example are really just beginning to get traction as device relevant. So I look at the demand statement and I feel reasonably good about all of it. And then obviously I think there's maybe four fabs coming online in the first half of next year, three of them I think are foundry logic and one is memory. So it's very clear that the customer is committed to the medium and long-term inflections and they are very disciplined around their execution. So even in a world like DRAM for example where perhaps as a by-product of ASPs in the last three months, there's some level of anxiety, it's a superefficient conversion and it is a conversion that has business subsets, it's a better performing DRAM at lower cost. And so at the end of the day it's all about the customer's ability to pay for that and if they can afford to do the upgrade then I think you see it executed. So I don't know if I would call out any one segment right now, I feel like there's legs in all three of them as we describe them, and we will see how the next kind of six months plays out before we get quantitative. Weston Twigg : That was a very good answer, very helpful especially for what's a difficult question. So as a follow-up, can you help me understand the nature of the big increase in the future Japanese revenue, was that more CMOS image sensor or was that perhaps some memory shipment? Martin Anstice : It was perhaps a little bit of both of those things, West. Weston Twigg : Perfect. Thanks again. Operator : We'll next go to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C.J. Muse: I guess first question, I was hoping to get I guess discuss your thoughts on 10-nanometer ramp on the foundry logic side and how you would compare and contrast it to what you saw to 20 nanometer, 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer, both in terms of timing and magnitude of equipment, first the pilot and then high-volume? Martin Anstice : I think in terms of timing, I'd refer you back to the slide that I presented in the Analyst Meeting, kind of not so much more to add there but the substance of 10 nanometer we think emerges next year and continues through 2017 with 7 nanometer investments playing out in the 2018 timeframe. So there's more details in the Analyst slide deck for you to take a look at. In terms of how we would expect the 10 nanometer investment to compare and contrast, I don't know that anybody can really answer that question today and I'm repetitively exposed to a broad diverse set of opinions. My personal opinion is that 16 nanometer and 14 nanometer is obviously important nodes as first FinFET but I have the impression that the fabless community have expectations of performance and cost benefits in relative terms with 10 nanometer that will be greater than they realized in the 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer space, and when I read what I read from the foundries, that seems to be consistent with what they are describing as a business objective as well. So, I would expect 10-nanometer to be a very robust technology node for the industry. In our models, as a point of reference we try to assess risk in our long-term models or opportunity in our long-term models. I think by the time we get to calendar 2018 in the logic and foundry combined, we've assumed about 150,000 wafer starts of 10-nanometer capacity. C.J. Muse: By calendar start 2018? Martin Anstice : That's it. By the time we get to the end of 2018, and I should have said foundry only, sorry, foundry only about 150,000 wafer starts by the end of 2018, that's our assumption in our [indiscernible]. C.J. Muse: Great. And I guess my follow up for Doug, two parts here, one, can you share what ending backlog was, and then two, for OpEx trajectory and the discrete items here in the September quarter, should we be getting back to low, mid-350s in December? Doug Bettinger : C.J., I'm not going to give you bookings. I did that a quarter or so ago just kind of as a one-off thing. C.J. Muse: No, but you do report ending backlog. I'm curious if you can share that. Doug Bettinger : We don't report that. Martin Anstice : You're going to see that in the 10-K. Doug Bettinger : We report it one time a year and it's \u2013 I actually haven't even looked at it, C.J. C.J. Muse: Okay. Doug Bettinger : So then your second question on spending, it will come down, probably a little bit above the quarter that we just announced but pretty close I think. Martin Anstice : Just to put the backlog statement in context, the reason Doug said what he said is the same reason that about seven or eight years ago Lam Research guys were not reporting bookings anymore. It gives a very misleading commentary on the ebbs and flows of the industry. And so when you take that input and then you take the very short-term nature and the cycle time compression that exist in the industry, the backlog for any of our companies today is much less a commentary on the future of the industry than ever before. So that's why it is only an annual disclosure that shows up in the 10-K filing. Doug Bettinger : And it's not that meaningful for kind of upcoming shipments. Operator : We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Harlan Sur : Congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. On the roughly flattish shipment outlook for September, you pointed out strong 3D NAND. Can you guys just give us the rough sense directionally for your DRAM, foundry and logic shipments in September? Martin Anstice : I'll give you a little color. It's going to be strong 3D NAND. DRAM is probably down a little bit. Everything else I think is pretty steady, plus or minus. Harlan Sur : Okay, great, thanks for that. And I'm not complaining about the gross margin performance here but given your commentary around sort of record loadings in your manufacturing facilities back at SEMICON a couple of weeks ago, I'm also kind of somewhat surprised that the team is not driving some gross margin benefits from better overhead absorptions on higher revenues in the September quarter. Is it mix related as you mentioned or are there some other cost related issues that are masking the potential absorption benefits? Martin Anstice : As you might expect, we're driving this conversation really hard but as you might also expect our customers drive the very same coefficient really hard relative to us contributing to their long-term success. So frankly speaking, the gross margin conversation does not exist in isolation, at least as we run our Company. We are very focused on trying to get the balance right, we feel like we've got a tremendous growth opportunity that can be executed in the context of the models that we presented, and for us to execute that and have sustainability it means we have to respond and respect to the long-term interest of our customers and other companies may choose different strategies and they may have different growth and profitable growth profiles as a result of that, ours I hope is very clear. Operator : And we'll next go to Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah : Martin, you mentioned 20% growth in the last couple of years as well as this year. When you think about sustainable growth, is 20% sort of the number that you have in your head looking forward? Martin Anstice : That's a good try, Romit. I would say our objective is to grow faster than the industry. We have an outperformance objective. We've talked about trying to grow twice as fast as the industry and we've been able to demonstrate an ability to do that. I think that's the more definitive objective for the Company, and if WFE kind of goes up and it coincides with 20%, that's great. Doug Bettinger : We should grow faster than the market and the industry, Romit, is the important point. Romit Shah : Understood. Thanks. And then the other point you guys have mentioned at least as far as 2016 goes is, one reason why you're optimistic on DRAM is that 20-nanometer conversion is still low as a percent of the installed base. Do you have an updated number for what you think that is or what it might be towards the end of the year? Martin Anstice : More or less the same number today, Romit, as before. Our expectation is, by the end of this year we've done about a third of the conversion to 20-nanometer done. So if the industry continues at the pace of calendar 2015 from a conversion point of view, it's another 18 months to two years before you're done and that's without one X and one Y and maybe even one Z in the roadmap of our customers. So as I said in the Analyst Meeting, we've got kind of two to three nodes after the 20-nanometer technology node in the roadmaps of customers as we understand them today. So I think there's decent sustainability here. At the end of the day, as has been demonstrated many times in this industry, it's all about ability to pay and if the ASP environment puts too much pressure on profitability then obviously it's tough for folks to spend money on converting even if there's business substance to that investment. Operator : We'll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company. Edwin Mok : Congrats on a great quarter. So first question on the etch market share number, I understand obviously you guys gave that target on the Analyst Event, but just kind of think about how you can achieve those numbers, how much of that is already designed that you believe you have already won in existing 3D NAND or FinFET or kind of newer inflection [indiscernible] opportunity versus has any of that or what portion of that is relying on customer corroborating to let's say thicker 3D NAND there like 72 layer 3D NAND or [indiscernible] 10-nanometer process and you won that business, is that what [indiscernible]? Martin Anstice : I mean in the timeframe of right now, the selection decisions that are being made by the industry in logic, for example 10 nanometer selection decisions, now there are some a little bit left of that and then maybe even some a little bit right of that from a kind of early-stage selection perspective, but it would be irresponsible for me to say it's all in the bank because in this industry we should constantly have respect for the competency and capability of our competition, everybody that survived this long is good, and we should recognize that we have to work hard every single day to continue to realize the opportunity that we've described. But I do feel like if we continue to execute in this Company and meet the commitments that we've made to customers, then in large parts the inflection story absolutely is as much in our control if not more in our control than anybody else. So 'in the bank' too strong a word but I think we've got good track records, we've employed the right strategy and you've heard me talk a lot in this call about supporting beliefs of customers, I think the instinct and the philosophy that we employ in the business on a day to day basis makes this story sustainable. Edwin Mok : Okay, great, that's fair. And then, Doug, can I ask you about capital structure, any thoughts, I know you guys did the buyback and you guys put up dividend and raised dividend recently but any thoughts about putting more leverage on the balance sheet or maybe putting more, adding more debt on the balance sheet and can you remind us how much of your cash is onshore versus offshore? Doug Bettinger : I mean right now I'm pretty comfortable with the balance sheet as it's at. We just a quarter ago raised $1 billion in debt. I feel very good about the cash we have in terms of funding what we need. So I don't see doing anything in the near term beyond what's there because we've got what we need. In terms of onshore/offshore cash, a little less than half of the cash today on the balance sheet is onshore and obviously a little more than half is offshore. Edwin Mok : Okay, great. That's all I have, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Mahesh Sanganeria : I will just combine both of my questions in one. Martin, just a question on the memory, DRAM versus NAND, industry trend and specific to your Company, you talked about logic and foundry being down slightly, of course memory is up. Can you talk a little bit about relative growth in DRAM and NAND for industry specific and also for your shipments because if I look at your shipment last year, your DRAM shipment were probably 40%, 50% more than NAND, and this year I get to almost even NAND and DRAM, so NAND has to be a huge growth, so if you can describe that a little bit qualitatively that will be helpful? Martin Anstice : I mean from an industry perspective, the wafer fabrication equipment spending kind of the 2014 compared to 2015 under the assumptions we described in this meeting, DRAM and NAND both increased year-over-year and the increase is slightly greater I would say in DRAM than NAND Flash actually. I'm sorry, I said that back to front. So for the Company, we obviously have communicated to you a really important message in terms of a sound expansion for 3D NAND and that means in relative terms the story for the Company is going to be positive around the 3D NAND transition which is heavily deposition and to some extent also etch intensive. So you got to see a stronger story for the Company in NAND because of that, but our outlook is both segments spent more money this year than last year and we see obviously a very meaningful inflection expansion for NAND next year and we believe consistent with the answer to last question that there's sustainability to the DRAM investment as well. Operator : It does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. So at this time we will go ahead \u2013 we do have one more question. Martin Anstice : We'll take one more, operator. Operator : We'll take that question from Jagadish Iyer with [Bridgestone Technology] [ph]. Jagadish Iyer : Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Just one quick question, Martin. One of your competitors have highlighted that next year potentially there could be a slight slowdown in DRAM spending and one of your customers has also indicated that the bit growth for next year for DRAM could be lower. In such a scenario, how should we be thinking about the patterning opportunity for you for next year vis-a-vis this year? Martin Anstice : I mean it's appropriate that you should make a connection between the multi-patterning growth opportunities for the Company in DRAM because multi-patterning shows up in DRAM as well as logic. I think the relationship in our assumptions next year is probably two-thirds logic one-third DRAM in terms of multi-patterning SAM. So there's definitely a consequence. If there was a scenario where DRAM spending did not play out, there is some level of consequence into the multi-patterning opportunity but the majority in the two-thirds I think if my memory serves me correct is logic based anyway. Jagadish Iyer : That's helpful. Thanks so much. Audrey Charles : Thank you, operator. That's all we have time for today. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's call.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Lam Research Corporation September 2015 Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Audrey Charles, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Audrey Charles : Thank you, operator. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lam Research; Rick Wallace, President and Chief Executive Officer of KLA-Tencor; Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Lam Research; and Bren Higgins, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of KLA-Tencor.  Prior to turning the call over to Lam and KLA management to share their perspective on this exciting business combination, I will read a few preliminary legal notices of the proposed transaction. The proposed transaction will be submitted to the stockholders of each of Lam and KLA for their consideration. Lam intends to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that will include a joint proxy statement prospectus of Lam Research and KLA-Tencor. Investors and security holders of Lam and KLA are urged to read the joint proxy statement prospectus and any other relevant documents that will be filed with the SEC carefully, and in their entirety, when they become available, because they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. The materials to be filed by Lam and KLA with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. In addition, security holders will be able to obtain free copies of the joint proxy statements prospectus from Lam or KLA by contacting Lam or KLA Investor Relations through the Investor Relations contact page on each company's website, investor.lamresearch.com or ir.kla-tencor.com. This call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding future outcomes and events, including: the time and the parties' ability to close the transaction; the anticipated benefits, technological advances and synergies to be realized as part of the proposed transaction; and the anticipated structures of future combined operations. Actual events or results may differ materially from those described in this call due to a number of risks and uncertainties detailed in documents filed by Lam Research and KLA-Tencor with the SEC, including Form 10-K filing, Form 8-K filing, filings under rule 425 and the joint proxy and registration statements the parties expect to file. With that, I'll turn our call over to Martin Anstice. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Audrey. I would like to start this morning by thanking you for joining us at short notice.  Today, we announced that Lam Research and KLA-Tencor will be combining. We believe that this transaction will allow us to deliver compelling value to a transforming semiconductor industry by combining industry leaders in wafer processing and process control to help our customers address their most difficult challenges. Together, we will deliver unmatched capability, creating a new paradigm for process and process control, delivering optimized results in partnership with our customers by reducing variability and accelerating yields, helping our customers extend Moore's Law and performance scaling generally. The new company will have increased breadth and scale, both valuable components for sustaining long-term growth. The technical competency and capability of the combined company, which is illustrated by our respective product leadership positions, will benefit our employees, customers and stockholders alike. We are confident that together, we will deliver higher levels of innovation and collaboration than would be possible as independent companies.  We are certain that, just as we identified the need for closer alignments of deposition and etch, which resulted in our successful merger with Novellus, the opportunity for closer alignments between process and process control creates an exciting opportunity as the drive to reduce variability at the atomic level becomes central to our customers' high-volume manufacturing success. The transaction offers compelling financial opportunities, including the expansion of our served market and substantial synergies. We expect to realize $250 million of cost synergies within 18 to 24 months of transaction close and $600 million of revenue synergies by 2020. The transaction will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and free cash flow per share during the first 12 months of the transaction. If I could direct you to Slide 5 of our PowerPoint deck today, here are a few of the highlights of the transaction.  KLA-Tencor stockholders will receive $32 in cash and 0.5 shares of Lam Research per KLA-Tencor share, effectively valuing the company at $67.02 per share or $10.6 billion, using Lam's stock price as of October 20. On a pro forma basis, KLA shareholders will own approximately 32% of the combined company. Both boards have unanimously approved the transaction and, pending customary regulatory and shareholder approvals, we expect to close in mid-2016. The combined company will be called Lam Research.  We strongly believe this is the right combination for our industry at the right time. The powerful drivers of Cloud's mobility and IoT are firmly established and growing. The demands of these segments, higher performance, lower power and smaller form factors, increase the economic and technical challenges faced by our customers, providing a catalyst for broad industry transformation.  Our customers and their customers both demand new levels of innovation and collaborative engagements as they continue to scale with new materials, the transition to 3D device architectures, multi-patterning imaging, advanced packaging integration schemes and next generation memory solutions. The ability to differentiate in these technology inflections increasingly lies at the intersection of process and process control. Together, we will be much better positioned to meet these challenges by combining best-in-class process performance with industry-leading metrology, inspection and analytical capability. We seek to create unmatched and complementary capability to enable atomic level processing. I am looking forward to formally welcoming the KLA-Tencor employees to our new company. These are 2 companies with similar cultures and values, geographic proximity, with a passion to contribute and win, and to take pride in doing things the right way in the interests of our customers. I look forward to listening, learning and building a strong team together with them as we create a more exciting future. And before handing the call to Rick, I want to thank him personally, and also his team, for their leadership and vision in creating a great company, and working with us putting together what we believe is an extremely compelling transaction. Rick, over to you. Richard Wallace : Thank you, Martin. This is truly a transformational day in the industry and for both companies. I spent 28 years at KLA-Tencor, and I've seen several industry transformations. But in my opinion, this combination has the potential to be the most transformative, both from a capability and from a timing perspective.  Our customers are on the cusp of ramping some incredibly complex technologies, with roadmaps for advanced development over the next decade already in place. And KLA and Lam's combined capability to partner with our customers on improving the manufacturability and the yield of these technologies will be a powerful value creator in the space to a degree that neither of us could achieve as standalone companies.  The SAM expansion that's been experienced by Lam, driven by the inflections of 3D device architecture and multi-patterning, will complement KLA-Tencor's strong presence in foundry and logic, and create both SAM and market share expansion opportunities for both companies.  We're proud of what we've built at KLA and the value that we've delivered. The scale achieved by combining with Lam substantially enhances our future value creation potential, making this transaction a win both for today and for tomorrow. KLA's strong results and guidance today, and the confidence we have in continuing our growth in 2016, are a direct result of our efforts with our customers in the last decade to enable industry transitions and scaling. I want to recognize our employees whose dedication to excellence across all aspects of the organization have made this performance possible.  Through the discussions we have had to date with Lam, it's been reinforcing me -- to me that the capability and the culture of our companies are very similar. And that will be a key component to the success of this combination. And I also want to thank Martin for his leadership, and I am very confident in the success of this company under his leadership as we go forward. And with that, let me hand it back to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Rick. As we have said many times, our guiding principle for effective consolidation in our industry is first focused on the legitimacy of innovation strategies and the opportunity for sustainable value creation from the perspective of our customers.  With this threshold validated here, we are excited to deliver compelling value to all stakeholders by combining the established leaders in deposition, etch, clean, inspection and metrology. However, the rationality of this transaction lies in our belief that the combination is substantially stronger than the sum of the parts. By joining the critical device manufacturing areas of process and process control, our 2 companies combined will become a more knowledgeable, more capable and closer partner to our customers, better positioning us to innovate the solutions required to meet the industry's needs together. For example, in logic and DRAM multi-patterning, as we highlighted at our Analyst Day in July of this year, the key challenges faced in high volume manufacturing for multi-patterning schemes are variability and costs. By more effectively linking the process control expertise of KLA and Lam's strength in process around critical technology inflections, we can improve efficiency and utility of metrology information for optimization of the unit process at a much greater depth. This represents the potential for faster and better solutions for our customers, and opportunities for differentiation and profitable growth for us. It is already clear that the level of integrated controls we will be able to deliver becomes even more critical at 7-nanometer and beyond, where substantially high levels of control of patterning processes will be required in support of our customers' roadmaps. In the 3D NAND space, high aspect ratio structures and long process times increase costs and complexity. We plan to utilize our combined leadership capability in deposition, etch and metrology to innovate and develop process control capability for 3D NAND structures to help enable cost-effective vertical scaling. Our increased scale and breadth will enable multiple value creation drivers. From the market perspective, when we combine Lam's inflection-driven SAM expansion, which we believe extends throughout this decade, with KLA's strong presence and new product momentum in wafer and mask inspection and optical and overlay metrology, we expect to compete for more than 45% of WFE by 2018.  Worthy of note. The complementary nature of our presence in the WFE market is striking. Lam has historic strength in memory applications and has made meaningful progress in the logic segments of WFE over the last several years. Lam also has technology inflection growth drivers in logic and memory, both, with multi-patterning process flows and 3D device architecture. KLA has a relatively stronger presence and opportunity in the logic segments with exciting new product introductions. The wafer fabrication equipment segments complement is a powerful commentary on the combined company's opportunity to sustain growth through the specific investment cycles of our increasingly large and consolidated customers.  We also see meaningful costs and revenue synergies available, including $250 million of annualized cost synergies realizable within 18 to 24 months of closing as well as a strong revenue synergy opportunity of approximately $600 million by 2020, made possible by strengthening unit process performance and value of our core product offerings. Finally, our shared and well-established operating excellence combined with our deal-specific commitments to prioritize deleveraging our balance sheet supports our commitments to profitable growth. All of these value-creation drivers will reside in a business with increased diversity of people, product portfolio, market segments and customer exposure. More opportunity, no question. With that, let me turn the call over to Doug. He will cover the financial details of our transaction as well as offer a brief review of our September quarter performance and December 2015 outlook. Douglas Bettinger : Thank you, Martin. I'm going to start with the transaction summary, which you can see on Slide 12.  Lam Research will acquire all of the outstanding KLA-Tencor shares in a cash and stock transaction that values KLA at $10.6 billion in equity value or approximately $67.02 per share. The deal provides that KLA-Tencor stockholders may elect to receive in exchange for their shares the economic equivalent of $32 in cash and 0.5 of a share of Lam research common stock in all cash, stock or mixed consideration, subject to proration as more fully described in the merger agreement.  To finance the purchase, Lam will issue approximately 80 million new shares and approximately $3.9 billion of new debt. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade rating. The combined company will have a healthy cash position of approximately $5.3 billion and a very strong cash flow generation profile. We expect to begin deleveraging soon after closing with an objective to get below 2.5x gross debt-to-EBITDA as soon as possible.  As Martin mentioned, we expect to realize $250 million of annualized cost synergies within the first 18 to 24 months of close as well as approximately $600 million in annualized revenue synergies by 2020. We expect the transaction to be accretive on an earnings and free cash flow per share basis during the 12 months after closing. The combined company will retain the Lam Research name. Martin Anstice will lead the company as CEO, and we anticipate a combined company leadership team with strong representation from both companies across all functions. Lam's Chairman, Steve Newberry, will continue in that role, and 2 board members from KLA will join the combined company board effective as of the time of closing. As mentioned earlier, the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and the approval of both Lam and KLA shareholders. We've already begun integration planning, and our efforts will be helped significantly by our close geographical proximity, our long history of close collaboration as well as our collective experience of successfully integrating companies. We currently estimate receiving all approvals on a timely basis and that the transaction can be funded and closed in mid-2016.  Martin's already highlighted many of the financial benefits of the transaction. I'd like to take that a step further and shed some light on how we view the combined company's financial model. That starts with the sizable expansion of the revenue opportunity and increased diversity of our business. Given the complementary market leadership positions of each -- that each company enjoys and no product overlap, the combined company will be positioned to address approximately 45% of the WFE market by 2018. The combined company will also derive approximately 1/4 of its revenues from its larger installed base. We will have a more balanced exposure across all customers and market segments.  In the 2017-18 time frame, assuming a $35 billion WFE, we expect a combined company target model of approximately $10 billion in revenue and industry-leading performance highlighted by non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 27%. These profitability levels enable us continued strong and sustainable commitment to R&D into the uncompromised delivery of leading technology and productivity offerings as we leverage the combined strengths of the 2 companies to deliver on customer commitments. Martin mentioned in his comments the multiple value creation leverage that we have as a combined company. In addition to the expanded market, revenue synergies and strong profitability levels, we will be augmenting returns through deleveraging the balance sheet and continuing to pursue our capital return program including a sustained quarterly cash dividend, in line with Lam's current practice, and a bias towards continuing share repurchases, once we reach our leverage target.  Speaking as Lam CFO, this is an exciting transaction from a financial perspective, providing outstanding opportunities to invest in growth and create additional value for our customers, employees and shareholders.  Let me switch gears and now spend a few minutes on our September quarter results, guidance for September, and I'll also provide some color on our preliminary views of 2016. All numbers will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. The September quarter marked yet another period of outperformance for Lam, once again featuring record revenue and operating income. Results came in at or above the midpoint of our guided ranges across all metrics. September quarter revenues of $1.6 billion and shipments of $1.58 billion were both right at the midpoint of guidance.  As expected, memory shipments were stronger in the quarter. The combined memory segment made up 72% of total system shipments, compared to 16% in the prior quarter. NAND and other nonvolatile memory accounted for 40% of the shipments. NAND investment in the quarter was primarily directed towards investments in 3D NAND. DRAM shipments represent 32% of system shipments, which was down a little bit from 37% in the prior quarter. Shipments to our Foundry customers were at 18% of system shipments, and finally, the logic and other segment accounted for 10% of system shipments. Non-GAAP gross margins came in at 46.5%, which was at the high end of our guidance. The strength was driven by better mix and stronger manufacturing absorption. Operating expense came in at $364 million, which resulted in operating income of 23.8%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.82 ended up above the high end of our guidance. Let me now turn to December. As we previously indicated, we expect shipments down sequentially coming in at $1.275 billion, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1.41 billion, again, plus or minus $75 million. We're forecasting gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus a percentage point; operating income of 20.5%, again, plus or minus a percentage point; and finally earnings per share of $1.42, plus or minus $0.10.  September's results combined with the midpoint of December guidance positions us for our third consecutive calendar year of 20% revenue growth driven by our strong position in the technology inflections. As we look forward to 2016, while it's still a little bit too early to quantify from a numerical perspective, we continue to believe, based on market demand as well as planning conversations with our customers, there will be a healthy level of investment across a number of segments next year.  In the NAND segment, we see positive momentum driven by continued deployment of 3D NAND to meet the requirements of the growing SSD market. With approximately 10% of the install base 3D capable by the end of this year, we see the opportunity for continued strong investment in this segment.  In DRAM, we view our customers as disciplined in matching supply with demand. We expect diligent investments in 20-nanometer conversions given the high customer ROI at this node. And we also expect initial shipments for 1x nanometer DRAM in late 2016.  In the Foundry segment, we continue to see that investments are focused on FinFET adoption at a number of customers. Development at the leading edge for the multi-patterning intensive technology transition from first to second generation FinFET is progressing, and we anticipate will lead the shipments in 2016 for 10-nanometer capability.  As a result of these trends, our early view is that 2016 WFE spending could be flat to maybe slightly down. However, we expect our SAM to increase year-on-year, as a greater share of WFE is directed to critical technology inflection-driven spending. As is customary, I'd just add that the outlook I just shared with you is predicated on a stable macroeconomic environment.  With that, let me turn the call to Bren who will cover KLA's results and guidance. Bren Higgins : Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I just want to highlight that the reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found on our website, kla-tencor.com. Q1 was a good quarter for KLA-Tencor, with the company delivering results above the guided range for bookings and non-GAAP earnings per share and with revenues finishing at the top end of the range of guidance, demonstrating KLA-Tencor's market leadership, the strength of our business model and solid operational execution. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Revenue for the quarter was $643 million, and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.71, above the top end of the $0.46 to $0.66 guidance range. New orders in Q1 grew 8% sequentially to $725 million and finished 32% above the midpoint of order guidance. We experienced good momentum in order activity in the quarter, and demand was strong across each of our end markets, highlighted by strong foundry demand for both leading edge and 28-nanometer requirements as well as incremental upside in 10-nanometer mask inspection demand. We are particularly excited about the strong demand we are experiencing for leading edge mask inspection tools to support 10-nanometer development, as we had our strongest quarter for this product family since December of 2011. With the deployment of multi-patterning and other advanced device architectures in leading edge, logic and foundry, radical design is becoming increasingly more complex. The upside in mask inspection demand not only reflects KLA-Tencor's technology and market leadership in this key inspection market, it also indicates our customers are moving forward with their schedules for 10-nanometer development in calendar year 2016.  As we look ahead to the December quarter and into next calendar year, we expect continued order momentum. We are on track to ship multiple units of Gen 5, our latest generation broadband plasma wafer inspection platform, in the December quarter and expect the combination of new product demand in optical wafer inspection as well as the mask inspection demand I just discussed to set the stage for what we are planning to be a solid year in 2016.  Foundry was 44%, the new system orders in September and up strongly on a sequential basis, both in terms of percentage of total orders and absolute dollars compared with the June quarter.  Memory was 37% of new orders for Q1 with the majority of the demand focused on NAND activities. Logic was 19% of new system orders in September, consistent with our original view of timing of initial shipments for 10-nanometer development for both logic and foundry customers. These orders are expected to ship in the middle of calendar year 2016.  Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group : wafer inspection was approximately 43% of new system orders; patterning, which now includes radical inspection, was approximately 30%; service was 25%; and non-semi was approximately 2%.  Total shipments in the quarter were $635 million and within the guided range of $610 million to $690 million. In total, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of total backlog, comprised of $1.1 billion of shipment backlog or orders that had not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 to 9 months; and $214 million of revenue backlog or products that have shipped and invoiced, but have not yet been signed up by customers. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments in the range of $660 million to $740 million. Turning now to the income statement. Revenue was $643 million, finishing at the top end of the range of guidance for the quarter. Gross margin was 58.7%, slightly up compared with the June quarter on lower revenue, benefiting from a more favorable product mix and lower parts expenses in our service business than we originally modeled in the quarter. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 57.5% to 58.5% in December. Total operating expenses were $206 million, down $8 million compared with the June quarter, finishing below our guidance of $212 million and approximately $34 million lower than the September quarter of 2014. The lower operating expense levels we are seeing today are the results of the cost actions we took earlier this year. We expect quarterly operating expense levels to remain in the range of $205 million to $210 million over the next several quarters. Our effective tax rate was 22.6% in the quarter, in line with our long-term planning rate of 22%. Finally, net income was $112 million or $0.71 per fully diluted share, and we ended the quarter with 158 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn to some brief highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.3 billion. Cash from operations was $194 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $186 million.  In the quarter, we paid $82 million in regular dividend and repurchased 143 million of shares of our common stock in the period. We also made a supplemental payment of $40 million towards our outstanding term loan. In conclusion, although there is always some uncertainty as to the pace and magnitude of industry CapEx in calendar year '16, given our market leadership, new product revenue and with the benefit of our leaner cost structure, KLA-Tencor is well positioned for strong relative performance in the coming year. Now for guidance for the December quarter. Bookings are expected to be flat at the midpoint compared with Q1, and in the range of $625 million to $825 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $670 million and $730 million with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.75 to $0.95 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Martin. Martin? Martin Anstice : Thank you, Bren. As should be clear from our comments this morning, we see substantial value creation opportunities ahead for our organization, our customers and our stockholders by virtue of combining Lam Research and KLA-Tencor. We recognize both the opportunity and challenging combining 2 large companies, and we understand that our demonstrated execution is a necessary component of sustaining and building trust with all stakeholders. As demonstrated with the integration of Novellus and subsequent outperformance, we are confident and completely invested in meeting that expectation and sincerely appreciate your ongoing support. As was just summarized by our 2 CFOs and standalone company's press release today, the headlines of current and short-term future performance are clear. Both companies reported and guided a strong first half '15, second half '15 revenue balance. Both exceeded earnings guidance in the September quarter and exceeded earnings consensus for the December 2015 quarter.  Profitable growth is again reinforced by demonstrated operational excellence and leverage from flexible business models in both companies. New product introduction is a prevalent theme for the combined portfolio going into 2016, a year where we aligned to the consensus of flat-to-slightly down WFE with a second half '16 slightly stronger than the first half of '16. Significantly, at the combined company level, we anticipate a growing SAM calendar 2016 over 2015. For Lam, in large part, this is the inflection story generating outperformance opportunity; for KLA, in large part, this is a commentary on mix and new products with slightly stronger allocation to logic spending than memory when compared to 2015.  Longer term, the strategic rationale and growth opportunities lay in our combined ability to create a new paradigm of process enablement to support our customers as they address unprecedented economic and scaling challenges in their industry. As a combined company, we will continue our focus on the technology leadership and investments critical to success in the inflections of today and tomorrow, enhancing our ability to deliver value to customers while also expanding our SAM and strategic relevance.  We also remain committed to operational excellence and profitable growth, with returns enhanced both by achieving the cost and revenue synergies available in this transaction, and by continuing our commitments of returning additional value to stockholders. In closing, the combination of Lam Research and KLA-Tencor will allow us to move faster, innovate better, scale efficiencies and, ultimately, provide more value to our customers, their customers and our stockholders. We are very excited to get started on this journey. And with that, we are happy to take some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from James Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello : Martin, I guess first question, when you talk about the revenue synergies, can you help us understand a little bit how you're thinking about the revenue synergies for in situ versus standalone tools in the combined entity going forward? Martin Anstice : Yes, Jim. I think the way we think about it is that in the world of the complexity that I described for our customers, there's tremendous uncertainty about a lots of things, the materials, process, device architectures and structures and to some extent, there is uncertainty relative to how they solve some of these problems. So putting ourselves on the inside of this conversation is the space we want to be where whatever trajectory is valuable to our customers from an integrated perspective, standalone perspective, real-time process control perspective, we will have put together a portfolio of tensors, algorithms, analytics, software and process and metrology management systems where we can respond proactively and, I think, beat expectations. So we're not planning to go to market with the answer to this question. We have lots of ideas and we have lots of strategies in place already. But as you know, in this industry, responding to needs of customers and supporting their choices is an important foundation of success. James Covello : That's incredibly a helpful perspective. And as a follow-up sort of staying on the same topic, can you help us think a little bit about the general trend that you and others have discussed toward integrating process control with processing tools, whether it's in situ or standalone versus kind of the historical customer thoughts or concerns around kind of having their process control and neutrality, if you will? In other words, having a neutral process control provider, is this just a dynamic where the process control requirements and the processing requirements are getting so stringent that customers kind of have to give up some of their desire to have neutrality with their process control provider? Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean -- just to be clear, this is not about dominance. This is about creating more choices and more solutions for customers. There clearly is demonstrated momentum in the conversation of integrated and real-time process control. I think it's early days. And again, this combination creates a situation where we are going to be right at the center of enabling the choices of our customer. And I think that's the right place for us to be. Operator : We'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad : My first question, Martin, is really talking about your growth rates of the 2 companies. If I look at the CAGR over the last 5 years, Lam has -- Lam and Novellus have kind of grown mid-5% CAGR and KLA has been growing about half of that rate. And when we look at the industry guidance, which you have clearly outlined in the analyst days over the last 2, 3 years, Lam has been very well exposed to some of the inflections that are happening in the industry. So as you think about the growth rate of the combined company, does it slow down once you acquire KLA? And can you just help us understand like how are you thinking about the effect on your growth as you were looking at the acquisition? Martin Anstice : Yes, I think as we tried to articulate in the prepared comments, I mean, we're really excited about the opportunity. And stating the obvious, this is about absolute dollars of growth, not percentages. I mean, that's the fundamental measurement of performance of companies. And we see a tremendous platform of foundation in both companies for growth. I think we articulated slightly different reasons why in the '16 and '15 comparisons, both companies outperformed. The inflection story of Lam that we've talked about for many years is still a great platform and a great story and long may that continue, and we're supplementing that with a new product wave from KLA-Tencor, and we're supplementing that with more balance from a segment exposure point of view, and in the '16 to '15 transition, that is a very positive momentum for the KLA company and in turn, combined company. So we're really pleased about the growth trajectory, the profitable growth trajectory of both companies. Farhan Ahmad : And then as a follow-up, one question for Rick. If you can just talk about -- your Gen 5 platform is about to be introduced, so why sell the company at this point when you had a great product story coming up next year? Richard Wallace : Well, the Gen 5 is doing extremely well. We've had several customer engagements as we've talked. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we will be shipping those initial shippers by the end of the calendar year. So I'm very excited with that. I really look at this combination not as selling the company, but becoming part of a big industry powerhouse, really, where we're going to be able to provide great solutions for our customers as they work towards their challenges that they're facing in Moore's Law. And I think that this enables the industry to move forward, and I'm very excited about it. So I view it as the right next step for KLA-Tencor and for Lam. Operator : We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Bill Peterson : This Bill Peterson for Harlan. And congratulations to both Lam and KLA teams on the deal. I wonder if, Martin or Rick, you've had conversations with customers and what -- how are the customers viewing this transaction? And part of the question is because, obviously, last year, 2 industry leaders tried to combine and it didn't happen, and there were some thoughts that some of the larger customers did not really \u2013 were keen on the transaction. So I wanted to get your perspective on how customers view this potential transaction. Martin Anstice : Yes, I think I'll take this one. I mean, I have and I think I've even spoken to this on prior calls, I spent a lot of time in the last 4 to 5 years dialoguing with the customers around their strategic challenges and how we might contribute to creating value and choices and solutions as part of that. And I think every customer in the world is going to articulate a value proposition around controlling process and that is a fundamental component of value. There is obviously no product overlap here between these 2 companies. It's about adjacency. And it's about complement. There is geographic proximity, which makes the integration risk profile dramatically different than the other transaction that you referred to. So my instinct is from the conversations that I've had with customers, there is going to be a lot of support for this, and I think in large part, that's a commentary on the motivation. So the motivations that we've stated, I hope, are really clear. This is about enabling the future of long-term success for our customers and in turn, creating opportunity for us. And that bias to focus on the customer to build customer trust, to give them choices is everything about the values, the culture of KLA-Tencor and Lam Research and that will continue. Bill Peterson : Okay, great. And then maybe switching more to the fundamental environment, and you provided kind of a view towards 2016. I believe Doug, on a recent call at a different sell side conference, talked about how the view to 2016 was -- the bias would be perhaps even up, and now it's more flat to down. I'm kind of wondering what's changed since then. What are the puts and takes? And I guess what areas would you expect to drive it to more of a flat to down profile versus maybe a prior view of perhaps being up? Martin Anstice : Yes, I don't think we\u2019d add anything to kind of existing public disclosure on puts and takes. But the headline today is we support the consensus opinion of flat to slightly down of WFE. There are kind of a couple of elements to that. One of them is meaningfully less DRAM investment next year, meaningfully more NAND investment next year and kind of flattish microprocessor and logic and foundry to maybe slightly up. So that's a headline that I think is kind of well established. As Doug said in his prepared comments, a very important headline to remember is in that context, KLA-Tencor and Lam Research both are projecting SAM expansion year-over-year, and both of us are projecting market share expansion as well. And I didn't comment about market share, but our customary 1% to 2% market share target is kind of a platform of growth for us there. So hope that helps. I think we have to take the next question in the interest of time. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri : So I have 2 questions. Number one, Martin, can you talk about the dividend policy for the combined company? Douglas Bettinger : Tim, I'll take it. This is Doug. As we look forward, we're going to continue essentially the dividend level that Lam has today. And as we've described before, we understand the expectation that dividends grow over time and we will have a bias to continue to do that. I want to emphasize though, Tim, that the main priority, at least in the near term, first and foremost, is going to be the profitable investment in the business; second, is going to be deleverage the balance sheet; and then third, is going to be return to equity holders. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it, at least until we get to that leverage target I communicated, of 2.5x gross debt-to-EBITDA. We're going to prioritize paying the debt down. Martin Anstice : And relative to that 2.5x ratio, we're targeting 12 to 18 months to get to that point. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, it should happen in 2017, Tim. Timothy Arcuri : Got it. Okay. So I guess just a second question is really on the timing of the deal. As I said, obviously, I think of this -- that this deal makes tons of sense. But why now? Is it some view on EUV? Did something change in the market place in the last couple of quarters? I'm just sort of curious, why now. Martin Anstice : Well, I'm sorry to say it's not because you said you like the deal. The why now answer is pretty straightforward. This is a commentary on opportunity. It's a commentary on capability of combined companies and it's a commentary on the need from our customers and the industry. The foundation from 2 standalone companies is strong and architecting strategic change of this nature is better done from a position of strength. And so we see a tremendous opportunity. We do believe, as I said, there will be support, there is support, for this type of combination, which respects and promotes the long-term interest of our customers. And we certainly believe, having executed not quite on the same scale, but executed a merger integration with Lam and Novellus, we have an experience. We have a competency and capability to make sure that we do not compromise on commitments made to customers as standalone companies and we execute better and stronger together. Operator : We'll take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Christopher Muse : I guess, first question, Martin, just taking a step back, the narrative for Lam over the last 2 years was best growth in the industry, leveraged all the right technology transitions. And with this transaction, that narrative seems to be changing a bit. And so curious, what do you see in the future? And/or what has occurred that changed a bit? Is it the fact that we're maturing? Or challenges to Moore's Law? Is it a vision that scale, increased scale is really necessary to compete in that world? We'd love to hear your thoughts. Martin Anstice : Well, actually, I would probably contend the premise in your question. I don't think this is a fundamental recharacterization of the message from our company. We're absolutely focused on our performance. We're absolutely focused on operational excellence. We're absolutely focused on expanding profitability faster than we are revenues. And I think there's plenty of opportunity to do that as a combined company. This is a very strategic transaction. It is a commentary on a long-term commitment to our customers. And for sure, scale and breadth of portfolio is better than not. For sure, as I said, we have more diversity, more competency, more capability, more learning. The quality of fundamental research and product and services development will be higher as a result of this transaction. But I think at a very fundamental level, the outperformance commentary of this combined company is still a great value proposition. Christopher Muse : Excellent. And just as a quick follow-up, Doug, can you share your early thoughts on what the long-term tax rate will be for the combined entity given you're about what, 6, 7 points below KLA? Douglas Bettinger : Yes, CJ, if I was you, I'd model something partway between both companies. Obviously, part of when we do integration, we'll be working on some tax planning. But for modeling purposes, I'd split the difference right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Atif Malik : Martin, first question. Can you compare this deal to the Novellus deal? I mean, when I look at it on a cost synergies level as well as a product overlap, they're very similar. There's no product overlap. The revenue synergy is a little bit tough to understand, given that your -- it appears -- LAM appears to have not been successful in growing the process control area with a process equipment capability. So we'd love to get an understanding of what 2 or 3 applications you're looking at in terms of revenue synergies, and then I have a follow-up. Martin Anstice : Well, I mean, I guess the obvious statement to make relative to the comparison is this is bigger, which means our expectations are higher. And I think I agree with the essence of the comparison you just made. I think -- what is the differentiation? What is the distinction in our strategy versus any competitor strategy? Our focus is on unit process excellence. These are 2 companies that have well-established positions of leadership. And as we've talked about many times, you have to have positions of leadership. You have to give customers choices. You have to respect their ability to deliver competitive differentiation as much as your own. And I think with those biases and with that philosophy, there are, again, plenty of opportunities around 3D device architecture and around the logic roadmap for us to open up process windows, for us to deliver more predictable solutions to our customers and for us to break through the historic challenges associated with streamlining optimizing the process and process control arena. This is the first company that will have ever had the competency and capability that we will bring to our customers. Richard Wallace : One other thought. As you know, the adoption of inspection in measurement in memory manufacturing is lower than it is in logic and foundry. It's my belief that one of the reasons for that is, particularly in 3D NAND, is the fact that we're held off from the process. I think this combination allows the inspection of metrology to much more be part of the integration of those, and that becomes more important. It's not like our customers aren't struggling with the yield on 3D. We know they are. But I think this enables us to provide more capability, helps them get their yield and at the same time provides market opportunity for the combined company. So I think that's really exciting. Atif Malik : Great. And then as a follow-up. If you guys can comment on the NAND spending environment for next year? ASML on their call last week mentioned that the NAND spending on 3D especially could be lower than this year given that there's one fab that's already fully ramped on the greenfield level, but -- and there's brownfield fab. We love to get your thoughts on how you're looking at NAND spending within that flat-to-down outlook. Martin Anstice : Yes, we don't align to the statements and the representations you just made at all. So our view of NAND spending in calendar '16 is that it is higher than the calendar 2015 spend level. About 95% of the spending is invested and directed to the 3D device transition. We see a universal commitment to that technology transition from our customers, and I think the commentary from almost every customer around the importance of this transition is a very positive one. We believe that the 3D NAND chip capacity by the end of this year is around 160,000 wafer starts per month, and our best estimate is somewhere between 350,000 and 400,000 wafer starts by the end of next calendar year. And we would expect somewhere similar to, or maybe a tweak more, capacity in qualification at the end of next year compared to this, and that's really just a statement on kind of what is normal in a transition of this scale. So the 3D NAND investments, we think, is a very prominent theme and one that we're well positioned for. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar : A couple of quick questions. One is, clearly, both Lam and KLA as a standalone company has had a very product-focused approach. But when I look at the Lam-Novellus deal, it does got out of certain products like PVD to get the ultimate synergies. I'm wondering, to the extent you can answer, are there any products that exit now that you have KLA under your belt to get revenue or cost synergies? And then I have a follow-up. Martin Anstice : Yes, I don't know if I would really kind of look at a -- point to a PVD decision as a necessary or particularly material component delivering synergies. It was a pretty small investment level. But to your question, we have -- I think, both companies run very well. Both companies take strat planning and operational planning fairly seriously. Both companies have high bars for investment -- investing in the future of our businesses. And more or less, I think the roadmaps of both companies are valued together as much as they were separately. So that said, we have a really, really strong set of executives as a result of this combination. And they will continue to take ownership for refinements as appropriate from whatever learning and opportunities and feedback we have from customers. But I think the basic headline is : As Is. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. And then as a follow-up, what is the breakup fee that is involved in the deal? And were there other businesses that you looked at that you had thought would have been more attractive? Or you think this was the way given the size and scale required? Douglas Bettinger : Chris, the breakup fee is pretty customary and you'll see it once we file a prospectus. It's approximately $300 million -- a little less than $300 million. And Martin, do you want to comment on that? Martin Anstice : No. Nothing to say. Douglas Bettinger : This is the right deal at the right time, Krish. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin : I just had a follow-up question on the potential EPS value created from the merger, Martin. I think Doug may have said it, WFE is $35 billion, then you could hit an operating margin target. And I'm getting to a combined EPS of around $8 or so, which assumes a higher share count and some more interest expense from the debt. So that looks like it's higher by about 10% to 20% than the Lam EPS potential that you shared at SEMICON West. So my question is, just want to make sure that we were in kind of the ballpark of where this potential EPS could be? And is this one of the reasons why this combined company is better than the standalone? Douglas Bettinger : Yes, Stephen. I gave you a model that said $10 billion and 27%. I mean, just things to think about. The interest rate on the debt is going to be kind of high 3s as a percentage, and I've already given you how much debt need to get raised, so you can solve for that. We told you that the deal will be accretive in the -- within the first 12 months, and it will get more accretive as you go out in time. I'm not going to confirm the numbers that you just went through, but this is an accretive transaction. This is a transaction that's good for shareholders. It's good for the combined companies. We're really excited about where we're going with our numbers. Stephen Chin : Okay. And then Martin, you know there's a general market perception out there that KLA's market is in decline, and I think you did a pretty good explaining why you disagree with that. Could you share any color on what the customers may think of this deal? And the customers also encourage you to consider merging with KLA? Martin Anstice : I don't know that I would go quite as far as your last question. But as I said in response to a similar question earlier, I spent a lot of time dialoguing with customers in the last few years around strategic opportunities for our company to gather their perspective and their requirements and their motivations and to integrate that, because I want, appropriately, customers invested in the success of our company, in whatever form that exists. And I believe that there is a very compelling perspective from customers around value from opening up process windows, delivering more predictive results on wafer. And to Rick's points, technology enablement is the first contribution for us to make; productivity is the second. And there are as many economic challenges in the future of our industry and our customers as there are technical. And we think this is a very fundamental paradigm, which the combination allows us to pursue. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest. Weston Twigg : And not to be a downer, but I was wondering if you could maybe take a stab at giving us an idea of what your target model might look like if demand is not $35 billion WFE? Like, what if it's $30 billion? Can you give us maybe a ballpark view on what the target amount might look like in that range? Douglas Bettinger : Yes, it will be lower, Wes. I think if you're really kind of want to do scenario planning, you can look at the public commentary from both companies. We've both had financial models that have been out there. You can kind of look at the way I'm putting the 2 together in the $35 billion scenario, Wes, and I think you can kind of smooth between what you think the world looks like just by doing that. Weston Twigg : Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the revenue synergies, the $600 million. I was wondering if maybe you could help us understand a little bit more specifically where the opportunities are. Is it primarily just the new value of the combined solutions or do you see a specific segment? Do you expect to grow a bit faster than you could comment on? And just a little more color on how you get to that $600 million in revenue synergies. Martin Anstice : Frankly speaking, there's a limit to how much of that conversation I want to have. We've done a lot of work in preparation for this conversation to validate the $600 million. And obviously, there is a competitive component to messaging in the public domain. So Slide 8 in our deck today, which describes how we plan to deliver differentiated technology solutions together is the best way to answer the question. We do see there are very important opportunities to use metrology information to strengthen the fundamental value proposition of deposition, etch and clean solutions in the logic space around FinFET and next generation gates. The multi-patterning process flow is not the cheapest process flow in the world, as everybody has discussed. And so any opportunity we have to improve productivity, increase yields, open up process windows, is a tremendous value proposition. That will be new products and services, I hope, over time and more capable etch and deposition and clean systems. In 3D NAND, I think Rick already answered the question. There are opportunities in 3D NAND. It is illustrative where one company gets earlier access to an inflection in the industry, and we have an opportunity here that kind of normalized to make sure every part of process, process control combined company gets early access to technology inflections and get in the best position possible to make appropriate investments and deliver differentiated solutions. So a broad cross-section of plays, fundamental value will strengthen what we have. Second is supplement. And we will be taking a very measured approach through that. As all of you know, it takes a long time in this industry to deliver new capability, which is why the revenue projection is biased to the beyond 2018 reference point. Operator : We'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Patrick Ho : Martin, maybe for you. You guys have obviously displayed the growth, particularly for yourselves in the etch and deposition market and the SAM store you detailed. Maybe going back to your talk about innovation, accelerating and the revenue synergy potentials, do you believe some of your SAM expansion potential can, I guess, pull process control or maybe get it out of the current rut that it's in, and maybe help grow that SAM as well? Martin Anstice : I'm not sure I exactly get your question, but I mean, do I see SAM expansion opportunities in the process space of the company? I think the answer to that question is yes. And we're also not going to get so specific. So again, the headline here is increase the competitiveness, increase the competency and capability of the established portfolio in both companies by virtue of more learning and more understanding, and great teams that are really excited about an opportunity to work together. We obviously have had very limited interactions of technology teams in preparation for this announcement, but some and I would say the appetite and the enthusiasm in that community to create value and ways that are not available to standalone companies is extraordinary. I mean, I am really excited about what we're going to see when really smart people get together and finally have an opportunity to do something they've not yet had an opportunity to do. SAM expansion, market share, new products, new services, a lot of work and we're going to be very focused on doing the right thing to support choices and value for customer. Patrick Ho : Great. That's helpful, and then maybe for Doug, specifically on the cost synergy targets you've outlined of $250 million. These are obviously 2 very different companies in terms of process and process control. I guess, what are some of maybe the high level cost synergies that we can look at today in terms of that target that you're setting out there? Because there's not the immediate process synergies that you can get like you've seen in other deals. What are some of the steps that you'll take to get to that target? Douglas Bettinger : Yes, Patrick, at this point, we've done a reasonable amount of homework. That was part of the diligence process that we went through. When I look at the cost synergies, I think about 1/3 of it comes from the Cost of Goods Sold line. There's some commonality there. Although, as you know, there's not a ton. 2/3 of it probably come from operating expenses, and that's going to have a heavy bias towards the SG&A functions and probably not a whole lot in R&D. Half of this will be headcount and half of it will be non-headcount-related synergies, at least the way we're looking at it today. And we're going to be very light on R&D. I mean, the objective here isn't to do a whole lot in R&D. So we'll be very careful about how we're looking at that area. Martin Anstice : And just to repeat what I hope is a very clear headline : This is not about reducing cost. It is a necessary component of bringing 2 companies together, but this is all about creating a fundamental new value proposition in our industry to benefit our customers, very strategic. So please help us not lose sight of that message. Operator : We have time for one final question. Our final question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Martin Anstice : Audrey, please close. Audrey Charles : All right. Once again, we'd like to thank you all for joining us today. A replay of our call will be available on lamresearch.com. Thank you, operator. That concludes our call. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Douglas Bettinger : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Once again, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, a webcast replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, I will hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Satya and thank you all for joining us today. I will first begin with a review of our calendar 2015 accomplishments, including comments on their relevance to the growth outperformance opportunities for the Company, then offer a perspective on wafer fab equipment spending in 2016 as well as the trends driving our longer term favorable outlook, concluding my prepared comments with a progress update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor. Doug will then review our financial and operational performance as well as provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. 2015 was another record year for Lam Research, augmented by our plan to combine with KLA-Tencor this year. A partnership that we believe will create an unmatched capability for the global semiconductor industry by uniting best-in-class process technologies with process control, creating a new paradigm in process enablement, accelerating innovation for the benefit of our customers. Last year, for the first time in our history, we exceeded $6 in earnings per share, grew shipments by 25%, to nearly $6 billion, reported record revenues of $5.9 billion, with operating profits expanding at greater than 1.5 times revenues. Demonstrating, we believe, sustainable leverage in our business model. In this context in 2015, we achieved record output from our factories, while improving our on-time delivery performance and shortening cycle time for installations, a very solid operational contribution. 2015 was the third consecutive calendar year in which we have significantly outgrown the industry. Over the last three years, we have grown our shipments at an annualized rate of more than 22%, well in excess of WFE CapEx growth of 6% in the same period. Our success is always predicated on customer trust and the opportunity customers are willing to provide us. It is also the result of our vision, strategy and operational execution to bring a capability in leading-edge process technologies to bear on the most fundamental technology inflections that are driving an increasing proportion of wafer fab equipment spending. In short, calendar 2015 was a year we're very proud of. Many worked extremely hard, but the increased strategic relevance of Lam and the demonstrative results make that effort rewarding. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all of our employees across every function and in every location, without whom as a collective group, these accomplishments would not have been possible. The culture and values of Lam and a priority on continued learning and development remain a foundation of competitive differentiation. We recommit to that as even stronger aspiration in 2016. We estimate that the industry grew wafer fab equipment spending by approximately 4% to $33 billion in 2015. Marginally stronger than earlier expectations, our SAM share of WFE expanded to slightly more than 30% in 2015, driven by the technology inflections including the industry conversion to 3D device architecture in non-volatile memory and also in logic, increased use of multi-patterning in DRAM and logic applications and increased adoption of advanced packaging integration schemes. Our demonstrated strength in these extremely complex technology and cost-sensitive process flows allowed us to grow Lam's share of our SAM to the mid-to-high 40% range in 2015. Multiple patterning has become a key driver in enabling our customers' scaling plans. Our Vector ALD and our Hydra conductor etch technology have enabled scaling and proactively positioned reductions in the cost of multiple patterning through variability reduction and productivity improvements. We solidified our number-one position in 3D NAND for deposition and etch with differentiated products such as the high-productivity Vector Strata and industry-leading ALTUS and Flex products which address the high aspect ratio challenges of advanced memory applications. In the multi patterning segments we saw an unprecedented ramp for our Kiyo with Hydra technology for conductor etch, where we have increased our install base by more than a factor of 5 in the last 12 months. The Hydra conductor etch process control technology has delivered improved CD uniformity by approximately 50% from the prior baseline. We saw very strong momentum for our Vector ALD products, where we doubled our shipments for multi-patterning applications enabled by best-in-class within-wafer, wafer-to-wafer film thickness and CD variation control. The Vector ALD platform has improved system productivity by up to 50% in the year, delivering the lowest cost of ownership available in the industry currently. All market segments combined, the headline for Lam deposition was an approximate 2 percentage point market share gain in the year on a very strong SAM expansion. In 2015, founded on the depth of etch technical competency and capability at Lam and supplemented by some positive customer mix, we achieved the largest expansion of market share in over five years in our etch business growing our total share by over 5 percentage points to the high-50% level. We're well on track towards delivering the longer term goal that we communicated at our Analyst Day in July last year. In a perpetually competitive industry segment, we had a truly great year, maintaining our leading HVM position in co-vector etch and making substantial gains in dielectric etch. In the conductor segments, we saw of fast ramp of Kiyo F Series products at multiple DRAM and 3D NAND customers. We were particularly pleased with the substantial market share gains we had in dielectric etch in 2015, with our Flex-F and G-series product families at multiple memory customers with increased potential and momentum emerging also in logic. We remain focused on delivering critical etch technologies for high aspect ratio etch as our customers scale the DRAM capacitor and the film-stacked height in 3D non-volatile memory structures. In our clean business, 2015 was a year of solid execution and some strategic repositioning. We recorded our largest increase in single wafer clean market share in any prior year, with a mid-single-digit percentage gain. Our strategic planning process ratified again the increasing strategic relevance of clean within our product portfolio. It also provided a framework for the streamlining actions we reported to you late last year. We enter 2016 energized about a future of sustainable profitable growth excited about the increasing breadth of the Lam wet and dry technology product portfolio, targeted at supporting traditional clean and increasingly complex surface preparation and other yield-enhancing applications. Providing the foundation for the overall business momentum is the performance of our install base, a key focus of our customer service business group. Here, we set another record for revenues. This business group is focused on creating collaborative solutions to improve our customers' productivity, also asset utilization and reduce their risk through the equipment lifecycle with products including advanced predictive services and productivity upgrades. We're also addressing the needs of leading-edge and trailing-edge customers across a variety of wafer sizes and markets through a broader and more capable refurbished tools offering. 2016 has begun with well-publicized volatility and some contraction in growth expectations for the global macro economy, with risks in some emerging markets, but balanced by steady if slow improvements in a number of developed markets. Within this environment, Lam continues to be optimistic that the underlying technology drivers of mobility, cloud and the Internet of Things provide a foundation for an exciting multi-year opportunity for our products and services. We assume 3D non-volatile memory, a new memory technologies adoption, are at a tipping point this year, resulting in an accelerated demand for solid-state memory in 2016. We're particularly optimistic in this segment where we see many years of technology visibility and opportunities for Lam to improve the cost and performance roadmaps for our customers. We expect to see double-digit growth in non-volatile memory CapEx in 2016, driven by the need for the industry to convert to 3D capable capacity. Based on our analytics, the equipment industry is scheduled to support the delivery of a 3D capable install base of between 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of total capacity by the end of this year, supporting NAND bit growth this year of mid-30%. Rational industry spending is a common theme in a consolidated world. We anticipate meaningfully reduced year-over-year spending in DRAM with customers focusing on 20-nanometer and 1X nodes migrations to continue to improve their cost competitiveness supporting industry bit growth in the mid-20% range. On a combined basis, we expect overall memory CapEx at the $15 billion level, plus or minus $1 billion. From a foundry and logic CapEx standpoint, we continue to see an increase in projected spending for 10-nanometer investments, as well as 28-nanometer and above investments, across a number of customers. Since our updates in October, we have seen some reported weakness in end-market demand for high-end smart phones with content continuing to expand however and in that context we expect to see growth in 14-nanometer wafer demand as more companies ramp products of this node throughout the year. Taken together, we expect foundry and logic spending to be up slightly year over year at the $17 billion to $18 billion level in 2016. As a result of these trends, we expect that 2016 WFE will track to approximately $33 billion, plus or minus $2 billion which is relatively unchanged from the initial views we provided you in October. We're off to a great start this year with broadly positive customer engagements and an anticipated book-to-bill in March comfortably exceeding 1. Based on our current understanding of customer plans, we're very confident that our shipments in the first half of calendar year 2016 will exceed the second half of calendar 2015 and early indications suggest our shipments in the second half of 2016 will grow from this new first-half baseline. As a closing headline, December was our weakest shipments quarter in a record-setting calendar 2015 year. We anticipate the March quarter as our weakest in the 2016 year which overall is anticipated to be stronger for Lam than 2015. I will now update our progress towards completing our planned combination with KLA-Tencor and provide an early glimpse of our integration planning. We're working closely with regulatory agencies across several global regions to obtain the necessary approvals for the closing of this transaction. We remain confident that we can secure approvals to complete the transaction in mid-2016. Any updates to the developments on the regulatory front will be made through relevant filings or press releases that will be broadly disseminated to investors. We will not comment further on this subject in this meeting today. We're in the early stages of planning for the successful integration of Lam and KLA and the process that will enable us to realize the full strategic and financial potential of the combination while continuing to operate as two stand-alone companies with compelling products, technologies and people. We formed an integration planning team and we plan to leverage our experience from successfully integrating Lam with Novellus. A team with strong representation from both companies is established and already quite active. With a primary focus to develop a comprehensive understanding of what we both do and exactly how we do it. At a more personal level, I continue to be very pleased with the dialogue with customers around the world, who without exception, look to the value proposition available of enhanced innovation from this business combination. As has been clear from our public filings related to the merger, we intend to continue the existing KLA-Tencor supply and support relationship with the broad industry ecosystem of our customers and suppliers to our customers both. We will be ready for day-one execution I have no doubts based on numerous interactions worldwide. I am delighted that we have an engineering and technology community in both companies who see more opportunity each and every day to deliver a more compelling value together than is possible separately. Excitement is definitely building our deal hypothesis being validated through our planning. While 2015 was a record year for Lam Research, we believe that 2016 holds even more promise. With the current quarter momentum in our business, our opportunity for continued outperformance and the anticipated creation of an even stronger and more strategically relevant company in partnership with KLA, we're positioning Lam for significant performance improvements now and over the long term. In closing, I would like to express my thanks again to our customers for their trust and partnership, employees for our differentiated culture and performance, suppliers for their support and commitments and investors for their confidence and continued interest in Lam. Let me now turn the call over to Doug who will provide a review of our financial performance and our March quarter outlook. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thanks, Martin and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on what I know was a busy earnings day. We ended calendar year 2015 with strong performance. Meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter on all financial metrics. Earnings per share came in above the high end of our guidance range. In addition to the numerous milestones Martin mentioned during his prepared remarks, during calendar year 2015, we generated over $1.2 billion in cash from operations which was an increase of more than 45% compared to calendar year 2014. And we returned more than $410 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We're very pleased with what we've achieved this quarter as well as this calendar year. Shipments continued at a healthy level in the December quarter, totaling $1.288 billion which was a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. As we anticipated, memory shipments decreased in the quarter, with the combined memory segment representing 65% of total system shipments and that compares with 72% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments made up 42% of the system shipments which was up from 32% in the previous quarter. DRAM investments continue to be largely focused on 20-nanometer conversions. Customers continued to ramp NAND and other nonvolatile technologies which made up 23% of the system shipments and this was down from the 40% level that we saw in the September quarter. NAND investments were again primarily directed towards employment of 3D NAND capacity. December quarter foundry shipments were 25% of system shipments and this was up from 18% in the previous quarter. Foundry spending was broad based, with the combination of 10-nanometer pilot capability, first-generation FinFET capacity, as well as trailing-edge investments. The logic and other segment accounted for 10% of system shipments which was about the same level as last quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in at $1.426 billion which was a little bit above the midpoint of guidance and down 11% compared to the record-high level that we saw in the September quarter. Gross margin came in right at the midpoint of guidance at 45.5% And as I always mention, you should expect to see some quarter-to quarter variability in gross margin due to multiple factors such as product mix, customer concentration, as well as overall business volumes. Our financial model continues to be the right tool for you to use to build your models and think about our ongoing financial performance. Operating expenses in the December quarter declined to $352 million, coming in at 25% of revenue and this compared with 23% in the September quarter. About 62% of the OpEx spend in the quarter was allocated to R&D which was around the same ratio we held throughout the calendar year. Funding of strategic R&D programs to continue our technology and productivity leadership is critical to meeting our objectives of growing the Company at a faster pace than the industry. The market share success we're currently enjoying is a result of investments we have made in previous years. We aim to continue that outperformance. Operating income in the December quarter was $296 million, down from $380 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 20.8% which was down from 23.8% in September and a little bit above the midpoint of the guided range. Operating income and operating margin declined sequentially as a result of the lower revenues in the period. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 7%, down compared to 14% last quarter. The tax rate was lower primarily due to the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit in the United States. A tax rate of low- to mid-teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to include in your models. Based on a share count of about 172 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter were $1.57. This was above the high end of our guided range due to the favorable tax rate in the quarter as well as the higher revenue. The share count includes dilution from the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes, with a total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our investor relations website for your reference. In the quarter, we returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. We did not repurchase any shares in the December quarter as we have temporarily suspended share repurchases in anticipation of the business combination with KLA-Tencor. Let me now move to the balance sheet. Cash generation was strong again in the quarter with cash from operations coming in at $295 million. During the quarter cash and short term investments including restricted cash increased to $4.7 billion, up from $4.5 billion in September. Day sales outstanding increased to 70 days versus 62 days last quarter. The increase in DSO was due to the timing of shipments within the quarter, with shipments being more biased towards the back half of the period. Inventory turns remained strong at 3.6 times. Deferred revenue at the end of quarter were $395 million which was down from last quarter. And I just point out this number excludes $109 million from shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. I would like to remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on our balance sheet. Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following, $33 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $33 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $28 million which was down from $49 million in the September quarter. CapEx can sometimes be a lumpy number as you saw in December. CapEx for the year came in at $173 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees. I point out that we have been relatively flat headcount wise for the last two quarters. Entering 2016, we continue to be pleased with the momentum in our business and the progress we're making towards our targeted financial model. For the March quarter, our non-GAAP guidance is as follows. We expect shipment growth to $1.43 billion, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1.3 billion, plus or minus $75 million. This lower revenue for March is largely consistent with our December shipments. We expect gross margin of 44%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. The margin decline in March is due to both customer as well as product mix. I expect margin to improve from this level as we go through 2016. We forecast operating margins of 17%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.07, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 172.5 million shares. In the outlook for the Company, we're optimistic in the trajectory of demand for our products and services. We expect shipments and revenue in the June quarter will be stronger than in the March quarter. With the anticipated strength in shipments, we expect to grow our deferred revenue balances in the first half of 2016. As we sit here today, I expect the second half of the year will have a stronger top line than the first half due to investments in leading-edge foundry and logic. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Harlan Sur, JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur : Within the team's flattish WFE outlook for 2016 and your view on the positive trajectory of your business this year maybe you can just give us a sense DRAM, NAND, logic and foundry what the bias on customer spending trends look like first half versus second half. I assume for example 3-D and 28 nanometer maybe strong first half with 10 nanometer and 1X DRAM maybe strong in the second half, but wanted to get your views. Martin Anstice : Yes, thank you for your comments at the beginning there, Harlan. Obviously we're at the beginning of the year so lots to learn. But our analytics today would cause us to think that year over year, so 2015 to 2016, the memory investment level is maybe down by $1 billion and the foundry is up by about $1 billion and then logic and other are kind of flattish. So there's a plus or minus with each one of those, so that's a kind of segment composition. Our sense of first half, second half WFE we're currently modeling a 47%, 48%, 53%, 52% type of profile. So, overall a stronger second half than first-half. DRAM foundry and micron microprocesses all second-half stronger than first half and NAND to your point, slightly stronger in the first half of the year. And I would say that the upside to the extent there's upside in the first half, second half split and I'll just characterize with NAND, is all defined around the performance of devices and then momentum in SAD markets and so on and so forth. So that's the summary of our modeling at this point in the year. Harlan Sur : And as you mentioned, it seems like legacy 28 nanometer is a pretty resilient note. There's still a lot of design starts going on in this node. I think UMC just reported last night their doubling their CapEx spend this year primarily for 28 nanometer, hearing the same thing from some of the other China domestic manufacturers. How much of a driver of the foundry outlook this year is from some of these legacy nodes? Martin Anstice : It's not insignificant for sure. There is a healthy investment at above 28 nanometer and I would say it is almost equal to the same level of wafer stocks that we saw added in 2015. It has a slightly different composition. It's relatively broad-based so there's two to three customers at almost every foundry node and there's a cap in intensity at the 14 nanometer, 16 nanometer and 10 nanometer technology nodes obviously that make those investments relatively more expensive. But certainly there is a decent chunk of foundry wafer fabrication equipment spending that is 28 nanometer and above. Operator : And we can take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open. Romit Shah : Martin, you're under an environment that you characterized kind of flattish WFE for this year, based on your comments I'm sort of concluding that the company shipments can grow presumably revenues would grow, but as you think about operating expenses and some of the other below the line items, do you think it is reasonable to assume the company can grow earnings per share? Martin Anstice : Yes, I think we've got a pretty clear statement of modeling on that. Our long term financial model that we used at Semicon West is a great reference point for you. It's almost replicated in the F4 filing. There's 22% operating income references, there's growth references, there's SAM expansion references and the headline is the inflection story which is the catalyst for SAM expansion continues to progress 2015 into 2016 and all the way through 2018. Just to remind you our estimate of inflection-based spending as a percentage of WFE in the year just completed was in the low 30% range and by the time we hit 2018 our estimate is 55% or slightly higher. So, the SAM expansion story the targeted market share story certainly have us optimistic that we're continuing to grow the company in an environment of flat WFE and the economics that we're targeting are exactly as we've communicated in our long term financial model. So I think the answer to your question is yes. Romit Shah : Okay that's terrific. And then as a follow-up, Doug, just on gross margins for Q1, you mentioned that customer and product mix were negatively impacted in gross margin. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the specific stuff? Doug Bettinger : Probably not much more. You see variability if you go back in December we were 4% to 5.5%, in you back to the quarter before we were 46.4% and overseeing 44%. You get lots of puts and takes when different customer mix, customer concentration, tool mix. Not every tool we sell is the same profitability level and overall business volume is part of this, too. So all of it is contributing, Romin. And as I said in my scripted remarks I expect this to be the low mark in terms of gross margin percentage for the company in 2016 Martin Anstice : If I need to just build on that and take the question in the context of the totality of investments that we're making in the company. Let me deal with margin and OpEx together. You know the full process relative to the operating expenses in the company we have tremendous opportunity here to continue to outgrow the industry and our commitment to invest in R&D to support that initiative is a really important commitment for the company. So we're not jerking left and right, our commitment to customers around enabling technology. We're committed and we have to work through these short term kind of variability that we see as a result, as a result of concentrated customers these days. But having said that, we talked a lot about R&D and SG&A percentages so Doug can talk more if you want to in the call, but I think you know what we're trying to do there. We have essentially in the guidance provided today retained or constrained the operating expense investments to a level that is pretty similar to the March 2015 quarter. And just to remind you, in March 2015, we were just coming off the back of a $5 billion revenue year. Now we're coming off the back of a $6 billion revenue year. So to have the operating expenses at the $350 million level is a testament to the business model and the commitment to the management team to be responsible in the context of long term and short term performance improvements. Last thing to say, relative to gross margins, I don't think we're the first large equipment company to message December to March gross margin contraction in the scheme of things. The best council we have for you is the long term model and the 22% range of operating income is still the ambition of the company in the 2016 year. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : I had two things. First of all Martin just the sort of a question about the environment today versus three or so months ago, you guys had been very clear about the first half of this year shipments being up versus the back half of last year. But now it sounds like you're a bit even more optimistic on June shipments and particularly now you're looking in the back half and also showing you're pretty bullish there too. So the question really is what has gotten better? What particular customer area are what particular region has gotten better in that time? Thanks. Martin Anstice : I guess the context of what I'm about to say as I've said $33 billion which is exactly the same as what I said in October. What's different today obviously the passing of three months always provides a little bit more visibility, always provide a little bit more of a confirmation on technology roadmaps of customers and their ability to yield through very complex technology transitions. So it's the same numerical presentation and if my tone is a little bit more positive that's really a commentary on the passing of time and being able to validate plans and being able to see customers validate their plans a little bit more in January that we were able to do in October. Timothy Arcuri : And then I guess Martin just following on that if you add up all the projects in China there's like $20 billion worth of WFE. Clearly there's a big fab not huge but a decent sized fab that's actually ordering right now in China, but there's a lot of other very, very big fabs. And so I'm wondering, what is your assessment on the timing of that? Is any of that going to come into the back half of your year or is that more of a 2017, 2018 thing? Thanks. Martin Anstice : Yes, I'm going to reserve the right to not get specific to anyone fab. I think the headlines are clear from that customer what they're intending to do and as you know, we've got great position in the 3-D NAND transition -- so to remind everybody we're at about a 90% market share etch and depth-cortical applications and we made progress between planar and 3-D and so, we're a very active participant in the spending plans of the customer that you are referring to. And I should defer to their public confree on the timing. Operator : And we can take our next question from Chris Shankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Chris Shankar : Two of them, Martin and I give Martin the congratulations on a good calendar 2015. The first question is on the 3-D NAND spending. It looks like everyone want to be bullish on this. I'm just wondering, is there a risk that if customers run into yield issues, could that slow the pace of adoption or do you think that demand is so strong that they're going to punch through and meet your yields. And then I also had a follow up. Martin Anstice : I think it would be irresponsible to say that yield isn't relevant relative to cost isn't relevant to adoption. There is kind of a chicken and egg here. And I think one of the things that we're trying to do, we have obviously a tremendous opportunity to grow our company and outperform in the context of enabling many of the 3-D NAND architecture in partnership with our customers, but what goes with opportunity is a lot responsibility and we've got a lot of responsibility to help the customers yield to create an environment from a cost and performance point of view which is a catalyst for demand. I'm not sure which comes first a lot of this and the customer is going to speak to their tolerance of risk. To your point, everybody is invested with plans in 3-D NAND this calendar year as best as we can tell. 95% of the nonvolatile spending is focused on 3-D device architecture. It seems like there's a universal commitment to this and we're certainly head down working hard to contribute in our small way to the success of the customer. Chris Shankar : Just a follow-up for you also, for Doug, when you look at the next year or even later this year or next year it looks like the spending shift might move more from memory towards larger co-foundry. Is there a way to quantify how much of a margin tailwind would it be when the mixture's from memory to foundry? Doug Bettinger : No, I don't think there's really any substantial differential due to any of the segments in the business. There's differentials, customer to customer sometimes, larger early adopting customers that help with development sometimes, get a little better pricing but I don't think segments is something you should think of that way Chris. Martin Anstice : And I think is a basic headline what you've heard us talk about for many years is the philosophy relative to pricing what we sell to our customers. So our number one focus is to build customer trust. Our number one way of building customer trust is to position for fair compensation. And we're not the highest gross margin company in the industry by a long stretch. But I think we're the fastest growing or one of the fastest-growing and there's always a balance between targeted profitability and growth. And we spend a lot of time thinking through the legitimacy of the gross margin objective for the company and the range that we talked about for the last several years, this mid-forty percent range, 45%, 46%. And I think a very defendable place for us to be and it is in general, in a consolidated world it is pretty segments and customer agnostic, right? We don't want to play a role influencing the competitiveness of customers based on our pricing strategy. That would be a sure way to lose customer trust. Operator : We'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad : My first question is on 3-D NAND. Martin, you mentioned that the overall NAND spending is going to be up double digit. I wanted to ask if you can provide a breakout between cleaner and 3-D and specific to 3-D, how much an increase in spending do you expect to see? Martin Anstice : You know, we're at least in this goal going to keep our WFE disclosure for memory at the memory level as opposed to a DRAM number and a NAND number and the reason for that is because we see there are some pretty big decisions for a couple of customers to make around where their allocation of spending will be. So I'm hoping that by the time we get to the next call that clarity is there. But to the first part of your question our assumption is 95% of the investments in 2016 in non-volatile memory NAND and other schemes is 3-D. So it is dominating the investments. And it is a very complex mix of conversions and upgrades as well as some additions. I would say it is a very efficient spends plan and it has everybody participating. Farhan Ahmad : And just a clarification, how much was the split between cleaner and 3-D in say 2015 spending? Martin Anstice : I want to say 60/40. Doug Bettinger : Yes, it was about 60%. Farhan Ahmad : And then one longer term question, Martin. If I look at what happened over last three, four years, Lam has outgrown the industry massively and part of the reason was obviously like you guys have been following a strategy and investing heavily in the growth trends within the industry where some of your other competitors, EMAP and DOE, for a period of time kind of moved away their focus from semiconductor and were looking at other market and were kind of struggling, then this went into semis. Now looking ahead it seems like both of these companies have seen the outperformance that you have been able to deliver and kind of changed their strategy to start investing more in the space. Is there a change when you look at the competition that you are seeing in the growth areas of the market is it any higher now than what you used to see like say three years ago? Martin Anstice : I think I used perpetually competitive when I described the etch segment. It feels the same today as it ever has done. This is a tough industry, a tough segment and it isn't just about the big guys, it's sometimes the smaller competitors, the regional alternatives and so on and so forth. We have been very disciplined making the investments in our future, long term future, a priority for the company. It's a multiyear commitment that extends way back. And it is a tough thing to get balance but I think the company did a nice job at identifying the opportunity to grow through technology inflections. The technology and engineering results, the company did a fantastic job delivering as competitive products and services. Our field organization nailed the interface with the customer in terms of positioning but more importantly supporting ramps and productivity agendas and install base performance. So it's a total team effort. Our plan is to build upon that foundation and whether we can do exactly the same thing in the next three years that we did in the last three time will tell, but you've got a pretty committed company to a growth trajectory that is profitable. Operator : We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse: I guess first question, was hoping to drill a little bit deeper in terms of SAM expansion peer for calendar 2016. You grew 20% plus in 2015 versus the market's 3% to 5%, so great job there. Curious what the puts and takes are this year. How do we think about maybe a falloff in image sensors but a pickup and sharing logic the move to a greater NAND less DRAM differed revenues. What are the key drivers we should be thinking about plus and minus for this year? Martin Anstice : So I'll deal with one part of that and maybe Doug will deal with the deferred revenue piece. At a segment level the story that I described for WFE is slightly stronger foundry year-over-year relative to a slightly weaker memory investment. Historically that has meant something to us in terms of the degree of outperformance but one piece of really important context is we really positioned well in the image sensor transitions and I think when other folks were struggling a little bit with logic spend reductions we generally marched right through that because of that positioning and it is as strong today as a was then. Our momentum in foundries and in microprocessor logic is now I hope well understood to be a positive trajectory for the company. And so we still believe that in an essentially flat WFE our SAM increases. One part of that is the inflections message, so something like a 33% reference point for 2015 the proportion of WFE that is inflection-based and that is walking its way to the 55% level. We've just come off a stunning market share year for the company. We're going to keep working hard and the long term market share objectives I think are well within grasp at this point. So we're pretty pleased about that. Doug Bettinger : Yes, so just to follow on the second part of your question, normally you will see when we have got shipments ramping up deferred revenue will grow and vice versa when shipment coming down deferred revenue will come down. You kind of saw that in December. And in my scripted remarks I talked about an expectation that in the first half of 2016 we expect deferred revenue to grow. It's because we expect to be on a ramping profile of shipments. C.J. Muse: I guess as my follow-up if I take your commentary around shipments more second-half weighted than first-half it looks like we're going to hit roughly $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion and I'm curious, A., do you agree with that assessment? And B., does that mean that we should be targeting 46.5% plus type of gross margin exiting 2016? Doug Bettinger : Yes, C.J., I'm not ready to quantify anything yet. The fact that we're giving you color on the second-half we thought was important given March was a low level for the year. I'm not going to quantify it quite yet. And in terms of the profitability level I'll just take you back to the financial model we've put up back in July as the right way to think about the performance of the business on a medium term basis. Operator : And we can take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Doug, first off in terms of the revenue recognition versus the shipments and the deferred revenues that you're talking about, obviously Japan is a portion of it. Are there any other variables, like say as you mentioned the new Chinese fab, things of that nature that also cause a potential delay in terms of revenue recognition? Doug Bettinger : Every customer is a little bit different in terms of how they accept tools that are shipped, so customer-to-customer there's variation, fab-to-fab there can be variation. Especially when there's a new fab you're shipping to sometimes it can take a little bit longer to clear customs as an example, so the differential between ship and revenue has several different variables. Martin Anstice : But I think it's fair to say that the mix of customers this was a relatively slow term and we'll probably speed up a little bit over time. Patrick Ho : And Martin, just I'm going to the ALD market for a second. You guys have made a big foothold to try and get into that market. You're starting to see some of the gains especially as multi-patterning on the logic and foundry side. Kind of a two-part question there, one, how do you see the capital intensity increasing for the ALD market for us as a whole and secondly how do you see your share gain potential particularly as you move from the 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer nodes to 10 nanometer? Martin Anstice : The share gain sits in the context of the overall objectives for the company and depositions, so we've kind of given you a reference point of 5 to 10 percentage points in the calendar 2013 through 2018 timeframe. The ALD question is a really interesting one and I think there are actually a lot of unanswered questions relative to the choices of technology and integration schemes to address really complex challenges. But our expectation is that ALD is a market that grows faster than any other that we participate in in the deposition segment. And we come from behind in many respects. In the last kind of five years and so in relative terms the market share momentum that we're seeking in ALD is higher than the average in depositions. So it is a faster-growing market with a faster market share growth ambition. Which doesn't mean it's easy, it's really hard and it's hard because everybody wants a piece of that. Operator : And we can take our next question from Steven Chin with UBS. Your line is open. Steven Chin : Just a follow-up question on market share, did you feel comfortable that Lam's overall share in NAND this year will stay the same or even grow now that we've got a new entrance. I'm just wondering if customer mix in NAND this year can have another positive impact to Lam's market share this year. Martin Anstice : You know, at a level which is kind of relevant to a conversation between us, there's not that much difference between the market share positions of any one customer. We tend to have, when we want something we kind of want it at an application-specific level because we have a very competitive technology. As you know there is one of the four players that has a different integration scheme and so I want to be a little bit careful and just hold back because their scheme is there's and I don't want to focus too much on that difference. But the basic headline of a 90% market share curative applications, 60% market share all in which is a kind of double-digit gain for us from playing at the 3-D, that is what we have to build upon. And it is what others are trying to take from us. So that is our responsibility. Steven Chin : Just a follow-up question on China, do you think, Martin, we're at the point yet where Lam will invest more in a local China infrastructure or services to support future customers in China? Just wondering of China is part of the other Lam investment this year, part of the bet you're making going forward. Martin Anstice : For sure, but I wouldn't say that's a new reality. As a customer invests in building a fab, we have to invest consistent with supporting that. And as noted a couple times in this conversation there's a reasonable investment in China and it is increasing and we're making investments proactively to ensure that when we win positions, we build trust through a customer's ramp. The worst thing to do is to win a development position and then fail to execute because you don't have enough field process or field service engineers to support a ramp. So absolutely we're investing in infrastructure to support growth of the China marketplace. But that's true in every region of the world. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Weston Twigg : First, just wondering on the 10 nanometer logic and foundry expectations for stronger second half installations and then a ramp into 2017, can you give us an idea kind of like you do for 3-D NAND how many wafers starts might be shipped this year and next year? Martin Anstice : Yes, so I'm going to do this with some kind of caution and hesitation. We have a range around it. We're still over a 300,000 wafer starts per month reference point for 28 nanometer technology nodes and the sum of below 20 nanometer, so 20 nanometer, 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer and 10 nanometer. We would expect by the end of this year to have a shipped capacity which is different than a qualified capacity, but a combined shipped capacity of about 260,000 wafer starts, plus or minus 20,000. Weston Twigg : Okay. How much do you think that might expand in 2017? Martin Anstice : Can I way to get to 16 before answering that? Weston Twigg : I guess so. Wafer cleans you mentioned you're getting some good traction. Can you give us a better update maybe on the evaluation programs that were in place last year? And your overall market share position at this point? Martin Anstice : Yes, well, it still obviously is the weaker link in the company in terms of market share performance. It's certainly relative to etch and deposition and we did some strategic repositioning as you might remember towards the end of last year and rationalized some cost structure and focused a little bit more on what we consider to be the most relevant opportunities to grow. It's a mid-to high teens market share play for us today and the message we communicated today is strategically relevant. We're excited about of profitable growth opportunity coming into 2016 and we're broadening the product portfolio wet and dry and time will tell what we can accomplish as a result of that investment. But I think most of us would say we feel better about clean this year that we did last year and long may that continue. Operator : We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Martin, you talked about in your prepared remarks that you received positive feedback from your customers on the merger with KLA. Can you talk about one or two key areas where you think you guys can add value to the user or some of the applications? Martin Anstice : Yes, I think the basic message is going to be the same as the hypothesis we presented last time. The challenge for the industry is not just a challenge of physics it is a challenge of economics. At a strategic level we concluded that the most responsible action we can take, the most significant contribution we could make to the success of our customers, would come from the integration of process and process control. A big part of that value proposition is associated with new engagements across the companies with customers, because the reality is as you all know, the KLA team is a little bit more entrenched and stronger relatively in foundry logic than we're and we're more than them in memory. So there is absolutely an opportunity there. There are engineering exchange programs. We're building momentum, specifying the types of things we think are relevant to new collaborations and joint development activities with customers when we get to be one company. And quite how far that goes, how quickly, your reference right now is now $600 million bogie we have in the proxy for revenue synergies. And I would say I feel better about that today than when I did when I talked to you about last time because I see excitement emerging in the engineering community around the substance of opportunity which is everything about delivering vision here. And I see a sustained willingness in the customer base to support our plans to support them. So, pretty excited at this point. Atif Malik : And then a follow-up, Doug, the street has a tendency to miss model your revenues. And I think in the past you guys have talked about a formula for revenue 50% of shipments in the prior quarter and then 50% from shipments in the current quarter. Is that still the right rule of thumb moving forward? Doug Bettinger : I would be cautious about doing that because I think it has proven to be a really hard thing to model. And the reason is, because we live in a consolidated customer world and the difference between a week one shipment and a 13 week shipment is huge relative to the term and it moves absolutely. And so we cannot really give you a nice simple reference like we used to be able to. I remember vividly describing a relationship to you 10 years ago that would work for three years, five years. It doesn't work anymore, because it's consolidated. It is a much more variable play and every week counts and so we have a little bit slower turn in the March timeframe and we expect it to speed up. The best we can give you in terms of counsel on modeling is the exact guidance for the next quarter, the tone of quantitative sentiments on direction and the long term model that Doug has talked about a number of times and triangulating on those three you might get a quarter wrong but hopefully you get the year right. Operator : We will take our final question from Jogiday Shier with Redsun Technology Research. Your line is open. Jogiday Shier : I wanted to dive in on two aspects. First Martin I just wanted to get your thoughts on that DRAM side. Given the technology challenges and the market challenges, what needs to happen to trigger an investment going forward? Can we have an upside in DRAM investment this year? And I have a follow-up. Martin Anstice : I guess the answer to the question always has to be, yes there can be. Do I think there will be? Not clear to me today. And it would be a second half environment not a first half environment because I think the energy situation is getting better but it's probably not all the way there, but it's a lot better. There's tremendous discipline, it's a very efficient spend because it's all about conversions which is increased performance and lower cost which is more profitability, despite the fact that profitability levels have come down they're still reasonably able to support investment. I just think it's like a lot of discipline in a year when bit density conversion is playing out in DRAM as well which creates a little more complexity to your question. So I would say we have models pretty conservatively our expectations, maybe there's a little bit of upside in the second half of the year. At the end of the day it is all going to be about end-user and end-unit's demand and you will probably see that before we will. Jogiday Shier : Just as a follow up can you compare or contrast your growth in your etch and deposition segments holistically for the year, given the spending mix as we compare it to last year? Thanks. Martin Anstice : I'm not sure a quick at the question. We had a really tremendous year in terms of share gain last year. And that was particularly true in the etch business. It was an extraordinary year for the etch team. And do you get to repeat that every year? No you don't. So we typically target one to two percentage points of share gain. That's a great result in a year or in a technology node conversion. And so we just did something like that in deposition, we did a lot better and that in etch. I would expect the 1% to 2% reference to be a better long term modeling from what we just did. But again, time will tell. Operator : And this does conclude the question and answer session. I would like to turn the program back to Satya a Kumar for any closing remarks. Satya Kumar : Yes, thank you, operator. That is all the time we have for today. Thank you for your participation and we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's program.",

Martin Anstice : Thank you, Satya, and thank you all for joining us today for our quarterly earnings conference call. This afternoon I will share highlights from the March quarter, provide some perspective on how we're performing relative to our growth objectives and share a commentary on the industry environment so far this year. Prior to turning the call over to Doug, I will conclude my prepared remarks with a status update on our planned business combination with KLA-Tencor. Lam Research is off to a very solid beginning in 2016, with our March quarter results providing evidence of continued strong execution against our longer-term outperformance ambition. 2016 is a year where connected with the device architecture and process flow decisions of our customers, also with our decisions several years back to invest toward a long-term in enabling key technology inflections, we actively compete for more than 30% of WFE. In the quarter just ended, we delivered revenues and shipments above the midpoints of our guidance, and gross margin, operating income and non-GAAP EPS that were all above the high-end of our guidance range. We demonstrated business model flexibility by managing core operating expenses to a level lasts reported a year ago, while growing investments in R&D over the same period. Importantly, the results this quarter reflect a healthy balance of leadership focus on both our short-term and long-term. Most important of course is our long-term commitments to the success of our customers. Overall, our performance is a testament to the high-quality focus, the teamwork and execution of Lam employees throughout the company, and for that I would like to thank them all sincerely. As we evaluate the performance of Lam currently and develop strategies to support our vision for the combined company, we are driven by the opportunity for compelling value creation. Standalone and combined with KLA-Tencor, we model robust and predictable cash generation, supplemented by growth outperformance and over time more opportunities for investing in profitable growth and returning excess cash to shareholders. The growth thesis for Lam over the next several years is rooted in our strategy to partner closely with our customers to enable key technology inflections, such as 3D device architecture and multi-patterning process flows, and is validated by our performance in the last several years. As our results reveal, this strategy is working and is enabling the increased strategic relevance of Lam Research in our industry. Calendar 2016 is a year, where industry spending trends are increasingly biased to disciplined and strategic investments across most device segments, which lends further supports to our conviction in a multiyear company outperformance opportunity. This spending bias, we contend also is a driver for continued healthy WFE spending levels for the foreseeable future, despite somewhat tepid macro conditions. Now, looking at our progress across the inflection, first with 3D NAND. We see increasing adoption rates of this technology, strong traction for our products and service offerings and growing clarity around next-generation device industry roadmaps. First generation 3D NAND production involves etching through 30 or more stacked pairs of films. But these are growing to 60 or more pairs for next-generation devices, resulting in increased challenges for critical high-aspect ratio dielectric etch and also staircase conductor etch. Our Flex F and G Series dielectric products, featuring proprietary iron energy control and high selectivity, have tripled their install base in the last year and established Lam as the market leader in dielectric etch segments. Our Kiyo conductor etch platform with industry leading etch selectivity has enabled more than a two times improvements in the number of layers that can be etched in-situ for staircase applications, with the results that a majority of 3D NAND customers have now included Lam in their staircase etch HVM purchases. Our VECTOR ALD platform offers differentiated processing capability, allowing expansion of our SAM from multi-patterning to now include 3D NAND gap filled applications also. Turning to FinFETs and multi-patterning. During the quarter, we continued to build on the momentum of our differentiated Kiyo with hydra-conductor etch and Flex dielectric etch platforms for critical front-end-of-line FinFET transistor solutions for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technology nodes. As we communicated at the recent SPIE lithography conference, atomic level processing to control variability is increasingly critical for multiple patterning and that need will persist in an EUV-enabled environment. Our customers at the conference continued to affirm their strategy of leveraging improvements in both EUV and multi-patterning to address their needs and together with our peer group. We have conviction, the deposition and etch multi-patterning applications will grow for many years to come. Fundamental to enabling our share gains have been the performance of our 35,000-plus process module install base and in calendar '15, a 10 points improvements in our customer satisfaction indexes. On this last point, it was extremely satisfying that our logic segment capabilities and partnership have progressed to a point where we were one of very few companies recognized recently as preferred quality supplier to Intel. The focus we explained at SEMICON West 2015 of developing new value-add product and services is intended to provide our customers productivity, utilization and reuse benefits, in addition to creating new SAM growth opportunities across leading-edge and mature technology nodes for our company. As planned, over a multiyear period, we are on schedule for our install base business revenues to outgrow materially our install base units' expansion. In calendar '16, our emphasis includes implementing systemic improvements in customer satisfaction, increasing our spares market share with new products differentiated by Lam-specific OEM knowledge in learning, and building upon the early adoption successes of new install based advanced services and productivity solutions achieved last year. Now, I would like to provide a brief updates on demand and WFE trends. Expectations of the experts for global economic growth have been revised slightly lower, since our last report. End-market demand trends for technology products remain mixed with additional weakness in the PC market and relatively stable, although lower than expected growth rates in mobile. Meanwhile, we continue to expect solid demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market, driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and competition applications both. More importantly perhaps, we believe that Lam and the equipment industry broadly have an opportunity and responsibility to innovate for and with our customers to create a catalyst for the high levels of IC unit demand. Certainly, that is our conviction and thinking, both as a standalone process company and combined with KLA-Tencor. Our outlook for the memory market continues to reflect the offsetting factors of strong 3D NAND spending and meaningful declines in DRAM spending, driven largely by PC weakness year-over-year. The latter has resulted in now well-publicized and rational response from our DRAM customers, which should continue to help improve the ICE unit supply demand balanced. We expect the DRAM capacity to remain essentially flat-to-slightly down this year. DRAM WFE we estimate to represents mid-to-high $5 billion spending this year, focused almost exclusively on 20-nanometer and 1x nanometer upgrade investments to improve cost competiveness and device performance. We expect non-volatile memory industry WFE to exceed $9 billion in 2016 with every industry participants committed to the 3D roadmap. Spending patterns and the strategic actions by our customers in 2016 offer the clearest evidence yet. The 3D NAND and new non-volatile memories are evolving to have a transformational influence on the computes and storage industry, as device and system architectures evolve for consumer and enterprise cloud applications. 3D NAND in particular has an integration scheme that is heavily biased towards deposition and etch, a statement that is increasingly true as the customers transition from building Greenfield 3D fabs to conversions from 2D to 3D, and eventually from first generation 3D through subsequent vertical scaling. We assess that the equipment industry remains on track to ship a cumulative 350,000 to 400,000 wafer starts per month of 3D NAND capacity by the end of 2016, which includes around two-thirds by yearend production qualified. The headline for LAM is that with just under a quarter of global capacity 3D NAND capable by the end of this year, we are in very early stages of a multiyear growth opportunity. There is much for us to be excited about. We continue to expect flat-to-slightly better WFE in foundry and logic, where the majority of the spending is focused on strategic investments to enable 10-nanometer technology, although as stated previously, IoT applications, automotive, wearables and low-end phones, et cetera, are driving a healthy resurgence of 28-nanometer capital expenditure. Doug will provide more details in our financial guidance, but our shipments outlook in a flattish WFE environment is consistent with our ongoing outperformance commentary and prior long-term models. We ended this quarter with our strongest backlog and deferred revenue balance combined in the recent history of Lam, and we expect stronger shipments in June with sequential growth of approximately 9%. We retain our 2016 WFE outlook of 33 billion plus or minus 2 billion. And from a momentum perspective guide the first half '16 shipments stronger than our second half '15. And although slightly muted perhaps from our more conservative DRAM outlook today and some first half, second half rebalancing, we're still encouraged by the potential for slightly stronger shipment second half '16 over our first half '16. Now, I will conclude with some comments on the planned combination of Lam Research with KLA-Tencor. As a reminder, with continued execution and our priority on being number one in customer trust, we have the confidence that standalone Lam Research has a continuing growth outperformance opportunity over the next several years. We have elected to use this recent period of strength and an exciting outlook to pursue an even more strategic agenda to innovate beyond, what is possible, in two great companies separately for the benefit of all stakeholders. We invested a number of years developing the strategy with our customers and believe with all subsequent interactions, they are materially invested in the success of our vision. They trust our genuine commitments to the broad ecosystem and they are increasingly motivated by the opportunity for new joint development projects together. As we move through the early stages of integration planning, and our conviction in the business combination and the opportunities that will drive for the customer and combined company is only getting stronger. The integration planning team has been focused on understanding the organizational design and business processes of the two companies in order to ensure a seamless transition for our customers, suppliers and employees. We have announced internally and introduced to our customers a very strong global leadership team with balanced representation from both companies. Although, we remain two separate companies until the dates of deal closing, and until that time our most fundamental responsibility is to deliver on preexisting commitments made to our customers. Comprehensive integration activities have reinforced our confidence in achieving both, the stated cost and revenue synergies. In recent weeks, we received approval from both KT and Lam stockholders and have received regulatory approvals in Israel, Taiwan and Ireland. We are actively engaged with all other required agencies and remain confident that we will close the transaction some time around midyear. Our best estimate is June, July, plus or minus a couple of months. With that, let me turn the call over to Doug, who will provide an updates on the March quarter and our guidance for June. Douglas Bettinger : Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings day. We're pleased with the momentum to be starting the year with. Our results for the March quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics. Shipments for the quarter were $1.446 billion, which was up 12% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. Memory shipments were strong in the quarter with the combined memory segment making up 70% of total system-level shipments, and that compares with 65% in the prior quarter. Memory shipments were weighted heavily toward the non-volatile segment, which represented 43% of system shipments in the March quarter. This is up from 23% in the prior quarter, driven by ongoing customer investments in 3D NAND wafer capacity as well as increasing layer counts. We continue to see 3D NAND spending focused on both new wafers as well as technology conversions. DRAM made up 27% of the shipments, which was down from 42% in the December quarter. We're seeing continued discipline spending in the DRAM segment with a focus on 20-nanometer technology conversions to both reduce cost per bit and to enable improved performance. The foundry segment was up slightly in dollar terms in the March quarter accounting for 23% of system shipments. Foundry spending is focused on both leading-edge 10-nanometer investments as well as continued spending at 28-nanometer and above. The logic and other segment contributed 7% of system shipments. Shipments into the China region were particularly strong in March, representing 27% of total shipments. The majority of the spending in China continues to be spent by global multinational customers putting capacity in place within the country. Revenue came in at $1.314 billion in the March quarter, which was down roughly 8% from the December quarter. This revenue result was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin for the period came in at 45.1%, somewhat stronger than we expected. Better field and factory utilization and favorable product mix benefited gross margin in the quarter. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margins are a function of a number of factors, such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter. I'd like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing performance. Operating expense in the quarter were roughly flat at $350 million and this compares to $352 million in the December quarter. The majority of our spending continues to be allocated to funding our critical R&D programs. These investments are important in preparing for the current and next-generation technology inflections, enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities ahead of us. Operating income in the March quarter came in at $242 million and that compares to $296 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 18.4% above the high-end of the guided range, due to both the higher revenue as well as a stronger gross margin. The tax rate for the quarter was 14% and that compares with 7% last quarter. That by the way was about what we expected. A tax rate in the low-to-mid teens for the remainder of 2016 would be reasonable for you to use in your earnings models. Based on a share count of approximately 172 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $1.18, above the guidance range. The share count includes dilution on a non-GAAP basis from both the 2016 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact of about 11 million shares. Dilution schedules for the 2016, 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. We returned $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders. This equated to $0.30 on a per share basis. We did not repurchase any shares in the open market in the March quarter, consistent with our stated plans ahead of closing the proposed KLA-Tencor transaction. So now, let me turn to the balance sheet. We continue to have a healthy cash position. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased to $4.8 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations was $183 million and that compares to $295 million in December. The March shipment profile was biased toward the backend of the quarter, resulting in an increase in both accounts receivable and days sales outstanding quarter-over-quarter. DSO increased to 86 days in March. I expect this will reduce in the June quarter, as linearity is less back-end weighted. The quality of our receivable balance continues to be very strong. We've got a bluechip set of customers. Inventory turns declined to 3.2x due to the inventory build for the growth in the June quarter. Days payable outstanding extended to 46 days as a result of the timing of purchases within the quarter. Cash generation was partially offset by dividends paid as well as capital expenditures. We exited the quarter with deferred revenues of $511 million, which is up from $395 million in December. This amount excludes $121 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments remain on our balance sheet as inventory carried at cost. Company non-cash expenses for the quarter included $35 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization and $35 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $46 million, which was up from $28 million in the December quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 7,300 regular full-time employees, which was flat with December. Looking ahead now, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We expect shipments of $1.575 billion, plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1.525 billion, again plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. I do expect that the September quarter gross margin will be a little bit softer than in June due to customer concentration and product mix, and we forecast operating margins of 22%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $1.63, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 173 million shares. We're pleased with our performance this quarter and with the guidance we've just shared for the June quarter. We're delivering financial results coming from the strategic focus of the company on creating differentiated product and service offerings that enable the success of our customers. As we sit here today, I continue to expect that second half of the year will have a stronger topline in the first half due to investments in leading-edge foundry and logic. And just one last item I'd like to share with you. We will not be doing our normal Investor Day at SEMICON West this year. Our plans will be to do something later in the year, likely in the month of November. We will announce exact dates and venue later in the year as we finalize our plans. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : Couple of questions. Could you just, maybe I missed this, but the gross margin dynamics, could you talk about what's driving the 90 basis points uptick sequentially in the June quarter? And how much of that is really leveraged versus mixed driven? And then what exactly is having with the mix in September, I guess, that takes it down again? And could you quantify that number for us? Douglas Bettinger : Yes. There's a lot of different things that move gross margin around, which are overall business levels, you get product mix, you get a little bit of customer concentration some times that move it around. You've got a combination of all of those things occurring in the June quarter. And then it softens up a little bit in September, which is why I gave you a little bit of that color, which I normally wouldn't do. I think it will be a little bit later in the September. Amit Daryanani : And is there a way to think about just the quantification of how much -- is it the 90 basis points that reverses back in September or a much smaller number potentially? Douglas Bettinger : I'm not going to quantify it numerically except just to tell you, it's going to be a little bit softer. Amit Daryanani : And if I can just follow-up on the KLA transaction. Could you just talk about what are the regulatory requirements or any other milestones that's left to be achieved? I know, you mentioned, some that you've already done, but I'm curious what's left over here for the deal to close. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, we don't have specific disclosure on the agencies that we're working with. We have more to do. And we're kind of public with disclosure as and when certain kind of milestones are achieved, so you kind of have what you have. I think the important message is we're still confident of achieving approval for this transaction midyear. And I provide a little bit more kind of color in prepared comments. Again, basic headlines, there are no product overlaps between these two companies. And at least as best I can tell from every customer reaction I had before we announced this deal and every customer transaction that I've had the benefit of having subsequently, there is a genuine investments in the success of the combined company and the innovation that will be possible as a result of this investment. Operator : And we can take our next question from Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Tim Arcuri : So Martin, I just wanted to ask about China. And I know that most of the activity is from the multinationals right now, but can you sort of talk a bit about, there's a lot of these big huge chunky numbers out there, these big memory projects, most of them beginning at the end of this year and sort of into next year. And you can debate how much IP they have, but certainly, they seem pretty focused on spending their money. So I'm wondering whether you've thought about sort of what the incremental is to WFE or more specifically your business from the captive Chinese projects. Could it add a $2 billion to WFE as early as next year? Martin Anstice : Well, I certainly think there is a very compelling and thoughtful strategic rationale for the investments. I mean, the kind of balance of payments motivation from my point of view at least is very intuitive. As Doug outlined in his prepared comments today, the majority of today's investment is the international companies. And so clearly, there is upside to the extent that's there are indigenous company investments made, which to your point require access to technology one way or other, either it's acquired partners or developed internally. My instinct is that in the long-term, the investment that's available to our industry, the investments in WFE, naturally balances around supply and demand. And so is there a spike at the beginning of a geographic commitment to an investment like China, probably yes, and exactly how much, to be determined in my opinion. But I think at least perhaps if not more important question is, what are the opportunities for incremental IC unit demand to be created from this investments and what's capital equipment additions would prevail in that context. And I think we all recognize that incremental IC unit growth only occurs when there are performance or costs benefits above and beyond the baseline. And certainly the partnerships that emerged in China between design houses, semiconductor companies, electronics companies and ultimately semiconductor manufacturers create opportunities for partnerships to be attacked with demand. And whether performance benefits prevail is to be determined, and cost benefits obviously capture the government incentives and agenda that are relevant particularly in China in next several years. So I do expect a bump to be determined how big, I do think it's an authentic agenda. I do think it will be executed with discipline and I think in the long-term it's all about the costs and the performance of a chip. Tim Arcuri : And then I guess just as a quick follow-up. I think the numbers suggest that the industry is adding this year sort of from a trajectory point of view in 3D roughly 200,000 versus where you closed last year and versus that 350,000 to 400,000 that you'll close this year. So at that sort of 200,000 run rate, like is that a reasonable number to assume that the end of Q will add per year going forward or rather will convert or is this year a year that was like abnormally above that? I'm just sort of trying to figure out how many more years to a point really concerned about how many more years there is left on the conversion of the existing plane and I'm just trying to help that. Martin Anstice : Yes. So I think as best I can tell, it's kind of to four years plus minus a bit, that's kind of the customer dialog. Another piece of data is the data that I think included in my prepared comments that the 350,000 to 400,000 is a ships capacity reference, probably a third of that is being qualified at the end of the year. So it will take some time to get production ready. There are, I think, 1.3 million wafer starts per month of capacity in the non-volatile memory space. So the headline is less than 25% of it is capable of making a 3D device by the end this year. I think your question, obviously, is specifically unanswerable, because at the end of the day the pace at which the customer transitions is a byproduct of success in the marketplace on performance and cost. But the momentum is clearly there. It is the device. And our customers have made that commitment. So I think 95% of spending this year is 3D device architecture. And they will, as best I can tell, execute that over a four-year period, plus or minus a bit. And so three to five years is probably a reasonable proxy, but it speeds up or slows down on the basis of cost and performance. Martin Anstice : And Tim, as you know, even once it converted, 3D will evolve in terms of layer count and the architecture. So even after playing it, a 3D is done making that conversion 3D-to-3D has a long way in front it. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, I mean it's for sure. It's a 10-year roadmap to be very clear with you. And deposition and etch segments are well-recognized, I think, by every industry participants at this point, that we're kind of very central to vertical scaling. And the other reference I think that's relevant to answer your question is what's the roadmap for SSD. So this is probably the single biggest example in the semiconductor industry for IC unit demand creation. And there is a $30 billion hard disk drive marketplace that every solid-state drive company is pursing in our ability to contribute productivity and performance to that agenda is a real enabler of incremental IC unit demand, which is a supplement to what we're describing here. So from my point of view, it's a really exciting headline. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Martin, you seemed confident on second half sales growth versus first half. You seem to have maybe a slightly more tempered view on second half shipment growth versus first half, maybe not as much as you had previously anticipated. I think you mentioned maybe a slightly lower DRAM spending profile. Any other moving pieces, logic or foundry, which slightly tempers your kind of second half shipment outlook? Martin Anstice : No, simple answer. I mean, it really is kind of a PC and DRAM kind of story. There is a little bit of rebalancing going on between the June quarter and September quarter, but that will always be true and we'll probably see even more by the time we get there, in what direction I can't tell you today. But the headline for us in terms of the momentum, I think is really positive. We believe that as we're guiding today, our first half '16 shipments exceed our second half '15 shipments. We believe that we got potential for second half '16 shipments to exceed first half '16 shipments. And we're very confident that second half '16 revenues exceed first half '16 revenues. At a segment level, our first half '16 memory shipments exceed our second half '15 memory shipments. So that's probably a company specific commentary that you're going to have to kind of absorb and digest from a modeling point of view. But the real swing factor in terms of WFE was PC units and the consequence in DRAM, and certainly the good news is I made both of those statements, because if we had a PC adjustment and no adjustment in DRAM spending, we'd be setting ourselves up collectively for a bigger problem statement. So for me that's a great commentary on the industries ability to react through changes in their market. Harlan Sur : And then solid job on the discipline OpEx implied within your guidance I think for the June quarter is a step up to about $365 million, it's still lower than the overall topline growth and responsible for the operating margin expansion. So as the team steps up revenues into second half of the calendar year, how should we think about your level of OpEx growth relative to topline growth? Douglas Bettinger : Harlan, the way we should think about it is, I'll just refer you back to the financial model that we shared with you at SEMICON West mid-last year, I mean that's how we think about managing the company. It won't be exactly that every single quarter, but we do have that in our minds when we let R&D spending. And by the way in the June quarter, the biggest uptick in spending will be R&D. But we're cognizant of the profitability of the company as we manage things. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad : Martin, my question is on your etch market share on staircase. One of your competitors was obviously talking about market share staircase early in the 3D NAND cycle. I just want to understand like what drove the market share shift towards Lam? And how big is the market? And where are we in terms of, like what's the market share like on the already installed base? And how do you see that going forward on the staircase etch? Martin Anstice : Yes. I mean, I think the most important headline today is the very same headline. We communicated I think in SEMICON West of 2014. And the headline was the most important selection decision is the production tool of record position and that's true for us as it is anybody else in the industry. And we all work really hard to get a development tool of record position, but the only way you actually extend that into a production tool of record position, which is where the money gets spent is by demonstrating an ability to meet the specifications that you've sold or positions and making a productive and repeatable and having kind of consistency of high volume manufacturing production for our customers. So that's a continuum, and all of sudden it's not just oh, we're done, we never have to worry about it any more, we have to work really hard every single day to make sure that the advantage that's we've been able to present that is legitimized our participation in staircase selections is something that's sustained itself over multiple years and that's clearly the objective for the company. So it's really about just the natural passing of time and transitioning from [indiscernible] staircase is an important application, it's not the most critical. I think you recollect that we have about 90% market share in the critical etch, after the critical etch and deposition applications in the 3D NAND transition, and that's the kind of foundation of competitive strength of the company and the staircase is something we work hard to position in the HVM selections and we're very pleased with the results, although we've got more work to do and more upside of course. Farhan Ahmad : And my second question is regarding the ALD and ALE opportunity. At SPIE obviously Lam talked about great importance of ALD and ALE and some of your customers as well in addressing some of the etch placement and/or issues. I want to understand like should we think of these markets as being incremental to your core market or its just that you have more of the traditional etch being replaced by atomic layer etch? And how does the shift from like more of the traditional etches to atomic layer etch, how does that affect your market opportunities? Is it much slower? Is it like on a per layer basis much more intensive? If you could talk about that that will be really helpful? Martin Anstice : Yes. I would say, and this is going to be a Lam specific commentary, I will say for etch, I would not be thinking of it as particularly incremental. I think it's a commentary on more capability, more defendability, higher barriers of entry around the critical applications focus that we have in our company and the position of strength we have in etch. So for me as the technology roadmap of the customer gets more challenging, the bigger the proportion of etch-related differentiation will be occupied by atomic level control. The deposition also might be slightly different. And again, this is clearly a commentary for Lam Research, because we don't the comprehensive deposition product portfolio. We have, at least, one sizeable gap in the product portfolio compared to others. And so the atomic level deposition product roadmap for us has an opportunity to be disruptive more holistically and creates a growth potential for Lam Research above and beyond what might be available for a generic deposition kind of baseline. Operator : We'll go next to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your memory customers and the relationship between their spending levels and their cash flow both NAND and DRAM are quite worse than I probably thought they'd be here to date. I think there is pretty good cash flow coverage on the spending now, but it's eroding as the year goes by. What are your conversations with your customers telling you about that and how much of you're thinking on the second half is predicated on memory economics getting better? Martin Anstice : Well, it may only not surprise you, but I don't actually have that precise conversation with the customer, because that's their gig and their business. What I do focus on is sustainability of investments. What I do focus on is the strategic nature of investments. And what I do focus on is the response to changes in IC unit demand. And so when I look at memory, I see the type of correction happening in DRAM that I consider to be healthy, responsible and disciplined. And that's a good thing for the future of the industry and it kind of sets us up I think in DRAM for a more positive year in '17 and '16, but a lot can happen between now and then. And in NAND, this is about as strategic as it gets. So you have the first in history where every single participant of the non-volatile memory space is committed to 3D architecture. And clearly, they have to have an ability to pay for that roadmap. But I think it's so strategic, few would be comprised by short-term profitability or short-term kind of cash issues. Does that helps? Joseph Moore : Yes, that helps. And then, I guess, also in DRAM where all three of your DRAM customers are working on important yield transitions, I mean are you seeing flexibility there. And I think that you talked about maybe a little bit of a lower expectation for DRAM, any concerns if that continues to deteriorate if DRAM continues to deteriorate? Martin Anstice : I mean, clearly the market is telling it something with ASPs with announcements in the kind of the PC space and DRAM generally. I mean people are kind of adjusting their plans and there is still is significant legitimately to 20-nanometer transitions and 1x roadmaps and there is a generation or two beyond that in people's strategic plans. And there are real performances in cost benefits that go with our roadmap. But we're assuming we ended the year with slightly less capacity in terms of wafer starts than we began the year, which kind of sets us up nicely for next year. Operator : Next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho : Martin, firstly in terms of the logic and foundry space based, you mention that you saw both investments in 10 and 28-nanometer. How does, I guess the life extension of these logic nodes, particularly for 28 and probably for both 14 and 10, how does that extension of life of these nodes, I guess, benefit you specifically in terms of both systems as well as the aftermarket sales? Martin Anstice : I'm not really sure, I'm going to get your question here, but I'll give a shot. Obviously, we have a very long tail to our installed base business, when we sell something. So it's a 20 year commitment to our customers, once we sold a system in many respects and a 20 year opportunity in terms of upgradability and productivity improvements and so on and so forth. So clearly, this is the year where the majority of investments in logic and foundry are focused on leading-edge technology, but the cycle of investments in IoT and other broad marketplaces of 28 is creating installed base business opportunities above and beyond our baseline. You may recollect from our SEMICON West presentation a year or so ago, we talked about an objective to grow our installed business at a rate that was faster than our installed base segment growth. As we introduced new products and services to accommodate some respond to the productivity needs of our customers in the mature technology nodes and that's exactly what we're executing. So hopefully I got the essence of your question there. Patrick Ho : Now, I'll use my follow-up maybe to just kind of expand on that. I guess, what I was trying to get is in the past using leading-edge nodes when they ramp up, the previous nodes kind of starts falling off and pretty rapidly. But you're seeing these older nodes last a lot longer. I guess, what are the incremental opportunities both on the systems side, as well as on the aftermarket there is for Lam given these changing, I guess, industry dynamics? Martin Anstice : So there clearly is an opportunity, and so incremental 28-nanometer shows up because it's a great node in many respects. So it has a good performance threshold and cost dynamic that is relevant for a lot of kind of IoT-related demand. And so it's kind of a sweet spot in many respects. We have kind of great position. We are developing, in some cases, new product to be more competitive in the more mature technology nodes. And there are even examples where we're introducing new 200 millimeter product, believe it or not for some of these applications. They are not necessarily material in the context of the revenues of the company, but hopefully illustrative of the commitment that we make to all customers, not just those customers with leading edge. And clearly, when it comes to productivity solutions, clearly when it comes to install base improvement, advance services, utilization, productivity and reuse are everything to do with the economics of the semiconductor industry these days and that's not really new. But to your points, we're finding ways to contribute more to the customer's success and create some expansion opportunities and increase market share for Lam at the same time. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Chin with UBS. Steven Chin : Just a follow-up question on the strong shipments that you saw to China in this March quarter. Can you share some color on the customer diversity there? Was it concentrated into just one of these multinational customers or more than one? Just wondering if we should think about China being lumpy shipment region or are there enough multinational customers to make stuff consistently high region every quarter? Martin Anstice : You're seeing just pretty much everybody that's spending at the leading edge and some not at the leading edge, actually it's not really leading edge, making investments in China. And 80%-ish of the spending that we're seeing are global multinationals putting some level of capability in China, Steven. And it's not one; it's pretty much across the board. And I think it has been pretty well chronicled in the trade press who is making those investments. Steven Chin : And then just a follow-up question on trying to size up the wafer fab equipment opportunity in China. Do you think we could think about looking at China's installed base of 200 millimeter wafer capacity and possibly thinking about how much of a cost upgrade all of that to, let's say, state-of-the-art 300 millimeter capacity. Is that a reasonable way to try to size up the long-term China WFE market? Martin Anstice : You probably have to ask them. I mean, I am sure that the full spectrum of options will be exploited at some level, right. I mean, there are assets in place at 200 and below and assets of 300 and the customer will optimize that footprint as well as they can. But if they have presumably productive fabs at 200 millimeter that are technology nodes that meets and are correlated with the domestic demand, then they are as likely, if not more likely to stay in that form than be changed. So I mean our instinct is that if you go back to first principals here, performance and cost matter when it comes to the agenda and the sustainability of an agenda, it would seem more rational, the more of the spending at 300 millimeter related certainly in terms of greenfield. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Shankar with Bank of America. Chris Shankar : I had couple of them. Thanks for the color on the second half shipment and revenue. I just wanted to ask the question a different way. If the industry is flattish this year for WFE given the last couple of years, you guys have outperformed the industry, is it fair to assume your revenue growth will be better than the industry trend for this year calendar '16? Douglas Bettinger : That's the plan. Martin Anstice : Yes, Chris, I mean we've talked about these technology inflections, they will be a bigger percent of the total spend this year than they were last year and as you know that benefits us. Douglas Bettinger : So I mean another reference, and it's not a linear progression, so it's little hard for us to kind of give you much more than these two reference points, but the outperformance commentary of the company is highly correlated to the technology inflection 3D device architecture, multi-patterning we've talked about it many times. And our estimates of the proportion of WFE last year that was inflections-based it was 33%. Our estimate of the proportion of WFE that will be inflections-based in calendar '18 is approximately 55%. So we are on a journey. We've come from zero to 33% last year and we're on our way to the mid-50s few years from now. Chris Shankar : And then industry level question, when you see the second half versus first half comparison on the spending run rate, it looks like there was more 3D NAND spending in the first half of this year. Should we assume the second half is going to be weighted more towards 10-nanometer logic foundry customers? And if so does it have any impact in your gross margin profile? Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean, we had previously stated that all segments except NAND were second half biased. It is the by product of this PC and DRAM story. We would now say, memory first half '16 is stronger than second half of '16. And logic foundry, to your points, second half '16 is stronger than first half of '16. So if you want to kind of have first half, second half profile, our assumption is memory is in the mid-50s in the first half and foundry logic is 55 to 60 level in the second half of '16. Operator : Next, we'll go to C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: I guess first question, Martin. You've outlined basically a flat WFE outlook. Curious what it would take to see growth this year? Where would you handicap, I guess, the highest probability where you could see an upward surprise? Martin Anstice : I don't think I'd call that DRAM. So I guess, I mean, as I call that 3D NAND or logic, I think there is, as we've discussed many times, there's a real value proposition here to high performing and lower cost non-volatile memory relative to solid-state drive and hard disk drive kind of trade off. So there is a compelling motivation to be as good as we can, and as an ecosystem as fast as we can. This is a pretty complex transition. And it's the first year where everybody has kind of invested in it, so it's not the easiest thing to do. But I would say, at least from the interactions I've had with customers, the direction in terms of yielding is very positive. So probably the biggest upside is 3D NAND in terms of really getting traction and how that plays out we'll see. Technically, there's probably upside in foundry relative to kind of 7-nanometer, but that's some ways off probably, if I interpret the comments from our customers in the last several days correctly. C.J. Muse: And I guess as my follow-up, there seems to be a pretty good debate around the sustainability of 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer foundry logics spending. I'm just curious if we added roughly 10,000 equipment shipped in '15, roughly 35,000 this year, how do you think the world evolves next year? I know, it's a long time from now, but would love to hear your thoughts. Martin Anstice : Unfortunately, I'm not going to be quantitative about these thoughts. But qualitatively, as best I can tell, C.J., there is much more substance to a 10 and 7 conversation in terms of performance and cost benefits for the fab-less community than what's true at '16. And the tape-out data that's presented looks like it is supporting that rationale. The fab-less community in the foundries have growth trajectories that exceed overall semiconductors, so I mean at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to the reality of power, processing speed and cost. And if the substance of those roadmaps is there from my point of view, they will be demanded. And I've seen a growth in those segments will create expansion in our industry, so that's the best I can do. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company. Edwin Mok : First, I want to call quickly on install base business. I think previously you guys talked about how [indiscernible] will 13% comp growth for that business over the next few years. So wondering are you tracking in line with that? And as some of these new product you guys have shoveled the last two years come off, do you expect that to drive some incremental growth in that business? Martin Anstice : Yes. I mean, the prepared comments actually were intended to communicate that. I mean we put a lot of time and effort in the last several years into engineering the set of products and services consistent with the objectives that you correctly stated. And we validated a number of those with the key customer selections last year and now it's about kind of broadening the penetration of those products. I would expect that the install base business as a proportion of our business goes up not down consistent with the some expansion that we're describing to you and executing on a day-by-day basis. So we come into the year pretty strong, I would say on installed based products and services. Edwin Mok : And then just kind of quick follow-on the DRAM investment there. I think one of your peers has talked about potential increase DRAM investment, they expect to come into the second half of this year, maybe predicate on 18-nanometer investment. Do you have any color on in terms of timing of that and what do you think customers are in terms of actually getting ready to ramp 18-nanometer? Martin Anstice : Well, they're clearly is -- there is kind of roadmap for below 20 and there is clearly described value from a performance and the cost point of view and there clearly is some investments showing up this year. At least through the lead times that are relevant in our business, and actual in deposition, we don't expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. But depending on your lead times, it could well be and if you have long lead times and that's your conclusion that probably bodes well for us in the first quarter of next year. Operator : Take our next question from Wes Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Wes Twigg : First just want to come back to this ALD growth idea and wondering if you can give us an idea of your growth expectations or revenue expectations in 2016? Martin Anstice : Unfortunately, not. And I'd love to help you, Wes, but it's one of the more strategic kind of product lines in the company. There are hugely complex dynamics associated with positioning in ALD technology against others. So we are behaving with stealth for reasons that are really important to us in terms of competitive advantage. Wes Twigg : That make sense. I guess, I'll ask another question, you probably can answer then. You spoke about non-volatile memory WFE this time. I think, what you're trying to perhaps do is be inclusive of 3D cross-pointing them. Just wondering if you're seeing any 3D cross-point activity yet or if you think that will be meaningful this year or do you think that's more of a 2017 event for you? Martin Anstice : I think, we've also got to be a little bit careful with disclosure, but I've heard at least one other equipment company say what I'm about to say, which is, the vast majority of spending is related to traditional kind of 3D NAND architecture. And I'll leave it at that, if I may. Douglas Bettinger : There is a reason, Wes, we're saying non-volatile memory, because other things are beginning to happen. Operator : And we will take our last question from Mehdi Hosseini. Mehdi Hosseini : I have two follow-up. Martin, your September quarter is historically kind of seasonally down, and with the second half up compared to the first half, is there any quarterly trend we need to be aware? If I just take the midpoint of your shipment guide for the June and go flat from there, I get to mid single-digit growth. But I also want to be aware if there is any seasonality with September quarter? Martin Anstice : I frankly, I literally never think about seasonality, because I don't know what it would mean for our business anymore for all the same reasons that I don't know what cyclicality means anymore. I mean the second to the industry are trending and tracking, definitely this is a very strategic year. And best counsel I can give you, relative to modeling Lam, is what we've said, the long-term financial model is the best calibration for kind of profitability and performance, given WFE. And you've heard us describe an expectation that our second half revenues are higher than first half revenues this year. And we've got a decent shot having some upside in shipments as well, second half over first half. So that's the best we can offer you at this point. Mehdi Hosseini : And then the second follow-up or clarification, you talked about 350,000 to 400,000 wafer per month of 3D NAND at capacity added. How do you think about the yield impact, if three of the four manufactures are going through the learning curve, would that have any material impact on wafer capacity in '17 as yields improve? Martin Anstice : My presumption is not, but that's an industry answer, not a company answer, because we like obviously as many customers as we can have and we don't have so many. But honestly speaking, I think as an equipment industry we're agnostic to kind of who is spending the money. My presumption is, if there is demand for ICs, someone will fill it, and they'll need to buy equipment to make it. So there are five companies participating in a non-volatile memory RAM, as the best I know on a significant scale, and they are competing with intensity to get their fair share and we're supporting all of them in the exercise of their objectives. But if one yields faster or slower, presumably it makes itself out for the industry. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our Q&A portion of the call. I return the floor to our speakers for closing comments. End of Q&A Satya Kumar : Thank you, operator. That's all the time we have for today. Thank you for your participation. And we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.",

Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you, Satya, and thank you all for joining us today for our quarterly earnings conference call. The headline is that we delivered strong results that continue to reinforce our increasingly strong presence in the industry, as the enabling technology inflections continue to intensify around etch and deposition processes. In addition, the quality of our earnings rises as a higher proportion of our market share occurs in critical applications, which are characterized by extreme technical complexity and multi-year cycles of learning for the company. Lastly, our expectations for performance in the second half of calendar 2016 are stronger than previously articulated. We believe that with sustained focus on execution in partnership with our customers, multi-year outperformance opportunity is set to continue. Lam's shipments, revenue and non-GAAP gross margins were above the mid-points, and non-GAAP earnings above the high end of our guided ranges for the recent quarter. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the support of our customers and the contributions of all Lam employees, without whom our performance would not be possible. I would also like to recognize the support we have received from our suppliers who have helped us to ramp our capacity, increase responsiveness to customers, increase localization and support our rapid product development cycles. Thank you all. At the core of Lam's outperformance is our culture and values, our close partnership with our customers and our ability to deliver innovative products, service, and capabilities at scale, which directly address key semiconductor manufacturing technology and market inflections such as 3D NAND, multi-patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging. Our predominant focus is always on increasing the probability of success for our customers, contributing to their stated business objectives. In that context, the importance of these technology inflections and their enabling of new industry growth vectors has never been stronger. Our leading customers are moving to capitalize on the acceleration in innovation centered on the next wave of industry application drivers such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and connected devices and automobiles. They articulate aspirations to change the world. Realizing the potential of these application drivers will demand unprecedented scaling of performance, power, and cost for compute, storage, and networking, significantly beyond what is possible with traditional scaling and shrink and Moore's law. In essence, this reenergizing of our industry demands a more holistic approach to systems architecture through the entire semiconductor ecosystem. In cloud server, storage and networking devices, this revolution is driving significant semiconductor demand for DRAM, NAND, new memory technologies, and over time additional logic chip demand for advanced computation necessary for converting data into actionable information. Growth in semiconductor content for DRAM, NAND and leading and trailing edge logic is a strong theme also in clients' devices like smartphones, IoT, and connected automobiles to deliver the power of the new industry application drivers and enrich the end consumer experience. We believe that Lam is in an outstanding position to help drive needed innovation and capitalize on the opportunities presented by current and future inflections. The foundation of the last several years, great employees, strong ecosystem trust, and the increasing quality of product and technology roadmaps delivers an execution track record, proven financial outperformance, and leads to our recognized market leadership position. Lam's etch and deposition products and their on-wafer performance are vital to our customers' success, no doubt. In partnership, we are enabling multi-patterning-driven scaling and logic and DRAM. We are facilitating cost reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies and supporting increased compute performance and memory bandwidth with FinFET and advanced packaging technology inflections. One characterization of our strategic relevance is in our expanding market opportunity. As a result of our strategic and operational execution through the last several years, Lam's addressable market as a share of WFE has increased from 26.5% in 2013 to over 30% last year and is on track once again to exceed the performance of overall WFE in 2016. The 3D NAND inflection in particular has accelerated and is driving a greater than 30% growth in 2016 NAND WFE year-over-year, as our customers' target probably the single largest growth opportunity in all of semis over the next few years. NAND is still in the early stages of penetration with its share of total bits addressable at under 20% of the overall flash and spinning media storage market combined. Underpinning the strong product cycle for NAND in storage is the visibility provided by the technology roadmap of our customers, which extends well into the next decade. Etch and deposition are the key process technology enablers of 3D NAND, a fact that is perhaps best illustrated by the greater than 2X growth in our non-volatile memory markets over the last two years and exciting multi-year growth outlook going forward. In addition to the demanding requirements for high aspect ratio etch and cost and technology enabling moldstack scaling and 3D, atomic level processing is growing increasingly importance as storage layer counts scale from 40-plus layers today to over 60 layers next year and eventually to more than 100 layers in the next few years. Lam has prepared its product portfolio for this trend. Our latest ALTUS system with low fluorine tungsten atomic layer deposition or ALD capability is being qualified at multiple customers. This system enables the next generation 3D NAND and DRAM by delivering an innovative ALD solution with lower fluorine impurities, differentiated stress control, and void free fill properties. Our VECTOR Strata PECVD deposition product is seeing very strong momentum with its industry-leading productivity and film property control for moldstack deposition and is now process tool of record at the significant majority of global 3D NAND customers. Our dielectric etch installed base for high aspect ratio applications in 3D NAND and DRAM has more than doubled over the last year. This strong performance of the portfolio of our VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and Flex and Kiyo etch products has allowed us to remain on track with our objective first shared with you at SEMICON West a year ago, up 7 percentage points to 10 percentage points of share gain from the 2D NAND to 3D NAND transition. Another important element of the value we bring to our customers and enabling the growth of our systems market share is our customer support business group, which is leading value creation across the entirety of our 40,000 process modules in the installed base. This organization inside of our company is providing world-class support for our new systems during integrated circuit production ramp and addressing our customers' ongoing and critical operational needs for spares and services over lifetime. But increasingly, this organization is also contributing highly innovative, differentiated technology, productivity and lifecycle solutions, resulting in substantial served market growth and an increasing revenue stream annuity that supports our investment in our future. Now turning to a Lam and KLA-Tencor merger update. To reemphasize the points made many times before, the outperformance potential of Lam is set to continue for multiple years we believe. This period of strength we've chosen to harness strategically through the planned business combination of two great companies. We continue to make progress with anti-trust agency reviews. We are pleased with the overall tone of support from our customers for this investment and without compromising the focus on execution in two standalone companies, the integration planning is in better shape today than was true for Lam and Novellus at this same point in the process Excitement and substance internally and with our customers is building. We continue to work diligently to receive the necessary approvals and now target completion of our merger in the coming few months. We have no doubt this is a value creating transaction for our customers and the company, for our employees and suppliers worldwide. The opportunity remains. We are 100% committed to innovate beyond what is possible for the two standalone companies separately to the benefit of the overall semi-ecosystem and add to the potential of Lam as currently defined. Now turning to an overview of capital equipment spending patterns in 2016. Expectations for global economic growth have remained generally stable since our last report, although there has been some increased uncertainty with the possible effects of Brexit. End market demand expectations for PCs has been relatively stable, and there's evidence of solid growth in low-end smartphones and slightly slower units, but stronger content expectations today in high-end smartphones. We continue to expect solid and long-term demand for leading edge silicon in the enterprise markets driven by the move to the cloud. WFE for 2016 continues to track to $33 billion, plus or minus $1 billion. Our bottoms-up analytics imply at/or slightly above the midpoint is most likely. By segment, memory WFE tracks to approximately $15 billion with spending more biased to NAND than DRAM this year and for sure since our last update. We now expect NAND CapEx to be up over 30%, offset by DRAM CapEx, which we now expect to be down approximately 40%. Logic and foundry CapEx is tracking slightly better than our prior expectations. Spending in these segments is weighted primarily to an addition of 10-nanometer and some pilot 7-nanometer capacity as well as additions at the mature 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer technology nodes with China featuring prominently driven by strength in low and mid end smartphones and IoT devices. Despite a flattish WFE year with some segment mix headwinds for our company, including a substantial decline in DRAM CapEx this year, Lam once again is poised to outperform WFE in calendar 2016. We are confident that calendar year-over-year revenues and second half 2016 versus first half 2016 trends are very positive. Currently, we anticipate second half shipments will be up mid to high single digits sequentially. Momentum continues to build in 3D NAND with total 3D NAND shipped capacity at the end of calendar 2016, now tracking to the higher end of the 350,000 wafer starts per month to 400,000 wafer starts per month outlook that we provided earlier. In DRAM, spending remains focused on the 2Z nanometer and 1X nanometer conversions with about 50% of industry capacity converted to 20-nanometer and mid single digits converted to 1X, we believe, by the end of this calendar year. We remain optimistic on content demand drivers for DRAM in clients and servers, which combined with our customers' prudent responses to managing supply in response to the PC demand weakness earlier in the year are already pointing to early signs of improving supply and demand balance. This sentiment biases us positively for a recovery in DRAM CapEx as we look into the next calendar year. As we enter the second half of 2016, we are excited by the inflection-driven long-term outperformance opportunities for Lam. Also our strong installed base market share positions across all geographies and when combined with KT, further increased strategic relevance to our customers by providing them more valuable innovation, trusted productivity, and fast solutions. With that, let me hand the call over to Doug. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Okay. Great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today during what I know is a busy earnings time. The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2016 fiscal year. In the quarter, we performed above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics with operating margin and earnings per share above the high end of the range. For the fiscal year, shipments, revenues, operating income dollars, and earnings per share were all at record high levels. We delivered double digit revenue growth fiscal year over fiscal year and operating income dollars and earnings per share that grew at twice the rate of revenue growth. Moving now to the specifics for the June quarter. Shipments were $1.587 billion, up approximately 10% compared to the March quarter and just slightly below the record high level that we saw in the June 2015 quarter. The combined memory segment made up 66% of system shipments, and that was down from 70% in the prior quarter. Non-volatile memory shipments contributed 51% of the system shipments, and this was up from 43% in the March quarter. The non-volatile shipment dollars represent record levels for Lam Research. As we progress through first half of the year, 3D NAND investments have accelerated with multiple customers moving forward in their 3D NAND ramp plans. We are continuing to see the expansion of our SAM. And this combined with our success in winning critical applications in the 3D NAND process flows of our customers is driving the financial performance we're delivering. 3D NAND will represent over 95% of NAND shipments for 2016. As we expected, DRAM shipments decreased to 15% from 27% in the prior quarter. Investment is pacing at a rational reduced level in response to market conditions. DRAM spending was predominately focused on 20 nanometer conversions with the continued objective of lowering cost per bit. PC DRAM pricing seems to have bottomed as the market shifts to server and mobile DRAM. Server and mobile represents roughly two-thirds of the market bit growth this year. System shipments into the foundry segment increased to 27% which is up from 23% in the March quarter. And as Martin mentioned, foundry spending continues to be broad-based with an increasing contribution from 10 nanometer capacity additions augmented by the ongoing investment at 28 nanometer and above nodes primarily in China. The logic and other segment held steady at 7% of system shipments, which was a level similar to that we saw in the March quarter. From a geographic standpoint, China continued to be, strong representing 17% of total shipments and 22% of total revenue. June quarter revenues came in at $1.546 billion, a sequential increase of 18% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was strong in the period at 46.6% which was a 150 basis point improvement from the 45.1% that we saw in the March quarter. The strength in growth margin was a result of higher business volumes as well as favorable product mix. And as we've described previously, you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter in our gross margins. And I'd just like to remind you that our financial model is the best reference to help you think about margins over time. Our operating expenses for the quarter were within our expectations at $361 million which was an increase on an absolute basis from the $350 million in the March quarter, but decreasing to 23% of revenue in the June quarter versus 27% in March. In the June quarter, our spending allocated to R&D was 63% of total spending. During the quarter, we completed construction on our new R&D lab in Fremont, California. This lab will put us at the state of the art in terms of capability and flexibility to continue to develop leading-edge process capability and productivity solutions. Operating income for the quarter was very strong at $359 million which was an increase of 48% compared to the $242 million in the March quarter. Operating margin increased from 18.4% to 23.2%, above the high end of the guidance range due to both the higher revenue as well as the stronger gross margin. This operating margin percentage is the second highest level since our acquisition of Novellus in 2012. Our tax rate came in at 10%, which was lower than the 14% rate last quarter, primarily due to more income from lower tax jurisdictions. A rate in the low teens for the remainder of 2016 would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling. Earnings per share for the June quarter were $1.80 based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the outstanding 2016 warrants with a total dilutive impact of about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. In the June quarter, our $450 million 2016 convertible note matured and was settled for both cash and stock. The stock issuance was offset by the corresponding bond hedge that we had in place. Dilution schedules for the remaining convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $47 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases in the quarter in line with our previously announced plans around the business combination with KLA-Tencor. Let me now turn to the balance sheet. We have a very solid cash position of $7.1 billion on the balance sheet, reflecting both the strong performance of the business as well as steps we've taken to increase the cash position of the company during the quarter. We generated a strong cash from operations of $424 million, which was an increase of 132% sequentially in the quarter. Cash from operations for the fiscal year came in at $1.350 billion, a record high level. As expected, days sales outstanding for the period improved to 74 days from 86 days, with the shipment profile more linear than in the March quarter. Inventory turns improved to 3.5 times. We completed the issuance of $2.4 billion in principal value of investment grade senior notes in May. This issuance together with $1.5 billion in term loans completes the required financing for the KLA-Tencor transaction. The net interest expense associated with the $2.4 billion financing is $4 million and is excluded from our non-GAAP results in this quarter. On a full-quarter basis, the net interest expense from this new debt will be approximately $18 million. The deferred revenue balance at the end of the June quarter stood at $566 million, an 11% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $132 million from shipments to customers in Japan, which will convert to revenue in future quarters, and recall that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on the balance sheet. I expect that deferred revenue will again grow in the September quarter. Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following : $39 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization, and $36 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $52 million, which was up from $46 million in the March quarter. CapEx projects included investment in infrastructure expansion from an additional engineering lab space to support the growth of the company. During the quarter, we sold our San Jose campus for net proceeds of approximately $80 million and a gain of $15 million. This gain is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This transaction is part of our R&D consolidation into the Fremont site. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,500 regular full-time employees. The growth in head count was primarily related to growth in factory resources to support the growing business level. Additionally, we added some R&D heads. So now, looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We're expecting shipments of $1.700 billion, plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would represent a record level of shipments for Lam Research. We expect revenue of $1.625 billion, again plus or minus $75 million. This midpoint would also represent a record level of revenue. We expect gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin is down sequentially due to higher customer concentration in September. We forecast operating margins of 22.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally we forecast earnings per share of $1.77, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 176 million shares. This earnings per share number excludes the $18 million associated with the $2.4 billion KLA-Tencor financing. The net interest expense will be excluded from our non-GAAP results until such time as the deal closes. We expect both shipments and revenue to be stronger in the second half than the first half with mid to high single digit growth in shipments in the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half. We expect revenue growth in the second half to outpace shipment growth half over half. We expect to deplete some of the deferred revenue balance by the end of the calendar year. And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Tim Arcuri with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I had two questions. I guess, first, Doug, I'm not sure if I heard the guidance right, but it sounds like the second half shipment guidance is sort of up mid to high singles. So that would imply that the fourth quarter shipments are down a smidge, they're down maybe $150 million. And I guess \u2013 and my question on that is, we've all heard about some recent big 3D NAND projects that may have sort of pulled into this year, so is that more \u2013 sounds like that's more of a Q3 phenomenon than a Q4 phenomenon? Thanks. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Tim, we've given you a firm number on calendar Q3, and then calendar Q4, it's more directional, that's why it's mid to high single digits, because I don't want to specifically pinned down to exactly what is December, and that's why we've put a range around it. But when we describe it, it represents our expectation for everything that's going on not just in 3D NAND, but foundry/logic as well. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Just to add to that, Tim, I would say the message that we would very deliberately emphasize is the outperformance opportunity long-term for the company in the inflection space and whether it's multi-patterning with logic or 3D NAND scaling. The ebbs and flows in any one quarter, or ebbs and flows from one customer to another, I mean, they \u2013 I guess, they're interesting at some level. But I think one of the headlines from the industry in the last two months, three months is a very strong strategic commitment to some inflections that fall directly into the wheelhouse of this company because of the intensity of etch and deposition-related process. So, yeah, there's always an ebb and flow, but the headline \u2013 I hope you help us with, which is long-term commitment for customers to inflections that are extremely relevant for the future of this company. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Good point. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Totally, Martin. Okay, great. And then a follow-up question is on China. So of course, overnight, two of the bigger projects in China, the Tsinghua plant and XMC, they merged to form a new venture. Obviously, they still need IP, but it seems like maybe there is a little more confidence that this project could sort of get off the ground. I know, Doug, you guys have been a little more, I think, not cautious, but a little more realistic, I'd say on China that it's sort of like an even-sum game. So sort of in light of that recent development, can you talk a little bit about China and whether you're seeing any increased signs that maybe you could see some business from these indigenous projects on the memory side next year? Thanks. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I'll let Martin handle this one. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I think \u2013 I don't really think there's a kind of deliberate kind of tone differentiation for Lam relative to a China agenda. We all see exactly the same thing, more or less at exactly the same time, and what we said, I think, fairly consistently is that, the conviction to an IC 2020 and 2025 agenda appears very solid and robust. There are very strategic actions sometimes involving global companies, sometimes the domestic community. We are tracking at least 20 different fab level kind of ambition statements. And there is a full spectrum of kind of probability associated with each one of those. There clearly is, over a multiple year timeframe, more than 1 million wafer starts per month out there as a kind of reference point for installed based capacity in China. Relative to it being incremental, for me that's all about performance and cost of devices. And if the performance and cost of devices out of China can be a catalyst and a trigger for incremental demand, it's kind of positive for a global kind of industry including Lam. So time will tell. But clearly the commitment appears to be there. And as Doug said in his prepared comments, China is not an insignificant part of the revenue for the industry and the company. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah, Tim, just to remind you, whatever happens in China, we are going to be involved substantially. Our share position, our presence there is very strong. So whatever is going on, be it a global multinational or an indigenous Chinese customer, we're extremely well-positioned. Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Of course. Okay. Thank you so much. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you guys have done any analysis in terms of the current level of DRAM shipments. If you know kind of where we're tracking for DRAM supply next year kind of given the rate of investment we've seen, if you have any thoughts on that? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I think we've done analytics, but we're not going to kind of get ahead of our customers relative to quantitative disclosure. We feel really good about kind of the ASP dynamic in the last several months and the inventory situation generally, I think those are kind of positive trends, the discipline appears to be in the system. We end the year, we believe, with a smaller installed base than we began the year. There's plenty of opportunity left to improve the performance and lower the cost of DRAM chips from conversions. I've said in my prepared comments, no more than 50% converted to the 20-nanometer technology node by end of year. So we are biased to a positive spending year in DRAM next year. But we're going to hold off on dollars until little later in the year. Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess just \u2013 when you talk about that, that's more based on your extrapolating what the DRAM environment will look like next year, or are you sort of hearing forecast from your customers that spending would pick up next year in DRAM? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I guess, the humorous response would be, we don't just make it up. So it's an educated judgment from the analytics of the company and a lot of dialog with our customers. I mean, we try to give you the best perspective we have, and I just did. Joe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question; when you think about an environment with shipments down in Q4, curious how we should think about deferred revenues cascading in given that they're at record levels today and you suggested they would grow further in September. So curious how we should think about that coming through? And then what would the impact be to gross margins? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: So I described an expectation that next quarter deferred revenues will grow again. They grew this quarter. You normally see that when shipments are above revenue, which obviously we've had the last couple of quarters now. I also described an expectation in the scripted remarks that I expect by the end of the year to deplete some of the deferred revenue, and obviously that will happen then in the June quarter if it's growing in September. So that's the way to think about it. Gross margin, C.J., I'm really only going to guide at one quarter at a time. There isn't anything magic about the deferred revenue and gross margin. It's more of what the product mix is, the customer concentration, all of that. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Okay. Very helpful. And then I guess as a quick follow-up, hoping to, I guess, dig a little bit into the KT transaction, can you update us on what needs to get done on a regulatory basis? And then whether you can extend the bridge financing beyond October 20? I think I saw that as an important date in the filing. Thank you. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I'll let Doug deal with the financing part of that question. What needs to get done is, we need to get consent from agencies that we haven't got consent from. We're working hard to that. We've obviously communicated to you today a delay relative to our original September reference. We might be lucky and still be pleasantly surprised, but we don't expect to receive consent globally inside of the September quarter. We're targeting before mid October. And obviously the disclosure of the company will stay consistent with our learnings. We feel the deal is clearly a compelling value proposition to our customers and our company. We feel better about it today as the value proposition than ever. I think even as recently at SEMICON West, we had a couple of customer meetings with clear statements of interest in the joint development activity and the innovation that would be possible when Lam and KT come together. We're targeting closure as fast as practically possible and obviously looking forward to being part of one company. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: And then, C.J., you're right. The term loans have an expiration that would be in the 20th of October and were we still to be going back and forth and we extend the deal timing, then I'd have to go extend those as well. Wouldn't be all that hard to do it. C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI : Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. Last quarter, the team was somewhat optimistic on second half shipments being up over first half but a little bit tempered just given the DRAM fundamental environment. Obviously, this call, you seem extremely confident. You even quantified the growth in second half shipments. What segments or programs are driving the better second half view relative to outlook 90 days ago? Is it truly broad-based across memory, foundry and logic or is it skewed towards one segment or the other? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I would say, relatively speaking to the commentary of the company three months ago, it's memory and foundry both and it's exactly where you'd expect it to be of 3D NAND and demand related with broad industry commitment to that technology and it's 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer focused with as best I can tell very good tape-outs and customer engagement commentary from the customers that are making those investments. So it's definitely not just a single segment or limited customer commentary. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for the insights there, Martin. And given the stabilization in DRAM pricing, as you mentioned, there is a focus on profitability. As you mentioned, 50% of the capacity may be transitioned to 20-nanometers exiting this year. But there also seems like there is a sense of acceleration on some of the leaders in the space to make the move to 18-nanometer and 16-nanometer nodes. So I'm wondering if you're seeing this reflected in your second half shipment outlook and your thoughts on shipped 1X capacity as we exit this year for DRAM. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I mean I think the essence of fundamental value in these conversions is kind of well understood and I don't think debated. I think appropriately, our customers are disciplined around supply and demand in their respective industry. They're conscious not just of adding capacity, but making money on the chips they build. And so we are very confident that as the cycle of demand emerges, and there's a decent amount of commentary on content expansion in some of our devices, as well as some positive signs in terms of unit demand on the low and mid end. This will kind of naturally play itself out. So, I don't really think it's a big second-half commentary for us, which is why we've articulated an expectation of calendar 2017 biased to the positive and that certainly when we would expect the supply and demand kind of conversation to be more or less behind us. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: And Harlan... Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for the insights. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah, there is a little bit of 1X conversion occurring. But that really is going to be more about what's happening next year. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for the insights. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to ask about the deal because there's been uncertainty as to whether or not it's going to go through. And I think part of this stems from what happened last year. You know AMAT, TEL \u2013 yeah, that was a deal that was consistently delayed until it ultimately got killed. And with KLA this is \u2013 from what I understand the second time that you guys have delayed the timing of the closure. So, I guess the question is why should we be more confident that this transaction actually goes through? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I guess I don't really get chance to comment about your confidence. I will tell you that we believe this transaction is fundamentally different than the conversation and the transaction that you just referred to. There is no overlap whatsoever. We strongly believe in the merits of this transaction. We believe it's pro-competitive. We believe that Lam and KT together can innovate and deliver value to our customers beyond what we can do as independent companies. We are, as you know, from prior disclosure, codifying kind of the behavior that will be relevant to the company with the consent decree conversation, and I think we're on records in prior earnings calls on that point. One part of that obviously is describing our commitment to the entire semiconductor ecosystem relative to availability, supply and support kind of KT products. And that's just kind of part of this process. And we're stepping through and working diligently and collaboratively with agencies. We respect their work products. And as you likely anticipate, the crystal ball of Lam Research doesn't extend beyond the precision that we're kind of currently articulating. So we're doing the best we can to give you our best knowledge and we'll continue to make that commitment. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: And Martin, is customer feedback really important and do you feel like there is a difference here with what you guys are trying to do with KLA versus previous deals? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Maybe I don't want to get trapped in a comparison here. I will tell you what I've tried to communicate from the beginning here. Obviously, we're doing this for the benefit of our customers. We believe we can innovate more and contribute more value to our customers and support their technology and economic roadmaps with this transaction. We believe if we do that, there will be more opportunity for our company and hence all stakeholders benefit. So we believe passionately in that value proposition, and we spent a decent amount of time working the conversation indirectly and sometimes directly with our customers to make sure the strategic choices were lined up with their expectations. There's always an ebb and a flow and I'm sure every \u2013 one customer has a slightly different characterization of this. But I feel, as least as best as I can tell from my personal interactions with customers, there's much more support than not and much more interest in exploring innovation potentials. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. My first question was on 3D NAND. I appreciate 2017 is still a couple of quarters out but was curious how you guys were thinking about 3D NAND spend into next year. Are there enough projects out there? And is the mix broad-based, enough for you to predict another healthy year? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, I think if the \u2013 yeah \u2013 I'm going to stay away from quantitative again if I may, but qualitatively, we think this is probably one of the most healthy spaces in the semiconductor industry because there are some very compelling value propositions and growth opportunities for semiconductors with solid state drive technology particularly. So again \u2013 in any one quarter, there's an ebb and a flow precisely how it plays out, but broad industry commitment to this technology and very compelling growth opportunities as we characterized in our prepared comments today . Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up is on EUV. It seems like your customers are warming up to the idea of EUV insertion at the 7 nanometer node. Have you also sensed a slight change in tone as it relates to their approach to EUV? And it would also be helpful if you could help us understand how your opportunity in etch and dep would differ between a world with no EUV and perhaps some EUV? Thank you. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: A gentleman by the name of Peter Wennink is much more qualified to answer your question than I am. So, as we've said a number of times, we are invested in extending immersion and enabling EUV to the best of our abilities, so as an etch and deposition and clean company. And we believe that the inflection opportunities, multi-patterning opportunities in DRAM and logic for us extend into an EUV implementation. So when that happens, which we hope it does in the best interests of the semiconductor industry and our customers, we are there to support, and we believe the multi-patterning growth opportunity continues in that context. So no major tone comment from me at the customer interface because obviously we dialog much more about our business than ASML's. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you very much. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: You are welcome. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking the question. You, obviously, guided NAND to be little bit stronger this year. I just wanted to probe the linearity of NAND. Do you still see the NAND shipment has been primarily first half weighted? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: It's a little stronger in the first half than the second half, Farhan. It continues, though, to be quite strong as we look into the second half. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then, Doug, can you talk about how much of the cash is onshore versus offshore? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Well, it has materially changed. All of the $2.4 billion that we raised, obviously, is domestically available. Taking that out, the remaining balance sheet cash, it's still about 20% or 25%. As it pertains to funding the transaction, we have all the domestic cash that we need to complete the KLA-Tencor transaction. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. That's all I have. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Farhan. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go ahead next to Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Hi, Martin and Doug. Nice results. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Stephen. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Just a question on the customer concentration, it looks like Lam shipments to Southeast Asia were up a lot in the quarter. Was this region mostly one customer? And is Lam likely to see a different top three customer list every quarter? And it's basically just up to you to manage this quarterly customer lumpiness? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. There is primarily one big customer investing in Southeast Asia. That I'm sure you know who it is, Stephen. And, yeah, you're going to see variability quarter-to-quarter as these very large fab projects get undertaken. They will come in and then they will need to ramp and then another one will come in and they will need to ramp. And so you're going to get variability due to that. That's just the nature of this business. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I mean to the manage reference, I don't think we get chance to manage it. We are biased to give our customers what they need... Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: That's right. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: ...when they need it to the best of our abilities. And as Doug says many times, that that creates an up and a down, week-to-week, months-to-months, and quarter-to-quarter in every element of our financial statement, and it's tough for you we realize. Hopefully, you realize it's tough for us as well. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: And Stephen just one last comment on this. I mean, I always refer back to the public financial model that we put out there is the best way to kind of think about things over time. When we put that together, we did our best to, kind of, model some level of variability. It doesn't mean it's going to be exactly those numbers, but that's the right kind of medium to longer term way to think about it. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for sharing that color. My follow-up question is on shipments to logic customers. We saw Lam recently win a Preferred Quality Supplier award from Intel last year. Congratulations on that. But we still haven't seen a big inflection in Lam shipments to logic customers. Just curious, if you still see logic as a customer segment that you're confident you're taking market share from and maybe future upside? Thanks. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Absolutely, yes. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Definitively. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I told them one, Doug \u2013 I know you don't want to comment on December, but I'm just curious if December revenues are flat versus September, would the gross margins be up in December? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Again, I'm only guiding gross margin one quarter at a time. Usually \u2013 everything else equal, if you have a higher level of revenue, margins will tend to be better. But you got all the mix that I've always described. So you can't necessarily just run to that conclusion. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. All right. And then a follow-up for Martin. When you look at the 3D NAND as you go into like 64 layers, 96 layers and beyond, does the etching composition shift more towards dielectric etch versus conductor, or do you think conductor actually remains a major portion of the overall etch market in 3D NAND? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I don't think I have a segment message for you, more or less because I think the productivity solution set that will play out in high-volume manufacturing for the types of vertical scaling that you just described, have perhaps still a lot of work from the entire supply chain and also from the customer. So I would say watch this space, and if we see anything of value to communicate, we will. Again to reemphasize what I said in my prepared comments, the 2D to 3D transition for us was very strong with a 7 percentage point to 10 percentage point share gain for the company. Another, kind of, couple of data points that I would give you on 3D NAND for the company from a market share perspective. In general, the development tool of record decisions that translate into production tool of record decisions actually got stronger for us. And the other reference, I would give you is that obviously our presence in critical applications, which is really a commentary on quality of earnings is very, very strong. So we're right at the center of enabling, and that puts pressure on us but we feel really pleased about the position of the company. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Krish. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Martin, first in terms of the growing adoption for applications for both atomic layer deposition and etch, what's the market opportunity as a whole that you see for those type of products? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: That's something that, if I may, I'd like to defer to our analyst meeting planned for November because, to your point, atomic level processing \u2013 generally for us, atomic level etch and atomic level deposition is a very central part to the opportunity for growth in the company, and competitive differentiation and also quality of earnings. So I would prefer delay, if I may, until our November meeting on that point. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. And then maybe, for Doug, now that you're approaching record shipments, and obviously you've done a really good job up to this point with the high level shipments and probably a lot of pulls and pushes. Can you just discuss or give a little bit of color and some of the tactics, either whether it's the supply chain, manufacturing or how you're managing these record levels, especially as they keep growing? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: I mean as I talked about, we have added resources in the manufacturing organization. You've seen our inventory balances tick up a little bit in anticipation of very strong shipments. And I think specifically the reason Martin in his scripted remarks thanked our suppliers, is they've supported our ramps very, very well. We've been talking to them well in advance of them needing to grow their volumes so that they are going to be ready for this. And I think we've executed extraordinarily well and will continue to. You manage the churn as it happens. And we've got a great global operations group that is really good at what we do. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And thanks for taking my question. So in terms of foundry spending, it looks like the 28 nanometer and 40 nanometer and maybe 200 millimeter as well seems to have a longer life cycle because of low and mid range films phones. How do you think that changes your WFE forecast this year or next year? Or maybe it's just related to your service business, any way you can quantify it? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: I don't know if I'll give you as much as you want. I'll give you as much as you want. 28-nanometer looks to be a very long node. And we're seeing even some 40-nanometer investments occurring. I think it has somewhat to do with low and mid end phones for sure. It's got equal amount to do with kind of where IoT stuff is going and that is how we monetize some of the installed base business as well. We're looking at that very differently in terms of that opportunity. And you're right. Some of the stuff is even 200 millimeter equipment. So we're very focused on it. I don't know if that was what you're looking for. But 28-nanometer is going to be around for a while. Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. My follow-up question is curious about your thoughts on another deal in the space between litho company and a process control company. I guess from a KLA perspective, does that change in any way your thoughts on the combined company SAM expansion opportunity? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: No, I don't think it changes our objectives or our strategy. I think in many respects it probably validates the legitimacy of the vision to bring process and process control capability together at some level to innovate for the success of our customers. So it's another data point. There are others with other peer companies and other competitors. Sometimes it's an acquisitive action like the one you just refer to. Sometimes it's organic. There are plenty of examples now in our the industry where people are employing similar strategies. If your question maybe more relates to the competitive dynamic between e-beam and optical, our sense is that industry consensus is very complementary technologies. We're not obviously in a position to speak to KLA's business. But from the seat that we have with limited knowledge of the details, the latest generation optical inspection capabilities that KLA has brought to the market appear very robust and getting pretty solid traction. So, no real change in how we think about it, perhaps further validation of the vision. And to kind of restate what I said before, we're targeting to close this thing and we're working diligently with agencies to get that done. We never have any guarantees, but we're working hard to do that a little later than the September timeframe, targeting right now, mid-October. Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Sidney. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities : Hi. Yeah, thanks. Actually I had a similar question on the ASML-Hermes deal, but from a different angle, I was looking at it as an opportunity for Lam potentially given that you have a pretty tight relationship with ASML already and they are talking about doing pre-and post etch measurements and creating a holistic litho loop that extends into the process arena. So, I was just wondering, if you could maybe tell us how closely you're collaborating with ASML on this type of application, and if you think there's an opportunity to maybe gain market share, if you can drive customers to use more Lam tools in a holistic litho loop. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I think it's kind of premature for me to start talking about collaboration when we haven't actually closed our deal yet. But, obviously, to your point, the relationship between the companies is good and strong. We work diligently both to support the long-term success of our customers and I see that trend continuing. So, we all have some version of the same vision I think to deliver more predictable process to our customers, to open up process windows, to deliver their roadmaps with higher quality, lower cost IC devices, and whether we call that holistic litho or holistic etch or holistic dep or holistic process, we've all got our own nomenclature, but I think the strategy and the model of collaboration for our company is set to continue, I hope, for many years. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities : Got it. And then as a follow-up just looking at the model, guidance implies that OpEx would increase meaningfully next quarter. Just wondering if most of that falls into R&D and if you could give us an idea of what level of R&D increase you're looking at throughout the rest of the next fiscal year? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah, a decent amount of it, Wes, is R&D, and again the right way to think about how we're going to spend money is pinned on that financial model. Obviously as we grow, we need to invest more to continue to grow and that's part of how we think about it. In the back half of the year given a little bit stronger P&L, there's also a general increase in that variable compensation piece that varies with the P&L. Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities : That's helpful. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Just extending that answer a little bit further. I don't think we've ever invested more in the future of this company than we are today. I mean, I feel really good about the distribution of operating expenses to R&D and SG&A, I think we kind of set a tone. And whether we're the best in the industry or one of the best, I'm sure you guys can figure out but the 63% reference is something we worked hard for. If you look at the last several years since 2013, we have increased our investments in R&D by more than 30%. And in that same timeframe, the increase in investments in SG&A is about 10%. So, investing in the future of the company to prepare us for the inflections that we're describing, today's inflection is getting bigger and the next generation inflections central to long term success for the company. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Okay. Perfect. Our last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yep. Thanks. Glad I stuck in over there. I guess, first off on the KT transaction, could you just talk about what are the concerns that you're hearing from regulators, because the deal seems fairly complementary and no real overlap. I'm curious what's the feedback you're getting. And is there anyone other than the DOJ that's giving you negative feedback or concerns on the deal? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. We're not really in a position to talk about the conversations we're having with regulators. I mean, the essence of this deal, as I said a couple of times, is no product overlap. We believe a compelling and pro-competitive value proposition for the benefit of our customers. We have made broad commitments to the ecosystem relative to supply and availability in support of process control equipments. And the protocols around intellectual property protection are well established in this industry and the company. So, I mean those are the qualitative statements I can make around your question. But the specifics of our dialog with agencies unfortunately we're not at liberty to dialog about. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Understood. And if I just follow up, if get your comments on the back half shipments right, I mean, you're implying December could be down modestly. Is that essentially just a pause that you're seeing maybe on the 3D NAND side, or is something else driving that shipment down in December, and I get it could be lumpy but I'm curious what's the driver this time around in December. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I wouldn't describe it as a pause. I mean there is just a \u2013 every customer has their own cycle of investment. And they can't continue to jam tons of capacity into their fabs like forever so they add and then they pause a little bit, but there's no generic kind of industry cycle type pause commentary that we can make. And frankly I don't think we'll ever be able to make. I think the industry is very different today as a result of consolidation. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. It's just timing of projects. I mean it's nothing more than that. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you. Satya Kumar - Lam Research Corp.: Operator? Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now hand the program back over to Satya Kumar for any additional or closing remarks. Satya Kumar - Lam Research Corp.: Yes. Thank you everyone for joining our conference call. Our Analyst Day is scheduled for November 16. Do make a note of that. We've issued a press release on that. Thanks once again. Operator : And that does conclude today's program. We'd like to thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day, and you may disconnect at any time",

And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Good afternoon and thank you all for joining our regularly schedules earnings conference call. Anticipating our upcoming investor and analyst meeting plan for New York on November 18, I will keep my prepared comments shorter than usual. The focus today will include financial, operational and market highlights for the September quarter and calendar year 2016; an update on recent changes in the industry environments; and initial perspectives we have on calendar 2017. Doug will then provide details of our financials and summarize guidance for the December quarter before we open the call for questions.  Demonstrating the constancy of our focus, quality of alignments in the company and commitments to invest in the future of the company for these last several years, Lam delivered another outstanding quarter reporting record shipments including a record high foundry shipments, record total company revenues and non-GAAP net income. As is always the case, how you do something is at least as important as what you do more so in the context of our multiyear growth and value aspirations. Accordingly, we have a permanent focus on customer oriented core values and culture, and an extraordinary commitment to operational execution and company scaling. Our supply chain, our factories, our field service organizations once again delivered terrific performance. We achieved a new record for shipments in the quarter. We are on track to deliver our customers a combination of schedule flexibility and on-time performance for the year that is a significant enhancement of capabilities. And as shown by our guidance today, we are gearing up for an additional growth in December. Our differentiated product pipeline momentum continues apace most recently with metal ALD in 3D NAND and atomic level etch in dielectric foundry applications. In addition, our business teams are achieving more than 90% success in critical defenses and new market application penetrations combined which is extremely rewarding. This is an exciting time to be part of the semiconductor ecosystem, no doubt. In the world of foundry logic, the demonstrated performance benefits of 10-nanometer technology and commitments of our customers and reportedly more than 20 of their customers to the near-term seven 7-nanometer are strong endorsements of the diversity of cloud mobility and high-performance computing enabled consumer and enterprise applications. What is clear in this segment also is the importance of 3-D architecture at both the chip and systems integration level. Innovation in our technology and product roadmap for the transistor, interconnect and also advanced packaging applications is a critical priority for systematically strengthening our strategic relevance. We believe Lam is one of very few companies gaining share through this round of foundry logic technology node transitions. Our segment exposure continues to be more balanced and an objective in results we are particularly pleased with. Worthy of note in a world where we estimate foundry wafer fabrication equipment spending grows 25% year-over-year 2016 compared to 2015, we are communicating to you today with our presented results and December guidance a view that our foundry shipments for the year increase by approximately 40%. Illustratively, 48 layer 3D NAND is enabling the 256 gigabytes high density storage that is required to power high resolution image capture and dual cameras in smartphone devices. Similarly in the data center, 3D NAND-based SSDs allow for hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage to be located within the server itself enabling cost-efficient scale from cloud-based services. Looking ahead, the roadmap is well-defined and looks very promising for 3D NAND. At the recent Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara, our customers highlighted the numerous design and integration options not previously available with Planar technologies such as scaling layer accounts and the ability to transition from three-level cells to quad little cells and leveraging pitch and density scaling to target different storage end markets. Lam was privileged to be the only major semiconductor equipment maker invited to present at the conference, independent recognition of our critical role in the 3D NAND deflection and the commentary both on the opportunity and responsibility for Lam that is shared with our customers. Long-term WFE growth is only made possible with end market demand catalysts and process technology inflections. Combined with these two drivers, our roadmap and multiyear execution make possible the fifth consecutive year in 2016 where our SAM has outperformed WFE. Looking forward, we have targets and strategies that we will specifically discuss in November to enable and participate in these outperformance trends for many years to come. Our ability to capitalize on this extraordinary opportunity is all about leadership execution and is measured ultimately by customer trust and competitive differentiation. As illustrations, in conductor edge, our keel family with its hydra multizone temperature control technology provides the most technically advanced production proven etching performance critical for logic and DRAM multi-patterning in the industry. Lam has the broadest and strongest conductor edge position especially in 3D NANDs were [7:42] has now been qualified before production at all NAND customers for a majority of applications which we believe achieved position in more than two thirds of the available market. In dielectric etch, we continue to make several technology and productivity enhancements to our Flex family including most recently the release of atomic level etch capability. Our ALE innovation features a proprietary advanced mixed mode pulsing capability, delivers a 2x improvement in selectivity versus conventional etching while providing atomic level control over variability critical to address issues like RC delay for advanced foundry and logic process nodes. The Flex series products are seeing substantial momentum in 3D NAND and are now qualified as production toll of record for critical high aspect ratio applications at all major customers. In deposition, our ALTUS tungsten fill and VECTOR dielectric deposition systems are seeing very strong momentum that is set to continue into next year. 2017 will be the year of 64 layer 3D NAND and Lam\u2019s product innovations and application share momentum position us well to improve our market share as we head into next year. Complementing our leading edge and critical applications strength, the performance of more than 40,000 Lam process modules installed provides a strong platform for overall business momentum and is a key focus of our customer support business group. This business is on track for another record year. More important than reported growth in any one year, however, is the increased confidence of sustaining long-term profitable growth trajectory of the company. In the last several years, we have fundamentally improved our capability to support our customers through local manufacturing and warehousing, innovative technology and productivity upgrade solutions, refurbished equipment sales and service, and product solutions to overall fab productivity improvements. These investments are paying dividends again more to follow at our investor event.  Now let me provide a short overview of customer equipment spending trends for calendar 2016 and our preliminary expectations for 2017. Outlook for global economic growth in unit shipments for PCs and smartphones have remained stable since our last report. Increasingly, more important than unit demand for traditional consumer computing devices however is a significant growth in content for leading-edge memory and logic devices in smartphones and servers. This dynamic is being driven by the end market demand inflections I spoke of earlier and is powering our SAM growth outperformance opportunity. WFE spending for 2016 is now tracking slightly above the high end of our previously communicated range driven by stronger foundry and 3D NAND CapEx investments. Sequentially for calendar 2016, NAND WFE is now on track to grow over 40%, foundry over 20%, and expectations for DRAM CapEx remain unchanged at down approximately 40% year-over-year. Momentum and commitments continues to build for 3D NAND where we now expect total industry shipped capacity to reach approximately 425,000 wafer starts per month by the end of this calendar year. We are confident of sustainable positive long-term trends in this segment. At the same time, our strength in Foundry logic continues to build where we are realizing the benefits of multiyear efforts through customer spending associated with additional qualifications and PTR wins for 10 and 7 nanometer devices. Despite the challenges of DRAM and certain pockets of logic spending in 2016, despite also the memory versus logic segment headwinds for the company relative to our peers this year. We are on track to grow total company shipments meaningfully for the fifth straight calendar year at a CAGR of approximately 18% over that extended period. As we look into 2017, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in 3D NAND. For numerous reasons, we are also more convinced and convicted in our belief that DRAM supply and demand conditions will continue to improve as we previously indicated. As a result, we have an upward bias to spending expectations for DRAM and NAND in 2017. We expect flat to a modest pullback in logic foundry spending as customers digest the 10 nanometer investments made in 2016 and commence initial 7 nanometer roadmaps. Overall, we are modeling slightly higher total WFE spend in 2017 with memory versus logic segment tailwinds for the company once more. Again, our objective will be to outgrow WFE in 2017. To summarize, fundamental to our strong performance has been our strategy to partner closely with our customers to help address their most tough and difficult challenges. Despite as we conveyed a couple of weeks ago, the disappointment at not being able to deliver to our customers the potential of unmatched capability and innovation from Lam and KLA-Tencor combined, we are very excited by the demonstrated multiyear strength and inflection-driven outperformance future opportunity for Lam Research. With continued execution, a robust product pipeline, overall stronger install base and market share positions, and increased strategic relevance to our customers, we believe the innovation to support long-term value creation for all stakeholders is a valid ambition for Lam Research. Before turning the call over for additional details on our financial performance and outlook, I would like to extend my genuine thanks to our customers and employees who together make the exciting story of Lam Research possible. Their support and encouragement inspires us each day to achieve our full potential. Doug? Doug Bettinger : Okay, thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. The September quarter results reflect another quarter of solid execution and record results. In the quarter, shipments, revenue, net income and cash from operations were at the highest level we delivered in the history of Lam Research. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter. Shipments in the September quarter were $1.78 billion, up approximately 8% compared to the June quarter and at a record level for the company. The combined memory segment made up 56% of system shipments and that was down from 66% in the prior quarter. Non-volatile memory shipments contributed 43% of the system shipments and this was down from 51% in the June quarter. 3D NAND investments are continuing at a healthy level with customers committed to their plans for scaling the technology to reduce cost, enhance performance and increase output in response to strong customer demand. Our deposition net products are critical to enabling the scaling for customers. We are extremely well-positioned with the PQR decision made by our customers and what may be the largest multiyear growth opportunity in semiconductors. Customer discipline remains intact in the DRAM segment with shipments making up 13% of total system shipments, compared to 15% in the prior quarter. There appears to be a stabilization of the supply demand balance and we are seeing positive momentum in the marketplace as a result. Demand is strengthening, but by content growth in both smart phones and servers. Spot pricing is showing improvement. System shipments into the foundry segment was a bright spot as Martin mentioned and increased to 36%, which was up from 27% in the June quarter. The system shipment dollars in foundry represented a record high level for Lam Research. Foundry spend was bias toward investments to execute 10 nanometer ramp and 7 nanometer pilot projects. We also saw continued spend predominantly in the China region at the 28 nanometer and above nodes. And finally the logic and other segment came in at 8% of system shipments up from 7% in the June quarter. Logic spending was largely in support of conversions to the 10 nanometer node. We set a new record for revenue in the September quarter. Revenue came in at $1.632 billion, which was a sequential increase of 6% and a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was a little lower than the midpoint of guidance at 45.2%. As I previously stated, we expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in our gross margin due to factors like business volumes and mix. And I'll remind you, the financial model is the best reference to help you analyze our ongoing financial performance. And I look forward to sharing an update to the financial model with you at our Investor Day in November. Our operating expenses for the quarter were $372 million, which was an increase of 3% from the $361 million in the June quarter and it held steady at about 23% of revenue. OpEx spending allocated to R&D was again at benchmark levels of 63% of total spending in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was again strong at $366 million, an increase of 2% compared to the $359 million in the June quarter. Operating margin decreased slightly to 22.4% down from 23.2% in the prior quarter primarily due to the lower gross margins. The September quarter tax rate came in at approximately 12%, which was a little bit higher than the 10% rate last quarter primarily due to changes in the level and mix of jurisdictional income. A rate in the low to mid teens for the December quarter would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling. Earnings per share for the September quarter were $1.81 based on a share count of approximately 178 million shares. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes and the remaining 2016 convertible note warrants with a total dilutive impact of about 15 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. As the stock price continues to rise, the convertible notes will continue to add to the diluted share count albeit at a decreasing rate of increase. Dilution schedules for the convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling. We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. There were no share repurchases during the quarter. Let me now turn to the balance sheet. At the end of the September quarter, we had $7.47 million in cash on the balance sheet. In line with the plans we stated during our call earlier this month, at this point we have redeemed the $600 million 2023 senior notes and the $1 billion 2026 senior notes under the special mandatory redemption provision of those notes. The $800 million 2021 senior notes will remain outstanding and will be used for general corporate purposes and other purposes as can be found in the prospectus. If our pro forma for the cash we returned to bondholders in October, we would have finished the quarter with $5.83 billion on the balance sheet. Roughly 40% of this cash is currently domestically available. And I will remind you, we continue to generate between 20% and 25% of cash domestically on an ongoing basis. Cash generation continues to be healthy at the company. In the September quarter, we generated $473 million in cash from operations, which was an increase of 12% sequentially and an all-time quarterly high for the company. Days sales outstanding for the period improved to 72 days from 74 days with the shipment profile slightly more linear than it was in June. Inventory turns improved from 3.5 times to 3.9 times. At the end of the September quarter, the deferred revenue balance was $704 million, a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter. That number excludes approximately $65 million from shipments to customers in Japan that will convert to revenue in future quarters. And I'll remind you that those Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on the balance sheet. Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following : $39 million for equity compensation, $39 million for amortization, and $36 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $42 million, which was down from $52 million in the June quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately 7,800 regular full-time employees. We added headcount during the quarter primarily to meet customer needs for additional factory output and field support. Additionally, we added resources to continue our investment in product development. Let me now turn to our outlook for the December quarter. I'd like to provide the following non-GAAP guidance. We expect shipments of $1.85 billion plus or minus $75 million. We expect revenue of $1.84 billion again plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 46% plus or minus 1 percentage point. We are forecasting operating margins of 25% plus or minus plus 1 percentage point. And finally, we forecast earnings per share of $2.18 plus or minus $0.10 based on a share count of approximately 170 million shares. This earnings-per-share number excludes roughly $37 million associated with the interest expense, one-time fees and accelerated cost associated with the retirement of the 2023 and 2026 notes as well as the term loan commitments. With our year-to-date results and the strong guidance I just provided for the December quarter, we anticipate that calendar year 2016 will be another record year of financial outperformance for the company, a fifth consecutive year of growth outpacing that of the industry as a whole. Before transitioning to the Q&A session, I wanted to pick up on Martin's earlier comment regarding our Investor Day, which is now on November 18. We\u2019ve decided to host the event in New York to make the event more convenient for a larger group of investors and analysts that are following the company. We look forward to seeing you in New York on the 18th. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. Martin, first one is, if I look at your December guidance compared to the model that you guys have given in the past, it looks like the quarterly WFE is running at close to $37 billion, $38 billion. You guys are annualizing at well over $8 in EPS. Is it fair to assume that next year is really going to be a modest growth to the extent you can characterize it, should we assume sequentially in the next couple of quarters should decline from the December quarter? And I also had a follow-up. Martin Anstice : Krish, as is customary for us, we really don't comment specifically about quarter to quarter transitions and inflections. What we\u2019ve tried to provide some perspective on today are some very significant and underpinning market references for you and for us as a company and whether it's a very favorable outlook relative to a universally adopted 3D NAND transition at this point or perhaps more specifically to the company, our share momentum in logic and in foundry, we feel like the objectives for the company that are currently defined by the long-term financial model, we are executing kind of well within that, maybe a little ahead of that and certainly the expectations we have at this point for calendar 2017 slightly stronger with a bias to memory compared to this year, which bodes well for outperformance for Lam. Krish Sankar : Got it. And as a follow-up if I can ask on 3D NAND, if you look at the NAND install base, it\u2019s about 1.4 million wafer starts and you guys said exiting this year 3D NAND will be at 425,000 wafers. If 3D NAND is going to help replace hard disk drives eventually is the potential install base larger than the 1.4 million that we have or had for planar or the fact that 3D has more density or bits in a given wafer it actually offsets the actual install base growth over time? I'm just kind of curious to your view point on that. Martin Anstice : I think our viewpoint is a bit of both. I mean there's density on wafer for sure, but our view is even in the time horizon of calendar 2017, we end calendar 2017 with more wafer starts than we began the year. And just in context, the 700 reference that I think most people have for next year now when they describe the shift 3D NAND capacity by the end of calendar 2017, that 700 probably qualified as 600, that 600 is probably no more than 40% of the install base as 3D NAND capable. So we are in the very early stages of a multiyear transition and we think that's a pretty compelling part of the Lam Research story. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead. Stephen Chin : Great, thanks. Congrats on the execution Martin and Doug. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Stephen. Stephen Chin : Just a follow-up question on the shipment, so the second half of this year shipments looks like they will end up 17% higher than the first half. I remember when you first looked at the second half of this year, you thought it was going to be flat and it improved over the last few quarters. Can you share any color on how you see the first half of 2017 versus the second half of this year? Martin Anstice : On the basis that I think from the beginning of this year, I was the idiot of the industry that was talking about the stronger second half. I'm going to reserve judgment and claim that it's too early to have commentary on the first and second half next year. I mean we\u2019ve kind of put on the table for you, a reference for higher WFE, I think, it's kind of modest. It's probably a single-digit increment year-over-year and there are a lot of moving parts that could potentially make it a very evenly distributed year, make it first half a little stronger and make it second half a little stronger. So, more \u2013 more maybe in the analyst meeting, much more \u2013 likely more commentary on first half, second half early next year. Stephen Chin : Okay, thanks. And then just a question on customer concentration. Can you just share your early thoughts on the December quarter shipments? How it looks, memory versus foundry logic? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Stephen, it's Doug. I think both are continued to be relatively strong in the next quarter. Stephen Chin : Okay, thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Operator : And we will take our next question from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess two questions for me as well. To follow-up, if you think WFE is going to up modest, call it, 2%, 3% or so next year. Could you just maybe help us understand what do you think your SAM or your revenue opportunity would look like in that scenario where WFE is up 2% to 4%? Martin Anstice : We got kind of a couple of ways to answer that. One of them is take a look at the long-term financial model that will be updated in November for you at least as far as kind of giving you at least another year of visibility in terms of our expectations. Another reference for the company is the stated ambition from a market share growth perspective. So we've got two references for you, we've got the long-term market share growth with 3 to 5 percentage point references, we\u2019ve talked about many times 1 to 2 percentage points through technology nodes and there's also a commentary on SAM expansion. And the headline for the company, if you go back to a 2012 reference point is, we had a portfolio of products that was competing for about 25% or so of wafer fabrication equipment spending. That's in the 33%, 34% range probably this year and we expect in excess of 35% to be the competitive reference point for us, the proportion of WFE that we're competing for with our portfolio next year. Some part of that is a commentary on the product portfolio of the company as we invest and make available more product to our customers and some part of it is the technology inflection in patterning and 3D NAND, which has a natural bias to the etch and deposition segments of WFE. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. That's helpful. If I can just follow-up, the December quarter guide obviously very strong in revenue and shipment, I'm curious do you feel there\u2019s some little pull that's going on maybe in the memory side from your customers for their CapEx plans and that's why they are somewhat better or is this just a reflection of good end demand, doesn\u2019t mean March will be down more dramatically than normal? Martin Anstice : It's kind of really hard to kind give opinion on kind of pull or push. I mean the reality is the year is a little stronger than we expected when we last talked to you in our earnings call and it's a little stronger in 3D NAND and also in foundry. So if that's your definition of kind of pull and I guess the answer to your question is yes. But are we communicating to you an expectation that this is pull that is over exuberant and it\u2019s a risk of creating a whole shortly, I think the answer to that question is no. We see compelling value propositions in 3D NAND and compelling value propositions in the 10 and 7 nanometer logic foundry investments. They are going to go up and down a little bit quarter to quarter and pull in and push out, but fundamentally the long-term headline is the most relevant one as far as the value of our company is concerned. Doug Bettinger : And that's why we suggested that to you we see next year a little bit stronger as well. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. That's perfect. Thank you, guys. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Amit. Operator : We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question trying to, I guess, dig a little bit deeper into the 3D NAND side and curious when you think about greenfield versus conversions in calendar 2016 and your current outlook for calendar 2017, is that a headwind or a tailwind for you particularly when you think about next year being a year really for 64 layer count? Martin Anstice : I don't know C.J., it's terrifically difficult to answer a question like that, it has so many moving parts. This year is a headwind most significantly because of memory and logic foundry kind of spend mix for the company. At a 3D NAND level, the story is really positive for the company in conversions and vertical scaling, but it's also really positive compared to overall WFE and greenfield as well. So probably it gets a little bit better as people step from greenfield to conversion, but it's really hard to give you a simple answer to a very complex modeling question. C.J. Muse: Okay. I guess I'll take a stab with second one then. Deferred revenues have grown considerably over the last year and just curious I guess as part of that, does that really speak to your new products and new wins and timing of revenue rack and as part of that when you think you'll start to catch up and will see that flow through to the revenue line? Martin Anstice : Yeah, C.J. a little bit of it might be some aspect in new products, but more importantly it's a fact that we've been growing shipments fairly consistently and when you have a profile where shipments are on a growth trajectory, deferred revenue typically builds and revenue lags as a result. When shipments level off, you will see revenue then catch up with shipments. So that's the way you should expect that the fact that shipments have been outpacing revenue is why deferred revenue was built. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks C.J. Operator : We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you very much. I guess I have two questions. First for Doug, really on cash, it seems like there's maybe $1 billion worth of excess onshore cash today and if I look at your free cash flow, you are going to probably generate $1.5 billion roughly a year and that would imply maybe another $350 million to $400 million of onshore coming per year and only half of that is being consumed by your dividend. So clearly you have a lot of flexibility there on the cash. Can you talk about how you think about repurchases versus dividend? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Tim, why don\u2019t you come see me on November 18, I'll give you some clarity at that point. I don't have anything to tell you until then. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. All right, thanks. And then I guess, Martin, I'm going to try to come at this wafer run rate question a little bit differently. This year if the WFE is going to be $34 billion, which is now what you're saying, you're going to be about 18.5% share, that\u2019s flat despite a very difficult year in DRAM, so that's great for you. But if I use the 18.5% number in your guidance in Q4, it implies that the industry is run rating WFE at roughly $40 billion in the fourth calendar quarter, which is a pretty heavy number. So I guess my question is, do you argue with that math on where the WFE run rate is for Q4? I'm just trying to see how shipments can't come down here even if the next year is good WFE year? Martin Anstice : I guess one of the advantages of the gray hair I have is I know how to answer that question now. So I don't even try to argue or defend or rationalize or justify because as we\u2019ve said many times, Tim, we understand our SAM really well. We understand our share of SAM really well. We don't understand frankly speaking the SAM of \u2013 the rest of the industry for products that we don't have and we just kind of back into a WFE reference to the best of our abilities. So I don't really have an ability to kind defend, argue, answer a question about WFE because it's just kind of an extension of a very well thought through SAM and quite exactly what the cycles of spending are for other parts and quite exactly what their pricing strategies are, I guess you got to ask everybody in industry to kind of pull it all together. Our view is the best one we\u2019ve articulated. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, Martin, thanks. You guys are usually very good at WFE, so that's why I asked. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks. Martin Anstice : No problem, Tim. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Farhan Ahmad : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on NAND. In terms of your planar NAND -- in terms of the planar NAND install base, it\u2019s about 70% of the overall capacity, what kind of productivity improvement or bit growth are you seeing on that install base? And is it fair to assume that the vast majority of bit growth going forward needs to come from 3D NAND? Martin Anstice : I think yes is the answer to that question. I'm sure every customer in the world is working to make more productive their planar capacity particularly in the context at the end of this year the majority of the install base for NAND is still a planar capable investment. But certainly I think kind of the growth of the industry and the chosen technology that is now kind of universally adopted has the focus on 3D NAND. Doug Bettinger : On 3D, yeah, for sure. Farhan Ahmad : Got it. And then just one question in terms of how the WFE is tracking for last couple of years versus the semi-revenue growth, I mean, last year semi-gap companies were all up, close to double digit, if you combine all the revenues and this year also it\u2019s like very healthy growth and next year is also very healthy growth and we haven't seen that much semi-revenue growth. Have you thought about like what's the main drivers, which are giving you more of the growth related to the semi-industry? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I mean, at a company level, obviously, there are two basic headlines. One of them is the proportion of WFE that we're competing for, which to my earlier answer is kind of transitioned from the 25% level to the 35% level since 2012. So we're competing for $3 billion more business each year if you just want to pick a $30 billion WFE reference. We're competing for $3.5 billion if you want to pick a $35 billion reference. And some part of that is a product portfolio message to the company and some part of it is the technology inflection the patterning and 3D NAND or 3D device architecture transitions for the industry. That's kind of message number one. And message number two is share gain. And we've had some pretty significant messages on share gain. We talk to you in our last earnings call, if my memory serves me right about double-digit share gain in the planar to 3D NAND transition and we\u2019ve talked today about a fairly unique story we think in the industry in the logic and foundry space at least as best we can analyze were one of very few companies that has demonstrated share gain in logic foundry combined in recent technology node transitions and we are just beginning to see the evidence of that show up in our financial statements. Farhan Ahmad : Thank you. That's all I have. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Farhan. Operator : We will take our next question from Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone. Jagadish Iyer : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Martin, if I take your NAND shipments this year, give or take you are up like almost about 75% and if bit growth for next year is similar to this year and I layer in your commentary on spending, how should we think about your growth in NAND shipments as you look at 2017 given where your market share is and where the industry is transitioning to 64 layer and will it be consistent with this year or could it be higher or lower? Martin Anstice : Well, I mean the overall kind of story for the company in 3D NAND, we are targeting to be more positive proportionately next year than this year and that's a commentary on our best understanding of the conversion strategies of our customers and our targets and plans to systematically introduce more products to compete for more SAM and to make more competitive the products that we have to get a bigger share of it. Now there are no kind of pendulum swings in this industry, it's pretty rare that you accomplish major swings in any one year. And so I think the performance of the company will be a continuation if we keep executing of the last couple of years and that continues to be our focus. Jagadish Iyer : Okay. I have a brief follow-up. You talked about foundries trying to digest some capacity for 2017, clearly there is one leader there, but how should we think about other foundries trying to catch up to this preeminent leader here to as they try to ramp to 10 or 7 nanometer? Thank you. Martin Anstice : Yeah, I mean, obviously, you have to ask them not us, but clearly the opportunity that exists from demonstrated performance benefits at the 10 and 7 nanometer technology nodes make it a very strategic and legitimate target for every foundry and certainly from the seat we have. Everybody is focused on doing their best to get their fair share, however, they define that technology inflection and none of this is easy, and so we support all of our customers and whatever ambition they have to the best of our abilities. So I sense people are broadly focused on it in doing the best they can. Doug Bettinger : I would just point out that we're continuing to see nice investment profiles at 28-nanometer and above, and obviously that stuff is much broader based. Jagadish Iyer : Thank you. Operator : I\u2019ll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Romit Shah : Yes, thank you and congratulations on the strong results. Martin, I just wanted to ask as it relates to China, we've been all looking for evidence that the local vendors there will start spending in both foundry and memory, and I just wanted to get your sense on that region and if it's something you're anticipating to at least hear about it as we get into next year? Martin Anstice : Yes I think for sure there are ambitious plans stated and there are active discussions I think between customers and potential new domestic customers in China with Lam and presumably with every other equipment company. Our position and presence in China is historically very strong in etch and deposition both. I think we have kind of good platform and as best we can tell there are up to 20 active projects certainly that we are focused on tracking in China and I think the spending or at least the significant spending is more likely to be a calendar 2018 statement then calendar 2017 but I think there's a decent amount of statements that towards the end of 2017 we could start seeing something emerge. So that's the best I can give you at this point. Romit Shah : That's helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Romit. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Edwin Mok : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to ask back on your foundry logic share gain that you talked about and maybe take a little deeper and can you kind of give us some color where your driving the share gain? Is it on the \u2013 you guys have been very strong patenting, is that one area that is driving share gain? Is it around other area I think it is working very strong in tungsten maybe give us some color one step more detail color around the share gain around foundry logic? Martin Anstice : I think you just did a pretty job answering your own question. Clearly, the single biggest SAM expansion in foundry logic is patenting. We got some pretty important headlines that a company unique I think relative to microprocessor share gain momentum. And our presence in share gain our both etch and deposition and they are frontend and back end as far as interconnect as well as [indiscernible] footprint. So pretty holistic, pretty comprehensive and patenting is obviously a key driver. Edwin Mok : Okay, great. And then just a focus on the foundry logic area as well, I think some of your peers are more upbeat about the coming year thinking foundry logic to grow little more and you mentioned some digestion on 10 millimeter. Do you think that trade of nature growth will not be big enough to offset any digestion in 10 millimeter and some of the customer need to spend too much, do you think they won't be a big spender in 2017? Martin Anstice : I say our view and it's still forming. We are a long way from being definitive on it. We said kind of flattish to maybe slightly down is the reference we have for Foundry. We do expect that 28 nanometer and above investments in 2017 will be greater than they were in 2016, but to your point, that's a capacity addition that is much cheaper than a leading-edge capacity addition. Whether it turns out to be sufficient to make a neutral or grow kind of time will tell. As best I can tell from customer disclosure, there's kind of a common view that capital intensity in foundry is assumed to be kind of flattish and certainly we are not a position to message any different from that. There's clearly a large amount of investment going in this year for 10 and commitments and significant interest in what I think now is generally accepted to be more valuable and probably more significant technology now to 7 and that looks like that's more of a second-half statement than first half at this point. Doug Bettinger : It\u2019s still kind of early for us to have a formulated view on 2017 as we get closer to 2017 itself and we would normally give you more color when we are a quarter further down the road, so check back with us in a quarter, we will give you an updated view. Edwin Mok : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Hi, thank you. I had a couple of questions on smaller product areas. Can you talk about events packaging, seems like we're starting to see some more consumer-oriented products coming out again in the end of this year, could that be a decent driver for you guys next year? Martin Anstice : Well, certainly systems integration and packaging are very prominent parts of the strategies of our customers to overcome the limitations of physics in the frontend. And I think demonstrated performance and cost benefits showing up there. It's one of four technology inflections that we identified three or four years ago now that are relevant to the future of our company. It was then and still is the smaller of the four, but as time passes the through-silicon via etch position and strength that we have becomes more valuable and obviously the presence of the company in interconnect, copper position is also very strong. So over time I would expect the advanced packaging SAM to be more relevant and I think you know from prior disclosure where we are strong and where we are not. Joe Moore : Great thank you. And also on the image sensors side, have you seen any signs of life, signs of recovery in that segment? Thank you. Martin Anstice : I would say not as strong right now as it has been but reasonable evidence that strength is beginning to emerge. So whether that's the first half or second half kind of reality, we will see. Joe Moore : Great. Thanks so much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Joe. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. Weston Twigg : Hi, thanks. Just wondering first on DRAM, you said you expected DRAM WFE to be up a little bit next year. Wondering if you're seeing any signs of new DRAM capacity activity or really just no transitions at this point? Martin Anstice : I think it\u2019s more of a no transition statements. I mean arguably there are kind of 50,000 wafer starts per month contractions in one year and maybe additions in another year. And if I were to place a bet I would say we probably end next year at or about the same in terms of wafer starts that we began the year. But as you know, this has been a year of significantly reduced spending. Our estimate is the DRAM investment is down 40% this year. By the end of this year, we believe that approximately 50% of the installed base is 20-nanometer capable. So there's a pretty significant opportunity for value creation for the customers in terms of cost-reduction and performance from continued conversion. And as is also true, the 1x world for DRAM is just beginning in calendar 2016 and we think we will be the primary change to the installed base in calendar 2017. And if I were to guess, I would guess that at the end of next year about half of the installed base in DRAM is the 20-nanometer, maybe a quarter of the installed base is 1x and a quarter of the installed base is 25 or above. So I think that's approximate segmentation of the 1.1 million wafer starts depending on how you calculate it is kind of what we're looking at right now. Weston Twigg : Okay, good. And then similarly in 3D NAND, you said WFE was up and you mentioned 700,000 installed wafer starts by the end of next year but do you see that number biased higher as well the way things are tracking? Martin Anstice : I said just on the 700, I said that was kind of the shift capacity statement that we're coming up with and I\u2019m seeing other people say the same thing slightly above 700 and that compares with the 425 that I referred to today in my prepared comments for the end of calendar 2016. And our estimate is that probably there's about 100 or slightly more than 100,000 wafer starts unqualified at the end of this year, probably a similar number at the end of next year and obviously that exists in the context of 1.5 million wafer starts per month of capacity by the end of next year. So a little bit more capacity and a lot more 3D NAND but in relative terms still 3D NAND installed base is the minority of the installed base by the end of next year. Weston Twigg : All right, very helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, West. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and I thought I'd jump on the quarterly execution and on the outlook. On your view on DRAM spending being higher next year, clearly the customer base here remains pretty disciplined, very focused on profitability. I appreciate the view from the prior question on the capacity in 2x versus 1x. Can you guys just remind us your SAM growth going from 2x node to the 1x nanometer node and what application is that SAM growth coming from? Martin Anstice : I'm not sure I have something to hands to answer that question, Harlan. I apologize. Obviously at a macro level when we last reported our $3 billion SAM reference, we framed the SAM growth opportunity in DRAM at the 50% to 60% level through calendar 2018. And in the patenting area specifically which is the single biggest kind of market expansion in DRAM that's relevant to our company, we characterized 15 to 25 steps at 20-nanometer going to 25 to 30 steps at 1x. So that's about as helpful as they can be at this moment and we will take that question as long as well as I think it was CJ's question earlier around the SAM for each of the three NANDs implementation scenarios and we will try to get some more information for you at the analyst meeting. Doug Bettinger : We will update that page for you, Harlan. Harlan Sur : All right, thanks for the insights there. And then on the record shipment outlook, I'm wondering if you're starting to structure manufacturing capability. As I think about the potential for more growth for the team in 2017 I'm wondering if you can just give us a view on what is the upper limit from a shipment dollars perspective that you can accommodate from a manufacturing perspective on a quarterly basis. Martin Anstice : Yes. We actually have more flexibility than perhaps you realize. It takes a huge amount of effort so these are not kind of five minute investments. We are constantly assessing not just capacity in our own factories but our supply chain and in our field service organizations for the installation because if you can make something we can\u2019t install it you have a problem, if you can install it but not make it you have a problem, if you can make it but not buy it you have a problem. A lot of effort focused on that. We have nor will we ever have disclosure that speaks to the maximum capacity of the company but it is more flexible. We are challenging and stretching the entire company to be honest, but we believe we are executing with appropriate discipline and we are making investments to make sure that we have capacity to meet the expectations of our customers and continue to position the company for sustainable growth. So lots of moving parts, very complex, but we feel like we are doing a pretty good job all things considered. Martin Anstice : Yeah, Harlan, we have a phenomenal supply chain organization. These guys are just super good at what they do. So the execution of the company has been really, really good from those guys. Harlan Sur : Thanks for the insights. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : We will take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. I just had one on gross margins. I appreciate the quarter to quarter volatility here, but I was hoping you could discuss a little bit more what drove the slight miss in Q3? And for the current quarter you're guiding gross margins to improve marginally despite a pretty big revenue number. Is this as good as it gets from a gross margin perspective or is there a leverage left in the model? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Toshiya, I would just point you back to the existing disclosed financial model, it\u2019s the best way to be thinking about the company and, obviously, I will give you an update on that when we get to November 18. We are not going to apologize for a 30 basis point -- slight below midpoint on gross margin, it\u2019s really hard with all the moving parts and different customer mix, things you have going on, there is always going to be variability. And we\u2019ve been pretty consistently in that 45 to mid-46 gross margin range and that's kind of where the business runs. It runs pretty effectively. Martin Anstice : I think in context again just to kind of put some more substance around what Doug just said, our long-term model for calendar 2015 and 2016 in a world of $35 billion WFE, which we think is greater than the world\u2019s we are actually living in. We said we would aim for $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion revenue range. The sum of our quarter results and guidance are at $6.3 billion. So, at a revenue level, there's commentary on SAM and share, we are performing higher than we indicated in our long-term financial model. In terms of targeted profitability levels, which includes gross margin and the investments in operating expenses and as we said many times, our focus more is [59:30] and gross margin. Our long-term model said, we were targeting a 22 percentage point operating income and the sum of the results and guidance we\u2019ve just given a 23%. The long-term model also said there was a range of EPS targeted between $6 and $6.75 and by the way a lower share count because when we put the model out, we weren't signaling to you that we would be in essentially a blackout period for 12 months because of the KLA transaction, but against that $6 to $6.75 EPS reference, sum of our results and guidance today are about $7 dollars. So, I kind of would like you in context if I may ask for that, I think the company's performance financially is really nicely balancing growth and profitability and the trick here is balance. It is super easy to drive profitability up and not grow. It is really hard to architect a vision and then perform consistent with delivering profitable growth that's our vision. And that is what we believe we are executing and delivering and, of course, if you remember of Lam Research, long may that continue. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Toshiya. Toshiya Hari : I appreciate that. Thanks very much. Operator : We will take our final question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. I just have one question regarding some of the foundry logic commentary you've highlighted today. Within the context of 10, 7 nanometer node that appears to be \u201cone big node\u201d again, some of the share wins that you talked about at 10 nanometers, are those simply going to transition to send 7 nanometers or are there more potential application wins that you can get at the 7 nanometer node on its own? Martin Anstice : As I know that you know Patrick nothing is quite as simple as it just transfers, but obviously demonstrated performance at 10 nanometer for [61:36] one is a very strong reference point for selection at 7 and we feel very confident about that. We are investing to achieve more than \u2013 more market share at 7 than we have at 10 and I believe there are some pretty compelling reasons why we can deliver that. Again consistent with our long-term aspirations of the 3 to 5 and 4 to 8 percentage points that we have for each of the product lines of the company. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Satya Kumar : Thank you for joining us for the conference call today. Just a quick reminder that our Analyst Day will be held in New York on November 18 and we look forward to meeting you all again. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up, so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019ll first start with an overview of our December quarter results followed by comments on our 2016 performance milestones and their relevance to sustainable growth opportunities for the company. Lastly, we\u2019ll speak to the industry updates and their assumptions relative to wafer fab equipment spending in 2017. In December 2016, Lam delivered another record quarter, reporting all-time high shipments, revenues, profit dollars and EPS. All of which also exceeded the midpoints of our guidance range. That foundation and momentum reflects itself in our March quarter guidance, where shipments and revenue both exceed $2 billion for the first time in our history. We are inspired by the opportunity to support the success of our customers and for Lam to continue its trajectory of multiyear outperformance again in 2017. But first, let me take a moment to reflect on 2016, the fifth consecutive year of growth and outperformance for Lam with a shipments CAGR of almost 20% over that period. In the year, we grew our shipments to a record $6.7 billion, two times faster than the 5% increase in WFE that we estimate occurred. We consider this relative outperformance as well as a further solidifying of our share of WFE as noteworthy, especially in the context of a meaningful decline in DRAM investments last year. Customer segment mix will be better for us in 2017 than was true in 2016 we believe. As we establish new record results, it is important to recognize the demonstrated quality of our earnings, because our focus remains on delivering sustainable profitable growth. This is particularly true in the context of the balance we described at our Analyst Day between the various business segments of multi-patterning, 3D non-volatile memory, packaging and installed base service. Lam has strengthened its momentum in foundry and logic with significant application share gains from the 2016 [ph] nodes to the 10 and 7 nanometer nodes. As an example, during the quarter we more than doubled our installed base for our production proven Atomic Layer Etch system for logic self-aligned contact application with our dielectric etch product and mixed mode pulsing technology. Application share wins such as this helped us grow our foundry shipments 15 percentage points faster than foundry WSE growth of 25% last year. Said differently, the foundry business segment for Lam Research grew 40% in 2016 year over year. Turning 3D NAND, which has emerged as one of the strongest growth opportunities for the semiconductor industry, we grew our NAND shipments by over 80% in 2016, almost twice the rate of growth in NAND\u2019s WFE. This record growth was made possible, because Lam\u2019s product portfolio addresses a variety of critical applications in the manufacture of this device architecture. We shared with you previously that our revenue opportunity increases by approximately 50% per incremental bit of capacity added for 3D NAND compared to planar technology. Perhaps unique to Lam, our opportunity is relatively agnostic to whether the incremental bit capacity is added by new greenfield wafer capacity or through conversions and upgrades, which means that in a conversion driven world our opportunity to outperform remains significant. Most importantly, we continued our market share momentum in 3D NAND and other non-volatile memory derivatives by defending 100% of critical applications and by adding additional applications for staircase etch and atomic layer deposition for advanced memory, and 64-layer selections, which will ramp in 2017. Specifically in atomic layer deposition, we continue to expand the number of applications with several key penetrations at multiple memory and logic customers. While we are very happy with what we accomplished and delivered in 2016, we are committed to the success of our customers long-term and are enthusiastic about the multi-year growth opportunity ahead. As we said at our Analyst Day, the industry is clearly now more than Moore as powerful demand drivers in the form of cloud, mobility and connected devices create new challenges that we are well positioned to help our customers address. Important to catalyzing on the opportunities ahead is the fact that we have the right products at the right time to help our customers enable this industry transformation. This multiyear product positioning by Lam creates sustained outperformance opportunity, central to which is our technical competency and capability, and the trust our customers place in delivery of technology in a form that contributes to their success. Complementing the customer engagement momentum achieved through technology innovation is the capability of Lam manufacturing, supply chain and customer support organizations. Our largely U.S. based manufacturing organization once again delivered record factory output for the December quarter, managing and ramping a complex global supply chain and our own manufacturing capacity both. The flexible business model of Lam and the commitments to invest in our future has enabled, consistent with our guidance today, scaling of the company by more than 40% in the March 2017 quarter from the average shipments level in calendar 2016 of slightly less than $1.7 billion. Record systems shipped means record systems installed and supported, and here once again our global customer organization affected accelerated production ramps across multiple sites throughout the world. Our focus is on supporting the time-to-market needs of our customers. Rounding out the overall value proposition to our customers is the service capability provided by our customer support business group, a value proposition that has increasing emphasis, particularly in the context of IoT. This component of our business reported the fifth consecutive year of growth and has more than doubled in revenues over the last five years. Simply stated, our focus is on improving the technology and productivity of our 40,000 plus process modules in the installed base through innovative product, upgrade and service offerings, in turn increasing the competitiveness of our underlying etch deposition and clean systems capabilities. Now, turning to the overall equipment spending trends of 2016 and our expectations for 2017, WFE investments in 2016 ended a little over $34 billion, essentially unchanged from our prior views. We are in a data-centric world characterized by the cloud and connected devices, which we believe is driving a multiyear growth trajectory for semiconductor contents across a number of electronic devices. As a result, we are seeing our customers increase their WFE investments to capture these opportunities. We remain optimistic on the potential for global economic stability and growth, without exception our key indicators or models more positive in calendar 2017 than for calendar 2016. In 2017, we expect the following trends. DRAM supply and demand balance has tightened significantly in the second half of 2016 due to strong ends demand, and depletion of inventories generally. We expect continued tight supply and demand in 2017 as investments recovers from the extremely low levels of 2016. We continue to see multiple demand drivers for DRAM. On the consumer side, the migration to 8-gigabit die densities enabled by the transition to 20 and 1x nanometer DRAM combined with increasing use of advanced processes is enabling exciting new application such as VR and 4K gaming, also sustaining healthy DRAM content growth in mobile and the PC. On the enterprise side, the migration to 40 nanometer server processes with new architectures including increasing attach rate of hardware accelerators and new high bandwidth memory interfaces are driving significance DRAM content. As a result of these favorable supply and demand dynamics, we expect to see a double-digit recovery in DRAM spending in 2017, still largely focused on conversions with approximately a quarter of the industry capacity converted to 1x node by the end of calendar 2017. This is a commentary on increased investments with continued discipline relative to our expectations for supply and demand balance. We expect NAND CapEx to once again grow double-digits in 2017 with more than 700,000 wafer starts per month of 3D NAND shift capacity expected by the end of 2017, representing less than half of the total NAND wafer capacity for the industry, we expect at that time. While there is continued focus on where we are in the conversion from 2D to 3D, we believe the industry is in a much earlier stage on the broader transition to solid state storage. As an example the average NAND content in a smartphone was only about 25 gigabytes in 2016, a tenth of the levels for high-end flagship models. The transition from 128 to 256 gigabyte for PC SSDs with line-of-sights of 512 gigabyte reaching cost parity with hard drives is increasingly a consensus view. In the data center, high density SSDs are playing a pivotal role to usher in new architectures. Consistent with headlines of our recent analyst meeting this is a world of increasing content. Combined these trends are on track to drive significant growth in revenues for our memory customers. We expect memory industry WFE in the high teen billion dollars with growth representing stable capital intend to the in 2017 year-over-year. We expect foundry and logic investments to be flattish in 2017 characterized by investments primarily in new 10 and 7 nanometer capacity for leading edge processes for both mobile and compute applications. Approximately a quarter of the foundry industry capacity we anticipate will be at the 20 nanometer and below nodes by end of 2017. Matching capacity in aggregates that is equivalent to the 28 nanometer node. Coincidence with this leading edge spending, we see meaningful investment of the 28 and 40 nanometer nodes for various types of sensors and communication chips for mobile and IoT applications again this year. Overall we thing WFE is likely to grow mid to high single digits in 2017 to the mid $37 billion level plus or minus $2 billion. Consistent with our prior commentary at this time we expect investments by domestic China memory companies more a 2018 story than 2017. We remain optimistic about the focus on global supply and demand, and disciplined investment by all. In closing, let me take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and contributions of our global employees, and the supports of our customers without which our past, present and future would not be possible. We are positive on long-term semiconductor growth and for 2017 specifically. From our comments again today, I hope it is clear that we believe Lam is unmatched in its positioning and opportunity relative to market and technology transition. With that, let me turn the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today and what I know is a busy earnings day. We ended the calendar year was strong performance for the December quarter exceeding the midpoint of our guidance and all financial metrics. We delivered record levels for shipments revenue, operating income dollars, and earnings per share both through the December quarter as well as for the calendar year 2016, again demonstrating the company\u2019s ability to grow the business at a pace that is materially faster than WFE as a whole. So we dive more deeply in December quarter, momentum in our shipments continued totaling $1,923 million, which was up approximately 13% compared to the September quarter and was at the high end of our guided range. Shipments for the combined memory segment came in at 61% of system shipments, which was up from 56% in the September quarter. Non-volatile memory shipments made up 37% of the system shipments, which was down a little bit from 43% in the prior quarter. Customers are committed to their technology roadmaps investing in the vision of economically scaling the technology in step with increasing product performance. As we share during our Analyst Day in November, this is an exciting time for the segment to the market, with 3D NAND possibly the largest growth driver in the industry. We\u2019re pleased with our leadership in 3D NAND, in particular with our strong position in the most critical applications like the channel whole edge, the mold stack and the word line fill. DRAM shipments grew 24% of total system shipments compared to 13% in the prior quarter. But the tightening of the supply demand balance in the DRAM segment, customers increase their investments in the December quarter. Content growth in areas such as servers and smartphones, have contributed to a burn down of inventory and corresponding upward movement in DRAM prices. The foundry segment remained strong at 31% of system shipments in the December quarter, which was down slightly in absolute dollars from the record level we saw in the September quarter. Foundry spend was focused primarily on 10 nanometer. As Martin mentioned, we\u2019ve made some significant market share gains in the foundry and logic space as our customers are migrating to smaller geometries and implementing more challenging architectures. And finally, the logic and other segment contributed 8% of system shipments, which was flat with the September quarter. December quarter revenues were $1,882 million, which was up 15% compared to the prior quarter. Gross margin improved to 46.4%, which was up 120 basis points from the 45.2% in the September quarter. This was primarily due to business volumes, product and customer mix. And as I always mentioned, you should expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in gross margin, the multiple factors such as product mix, customer concentration overall business volumes. And I remind you that our financial model continues to be the right tool for you to use to build your own models, and to think about our ongoing financial performance. Operating expenses came in at $384 million for the quarter, which was up from $372 million in the September quarter. OpEx decreased to about 20% of revenue in the quarter compared to 23% in the prior quarter. Spending allocated R&D was about 64% of total spending in the December quarter, up from 63% in September. You should expect to see more variability in our quarterly spending in 2017 and historically as we\u2019ve changed our methodology and how we record variable compensation to better align the expense with the quarterly profitability. Operating profitability was very strong in the quarter; we generated operating income of $490 million, which was an increase of 34% compared to the $366 million that we generated in September quarter. Operating margin increased to 26%, which was up from 22.4% in the prior quarter, driven by the higher revenue and then improvement in gross margin. The December quarter tax rate came in at about 15%, which was higher than roughly 12% rate last quarter and in line with our expectations. A rate in the middle teens would be a reasonable number for you to use in your modeling for the March quarter as well as 2017. Based on a share count of approximately 181 million shares earnings per share for the September quarter were $2.24. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes with a total dilutive impact of about 16 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. And I just remind you, dilution schedules for the remaining convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. We returned $0.30 per share for a total of $48 million in dividend distributions to our shareholders in the quarter. At our analyst meeting in November, we announced an increase in the dividend level to $0.45 per share. The first distribution at the new level was paid out earlier in the month of January. In addition, we initiated purchases under our $1 billion board authorized share repurchase program, which was also announced at our analyst event. In the December quarter, we spent $65 million and took delivery of approximately 619,000 shares at an average share price of $105 per share. Let me now take you through the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $6.089 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. The cash remains approximately 40% onshore and 60% offshore. During the quarter, we redeemed the $600 million 2023 senior notes and the $1 billion 2026 senior notes under the special mandatory redemption provision of those notes. Cash generation for the company continues to be healthy. In the December quarter, we generated $404 million in cash from operations. In the December quarter, days sales outstanding improved to 69 days from 72 days. Inventory turns also improved from 3.9 to 4.1 times. We exited the December quarter with a deferred revenue balance of $673 million, down a little bit from $704 million in the September quarter. That number excludes approximately $129 million from shipments to customers in Japan. This number is up from $65 million last quarter. I\u2019d like to remind you that those Japanese shipments remained as inventory carried across on the balance sheet and will convert to revenue in future quarters. I do expect to see deferred revenue grow again in the March quarter. Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following : $32 million for equity compensation, $39 million for amortization, and $39 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $37 million, which is down a little bit from the $42 million that we spent in the September quarter. We exited the quarter with approximately 8,200 regular full-time employees. Headcount additions were targeted at supporting increased business levels and customer ramps. Let me now turn to our outlook for the March quarter. I\u2019d like to provide with our non-GAAP guidance. We\u2019re expecting record shipments of $2.350 billion plus or minus $75 million. We expect record revenues of $2.125 billion plus or minus $75 million. We expect gross margin of 45.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin is down somewhat from the previous quarter due to business mix. Forecasting operating margins of 25.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Spending is up in the forecast due to profit depended expenses and payroll related taxes in addition to new R&D investments. And finally, we forecast record earnings per share of $2.55 plus or minus $0.10 based on a share count of approximately 180 million shares. So in closing, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the December quarter, as well as calendar year 2016 and the milestones we achieved throughout the year. Looking ahead, we remain committed to our objective of creating value for shareholders and to successfully executing on the growth opportunities ahead of us. We continue to expect 2017 will be a first-half weighted year with shipments more first-half weighted than revenue. Also, as we sit here today relative to the June quarter, we\u2019re expecting June shipments that are roughly in line with what we\u2019re seeing for March. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you very much. So, I guess, Doug, the first question I have is as you look, I mean, obviously you have some concentration issues in March, but do you think that the concentration is going to get a little better or a bit more favorable as you look out to June and the shipments are basically flat? Doug Bettinger : Yes, it might, Tim, but as always remind you, keep in mind the financial model when you model things. We\u2019re right in the sweet-spot of where we should be relative to that financial model relative to operating income percentage, and gross margin and spending obviously both go into that number. But we\u2019re kind of where we should be is how I think about it. There\u2019ll always be puts and takes around it as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. And then I guess just a question, you guys are doing a great job, I mean there is no question about that. Everybody can get that. But I guess, as you think strategically, Martin, as you\u2019re looking out a couple of years, KLA would have been great, but it didn\u2019t happen. So as you think about sort of making hay when the sun shines right now and how you want to remake the company for the next couple of years, is display something that\u2019s interesting to you, given that we\u2019ve seen very early in that cycle? Is there any technology you can bring to bear maybe in that vertical? Thank you. Martin Anstice : Well, probably the most important thing to say in response to that question, Tim, and I appreciate your comments about the force [ph] of the company, thank you, is that actually there is no need to kind of remake the company. I mean, that we are not sitting here as the leadership team feeling encumbered with that responsibility for several reasons. The first reason is the company is performing very well. The second reason is, in the context of how we expect the market to evolve in the next several years, in the context of these secular demand drivers for the semiconductor industry more broadly, the KLA-Tencor conversation for the company was leveraging a position of strength. And that\u2019s the position of strength that we expect to continue for number of years. So I feel like we\u2019ve got a tremendous opportunity with the product portfolio in the markets that we currently occupy. As we touched upon, albeit briefly, in the analyst meeting, we have attention always to capital redistribution conversations. We have attention always to adjacent market growth opportunities. And that strategic dialogue has always been active and will continue to be active. But I feel like, even if we took no action relative to product to markets, the story of the company in the next several years is going to be a story of outperformance, if we continue to execute in the way that we have. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question is sustainability in longer stronger cycle kind of question. And, I guess, within that perhaps if we could just focus on the NAND side. So curious, how do you think about, and I know you put up the $50 billion number, but how do you think about perhaps a world where there is more conversions next year as opposed to greenfield, and your exposure to both; and whether or not the strong level of spend in NAND that we are seeing today can continue into calendar 2018 and beyond? Martin Anstice : Yeah, C.J. it\u2019s a very good question. Thank you. So a couple of things to say and maybe I\u2019ll kind of like step up a little bit from the NAND dialogue here just to give a little bit of context. So in our prepared comments today, Doug, specifically called out an expectation that shipments in the June quarter would be somewhat similar to shipments in the March quarter. We\u2019ve talked about a couple of times now on expectations that this is a WFE year that has a bias more to the first-half than the second-half. And we\u2019ll see where the year ends out. But if you ask me today what I expect the balance to be in terms of shipments and WFE, it\u2019s hard for us to see today at an industry level and the company level a better balance in shipments, and WFE than 55/45 first-half/second-half. And the NAND flash segment is one of the segments that\u2019s a little bit more acute from that in terms of first-half bias, in large part simply a byproduct of the timing of customer investment decisions and not every NAND flash customer in the world is biased to first-half investments. But the sum of all of the market as best we understand it today is slightly more first-half concentrated than the overall 55/45 reference I just gave you for the industry. So in answer more specifically to your question, we clearly take a position that the secular trends, the multitude of demand drivers the SSD roadmap that our customers are invested in, is a multiyear and a long-term reality. And we\u2019ve articulated, I hope the substance of the positioning of Lam Research in the mix of enabling that, and the etch and the deposition portfolios of the company get stronger. And they are relevant, if not, more relevant today than they were a month or two ago relative to the future of our customers. So as we think about the question, I would say, 3D NAND is clearly a very strategic investment, number one. Number two, there is a multitude of demand drivers that are very well established and legitimate I think for our customers. We do see discipline and the timing is really just a byproduct of individual choices for investment for our customers. We expect to end the year with less capacity in qualification than when we started the year, which maybe is another commentary on discipline. And maybe most important of them all, the capital intensity conversation is really unchanged year over year, which I think is positive for the industry. And in addition to last comment, the investment plans for the industry to transition to 3D in our models would cause us to end this year with less than half the installed base 3D capable, so multiple year investment for demand and technology roadmap drivers. C.J. Muse: That\u2019s very helpful. If I could just ask a quick follow-up, I guess, Doug, as we look at deferred revs including Japan growing again, and shipments being more first-half oriented is there sort of a dollar figure we should be thinking about, where revenues will surpass shipments for all of calendar 2017? Doug Bettinger : I\u2019m not going to give you a dollar number, C.J., but I\u2019ll remind you, the way to think about it is when you\u2019ve got an accelerating shipment profile like we\u2019ve had you always get revenue lags as it just takes time to get things into the fab and they accepted. And when you\u2019re seeing a guide in March where revenue again is lagging shipments and so I accept deferred revenue will build in March. What happens when shipments level off or if they in one quarter might go down a little bit, then revenue will catch up. Over time it all normalizes and it\u2019s going to be the same numbers, right? It\u2019s just a matter of the rate of change, a second derivative if you will of what\u2019s going on there. Martin Anstice : Maybe last point to add on that, if you take a long-term model, which Doug has already said, is the guidance we can give you always for modeling the financials of the company. If you look at the stated revenue model for the company, in the 2017/2018 timeframe at a $35 billion WFE, implied by that model and our statements today around WFE expectations for 2017, which cause you to conclude that a revenue level for the company in the $8 billion range is a reasonable stake in the ground. Now, that is obviously not a forecast, it\u2019s not guidance. It\u2019s kind of triangulating around the disclosure of the company. And if WFE turns out in the way that we\u2019ve articulated today, we would expect an $8 billion reference for revenues as a legitimate framework for modeling the company. Doug Bettinger : For calendar 2017. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stephen Chin : Thanks. Hi, Martin, and nice results and guidance as well. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Steve. Stephen Chin : Yes, I wanted to just follow-up on the DRAM view for 2017. Can you remind us of how much Lam has historically outperformed DRAM spends during these WFE upturns? Last year, I think you said, Lam\u2019s NAND shipments outgrew the industry by 2X. Is DRAM something along the same lines as NAND outperformance? Martin Anstice : I have to profess I don\u2019t know the exact off the top of my head. If we can get it by the end of this call we\u2019ll provide it. But needless to say, we\u2019re in great shape in terms of kind of DRAM position. I mean, it has a dominant profile to it in terms of conversion spending and the segments of etch particularly is in the kind of top-end of the investments of the customer that are typically upgraded from node to the other. So there was a noticeable headwind for us last year because of a reduced spending. And that situation is very different this year. Now, all that said, in spite of the fact that we expect more investments in calendar 2017 in DRAM than 2016, we still expect the level of investments in DRAM in 2017 to be lower than the levels of 2015 and 2014, just as a proxy. And I think everybody understand pricing tells the story, and it tells the story really well right now in DRAM relative to supply and demand balance or even maybe constraint. Stephen Chin : Okay. Thanks for sharing that, Martin. And then just a follow-up question on your view about domestic China being a 2018 opportunity as opposed to a 2017 opportunity, is your view that developing intellectual property is kind of the key hurdle rate for domestic China before they spend? Martin Anstice : Well, I think maybe what\u2019s true role of us in the supply chain is - two things need to come together maybe at least two things need to come together to be successful. You have to have the money to fund investment. And you have to have the know-how the competency and the capability to execute, and reality is for all of us getting access to know-how competency and capability includes a broad range of incentives and technology licensing and acquisition can be one of them, but it\u2019s not the only one. And so I would maybe, say, our view relative to China and to be very clear, I specifically called out China domestic memory is my message today, clearly there is a history and reality in the future of well-established domestic foundry investment in China as well as the participation of the global equipment, of the global semiconductor companies. So my comment was really focused on domestic China memory more 2018 to 2017, and money, and know-how competency and capability is what it takes for all of us in any part of the world to go execute. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Stephen. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks for letting me ask a question, and congrats on the great results. My first question, Doug, is on the potential tax reform. You guys have a significant amount of your cash offshore; how should we think about your capital return, if there is a tax reform? Have you given any thought to it? Doug Bettinger : You think about all time, Farhan, I mean the practical reality of it is until there is a definitive law out there that you can understand exactly what it requires and what are the laws you do, it\u2019s hard to specifically answer the question. Obviously, if we get accessibility to worldwide cash without having tax penalty that creates a whole lot more flexibility for us to access the cash to do a variety of different things. Some of which might be capital return investment in the business, as Martin talked about adjacent M&A. We haven\u2019t had any definitive conversation, because just too early right now and too much uncertainty. But stay tuned, we\u2019re paying very close attention to it. Farhan Ahmad : Thank you. And as a follow-up, I just had a question on the linearity of the year. You talked about March quarter and June quarter being significantly higher than December. Can you provide us some color on what\u2019s driving the incremental growth from December quarter to first half of the year? Is it foundry, or are you seeing more growth in other areas, as well? And is the linearity between first half and second half, if any different between different segments? Doug Bettinger : Farhan, you heard Martin described kind of more first half weighted overall both WFE and shipments, and also describe NAND is maybe more first half weighted than the other stuff, so that\u2019s a data point for you. When we look at March as well as June, everything is pretty strong. Everything investments are recurring at leading edge, it\u2019s NAND, it\u2019s DRAM, it\u2019s foundry logic, it\u2019s hitting on all cylinders from my perspective I don\u2019t know, Martin, if you\u2026 Martin Anstice : Yeah, I would say maybe just to be very direct. Our shipments guidance today from March quarter assumes that there will be sequential growth across foundry, DRAM, and NAND. Next question, please. Doug Bettinger : There you go. You got a follow-up, Farhan? Operator : Okay. We\u2019ve got next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon, and great job on the quarterly execution and outlook. At Analyst Day, I think you guys showed a slide deck China WFE spend would up this year. And I think the biggest component of that was the incremental growth coming from the domestic China programs. And so first of all, do you still see the spending landscape playing out this way for 2017. And I assume most of the domestic China spend is more 28 and 20 nanometer foundry and logic. Any insight to it would be appreciated. Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean, actually our China perspective today I feel is actually unchanged from the commentary of the analyst meeting. Clearly, there is an ambitious agenda. Our assumption is there is a greater investment in calendar 2017 in China. And the largest single component of that expansion year-over-year we\u2019ve assumed is domestic, not international, and it\u2019s logic foundry in focus. Harlan Sur : Great. Thanks for the insights there. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Harlan Sur : And given your advanced equipment toolsets and process modules, I\u2019m assuming that it\u2019s becoming more difficult for your customers not to be engaged in some sort of service and productivity engaging. And so, as it relates to your installed base business and I think last you gave us an update, it\u2019s about 25% of your business. You\u2019ve been growing that at a stable double-digits CAGR, very accretive to the cash flow generation. So for calendar 2016, how much did your services business grow both revenues and operating profitability? And do you guys expect it to grow double-digits this calendar year? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Harlan, I mean, it grew consistent with our expectations. I can\u2019t remember off the top of my head whether it grew a little bit more in the equipment business or not. But it was roughly in line. It\u2019s still roughly a quarter of the company\u2019s overall business. And you got it right, it\u2019s very cash generative, very profitable business, very broad-based in terms of the number of engagements and number of customers. And generally speaking that chart that Tim Archer showed you at the Analyst Day, we\u2019re very much on track to deliver that, that growth that we had targeted and are targeting. Martin Anstice : I think one of the reasons why we answer the question the way we do, Harlan, is because there are two value propositions of the customer service business group and one of them is the contribution to the company of profitable growth, which is the essence of your question. The second is the contribution to the company through the delivery of installed base performance that makes the underlying systems businesses of etch and deposition, clean more competitive and it\u2019s more valuable to the customer and to the company. So that\u2019s how I think about the totality of value that\u2019s possible for the customer and the company, and so that the - the specificity of income statements by segment is not so relevant for us. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Krish Sankar : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats again on the good execution, guys. Two quick questions; first one, I just want to ask the DRAM CapEx question a different way. If you look at the DRAM WFE spending last year and possibly this year, it\u2019s going to be roughly half of the NAND WFE spend. Do you see that increasing for DRAM to go back to like the 2014/2015 levels or do you think conversions are going to be the norm this year and into next year that what you\u2019re going to see in DRAM WFE is more a bonds off the bottom or bonds at the really low levels of 2016? And then I had a follow-up. Martin Anstice : Thank you for your comments there at the beginning. No, I think as I said a few minutes ago, our expectation is I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a bounce. I\u2019d describe it as a demand-driven investments by our customers. But the expectation is that the level of investments continues to be sustainable, continues to be disciplined. And we\u2019re certainly modeling a level of investment for 2017 that is lower than the levels of investment that occurred in 2015 and 2016, but to your point, higher than 2016. So it\u2019s probably a little early for us to get specific on segments at the WFE level, given we\u2019re only in the first month of the year, but you should expect us to put more substance on that maybe in the next earnings call. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. Thanks for that, Martin. And then a follow-up, when do you expect the 3D NAND customers to move to 96 layer? And if you think that\u2019s going to happen next year and NAND WFE holds up at these levels, and then you add in China memory CapEx coming in from the domestics, do you think $40-billion-plus WFE is not way out of the range for next year? Thank you. Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean, I - maybe it\u2019s a little - I\u2019ll break your question into two parts. One of them is the kind of technology roadmap of the customer. And I think we don\u2019t actually have a tremendous amount of data points in terms of the pacing of 3D device architecture kind of scaling. As you know the end of last year and this year it\u2019s really first year, where we have a broad participation by every semiconductor company in this space, in 3D device architecture. There is a roadmap that\u2019s a multiple node roadmap, I think we presented that in analyst meeting, I think our customers talk about having multiple steps beyond the 64-layer device. And we currently have a stake in the ground that\u2019s going to 18 months as a reasonable proxy, and obviously our R&D engagements run all the way through the roadmap of the customer for the next five years. So I think the answer to your economic question, investment levels is all a byproduct of momentum in the marketplace around this broad set of drivers and kind of momentum in terms of solid state drive technology. And I\u2019ve read a bunch of questions around yields of customers in this technology, and I think ironically investment is the commentary on confidence around yield, and I think ironically the creation of demand in the space is somehow related to economics. And so there is a momentum around creating legitimacy in the vision of the entire ecosystem, and economics, and scaling the devices central to that and we are here to do the best we can to support the vision of our customers. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on results and guide. I want to go back to DRAM for a second. You talked about - you expect DRAM WFE to go up double-digits in 2017, but your customers suggest wafer capacity will be relatively unchanged from 2016. First of all, do you agree with that? And second, from your conversations with their customers, how much does capital increase - capital intensity increases at 18 nanometers or 1x nanometer, and do you think Lam would do better in that? Martin Anstice : Yeah. I think, we have an opinion and it\u2019s always plus or minus. We have an opinion that actual wafer starts capacity for DRAM is relatively constant through the year. So our view right now is no material change in capacity end of year 2017 compared to beginning of year 2017, the best color I can give you right now on capital intensity is that it\u2019s dominated by a conversion based investments in DRAM, and we are not seeing a material positive or negative in the next several technology nodes around capital intensity. The position of the company is very strong, we have good share, and as to your earlier question, good SAM presence in the context of WFE. So I feel like we\u2019ve positioned very nicely but certainly no expectations of capacity addition, and if capacity addition does occur, I have every confidence it will be demands driven. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. And then my follow-up is similarly on the NAND side. You guys talked about 3D NAND shipped or installed capacity going up to 700,000 or more by the end of this year, but one of your biggest customers is only guiding full-year for the industry and themselves to be around 30% range. Is that because capital intensity is a lot higher for 64 layers, or are yields a lot worse than what we expected? And when do you expect an inflection point where this relationship maybe reverse itself? Martin Anstice : Maybe, I am not quite understanding your question. I will take a shot at giving you some color on it. I think the commitments of every customer to their technology is a statement on either actual yield or planned and realizable yields in the eyes and minds of the customer. I think there is enough discipline around all of us, but we make investments when we have confidence and we don\u2019t make them or not. So that would a kind of generic answer to your question and obviously the intensity, the investment levels at least of 64 layer device for more than 48 in the investment levels of 96, and more than 64. And the answer to your question in terms of capital intensity is going to be a byproduct to the pricing on the die when it comes off a wafer. And I think the customer is much better equipped to answer that than we are. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the solid execution. My first question is on EUV. I realize it\u2019s only been a couple of months since your Analyst Day, but ASML, they continue to be pretty vocal about potential EUV deployment at the leading edge in a couple of years. But when you sit down with customers and discuss N plus 1, N plus 2 technologies, did you sense any change in your opportunity over the next couple of years or not so much? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I mean the disclosure from everybody privately and publically that we have access to causes me to say no change in the message of the analyst meeting. And to refresh, we articulated SAM expansion for Lam at 40% from the 2015 to 2016 timeframe through the 20. We are definitely an advocate of technology innovation like EUV as a contribution to extending the value of the entire semi-ecosystem. And we\u2019re invested in contributing to the enablement of that to the extent that we can, so no real change the set of assumptions that we articulated in terms of number of passes, and the economics of that implementation for us. And I think importantly the market characterization between space based multi-patterning and litho-etch schemes. We communicated I think exactly the same headlines and messages today as we did in the analyst meeting. Toshiya Hari : Okay, great. Thank you. And then I\u2019ve my follow-up, but I had a question on OpEx in to the June quarter, if I may. Doug, you talked about your OpEx number becoming more variable and dependent on profitability, I suppose in the quarter. If we assume revenue in June is kind of flattish relative to March, and gross margin is pretty stable. Is it fair to assume that your total OpEx numbers is also flattish relative to March or is it not that simple? Doug Bettinger : That\u2019s probably a reasonable assumption, Toshiya, yeah, it\u2019s - that\u2019s not unreasonable. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Atif Malik : Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congratulations. Martin, your outlook of $37 billion WFE is a lot more bullish than the Street is thinking. Can you just talk about what will it take to get to the high end of that range and then in the low-end basically what\u2019s the swing factor? Martin Anstice : What we - I guess, we have a $4 billion range on this - which is customary for us. So what does it take to be the high end of any range? It takes legitimate demand for semiconductor devices and the need to add capacity. I kind of - I go back to one of the core themes of the analyst meeting. This is no longer the world of a killer app nor one dominant device. And even that one dominant device that we talked about five years ago, I think by most people\u2019s view is seeing a stabilizing, or decline, or maybe even potential for growth this year. This is a world of secular demands and a very diverse set of demand drivers, and I think our customers when I sit down where the customer today, the entire conversation is focused on time to market for them, and enabling their business strategies and competitiveness ambition to prevail. So I mean the simple answer is demand, if the vision of the customer and the industry, and the performance of the entire ecosystem deliver what\u2019s possible then we are in the multiple year period of expansion, and we\u2019ve called out specifically what we think that means for our company. Atif Malik : And it\u2019s a follow-up for Doug, you had a product rationalization charges in the COG [ph] plan. Can you just talk about what those products or areas were? Doug Bettinger : Yeah. I am not going to give you specificity is just investments we were making with an eye towards of penetration, two nodes from now that didn\u2019t end up come into fruition. And so we ended up with some assets that didn\u2019t have a forward useful life, so that\u2019s what that was, it was an investment that we decided we were no longer investing in. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Thank you. I\u2019d like to extend my congrats as well. Martin, first in terms of 3D NAND, a couple of years ago before this market really took off like it has today, you talked about some of the capital intensity trends, but you revise them higher over the last few analyst days. As the industry moves potentially to 96 and 128 layers in future years, is there the potential for increases in that capital intensity as well, or do you still feel very comfortable with the numbers you laid out at the most recent Analyst Day? Martin Anstice : I guess, the amusing interpretation of that is, we are not so good at analytics, because it takes us a while to get it right. I feel like actually - and maybe it\u2019s all about Satya joining the company that the analytics of the company are now perfect. Now, I actually think that we now have much more experience under our belts, right? I mean, to give us a little bit of credit, if you go back three to five years this was a concept and there was really only one customer in the world that was singularly committed to that device architecture. And collectively we\u2019ve gone through an incredible learning about what it takes to manufacture that device architecture. And we\u2019ve gone through an incredible learning relative to how the customers individually implement considering greenfield opportunities, conversion from planar to 3D and plain simple scaling of 3D capacity. So I feel like a knock on wood that the analytics presented at the analyst meeting are good for the next several years. But I am sure you will ask your question in a year\u2019s time if I say something different. Patrick Ho : I just want to make it clear. I didn\u2019t criticize your analytics. Martin Anstice : It\u2019s okay, Patrick. Patrick Ho : A follow-up question for you, Doug, in terms of the services business you talked about the growth aspects both on this call as well as the Analyst Day. Can you give some, I guess, tangible areas where you\u2019ve improved the profitability? Is it what you\u2019re offering? Is it just internal cost reductions? What\u2019s made services a more profitable business for you guys? Doug Bettinger : I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s necessarily more profitable year on year, Patrick. It\u2019s always been quite profitable. It\u2019s a great business, right? All the investment occurs in new equipment. It gets leveraged in installed base. It doesn\u2019t require a whole lot of investment. It\u2019s just - it\u2019s a very profitable part of the business. But on a year-on-year basis I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really more profitable necessarily. Martin Anstice : I think there is a kind of macro trend that is very important to us as we think about the strategy for this business. And the macro trend is a trend for us at least of targeting by investment, the most valuable products and services for the customer. So there are two types of business you can have in the installed base space. You can sell spare parts and maintain equipment at one extreme. At another extreme, you can be all of that and also a provider of advanced services around installed base optimization, for example, or taking productivity improvements that you\u2019ve embedded in latest generation leading-edge equipments and putting them back into a 28 nanometer space, for example. So advanced services and value creating products and services is our focus. And if we\u2019re successful developing that capability, if we are successful having it competitive over time. I think there is a trend to higher profit opportunities. So that would be maybe another characterization for you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Hey, thanks for taking my question. So it sounds like generally, you guys expect the first-half strength in WFE and shipment. Do you see any sub-segments of pockets of strength manifesting in the second-half of 2017 or do you see declines across all sub-segments? Martin Anstice : No. We don\u2019t see decline across all segments. There is a - maybe I can go back to my earlier statements. It is only January, so we have a tremendous amount of adds and subtracts ahead of us by virtue of push and pull, and changes in the investment strategies of our customers. So please recognize that we are giving you the best we can, but I guarantee it will change. The best we can say today relative to first-half and second-half is exactly what I noted earlier. We don\u2019t expect a more balanced shipments and WFE year than 55/45. And as I added as a supplement the concentration to the first-half shipments in WFE for NAND, we believe is above that average. Now, everything I just said could change, but that\u2019s the best we got for you today in terms of first-half and second-half balance. The second thing that I try to provide some context to you for analytical purposes, that was a reference to revenues. And what I wanted to do there was to make sure that everybody interpreted the long-term stated financial models as we had intended. And so there was a long-term model that referenced revenues, not shipments, referenced revenues in the 2017 and 2018 calendar year timeframe with an assumption of $35 billion of WFE with revenues $7.25 billion to $8 billion. And what I said today is that, that we had intended that with that information you would derive approximately a $8 billion revenue reference to the assumptions of SAM concentration and WFE and share that we\u2019ve communicated in the last several months including this earnings call. Amit Daryanani : Thank you so much. And as a follow-up, when China begins to ramp in the 2018/2019 timeframe, what percent of revenue do you think you could see China achieving? And is it something like 20%, 30% and how long could that sustain for? Martin Anstice : Wow, I really don\u2019t know that I have a basis to answer that question. I mean, there are so many moving parts. There is clearly a very strong ambition for investments and there are kind of stated numbers I think available to us all. And whether those numbers are investment dollars or those numbers are kind of wafer in start references, I think I\u2019ve read references to 3,000 to 4,000 wafer starts for NAND. I think I read 1,000 wafer starts to DRAM. I mean I have no idea on how this will kind of play out. But we continue to engage in every region of the world with every customer in the world to support to the best of our abilities. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Bill Grinstead : Good afternoon, guys. This is Bill Grinstead in for Mehdi. Just a quick question here on internal manufacturing capacity, obviously, you guys are looking for pretty strong shipments in the first-half. What is your capacity and how high is your utilization or do you guys think you\u2019ll need to flex that up? Martin Anstice : Well, we\u2019re constantly investing in flexing and it\u2019s a nature of this industry. It\u2019s less today from traditional cyclicality and disconnects on an industry level between supply and demand, more today because of the variability that any one customer can bring to us as a supplier to the semiconductor industry. We have no public disclosure for you on utilization or capacity. But I would reinforce the point that I made a little earlier. We are focused on proactively investing in the business of our company and that means proactively investing in technology and also operational capabilities for manufacturing and supply chain and service, to execute and support the success of our customers. And we did a lot of that already, right? We\u2019ve invested in creating the potential to increase the output of this company by 40% in a really short period of time. Our average shipments in calendar 2016 were $1.6 billion I think, and maybe $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. And we just gave guidance materially in excess of that. So the investments is proactive and we\u2019re obviously focused on the flexibility of our business model as much as ever. Doug Bettinger : Okay, operator, that\u2019s going to be our last question. Satya Kumar : Okay, operator, conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your line anytime and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Satya Kumar. Please go ahead, sir. Satya Kumar : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the March 2017 quarter, and our outlook for the June 2017 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company\u2019s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slide in the presentation for additional information. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 PM Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up, so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you all for joining us today for our March 2017 quarterly earnings call. Stating the obvious, we are extremely pleased with the performance of the company that we reported and guided today. As challenging as it is to scale our company from an average calendar \u201916 quarterly output level by more than 40% which is the reality of our 2.4 billion recent quarter shipments. It is gratifying to see the results of our collective efforts. Our strategy of the developments of an increasingly critical and enabling products and services portfolio, our consistent execution across all functions of the company and last but not least the tremendous commitment of our employees and partners globally are all necessary components of a multi-year outperformance story. It is a privilege to lead this company and on behalf of the entire management team I would like to thank everybody that contributed, the very same people that are creating as we speak the next world of opportunity in our future. We delivered record financial results once again in the March quarter, with shipments and revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and non-GAAP EPS above the high-end of our guidance range. For all the reasons previously communicated and reinforced by our actual performance currently, we believe LAM is in an excellent position with our leadership and competency in etch, deposition, and clean product conservative to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing for many years to come. Turning to the broader industry environment, as stated already the momentum of investment levels in the segments that we participate is net positive. Capacity addition and technology conversion trends appear rational and strategic, both elements leading to a strengthened outlook for the calendar year. Since our last earnings call, expectations for the year have improved. We are now guiding a first half shipment stronger than previously anticipated, with a second half now slightly more balanced than the no better than 55/45 reference of the last earnings call and the optimism that we have for sustainable technology demand trends is further strengthened by well publicized plans throughout the electronics ecosystem. In short, silicon continues to sit at the very center of long-term electronics technology and applications innovation. That is the fundamental opportunity for our industry and specifically for Lam Research. Market trends and our initial modeling indicates continued strength of WFE in 2018 also. Memory company cash flows, memory unit pricing and the implied commentary on supply and demand balance are broadly well analyzed and reported at this point. We have no incremental perspective to share at this time. Demand continues to be strong for NAND in the SSD and embedded markets driving increased spending activity for NAND in 2017. We expect total 3D NAND shipped capacity at year-end to represent slightly more than the 50% of the installed base with a balance of Greenfield and conversion investments this year. In DRAM, we continue to anticipate double-digit growth in equipment spending in calendar \u201917 year-over-year, with investments being dominated by technology conversion. We now model a modest growth in foundry and logic spending combined as leading edge devices increasingly meet performance targets and adoption criteria for the broad range of advanced computation market needs. These additional investments are focused primarily at the 10-nanomter technology node this year. Overall, we believe calendar \u201917 wafer fabrication equipment spending and to a greater extent our SAM and our own business levels are all tracking positively against previously stated expectation. The intended headlines today for the company are clear we hope. We continue to invest in the positioning of enabling technology, products and services with benchmark level R&D funding approaching two thirds of our overall operating expenses in support of our customers plans and to build sustainable value for Lam Research. We are actively working to enhance the competitive differentiation momentum of five years of profitable growth averaging an 18% revenue CAGR, with calendar \u201817 expected to be our most significant revenue, profit and cash generation growth year yet this decade. With the anticipated business plans of our customers, their equipment selections already made, and the continued operational execution standard of LAM, we have every confidence in our industry outperformance potential long term. We have singular focus on our corporate strategy and vision that we consider compelling for all stakeholders. Specifically, we believe that our intuitive focus on customer trust and a collaborative culture, a flexible business model, and a result to invest strategically in our long term success with a commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders all combine to create a rewarding opportunity. Last but not least, we believe that the secular demand trends and outlook for the world of technology and electronic applications are more compelling than ever with the silicon roadmap and the role of Lam Research front and center. With that let me turn the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today for our March 2017 quarterly earnings call. The March quarter represented a solid start to the calendar year. We delivered record levels of shipments, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income dollars, and earnings per share. Each of these metrics grew double digits quarter over quarter. Financial performance was above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics, with operating margin and earnings per share above the high-end of the range we provided to you last quarter. Shipments for the quarter were strong at $2.413 billion which was up 25% sequentially and again above the midpoint of the guided range. Memory shipments were very strong in the quarter, as customers continued their investments in three 3D NAND capacity. Our customers are investing in new 3D wafers, they're converting planar to 3D and they're also embarking on 3D technology conversions to increase layer count. NAND demand continues to be strong driven by growth in enterprise and client SSDs as well as mobile device density increases. The combined memory segment represented 73% of total system level shipments and that compares with 61% in the prior quarter. Memory shipments were weighted heavily towards - excuse me, the nonvolatile segment which represented 50% of shipments in the March quarter compared with 37% in the prior quarter. DRAM shipments grew 24% sequentially in dollar terms and made up 23% of system shipments. DRAM shipments comprise 24% of system shipments in the December quarter. We're seeing an uptick in DRAM spending in line with improving demand in content growth from areas such as smartphones and servers. DRAM spending is largely focused on conversions with the majority being conversions to the 1x nanometer node. The foundry segment was flattish sequentially in dollar terms accounting for 24% of system shipments. Foundry spending was a combination of leading-edge 10 nanometer capacity, initial 7 nanometer pilot investments as well as continued spending at 28 nanometer and above with the latter being primarily focused in China. And finally the logic and other segment contributed 3% of system shipments. Revenue came in at $2.154 billion in the March quarter, which was up roughly 14% from the December quarter. Gross margin for the period came in 46.1% above the midpoint of our guidance. And as I've shared with you before, our gross margins are a function of a number of factors such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, so you will see variability quarter to quarter. And I just like to remind you that our financial model is still the best way to think about our ongoing profitability performance. Operating expenses in the quarter grew as we knew they would to $414 million. This compares to $384 million in the December quarter. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to 19% compared to 20% in the prior quarter. And as Martin pointed out, the majority of our OpEx spending continues to be allocated to funding our critical R&D programs. Operating income in the March quarter came in at $578 million and that compares to $490 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 26.9%, above the high end of the guided range. The tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared with 15% last quarter. The tax rate in the March quarter was favorably impacted by the release of tax liabilities from the conclusion of certain tax matters. Additionally, we had a reserve release related to the Novellus acquisition that is included in the GAAP results. The tax rate in the low-to-mid teens for the remainder of 2017 would be reasonable for you to use in your earnings models. Based on our share count of approximately 182 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter totaled $2.80, above the guided range. This share count includes dilution on a non-GAAP basis from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes, with a total dilutive impact of about 16 million shares. And I\u2019ll remind you that dilution schedules for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. This quarter we returned $213 million to our shareholders, $73 million in dividend distributions and $140 million in share repurchases. We took delivery of 1.2 million shares at an average price of $114.30. We\u2019ve completed approximately 20% of our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization and I'll let you know that we plan to initiate a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in the June quarter. Now let me return to the balance sheet. We continue to have both a solid cash position and healthy cash generation. Cash and short-term investments including restricted cash increased modestly to $6.140 billion at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations was $423 million and that compares to $404 million in December. DSO held steady at 69 days in the March quarter, the same level as in December. Inventory turns were 4.2 which was up slightly from 4.1 in the prior quarter. This turns number is the highest we've achieved since we've combined LAM with Novellus. We exited the quarter with deferred revenues of $842 million, which was up from $673 million in December. This amount excludes $260 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. These Japanese shipments are up from $129 million in the December quarter. And I'll just remind you that these Japanese shipments remain on our balance sheet as inventory carried at cost. And I'll just do the math for you. I'd like to point out that this combined deferred shipment bucket now stands at $1.1 billion and it grew 37% in the March quarter. I expect deferred revenue will grow again in the June quarter. Company noncash expenses for the quarter included the following; $35 million for equity comp, $38 million for amortization and $38 million for the depreciation. Capital expenditures were $44 million which was up from $37 million in the December quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 8,600 regular full-time employees, which was up about 400 from the end of the December quarter. The increase in headcount was in support of our growing business levels primarily in the operations and field organizations. Additionally, we're bringing on board the talent required to execute on our forward looking R&D programs. Now looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide you our guidance - for non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We're expecting another record shipment of $2.500 billion plus or minus $100 million. We\u2019re expecting record revenue of $2.300 billion plus or minus $100 million. We\u2019re forecasting gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point and we're forecasting operating margins of 27% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, we\u2019re forecasting earnings per share of $3, plus or minus $0.12 based on a share count of approximately 180 million shares. We're obviously pleased with our performance this quarter and with the guidance we've just shared for the June quarter. Our business has never been stronger financially and we're continuing to execute extremely well. We're in the right place at the right time with the right products. We're partnering with our customers to enable the transitions happening within the industry today and we're making the investments required to sustain our business long term.  Operator that concludes my prepared remarks, Martin and I would now like open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Stephen Chin with UBS Bank. Stephen Chin : My first question is just on your early outlook for the 2018 industry wafer fab equipment spending. Does 2018 appear to be another growth year for WFE because of indigenous China or is it just continued spend by incumbent than in foundry and memory logic? Thanks. Martin Anstice : I think if I try to answer that definitively, I'd be a little bit misleading. I think that it\u2019s still early days but based on the data points that we see today Stephen, we see sustainability in the context of the discipline of capital investments, the relative balance and stability between kind of supply and demand as best we can tell in the industry. And particularly on the last part of your question, the China story, the domestic China story at least we believe it's more of a calendar \u201918 investment than calendar \u201917. So really our comments are comments about discipline in capacity additions and what we think are pretty compelling and exciting, and sustainable long-term demand trends. At the end of the day if that plays out as it is more generally described today the investment will follow. Stephen Chin : Just a quick follow-up on memory CapEx to sales trends. It sounds like memory fundamentals are healthy and historically we've seen memory industry have a CapEx to sales ratio of 30% to 35%. Do you think that CapEx to sales ratio is still a good sustainable scenario for the market or it's likely that CapEx to sales to go higher in light of the scalability issues with 3D NAND and slowing DRAM transition. Thanks. Martin Anstice : Honestly Stephen, I've never been a really big fan of capital intensity ratios because I think it kind of whipsaws us around in terms of the analytics in any one quarter and the reality is the economics of an addition in new capacity is a very different economics than a conversion. We're pretty agnostic in the NAND space to how our customers execute those plans as we've previously described. And in terms of wafer starts, it looks to us like the investments of this year are kind of pretty balanced between Greenfield and conversion. So we look to the sustainability question more in terms of kind of balance of bit growth demand and our understanding of supply additions. And I think kind of the market generally is telling that story. So I don't really have anything to tell you that will cause the future to be very different from the past in terms of that particular metric. Doug Bettinger : The only thing I\u2019d like to point out Stephen is obviously, you know what memory revenue is likely to be this year, it's super strong, right. And so you\u2019ve always have to think about affordability and clearly the levels that are going on today are affordable given how strong revenue and memory is. Operator : Moving onto to our next question, our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : I guess the first question, Doug is to you. Just looking out into the third calendar quarter, it looks like you guys said a little used words a little more balanced than what the 55/45 was, so maybe it sounds like second half shipments was down something like maybe 10% half on half. So that would sort of say 4.5 million shipments in the back half of the year. So maybe [indiscernible] in the third calendar quarter, is that like roughly the right math. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, I mean we're - Tim, as you know we guide one quarter at time, we\u2019ll give you a little bit of color which is what Martin did, when he said a little more balanced than the 55/45 and there's also reason I gave you the deferred revenue number, so you can think about how that likely transpires through the year. I'm not going to guide the third calendar quarter or the fourth, but I think we've given you enough to model it pretty closely. Martin Anstice : Maybe just kind of two things to add quickly. I think our outlook today at least would cause us to believe that the December quarter is our weakest shipments quarter of the year, so that's kind of one extra data point. Another one is just kind of plain simple math of the disclosure that we've given, so the sum of our actual performance in our guidance today is the first half shipment of 4.9. You will I'm sure all make their own judgments about how much better the balance is than we previously described, but if you just use the math of 55/45 proxy than the shipments for the year is approximately $8.9 billion and in a ramping year the revenues lack the shipment. So I think those numbers are the ones that we're kind of intending you to embrace. Timothy Arcuri : Then I just had a question about the deferred revenue balance, Doug, which you were talking about before. I mean, you guys are now up to about 1.7 months, if I look into June, you\u2019re going to have about 1.7 months if you add Japan plus the deferred, you know, the regular balance. And it starts to look a little like the old Lam sort of in terms of backlog, not the new short lead time Lam. Is there a dynamic there, maybe you're shifting more new products or there's something happening in NAND and sort of - can you help us understand what sort of catch-up we should see because obviously you're going to revenue a lot more than you\u2019ll ship during the back-half of the year. Martin Anstice : Yeah, it's pretty simple to think through this Tim, when you've got shipments that are growing the way we have the last several quarters, revenue almost always lags at growth and shipments. When shipments level off or if they were to decline sequentially, revenue will catch up, it's just a natural progression of the timing between with something shows up at the customer's dock and it gets into acceptance and revenue. Doug Bettinger : But specifically is your question, Tim, as more kind of headline for us in terms of the timelines for ship to install and therefore acceptance of revenues. In any one quarter and you don't get to see this unfortunately, but the specific scheduling of shipments in any one week or any one day of any one month, I mean, that kind of jerks the ratios around. So there's is no real story here in terms of kind of changing dynamic of timeline. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Patrick Ho : First off, in terms of your comments about a more balanced 2017 between first half and second half, is there any one specific market segment that's driving this better balance or is it a confluence of all the markets you mentioned in your prepared remarks? Martin Anstice : Well maybe I\u2019ll break that into two parts. So what changed for us between this earnings call and the last earnings call, if you look at kind of the expansion in the business that we've reported and we're anticipating approximately two-thirds of that is in NAND space and a third is in foundry logic. So that would at least tell you that - to the assumptions we made and disclosed previously there's no real headline in terms of DRAM. So that would be the first part of the maybe the most helpful part of answering you question. Maybe I'll stop there, did I get what you wanted? Patrick Ho : Yes, actually that\u2019s very helpful Martin. And my follow-up question maybe for Doug, in terms of the ramp up of shipments you talked about, you kept your supply chain at really optimal levels with inventory and even AR. What are some of I guess the nuances or the tricks that you\u2019re keeping the supply chain as tight and efficient as it's been particularly as shipments continue to ramp up over these last few quarters? Doug Bettinger : I mean it\u2019s continued focus on just managing our remote factories, managing our own internal facilities, anticipating what we were going to need to be able to support at this point months and months ago and communicating that to our supply chain partners, Patrick. I mean it's operational excellence, the way Lam has always executed, just at a different scale here. Martin Anstice : And just adding, I would say, honest hard work and when you hear us talk about our customer trust orientation, when you hear us talk about collaborative and partnership orientation that's pretty fundamental relative to sustaining your ability to perform and execute with the level of variability that is part of our business through the consolidation of our customers in the last several years. So our supply chain and our own factory and our field service engineers have done a tremendous job scaling in a very short period of time. And we continue to be proactive as proactive as we can be based on our visibility to ensure that investments are kind of made ahead of the need to support and service our customers. And competitively as best I can tell, we're doing just fine. Operator : Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : I have two of them, the first one for Martin. You're NAND shipments are at record high and 3D NAND spending is robust. I'm just curious if the pricing for NAND rolls over, will the reality of economics weaken and the 3D NAND makers might scale back CapEx or do you think the demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity. Then I have a follow up. Martin Anstice : Yeah, I mean I think you know one of our headlines obviously is there's a long way to go with the NAND story. And as I know you understand extremely well the economics of that device architecture are one of the most relevant parts to the penetration of SSDs and so on and so forth. So, I mean there's a positive for every negative. We see a long way to go, we see compelling demand drivers for that architecture and as we've described a number of times particularly in critical applications, the high volume manufacturing position of Lam in that inflection is outstanding. That's the best word that I could use to describe the position that we worked hard to achieve and sustain. So there's a long way to go and best we can tell, commitment to technology and sustainability to investment will go up and down along the way for sure, but long term, it feels pretty good. Krish Sankar : Then a follow-up for Doug, Doug you mentioned in your comments that the headcount addition for new product development. I\u2019m kind of curious, is this because these new products you\u2019re developing, you don't have the core competency within Lam i.e. full wafer deposition or etch-related technologies and is it why you're hiring or am I just reading too much into it. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, you\u2019re reading too much into Krish. I mean, any time you're doing more this year than you did last year you need more people to execute that, that's the statement around R&D. The biggest area of increase in headcount though Krish is, operations as well as the field who are shipping product real time and installing it at the customers facility. Martin Anstice : And maybe just to add to that, let's kind of go back to disclosure of the last earnings call, because there's two stories in the company, one of them is the story of creating a road map of products and technology that was relevant for inflections anticipating how those inflections would have a concentration of spending for etch and deposition particularly. The second part of it was building the competitiveness of the portfolio we have so we get a bigger share of it and we gave two very important headlines in the last earnings call. One of them was the statement about how our foundry business grows and we characterized the growth in our foundry business year-over-year \u201916, \u201915 of 40% compared to a 25% WFE reference and we also stated that in NAND, we grow shipments by 80% year-over-year almost twice as the rate of WFE growth. So the headcount of the company is a lifecycle statement. So you add headcount when you prepare to do that and you add headcounts when you're in the middle of doing it and to some extent through the lifetime in an installed base business, the tail will demand at certain points, adding additional headcounts for many years to come and that's a natural commentary on the evolution of the company. Krish Sankar : Got you. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys and great execution. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks for taking my question. I had a question in terms of the sustainability. The year on year growth that you\u2019ve seen is quite impressive in the first half of this year. Now if I look back more recently since maybe 2010, the cyclicality of the business has gone down and that also implies that like year on year comparisons have not been that fair. So the fact that you're having too much growth right now, is that a concern in your mind in anyway and should that bring concerns of cyclicality back into the industry. Martin Anstice : Yeah. In my opinion, no. I mean I might be wrong, but I think that there has been a fundamental transition in the industry as the supply chain is matured and as there's been concentration in the semiconductor industry. The traditional history of the industry was an over investment for many players and then a contraction. I think that's kind of long gone by virtue of scale and scope of the economics of the industry and the technical risks and opportunities to kind of go with it. But what is always still true is it's still difficult to predict and maybe increasingly so because there is no one kind of killer app or killer devices that diverse the demand drivers. It\u2019s more difficult to predict for our customers and therefore for us. There is some variability of spending and one element of our focus on competitive differentiation is business model flexibility and it\u2019s not actually that easy to ramp the capacity of your company by 40% to an average baseline of prior year. I mean that's a lot of hard work. The variability and flexible business model is a critical part of the success of the company and hopefully that will be a long term statement of value for our shareholders. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks, Martin. And then one question on China. There's a lot of expectation around memory investment in China next year. The question I have for you is that from your perspective, has the visibility of memory projects changed for China for next and is that a part that you see for China memory investments next year without some foreign IP coming in to the picture. Martin Anstice : Yeah. I think I'd probably say the same thing today that I've said for a while now and there clearly seems to be conviction to a plan that looks rational in terms of its kind of fundamental business objectives and your ability to execute as a byproduct of two things, knowing how to make the devices you want to sell and then having the operational scale to pull it off and whether that comes from M&A or IP licensing or just the developments of organic know how, I think we will see over time as best we can tell, we still believe that the China memory investment conversation is more a calendar \u201918 story than calendar \u201917 story and just to give you a little bit more color on the calendar \u201918 kind of holistically, we're tracking about 10 new fabs next year and to our understanding of the investment plans in those fabs, more than 80% of the wafer start additions will be not in China. So that's another data point that hopefully allows you to triangulate a little more. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, on the fact you\u2019ve talked about service running at around 20% of revenues. As you clearly increased your installed base over the last couple of years, curious, has that increased and/or when could we see an acceleration for that part of your business? Martin Anstice : Well, I think whether it\u2019s accelerating enough, I'll let you decide. But at least for the last couple of years, we've had a pretty intense focus on broadening our work I would say to a customer. So advanced services agenda and a creative use of software, really employing strategies around machine learning and harnessing the data from the information that's available to us and to our customers in ways that create value, whether it\u2019s productivity oriented or extendibility oriented, there's a number of very meaningful projects. The business has been growing faster than the pace of the installed base and it continues to do so this year. And I would say we would expect the momentum in kind of the \u201918 to be stronger than \u201917 on that point. But it takes some time right and you develop new products and services, there's no magic depending on swing. It takes a number of years to really demonstrate and deliver the value and have the customer convicted that transition makes sense for them. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And just as a follow up, when you think about the back half and I'm not asking for shipment guide, but as you think about mix and I think the takeaway from some of your comments earlier is that deferred revenues should help revenues exchange shipment from Q4. Curious how we should be thinking about gross margin trajectory in the second half? Doug Bettinger : C.J., the guidance I gave you as you think to margin percentages, even though we\u2019re maybe not exactly on the financial model, we provided to you the margin percentages in the financial model are still good guideposts if you will in terms of how to model our business. So I\u2019d encourage you to go back and have a look at what we shared with you in November there. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution. On your view on better foundry and logic spend, of that incremental spending improvement, does it include a bottoming out of the number of customers relative to your prior view and is the incremental spend more leading edge 10 and 7 or more follow through on legacy 28 nanometer. Martin Anstice : Most of the increment was ten at least compared and contrasted with our comments of the last earnings call and I don't know that our expectations for broadening are any different today than they were then. We expected there to be a number of customers making those investments and it's kind of playing out that way. Maybe one of the things I could have actually added earlier and maybe I\u2019ll do it now, Harlan, is when we look at our first half, second half, we believe that the first half memory is stronger than the second half memory from a shipments point of view and logic foundry is stronger second half than first half. So that's our view of kind of wafer fabrication equipment spending balance in the first half, second half by segment. Harlan Sur : Thanks for the insights there, Martin. And then on the strong memory shipment environment, what we're hearing probably the same thing you guys are is that DRAM and NAND suppliers are kind of hand to mouth right, in other words, the shipping whatever they can build even always in the seasonally weaker March quarter, so I guess my question is, are you sensing more urgency to drive accelerated node migrations Whether that 1X for DRAM or 64 layers for NAND, I\u2019m just wondering if we're going to see a step up in node migration cadence just given the industry supply constraints. Martin Anstice : Interesting question. I don't know if I would articulate a cadence message. I mean clearly there's a commitment to technology in conversions in memory and DRAM this year and that was a big part of the increments year-over-year from a spending and overall performance of the company. But I still don't think we're modeling any more than 25% of the installed base at the 1X node by the end of this year. So that\u2019s a reference there and maybe there's a statement on cadence, but there's clearly momentum and ambition to 64 layer devices. But if you look at the installed base of 3D NAND capacity at the end of this year, there's still a pretty broad mix of 3D capacity, right. So not only is there the reality that approximately half of the NAND installed base is 3D capable, there is the dynamic that some proportion of that 3D capable device is 32 player device capable, some proportion is 48 and some proportion is 64. So there's a long way to go with the installed base and supply chain, independent of the demand story. Operator : Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a few questions. First is, there are some concerns that the second derivative of the 3D NAND wafer additions has peaked. Clearly, you had opportunity to gain share going from 2D to 3D, as you address the biggest portion of the market, but let's say the number of 3D NAND wafer addition next year is exactly the same as this year in 2018. How should we think about your revenue opportunity to NAND and technology or help you do better than what you did this year. Martin Anstice : I have no idea. I mean it\u2019s such a precise question with due respect. I mean, the complexity of the customers\u2019 roadmap and spending, there are so many moving parts on that. I mean the best I can give you is that you got to take your own position on how much legitimate demand there is for 3D nonvolatile memory. We're pretty optimistic, but you make your own call on that. Whatever the level of demand that there is, Lam Research is going to perform better than the average equipment company maybe by a long way and that's the message we've tried to convey in terms of the criticality of etch and deposition in the device manufacturing process flow and it's the message that we try to articulate relative to critical applications, market share etch and dep at the 90% level. And it's the message that we've tried to articulate in terms of market share generally from plaintiffs to 3D which is almost a double digit gain in market share. So whatever it is, Lam Research is going to be a company in the mix of equipment companies that will be on the kind of upper end of the scale of performance as long as we keep executing in the ways that we have demonstrated in the last several years. I apologize I can\u2019t answer directly your question, but hopefully that context is helpful. Sidney Ho : That's super helpful. Maybe switching to foundry and logic, in the past, you talked about yours and maybe in the dep etch clean opportunity goes up a lot every node, I think just comment on your share gains in this segment, but at the same time, TSMC, again, this is probably not new, but last week, they talked about the capital intensity probably stayed within pretty stable range over next few years. Can you help us square those comments and when it\u2019s going up a lot and when it\u2019s kind of flattish? Martin Anstice : Yeah. I mean, obviously, the comments from any one customer are going to be WFE comments and the comments have come from the company, from us or segment specific, right. So our story is generally as you articulated in the microprocessor space. I think we've conveyed now for a couple of years a very different reality of engagement with the customer than was true five years ago and as I already noted again by repeating the disclosure of the last earnings call, our market share momentum in foundry has also been positive through the 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer transitions and all of that is true and supplemented by the fact that through the 10 and 7 and 5 nanometer technology roadmap, the proportion of SAM in etch and deposition systematically increases with the adoption of EUV that\u2019s I would say the consensus adoption assumptions and that's really a commentary on the progress that's been made in the economics of multi-patterning and it's a commentary on the insertion of EUR with a multi-patterning process flow and it's a commentary on probably 70% of multi-patterning integration schemes being spacer based. So there's a lot of kind of moving parts, but pretty positive story I think independent of the overarching statement that you've made and maybe one last point, logic and foundry are as invested as ever if not more so in utilizing their installed base and that will continue to be true for all of our customers. Operator : The next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. Martin, I had a question on 2018. I realize we're early here, but \u2013 Martin Anstice : We lost you. Satya Kumar : Operator, are you there? Operator : I am. We will move on to our next question. The next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on good result and guide. Martin, you were a keynote speaker at SEMICON China in March, I Just wanted to know if you're confident in domestic Chinese spending based on discussions in China is higher about the same than what was three months ago. Martin Anstice : It's about the same and I would say as a context, I'm a keynote speaker in SEMICON conferences all around the world. So I don't read too much into, I happened to show up in China. So we continue to believe there's substance to their ambition. We continue to believe they're working really hard and as is true for our customers globally, our job is to support as best we can and that's true for every customer wherever they are. Atif Malik : Great. And then as a follow up, can you talk about the image sensor market? In your 37 billion plus WFE outlook, how big is the image sensor opportunity and what are the trends you're seeing in that market this year? Martin Anstice : Yeah. I don't know Atif that we've quantified it specifically and I don't think we're going to today. What I would tell you directionally relative to last year is it\u2019s stronger this year than it was last year, probably not as strong as it was the year before, but we're seeing nice momentum in image sensor and it's a very etch and deposition intensive process and our position is strong. Our share position is very strong. Operator : We\u2019ll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Weston Twigg : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, just wanted to ask about DRAM. You said your outlook hasn't changed much for this year yet, but I'm just wondering as you look out in to 2018, big growth is pretty hard to come by, are you expecting some of that positive view on 2018 to come from DRAM capacity expansion in fabs? Martin Anstice : We're not assuming much of anything in terms of increased wafer stocks I would say in DRAM just as a general modeling statement and I'd say that for 18 as much as they would \u201917 and maybe even \u201920. I mean I think our long term model is basically kind of flat lined wafer stocks in DRAM. The spending is all about technology conversion. Generally speaking, the demand statement is all about content more than units of any one device and there are some really interesting kind of demand opportunities for our customers and clearly there are some rumors I would say at various points in time around speculating of increased investments if and when our customers start articulating that, then obviously we're well positioned than we would participate naturally in that as strongly as we have in our past. Weston Twigg : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondarily, just looking ahead on 3D NAND scaling, you\u2019ve talked about having good positions through 64 layer and trying to get good positioning for the 96 layer process, but just wondering if you're seeing a continued push for increased layer height from customers or if they\u2019re finding the scaling challenges are limiting then, you'll see them sort of double up on string stacking doublings layers of 64 or 48 for example. Martin Anstice : Yeah. I mean I think the industry is at a still and customers specifically are still working through the answers to those questions. From a traditional scaling point of view, vertical scaling point of view, I mean we have customer engagements that extend beyond the 96 layer. So we\u2019re actively working with customers of that layer count in its element environment and as is true, if a customer can continue the same integration scheme and same equipment selection and the same materials, they\u2019ll work really hard to do that. So I think if the solutions that exist technically work for people from a productivity point of view, then it's much more likely to be a continuation of the same trend. But the industry is just beginning its transition to 64 layer device architecture and there's a lot of learning ahead of the industry. So I see both scenarios potentially playing out with an overwhelming bias to stay with vertical scaling as an architectural choice just because it's the lowest risk path normally. Operator : And we have another question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Yeah. Thanks. Hopefully, I don't get cut off this time. Martin, I had a question on 2018. I realize we're early here, but when you think about the multiple growth opportunities you're exposed to, what are you most excited about into 2018 and on the flip side, what do you worry about the most? Martin Anstice : I'm really excited about where the electronics industry is generally. I mean, from my perspective, I don't know that in my 16 years of this industry and this company, I'd be more excited by the diversity of kind of innovation and opportunity for the silicon roadmap. I think it's just tremendous time. And if you're investing consistent with that opportunity, you've got a nice future ahead if you can kind of keep executing and solving very complex technical problems. So I'm really excited and that's a very holistic statement on some pretty compelling diverse -- device diverse application technology drivers that are relevant to cloud and enterprise and mass storage agendas as well as the advanced computation agenda that is necessary to really harness the value out of a connected world. So I mean that's the excitement for me. None of that can happen without a silicon roadmap. So that's pretty cool. What am I most worried about? I am not worried about that much if I'm honest with you in the long term. I mean you've got to keep executing and this is a hard industry. We have to work really hard to do what we do. So our focus and our intensity around operational execution is something that takes a lot of hard work. The macro is an unknown and uncontrollable and hence the focus on flexibility and variability in our business model and the technical challenges don't get easier, but I feel like the technical depth of our company is one of our strengths. Toshiya Hari : Okay. Great. And then I had a follow up on the logic business. I was a little bit surprised how low system shipments were in Q1 or the March quarter. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about the CMOS image sensor business potentially picking up off of a low base in 2016 and you've also talked about some market share or potential market share gains in the microprocessor space going forward. So when should we expect the logic segment of your business to pick up meaningfully from a shipment and revenue perspective? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : I\u2019ll give you a comment, Toshiya. I think March is probably the low point in terms of what the calendar year looks like from a system shipment standpoint in the logic and other, it\u2019s going to strengthen through the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. In terms of NAND, I think you're talking about little bit of a higher percentage of wafers on 3D at year end. I think you said 700,000 before and now saying a little over half, which I think is north of 750. Is that incremental supply do you think or am I being too literal about that or is that sort of more conversion from plaintiff to 3D? Martin Anstice : Actually, on the fly, I don't know that I know that there's a particular bias one way or the other. It was and continues to be at least in terms of wafer starts to pretty balanced year between kind of new greenfields and the conversion, maybe slightly more conversion, but it is pretty balanced. And certainly our expectations at the end of calendar \u201917 for shipped capacity in active qualification mode kind of similar to the level that\u2019s going into the year. So no real story in terms of supply and demand imbalance. Joe Moore : Okay. And then where do you see the end point on that mix. You have these fully depreciated planar fabs, do you think there's a long tail on that capacity or will you see conversion to either 3D or to DRAM over time? Martin Anstice : Yeah. I mean, the customers obviously are most qualified to answer that question. As best as I can tell, there was an intended conversion of the majority of the installed base over a period that runs probably four years from now. And that's without kind of the conversation around the secular demand trends and what that means for kind of bid growth and so on and so forth. So I believe if we're sitting here in four years\u2019 time, there will still be some planar installed base, but it will be a minority. Doug Bettinger : Will be very small, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from Romit Shaw with Nomura Investment. Romit Shaw : Yes. Thank you. Doug, I heard you just refer others back to the financial model from November. But back then, you had a basically a 2019, 2020 target of 26% operating margin on like 8.5 billion to 9.3 billion in revenue and this quarter, it looks like you're going to be run rating at the high end of that range and operating margin is going to come in per guidance at about 27%. So with all due respect, the model does feel a little bit stale and I guess my question is if we're to assume that LAM can get to 10 billion annualized at some point in the future, how do we think about operating margin? Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Romit with all due respect, 27 and 26 isn\u2019t wildly different. So me guiding you back the model is a place that you ought to gravitate towards. I don't have a model out there that's a $10 billion model, Romit, but if there was one, it probably would be better profitability than the $9 billion model. There is leverage in the model. You've seen it from us as we've grown and I would expect that you would continue to see it if we were to grow beyond the high end of what I have out there right now. Romit Shaw : Okay. The other question I had was just on the decision to do an accelerated buyback, just given the strong share performance and the potential for repatriation, can you guys just talk a little bit about timing here? Doug Bettinger : When we announced the buyback, it was $1 billion program, $1 billion buyback over a 12 to 18 month timeframe. As we executed through it, I felt like getting into the June quarter, we needed to step up the pace a little bit to execute to what we said we're going to do and that's what we're doing and why we're doing a little bit more in June. And yet Romit, I wish I'd done it a quarter ago when the share price was lower, but hindsight's always 2020 with stuff like that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Most of the questions have been asked. I have two follow ups. Going back to your Analyst Day presentation, specifically on 3D NAND, you were saying that the 96 layer 3D NAND should start being investment for 96 layer 3D NAND should start sometime in late 2018 early 2019. Should we expect another round of bakeoff for that particular node? And if that's the case, is that going to happen early \u201918 and I have a follow up? Martin Anstice : Well I think the reality of frankly the entire industry, not just NAND is, if a customer can keep doing what they're doing which is a commentary on materials and device architecture and process flow and equipment selection, they have every interest to do that because that's where the learning is and these are hard problems and challenges. So that tends to, not that any one of us are isolated from the competitive realities of life. But once you have high volume manufacturing positions and you have a learning that other people do not, your positions are generally very strong. So there is nothing extraordinary about the 96 layer structure in terms of how the customer will sink through and select equipments and we have the strongest high volume manufacturing position in the segments of our industry. So it doesn't mean we don\u2019t have to work hard, because we do. But we feel confident about the future of the company and the trajectory of our performance we've described to you. Mehdi Hosseini : And a quick follow-up for Doug, you have above $18 net cash per share, how much of that is onshore versus offshore and what are your plans for the cash that is offshore in case there's no change to taxation? Doug Bettinger : Mehdi, we finished last quarter, I think it was probably about -- maybe a little bit about 30% onshore, so about 70% offshore. Whole question around tax reform and when or if or what have you obviously is very topical and feels like every day, it's a little bit different. We're very much taking a wait and see approach, now whether or not to be any tax reform, there's a variety of different ways you navigate through that. But I'm more encouraged today than ever that we're actually going to get something done. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Kumar, I turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Satya Kumar : Yes. Thank you all for joining us and that concludes the conference call. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you, Satya. We delivered another record quarter, highlighted by over $3 in earnings per share and reported for the first time in the company's history nearly $5 billion in cumulative shipments in the first half of the calendar year. Shipments, revenue, profit margins and EPS were all well above the midpoint of our guidance range for the June quarter. In this context, I would like to thank sincerely our customers for the opportunity to contribute to their success, and our employees for their dedication and hard work, making these achievements possible. We will first start with a short update on near-term demand trends, add some context to the drivers behind our success over the last several years, and frame the exciting and sustainable opportunity we believe the company has going forward. As a brief headline, since our last earnings call, DRAM and NAND demand-driven spending both have increased our expectations for calendar 2017 and calendar 2018 company performance. We have continued investing in capacity and flexibility for business success. Our operational execution and performance we believe continues to set a competitive standard in our industry. Demand trends are robust, particularly in memory both in enterprise and consumer end markets. Applications such as machine learning and artificial intelligence are foundational to the next generation of technology innovation, and they are driving strong memory content growth for DRAM and NAND that offer attractive economics for our customers. The substantial density increases made possible by 3D NAND are driving strong content growth for high-end smartphone devices this year. Combined, we see tremendous opportunity over the next several years for robust, non-volatile memory growth in consumer end markets driven by innovations such as AR/VR, 5G, automated driving, robotics, and other IoT applications. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the opportunity for a silicon-enabled, comprehensive global technology and applications revolution. With these trends, memory-supply-demand balance remains tight, and our memory customers are on track to generate record performance, with memory industry revenues in 2017 poised to exceed $100 billion for the first time ever. Consistent with this demand-driven growth, our customers are planning incrementally higher capital spending levels both in DRAM and NAND. Underscoring our belief that spending levels are demand-driven and sustainable, memory industry capital intensity is on track to remain stable at approximately 20%, consistent with long-term averages and well below prior cycle peaks of 30% to 35%. Non-memory spending plans remained strong and essentially unchanged versus our prior expectations with a primary focus on technology inflections. Overall, industry WFE spending is now tracking above the high end of the previous range we provided. And we currently maintain a positive view on a strong customer spending environment once again in 2018. The improvements in WFE this year have led to increased Lam performance expectations for the calendar year, and now a relatively balanced outlook for our shipments first half to second half. Worthy of note, our full calendar year shipments are on track to significantly exceed the rate of WFE growth once again in 2017. Related, having previously highlighted the potential for calendar year shipments slightly below $9 billion, we now target slightly below $10 billion. This is a commentary of increased strategic relevance and effective scaling, also a commentary on the competitiveness of the right products and services at the right time. As we target this new milestone of slightly less than $10 billion in annual shipments for calendar 2017, I would like to take a moment to reflect upon an incredible journey, a journey that provides the context for Lam's ability to continue to drive long-term, sustainable and profitable growth for all our stakeholders. 10 years ago, Lam was a single-product etch company with an addressable market of 10 to 15 percentage points of WFE that was itself a highly cyclical and relatively low growth market, very leveraged to the PC. With solid strategy, execution and support from our customers over the last 10 years, we succeeded in several important ways. We built Lam etch market share to an unmatched technology and market share position deep-rooted in our leading-edge capabilities and our commitments to partnership with our customers. We transitioned from a single-product company to a diversified multi-product and services company, extending from etch leadership into clean and the deposition markets. Combined with a strong focus on identifying and positioning ahead of key technology inflections in semiconductor device manufacturing over many years, we have added over 20 percentage points to our addressable market, which now exceeds 35% of WFE. Additionally, while further strengthening our leadership in memory, we have diversified our revenue exposure through a strengthened position in logic and foundry market. And notably, our customer support business group through its innovative products, advanced services and productivity solutions continues to deliver growth at a pace that is greater than our installed base unit growth. Expansion of our served market and market share, combined with solid execution that delivered unmatched multiyear growth and value expansion, is the financial headline of Lam. But perhaps what is more important relative to sustainability of value creation is customer trust and the increased strategic relevance of Lam products and services to the success of our customers. As a statement of relative performance, we believe the opportunity for Lam is compelling. With a very strong foundation, I believe we are today entering another exciting phase in our evolution. Data is the new currency of the global economy. The collection, storage and analysis of big data to produce artificial intelligence and machine learning has the potential to change nearly every industry. This trend, we believe, is leading to sustainably higher demand for memory spending. Indeed, memory capital spending has grown at a 20% CAGR over the last four years, about twice as fast as the growth rate of overall industry CapEx. Our analytics endorse the conviction of our customers to the sustainability of bit density and diverse applications demand growth and the discipline of their investment. Lam technology and market leadership comes at a time when the semiconductor industry increasingly embraces vertical scaling as a key driver of performance improvement rather than simply traditional shrink. Vertical scaling is certainly a sweet spot for Lam. We have the highest market share in etch and deposition markets combined of any market participant. Our commitment and investments in R&D and a disciplined approach to product pipeline and road map over multiple years, combined with a focused operational execution and rapidly growing installed base, provide a consistent feedback loop to further solidify our positions of leadership. We will talk more about the opportunities we see in vertical scaling at a special reception that the company will be hosting on August 9 at the Flash Memory Summit Conference here in California. Rick Gottscho, our Chief Technology Officer, Satya and I very much look forward to engaging with many of you there, as a preamble to our planned Investor and Analyst Meeting in a few months. When we think about our future beyond the next several years, we believe our competitive and business strengths, our operating capabilities, and the environment around us, all combine to create tangible opportunity for Lam to further deliver long-term value creation. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and expertise in manufacturing, supply chain, and our sales channel, that each, we believe, are foundational to creating shareholder value in all current and future market opportunities. Our vision continues to optimize long-term and short-term success to the best of our abilities. Our vision continues to balance investing in the sustainable and profitable growth of Lam through the introduction of disruptive technology and incremental market offerings. Our vision is to realize full value from natural technology extensions of our company, and our vision includes an ongoing commitment to capital redistribution. With that, let me turn the call over to Doug. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Okay. Great. Thank you, Martin, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon during what I know is a busy earnings season. We're pleased with the results we have to share with you today for both the June quarter and for our just concluded fiscal year 2017. So let me go ahead and just jump into the numbers. In the June quarter, we performed above the midpoint of guidance for all metrics. We delivered record levels of shipments, revenues, cash from operations, gross margin dollars, operating income dollars, and earnings per share for the quarter and for the fiscal year. Each of these metrics achieved strong double-digit growth in fiscal year 2017 compared to the prior fiscal year. We believe these results and milestones clearly demonstrate solid execution against our multiyear outperformance objectives. Our upward trajectory of shipments continued in June quarter coming in at $2.543 billion, which is up 5% sequentially and above the midpoint of the guided range. Shipments for the 2017 fiscal year were $8.586 billion, which was a 46% increase compared to fiscal year 2016. Memory shipments remained strong with the combined memory segment making up 73% of total system shipments, which was in line with the prior quarter. Non-volatile memory accounted for 59% of the shipments, which was up from 50% in the March quarter. Demand for 3D NAND equipment continues to be robust with customers executing their plans for increasing layer counts and improving device densities. DRAM shipments represented 14% of system shipments, which was down from 23% in the prior quarter. Shipments for foundry customers were 22% of system shipments in the June quarter, which was down a little from the 24% in the prior quarter. And finally, the logic and other segment accounted for 5% of system shipments versus 3% last quarter. Revenues for the quarter were again at a record level of $2.345 billion, which was an increase of 9% compared to the March quarter. For fiscal year 2017, the revenues of the company came in at $8.014 billion, which was an increase of 36% compared to the prior fiscal year. Our installed base business contributed approximately 25% of our revenue in fiscal year 2017. The installed base now includes over 45,000 process modules, and with that growth comes an increasing opportunity to sell spare parts, upgrades, productivity solutions, system refurbishment, and other innovative product offerings. We have solid momentum behind our objective to grow the installed base business faster than the growth of the installed base itself, which is an important component of the sustainable cash generation of the company. Gross margin came in above the midpoint of guidance at 46.5%. And as I've shared with you in the past, we expect variability in gross margin on a quarterly basis as a function of number of factors such as business volume, product mix, and customer concentration. Operating expenses in the June quarter grew to $440 million, and that compares to $414 million in the March quarter. And of that OpEx spend, we increased the portion allocated to R&D to about 65%. We're very encouraged by the opportunities we see ahead of us and continue to make strategic investments in R&D programs over a multiyear horizon in support of our customers' road maps and plans. Operating income in the June quarter was at a record level of $650 million, which was up over 12% from the prior quarter. Operating income grew at roughly twice the rate of operating expense, demonstrating the leverage we have in our financial model, and supporting our ability to make strategic investments to sustain our outperformance going forward. For the first time in the history of the company, operating income generated in the fiscal year topped $2 billion. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%, which was up from 26.9% in March and at the high-end of the guided range. The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 13%, and that compares to 12% last quarter. A tax rate in the low to middle teens through the end of calendar year 2017 would be reasonable for you to include in your models. Based on a share count of about 182 million shares, earnings per share for the June quarter came in at $3.11, which was near the high-end of the guidance range. This share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes, with a total dilutive impact of about 18 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. And I'll remind you that dilution schedules for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. And I would just mention that with the increase in our stock price, we have received requests for early conversions of our 2018 and 2041 convertible notes totaling about $300 million. These requests will settle in cash and shares and are comprehended in our September outlook. We returned $587 million of cash to our shareholders during the quarter; $74 million in dividend distributions and $513 million in share repurchases executed largely through a $500 million accelerated share repurchase. The ASR terminated shortly after the close of our June fiscal quarter on June 30. Inclusive of the ASR, we have now completed about 70% of our current $1 billion buyback authorization, and we have repurchased 5.3 million shares at an average share price of $135.55. Now let me transition to the balance sheet. Cash from operations was very strong at $729 million, which was up from $423 million in March. For the fiscal year, the company generated over $2 billion in cash from operations. During the quarter, cash and short-term investments, including our restricted cash increased to $6.3 billion, which was up from $6.1 billion in March. The increase in the cash balance was obviously the result of the cash from operations that we generated offset largely by the capital return program that I referenced. Days sales outstanding improved to 65 days versus 69 days last quarter. Inventory turns were 4.1, down slightly from the 4.2 we saw in the March quarter. At the end of the quarter, deferred revenues were $966 million, which was up from $842 million in March. This number excludes $397 million in shipments to customers in Japan that will also revenue in future quarters. This Japan number was $260 million last quarter, and recall that these Japan shipments remain as inventory carried at cost on our balance sheet. And I'll just do the math for you. The combined deferred bucket now stands at over $1.3 billion as we exited June. Company non-cash expenses during the quarter included the following : $44 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization, and $40 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $35 million in the quarter, which was down from $44 million in March. We exited the quarter with approximately 9,100 regular full-time employees. The growth in head count was in the factory and field, in addition to the R&D organizations. Now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We expect shipments of $2.350 billion plus or minus $100 million, and as Martin mentioned, we are expecting a roughly balanced first half to second half shipment profile. We expect revenue of $2.450 billion again plus or minus $100 million. As we sit here today, we expect that December is likely the high point for both shipments and revenue in calendar year 2017. We're expecting gross margin of 46.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, forecasting operating margins of 28% again plus or minus 1 percentage point, and finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $3.25 plus or minus $0.12 based on a share count of approximately 183 million shares. We're obviously pleased with the financial performance of the company that we reported and guided today. And we believe we're well-positioned with our portfolio of products and services to successfully pursue the opportunities ahead of us. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Martin and I would like to now open the call for questions. Operator : Absolutely. And we'll take our first question today from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. You talked about memory is the driver of the upside to your outlook here. And just curious if you could put some numbers around how you're thinking about WFE for both DRAM and NAND this year and next? We would love to hear your thoughts there. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I think I'm not sure we have that much to add frankly to everything that I've seen, written, read by analysts or other equipment companies. And frankly speaking, the primary purpose of this dialog is to talk about the economics of the company, not the industry. So, what we've tried to articulate, C.J., is an enhanced view of performance this year, so the slightly less than $10 billion shipments reference is an important one, and that embeds in it a commentary on SAM expansion and share growth. And we have opined on kind of the sustainability of spending and a strong kind of outlook for calendar 2018. But as is customary, I like to take a shot at putting a quantitative reference at the beginning of the year and one at the end, and let other people have their moment of glory in the middle. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Let me ask another question then. If I look at what you discussed in terms of shipments and revenues for the full year, it looks like you're going to outgrow WFE roughly by 3 times. And I guess, that's pretty outstanding outperformance. What's the encore next year? How should we think about your relative performance and changes technology-wise that can sustain continued outperformance into 2018, 2019 and beyond? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I think we certainly have a view that the last five years and this year don't end at the end of this year. We're working really hard to make sure that there's an opportunity and demonstrated performance of sustainable growth and outperformance. And the best way to think about that frankly is to think about the commentary that we've made available around our product portfolio increasing its share of wafer fabrication equipment spending. So that comes about from our own investments in new products and capabilities, and it comes about from what I believe is an unmatched positioning of this company to the totality of technology inflections in the industry, and it comes about through device architecture challenges \u2013 device architecture decisions and process flow decisions of our customers. So, we have provided a quantitative reference today that says above 35% of WFE is what we believe we're competing for, you have all of the disclosure, I think, previously on market share, and we see both trends as positive, not just in next year but in the years to come. So, there's an ebb and a flow always on a short-term basis, but I mean we feel really good about long-term demand for silicon-enabled innovation. We feel really good about discipline in the ecosystem, and we feel really good about the unique opportunities for this company. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, C.J. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Moving on, we'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great set of results. Martin, can you just talk about the mix of spending between logic foundry and memory in the second half? The first half was very strong in terms of memory spending, do you expect the second half to be pretty similar in mix or do you expect a change? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. So obviously, there's some company disclosure, which is reasonable balance in shipments first half and second half. When we look at kind of WFE, I think, a more or less memory as an aggregated segment is actually also pretty balanced with kind of DRAM a little stronger in the second half and NAND was a little stronger in the first half. And similarly, kind of foundry and kind of microprocessor, other logic kind of balance themselves out as well. So foundry was a little stronger in the first half, and we believe microprocessor and other logic is a little stronger in the second half. So kind of all in, pretty balanced spending year is the one that we would assume today. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse : Got it. And then I just wanted to ask you a question about the overall services business. If I assume that that mix of business is pretty flat from last year, because I believe at the end of last year also, you had indicated that's 25% of the revenue. So the services business has grown at extremely fast rate at this year. Can you talk about what has driven that exceptional level of growth, which could be about 40% or more from last year to this year? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I mean it's inevitably kind of two or three things. One part of the growth of the installed base business, which is in spare parts and services and upgrades and refurbishments is the size of the installed base, and as Doug talked about in his prepared comments, the installed base has grown significantly in the last five years. So that's kind of baseline number one. The second element of this could be \u2013 is the breadth of products and services that we've made available to the industry, and I think the industry's natural inclination to take a greater advantage of the full portfolio of productivity solutions. So, the installed base business, spares and service and upgrades and refurbishment is all about productivity, generally speaking. It's about making an installed base more productive, and as we've talked about for many, many years, as an industry, the technology challenges don't get any easier, but that's also true for productivity challenges. So, as we introduce advanced products and services focused on productivity and so on and so forth, that plays into the performance of the company. Last thing I would say is that as the technical specifications of device manufacturing are more difficult, that naturally also plays into an enhancement of some elements of the installed base support business. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse : Thank you. That's all I have. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Farhan. Operator : Our next question today comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Congratulations on another well-executed quarter, just solid all around. Maybe stepping back a bit and sort of looking at the end markets' supply and demand dynamics. We had two relatively big memory customers report recently. The CapEx outlook by both looks very healthy, and the view by both is on a go-forward basis, CapEx trends look good on a go-forward basis. That's also in line with some of your prepared commentary. But the market seems to be interpreting higher CapEx as new capacity, new wafer starts especially in DRAM. So it's raising some cyclical red flags here. Given your forward pipeline, your visibility, do you guys see any signs that there will be meaningful uptick in total DRAM industry wafer starts this year or next year, or is more of the DRAM spend focused on accelerating technology migrations on the installed base? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I would say to the best of our abilities, the answer to your question is no, we do not see meaningful expansion of an installed base. Clearly, compared to last year, the investment level in calendar 2017 in DRAM is significantly improved and enhanced. But I think a couple references for you. We do not believe that the installed base in terms of wafer starts of output is any greater at the end of this calendar year than was true at the end of calendar 2015. Statement number one. Statement number two, when we look at kind of capital intensity of memory at the segment level and look at kind of DRAM specifically, it's a long way from kind of creating kind of the anxiety levels that we think would be relevant to kind of cyclical imbalance. Though we have the same conviction that I think is expressed by all, if not most of our customers, around disciplined investment, which doesn't mean it's perfect. I'm sure there's an ebb and a flow from one week and one month from one quarter to the next, but the fundamental headlines around content and density and demand and how that's playing out in terms of spending in a consolidated industry I think are pretty healthy. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for the color there. And then on the installed base business, obviously great to see the continued growth trends there, very stable annuity-like business. I'm assuming that you guys are also driving leverage in this segment, maybe Doug, if you could comment on services' op margin performance versus corporate margins, are service op margins accretive to corporate average? And are you guys able to drive the same amount of leverage that you are for the total business? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah, no. It's a very nice part of the business model. It's very cash-generative. As I think I've indicated before, it's probably a little bit accretive to the operating income on a percentage basis. It doesn't have anywhere near the amount of investment that is required in the new equipment side. But what I really like about it, Harlan, is the broad base of it. It's got many, many, many engagements, lots of customers. It's just a very stable predictable business, and your characterization of an annuity is exactly right, it is a great part of the business model. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Congrats. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you, Harlan. Operator : Moving along, our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, and congrats on the strong results. I had two questions. First on the opportunity in China. If you can talk a little bit about some of the developments over the past couple quarters both on the memory side and the foundry side. Martin, if you can talk a little bit about how you view the second half of 2017 and more importantly longer term? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I mean, again I'm not sure I have kind of too much to say incrementally here. As we've said for the last couple quarters, we believe that China is an increasingly important part of the industry measured by the level of spending. Today, spending in China is dominated by the global player presence in China, but this is a year where there is a foundry, DRAM and flash investments by the domestic Chinese community. And as is consistent with I'm sure every disclosure from every other significant equipment company, we're participating in that, as you might expect, and our presence and our plans in China are at least as good as our average, so it's an important region with an important focus for us. And we would still say today that the calendar 2018 is a bigger story than calendar 2017 for the kind of China. So, certainly that plays into our qualitative statements that we believe calendar 2018 is a strong year for the industry. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then my second question was on the logic business. Martin, I think you briefly talked about shipments being a little bit stronger into the second half relative to the first half. But longer term, obviously, this is a part of the market where you've historically been under-indexed, and at the same time you've talked about some wins at the 10-nanometer node. So, I guess from a timing perspective, when should we expect this part of your business to inflect to the upside in a more meaningful way? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I mean, I guess that it's always true that it shows upward revenues when customers spend money on the applications you've won. There's no pendulum swing here. This is kind of a multiple year transition, and we're super pleased about the progress, which doesn't mean it can't be better, and it doesn't mean our aspirations aren't greater than we currently have achieved. But we're walking towards an objective where the position of the company in logic is at least as good, if not better, than the position of the company in foundry and it will take a number of technology nodes to get to that point, and we're not there today. But I'm super pleased with our progress. And the comments on logic and foundry, I mean I don't want to miss the foundry headline, which we talked about last year. The performance of the company in foundry last year against the average of the industry I thought was just outstanding. So, I think we reported 40% increase year-over-year compared to about a 25% assumption on WFE. So, it's going to take a couple of nodes to kind of fully realize our ambition if we're successful in all respects, and we're certainly working hard to achieve that. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: And Toshiya, it'll be stronger in the second half than it was in the first half for sure. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Congrats again. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question today comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Arthur Su - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, this is actually Arthur on for Edwin. Congrats in a great quarter, and thanks for taking our question. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Sure. Arthur Su - Needham & Co. LLC: Martin, I had a question for you on your natural \u2013 your comment on natural technology extension. So, some of your peers have talked about increasing metrology intensity going hand in hand with more complex 3D NAND devices. Given your leadership in 3D NAND, how do you think about your product portfolio in terms of metrology, does it make sense to offer metrology system under the same roof to provide a more comprehensive solution? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Didn't we try that strategy? You know, and I mean, I guess that wasn't at the heart necessarily of kind of the Lam and KT ambition. But it was an inevitable kind of part of that strategy. Today's kind of process control ambition, metrology ambition is really kind of defined around a couple of things. One of them is that the real-time process control kind of dialog and the second is the potential for some level of integrated metrology. So, we've articulated our ambition, I think, in terms of SAM expansion on that, and the second part of our strategy is to increase the competitiveness of our underlying etch and deposition and clean products by dealing with one of the most fundamental challenges of the industry, which is tighter specs and the need to open up device design and device manufacturing process windows. So that's where our focus is. So, my comments around kind of natural technology extensions were intended to be a little bit more holistic than kind of metrology and process control. And really, this is kind of like not a new headline or new thoughts in the company. But I feel like consistent frankly with the trends of most of the industry participants, I wanted to make sure that everybody understands that we think holistically about how best to harness value from all of the assets and all of the strengths of the company. And so, when we look at that obviously, our vision is to create sustainable, profitable and kind of accretive growth for the company. And by natural extensions, we mean focusing on kind of the assets and the strengths of the company as currently defined, with a requirement for kind of high confidence business plans and leverage in our financial models. So, it's an emerging investment for the company, it's still quite small, I would say. The investment by the company in products and services and markets beyond our core is in the $20 million to $30 million range probably for the year. But I think it's an important part of the long-term vision for the future of the company. Arthur Su - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for that clarification. Just a quick follow-up question. ASML talked about the progress they've made with their EUV tool and the potential that it can address up to 15 layers upon insertion at 7-nanometer. Given your strength in etch and deposition, has that in any way shaped your initial view on your patterning opportunity, and do you believe that Lam is also well positioned to remain competitive due to improving economics of your multi-patterning processes? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah, I think that's a really good point. Actually I mean, every single day from us and every other participant is delivering litho multi-patterning schemes or spacer-based multi-patterning schemes, we're making the economics better. And to answer the first part of your question, the disclosures recently and the editorial hasn't changed our fundamental view of our opportunity. We still believe we have SAM expansion through the 5-nanometer technology node that we've currently kind of articulated in the Analyst Meeting. We triangulate around public statements and private statements from all of the industry participants that all kind of talk to us. We feel like we have nice opportunity. We have decent strength, and that our focus is on controlling the things that we can control and making the best of it. So, nothing new to say, and one big part of the economics of the company quite frankly has been multi-patterning in memory and logic both. Arthur Su - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah, thank you. Operator : Moving on, our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats again, guys, on another great quarter. I had a couple of them. Number one, Martin, if you look at the WFE spend on 3D NAND, obviously it's really healthy driven by \u2013 end demand is obviously greenfield, the yield's are pretty low, there's some conversion from 2D to 3D, kind of curious if any one of those vectors slows down, do you think 3D NAND can sustain in current levels, or are you worried about that going forward? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, I mean, I think the fundamental thing we look at is demand, right, which is not so much a unit conversation these days, it's a content conversation. And when you kind of look at this year and you look at the road map for smartphone content and service content particularly, I mean, I think that's the most important commentary around sustainability of spending because the spending, despite very critical and strategic technology transition this year, is predominantly defined around the importance of responding to demand and keeping supply and demand in balance to the best of our customers' ability, and as an industry participant, we're trying to support that. So, when I think about kind of how they spend money greenfield or conversion 2D to 3D, or 3D scaling, as we articulated in our Analyst Meeting, we're actually agnostic to how they go execute. If you look at the unique elements of the Lam Research serviceable markets, there are pretty similar opportunities for us in both implementations. And our view today is quite similar to the view we had a couple of months ago, more or less the 3D-capable capacity in NAND installed base at the end of the year will be approximately half of the installed base, which is not to say the transition is kind of half done, because in the context of the demand message and the technology road map for this particular inflection, I mean there's a lot of years of opportunity ahead of us, and we're certainly excited about participating and enabling to the extent that we can to the success of our customers. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then another question on the DRAM side, I think you did articulate the fact that you're not seeing a whole lot of capacity expansion, and clearly last year was a cyclical low for DRAM CapEx, and this year it's still below 2015 levels. Is it purely a function of the fact that the number of process steps is increasing as you go below 20 nanometers, it's more difficult to do, that's why even though optically it looks like CapEx is higher, it's not really as high as you think you'd expect it to be? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I don't know if we're completely qualified to answer the full scope of your question. I mean, I will tell you for our piece of the pie, yeah, and this is true in most every part of the industry, the investment in a given kind of wafer outs kind of goes up in technology inflections, and the trick for our customers obviously is making sure that the density in this case or the number of chips on the surface of the wafer goes up in proportion to the increase in kind of cost, and as I think is well-publicized to this point in time, the most challenging part of the semiconductor kind of road map from a kind of long-term perspective is DRAM. Although frankly speaking, there is kind of three or four nodes depending on how you define it in the road map that we have with customers in front of us today. By the end of this year, we estimate that only 25% of the installed base is actually at the 1x technology node. So, there's kind of a decent amount of sustainability and value proposition, I think, in front of the industry for DRAM. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Krish. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It's very helpful. Thanks, Martin. Operator : Our next question today comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Martin, first in terms of the capital intensity trend particularly for etch and deposition where we've seen growth in the percentage of the spend of those two areas, given some of the continued changing dynamics of the industry, do you see both of them continuing to increase maybe at a more moderate level, or does it assume flattened out particularly if EUV comes into play? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: So I think we've articulated as precisely as we can do in our Analyst Meeting, and I'd pull the slides and update the slides for the WFE assumptions that you think are most relevant, but we've articulated with the assumptions made that I think more or less is being reinforced by other disclosures since we made them, insertions in second phase of 7-nanometer and insertions planned in DRAM. Our serviceable market increases through the end of this decade and probably slightly beyond. So, on that one axis, as I've said, it's a nice opportunity for us and one where we continue to be very focused on. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. That's helpful. Doug, you talked about R&D being 65% of total OpEx. On a going-forward basis given some of the projects you have in hand, do you see that percentage potentially increasing as you keep kind of SG&A as flat as you can, or 65% kind of the right run rate we should be looking at? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah, Patrick. We're going to keep trying to drive that higher obviously. That's the good kind of spending that generates growth in the future. It's not to say every quarter it's going to be up, but on a year-on-year basis, the way we will manage and run the spending of the company will be to try to allow that to grow and still keep the discipline around the financial model in total, and by so doing, get more efficient in SG&A. Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Our next question today comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah, good afternoon. I have a question on the service side of the business. Is the strength that you're seeing there, is that also a reflection of 200-millimeter strength in the industry, or is that not a big part of that equation? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, it's part of the equation. Obviously, and I'd extend maybe that comment beyond the wafer size statement and kind of talk about the non-leading-edge investments of our customers as well. This is a year where, again, the investment levels in 28-nanometer and above for example are significant. And so, in the kind of so-called trailing-edge technology nodes and even 200-millimeter wafer fabs, as Doug said, we're engaged with a lot of fabs around the world, hundreds of fabs around the world. And we're engaged in every active wafer size and technology node, and certainly in the scheme of IoT road maps particularly in the broad set of systems integration that is now kind of the reality for the semiconductor industry that the full spectrum of devices, the full spectrum of wafer sizes continues to be the focus for, as I said before, truly optimizing the value we deliver to customers and truly optimizing the value we create for our shareholders. That's another kind of version frankly of harnessing full value from the company and natural technology extension, bringing kind of expertise and wisdom that we've developed in 300 mm and making it available wherever we can. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah, and Tom, just to add on, as IoT takes off and these analog-y sense-y kind of devices proliferate, the trailing edge is going to be more and more important over time. So, not necessarily just 200 mm as Martin pointed out, but trailing edge capacity between 200 mm and 300 mm is something we're certainly very focused on. Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Great. And then a follow-up, we're starting to hear a little bit more about some domestic OEM semi-cap players as well. Is there anything that changes the landscape as far as the competitive front goes? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: I'm not sure I understood the question, Tom, domestic OEM... Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Just some Chinese domestic players. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Oh, it's China. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I don't think there's a headline of significance. We obviously respect everybody that we get to compete with, and with rare exceptions, the players that exist in China today have been players that have been there for some years. And we wish them well, but we do our best to excel in the markets worldwide including China. So, nothing new to articulate today. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. We're pretty good at doing what we do, Tom. We spend $1 billion in R&D. So it's hard to compete with that level of scale. Not that, as Martin pointed out, we're not paying attention to everybody and paranoid about everybody, but it's hard to do the stuff that we're doing. Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Oh, thanks for taking the question. The first was just an operational question, Martin, to follow up on a point that you made that the company is getting to a $10 billion in annual shipment level, and congratulations on that milestone. The growth from $5 billion to $10 billion has been very fast, and the company's managed that very efficiently. As you look at the next leg of growth for Lam, what are the biggest challenges to maintaining the same level efficiency that you've had from $5 billion to $10 billion to whether it's $12 billion or $14 billion in shipments? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, the gray hair transition for me is done. So, now it's about losing hair, I guess, for the next transition. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: So, you get a little lighter. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: And I'm taking care of that for you, Martin. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: So, frankly speaking, I appreciate your recognition, number one, and your statement about efficiency, it's really hard to scale the company at the pace we are over a multiple year period. And I'll speak again to the employees and the suppliers and the customers quite frankly doing partnership kind of make all of this possible. We take pride in the business model. It's a business model that has been in place for as long as I've been in the company, which is now 16 years I think. And business model flexibility in investing to create kind of capability and capacity to respond to uncertainty in the industry holistically is kind of what our focus is. And the three elements of that you've really got to kind of deal with in terms of variability are kind of factory, supply chain, and service. And what you do in parallel is make sure you never compromise your investment in fundamental research and never compromise your investment in concept and feasibility and product pipeline because that must kind of exist under any conditions if you're going to take seriously owning kind of long-term success to your company. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for that color. The follow-up is for Doug. Doug, you mentioned that you'll be working through the ASR, what are the priorities for cash and cash return beyond share repurchase under the existing program? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. So, what I said maybe not very clearly is we're about 70% through the current buyback authorization. We authorized $1 billion and announced it at our Analyst Day back in November. And I'll remind you at that point, we meaningfully grew the dividend as well. I mean, I would expect to give you a more definitive update when we get to that November Analyst Day. We're going to keep chugging along the current authorization, and it likely will be close to completion in the November timeframe probably, and at that point, I'll be ready to give you a more definitive future what the next leg of this looks like, but it's likely going to be a continued commitment to a meaningful return of capital to shareholders, how and what, in what amount, I'm going to save for November. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Craig. Operator : Our next question today comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik - Citigroup: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Martin, if I look at your guidance here, you're probably around like $41 billion WFE run rate, couple of your peers at Semicon talked about $40 billion to $45 billion as kind of the new baseline for wafer fab equipment spending, understand you guys are positive on next year, would love to get your thoughts if $40 billion is kind of the new baseline for the next three years? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, I think as kind of Doug said in a conference kind of mid-quarter, we don't kind of not align to the types of statements being made broadly in the industry. We don't have kind of rationale to deliver you a different message. So, a number beginning with 4 is a reasonable kind of proxy. I think at the end of the day, sustainability is defined by two things. It's defined by the legitimacy and sustainability of demand, and we see a world of tremendous innovation in software and applications, which is enabled by silicon. And something really special happened in the last several years, and the special was the world of connectivity in cloud and advanced computation kind of showed up at the same time. And so, there's, I mean, a tremendous amount of excitement around that opportunity. And it's much more difficult for us sort of forecast because it's not one device now, it's many. And it's not a unit conversation, it's a content conversation, but that's kind of the nature of the beast. So, when we look at the most fundamental part of answering your question demand, we feel very good about it, very excited about that opportunity. The second part of this is all about kind of discipline and balance between supply and demand, and every indicator we have, whether it's supply and demand, statements from a modeling point of view, whether it's ASPs, whether it's inventory levels, whether it's reuse strategies, whatever it is. I mean, the datapoints that we look to continue to suggest much more discipline than not. And so, in the context of what I just described, with the assumption about stable units, an assumption about kind of continued content expansion, an assumption about the legitimacy of our China investments, we feel like there's sustainability to the types of spending levels that we're seeing right now. So, our view is, this is not an aberration. I'm sure it goes up and down along this journey, and we've all got a lot to learn, but it feels quite fundamental from the seats that we have in the semiconductor ecosystem. Atif Malik - Citigroup: Okay. Very helpful, and as a follow-up, in the past, you guys have provided 3D NAND shipped wafer capacity, can you tell us a number for exiting this year? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I'm not going to tell you a precise number, because I don't think it's that much different than what we said before. It's clearly a little higher. But the fundamental headline, which is the one that I really care about, is the opportunity for sustainability of investment that comes from content, and there's some great content messages. And by the end of this year, to the best of our knowledge, about half of the installed base will be 3D device capable in various forms. So there's kind of three or four forms of 3D capacity, and there's a great technology road map with demand, and so that the opportunity is kind of a multiple year opportunity. Atif Malik - Citigroup: Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Atif. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. I have two questions as well, I guess. Maybe just starting on the NAND side, and understand the secular growth narrative that you guys have, I totally get that part. But I'm curious, as you think about the next few quarters there with all the 3D NAND supply that's getting on board, do you see a pause that occurs there, especially in the early part of next year as some of those capacity gets digested? And if 2018 is more conversions, less greenfield, does that have any ramification for Lam? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, on the last part of the question, the kind of greenfield versus conversion, there's almost no implications for Lam. We articulated a reasonably agnostic view of that in our Analyst Meeting. Relative to pauses, I think the industry now collectively, the actions of our customers and the action of their supply chain is now sufficiently fast. But the disconnects are kind of sometimes not even noticeable, and they're much faster than they ever were. So, are there going to be ebbs and flows of investments? Always, but I think much less wild swings than was through in our history. And I guess that's the kind of variability versus cyclicality conversations that we've had a number of times. So maybe there's pauses and accelerations, but the customers will do the right thing. They'll make investment when they have demands to support, and as a supply chain, we're running cycle times today that are fast enough that were collectively responding pretty well to their needs. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. And I guess, if I can just follow up, at the Analyst Day, I think you guys laid out a financial model that talked about \u2013 I don't know \u2013 25%, 26% op margins, $10 to $11 EPS power, 2019-2020 timeframe, right? So far in 2017, at the end of this year, so you seem to be closer to $12 EPS run rate. So, should we think of Lam fundamentally during the high 20% operating margin and potentially higher if the WFE momentum sustains? If not, why should we think of margins coming down towards the mid 20%? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. The first thing I'd tell you is we'll give you new model when we get to the November Analyst Day, we're going to think through kind of investment levels and what that all looks like. If I were you trying to correlate those models to where we are today, I'd essentially run rate the previous model to level of spend you think is occurring this year. And when I do that back of the envelope map, we're probably, I don't know, a half to maybe a full percentage point on an op income above where those models would suggest, and whether we choose to spend a little bit more as we start looking at the numbers, I think we'll decide that as we go through it. But that's generally how I'd be thinking about it if I was you, Amit. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thank you for your time, guys. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Martin Anstice, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Thank you very much. So, I'd just like to say a couple of things in closing of today's call. The first thing is to say thank you to those of you that were complementary about the performance of the company and kind of recognized the journey and the accomplishments, because a lot of people worked really hard to achieve that, which is my second comment. And I recognize I made this in prepared comments, but I'd like to do it again now. None of this would be possible without the commitment and support of all of our employees in every function, in every location around the world, and people are working extremely hard to scale the company in the way that we are, and I extend that thanks also to the supply chain community that makes this possible. And last but not least, to the really important stakeholder, the customer, because without the customer's partnership and support, we wouldn't be telling the story that we are. So, in closing, a big thank you to a lot of people, it's a privilege to be part of this company, and a privilege to have an opportunity to tell the story that we do. Thank you for your time, attention, and interest in Lam Research. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm and a brief follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Satya. And thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. Lam delivered another outstanding quarter, with September shipments, revenue and gross margins above the midpoint of our guidance range; and operating margins and EPS above the high end of our guidance range. I'd like to thank our employees, our suppliers and our customers for their active support and confidence in Lam. With enhanced opportunity, we have enhanced responsibility to contribute to the success of our customers. And in that context we are inspired to achieve our full potential. Calendar 2017 appears destined to be another terrific year of out performance for Lam, a year that materially exceeded the expectations we had communicated at the beginning of the year for levels of demand-driven customer CapEx and our business as a direct result. The midpoint of our December quarter shipment guidance today reflects growth of approximately 50% year-over-year, nearly double the consensus growth expectations for WFE in 2017 and putting us on track to gain over 2.5 percentage points of ship share of WFE in the calendar year.  Based on our internal analytics, we continue to expect a strong industry spending environment once again in 2018 and essentially align to stated industry consensus at this time. We believe there are enduring drivers behind the sustainability of industry spending levels and our outperformance. Central to the argument on spending sustainability is the growing importance of data and the fundamental role that the road map of silicon is playing. We are entering a new innovation era. Central to the position of Lam outperformance is the increasing scope of industry relevance and competitiveness in the Lam product portfolio today.  The generation, transmission, storage and analysis of increasing quantities of data to create artificial intelligence has the potential to transform every segment of the economy, and we believe Lam Research is positioned comprehensively to capitalize on that strength. The last decade saw the transition from a PC-centric to a mobile-centric world. We expect the next decade is defined by a transition to an AI-centric world. Mobile devices have enabled an incredible platform of almost four billion global smartphone users, which allows for the rapid delivery and scaling of new AI-enabled services on a growing array of IoT devices and systems.  Together, these trends are resulting in semiconductor industry revenue growth rates accelerating from an average of just over 2% in the last six years to over 15% in 2017. Even more important than revenue and profit growth, a dramatic diversification in end use demand bodes well for our future. The critical role of data in this market transition is particularly positive for memory and storage semiconductor demand in the cloud and also IoT. This is strength and opportunity both for Lam. Cloud computing is a foundation for extremely data-intensive applications, which is driving strong demand for bit growth in server DRAM and NAND of over 30% and 50%, respectively. For IoT devices, we are in early stages of adoption of exciting new technologies like 3D cameras, AR and VR, and broad automation trends. This is driving over a 40% demand bit growth in these NAND markets. Combined, these demand trends and disciplined investment by our customers are driving record revenues in the memory semiconductor segments, which is on track to grow approximately 60% to about $130 billion in 2017 at strong levels of profitability. We see our customers increase their spending at sustainable and rational levels to respond to these long-term trends, with memory capital intensity slightly lower in 2017 when compared to the last two years. As we have stated previously, the products and services portfolio of Lam Research is unmatched, we believe, in its broad fit to the primary technology inflections of the industry. Our focus is to further increase this position of leadership and strategic relevance through a commitment to disruptive and customer-enabling technologies. During our presentation at the recent Flash Memory Summit, we offered perspective that lithographic strengths alone are no longer able to provide the device performance and cost improvements that are required to drive with these megatrends in end demand. Logic devices require new solutions to deal with dark silicon and Dennard scaling limitations. DRAM devices require new solutions to deal with signal-to-noise scaling issues, and NAND devices require new solutions to deal with cell-to-cell interference and reliability. Technology inflections such as vertical scaling, multi-patterning, advanced transistor and interconnect technologies, and advanced packaging are all critical in addressing these challenges to deliver necessary device performance improvements. These inflections are fundamentally enabled by etch, deposition and clean technologies, resulting in our served markets growing significantly faster than WFE again this year. We believe this trend is sustainable. Anticipating these and future inflections, we grew our R&D investments by nearly 60% in the last four years, reporting during the same period 140% growth in revenues. We continue to release significant capability enhancements across our portfolio, and we have the strongest commitment in our history to new concepts, technologies, products and services from R&D. These investments continue to pay off, with significantly more wins and successful defenses than not this year. Calendar 2017 is a stronger market share performance year for Lam than calendar 2016. Although with SAM expansion, this held less than half of our outperformance story. In addition to maintaining our leadership position of vertical scaling in 3D NAND, we had several new wins during the quarter across a spectrum of DRAM, NAND and Logic devices, and across the process flow in front-end transistors, middle of line as well as advanced interconnect. In dielectric etch, we extended our momentum in critical transistor contract applications by delivering differentiated atomic layer etching solutions that resulted in a new PTOR position at a second-leading foundry. We continue to maintain strong conductor etch positions, with increasing adoption of advanced technology and productivity options on our Kiyo conductor etch products at leading edge foundry and memory makers. In deposition, we won PTOR position for advanced cobalt interconnect at a major foundry. We had multiple wins for new applications in atomic layer deposition for both dielectric and metal film applications for non-volatile memory devices. To further expand our value proposition, we recently acquired Coventor, a market leader in 3D modeling and simulation in our industry. The addition of Coventor supports Lam's vision that advanced process and equipment control capabilities further enhance our competitiveness, our time to market and enable us to deliver significant incremental value to our customers. Already the potential value proposition of harnessing Coventor\u2019s modeling expertise with Lam\u2019s process and physical characterization capabilities to deliver more simulation and virtual fabrication for the development of next-generation devices has been reinforced by the excitement and substance of discussions within our engineering and collaboration partner communities. The growing strength of our systems business is further enhanced by our strong Customer Support Business Group, which continues to deliver advanced productivity and technology improvements to the installed base and actively promote new product offerings in support of MEMS automotive power management and IoT device innovation. This business, which represents approximately one quarter of our company revenues currently is on track to deliver another record year of growth at a rate significantly faster than the rate of installed base growth this year, a byproduct of an enhanced portfolio and the strategic fit of the business with our customers\u2019 needs. Combined, these strategies have extended our differentiation and deliver consistent outperformance for Lam. We are on track to grow significantly faster than WFE and our served markets this year. Over the last four years we have grown our shipments by 25% CAGR to approximately $10 billion this year at approximately twice the growth rates of both WFE and our largest and peers and competitive combined in the equipment industry. As we look ahead to 2018 we expect to build on this momentum with over 90% of customer decisions on PTOR selection decisions already made and on the back of what already looks to be another strong year for industry CapEx spending. In conclusion, we are encouraged by the scale and sustainability of Lam opportunity and we continue to invest in extending our differentiation and strategic relevance to our customers. We believe these dynamics position us well to continue to outperform. With that let me turn the call that over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We posted another solid quarter delivering results above the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics and extending our positive momentum heading into the end of the calendar year. Revenue, operating income, cash from operations and earnings per share were again at record levels in the September quarter and overall the company continues to perform well against our financial and operational objectives. Shipments for the quarter came in at $2.382 million down 6% from the record high level we delivered last quarter and just above the midpoint of our guided range. The combined memory segment made up 66% of system shipments which was down from 73% in the prior quarter. Non-volatile memory shipments represented 49% of the system shipments, which was down from 59% in the June quarter. DRAM shipments ticked up in the quarter, coming in at 17%, compared to 14% last quarter. Our customers continued to invest in technology migrations at a rational and sustainable level to support demand growth in the mobile and server markets. DRAM pricing continues to be strong, supporting the increased investments. System shipments into the foundry segment made up 21% of this total, down slightly from 22% in the June quarter. Foundry spend was biased towards investments to execute the 10-nanometer ramp, as well as 7-nanometer pilot projects. Logic and other shipments increased nicely in the September quarter accounting for 13% of system shipments, compared to 5% in the previous quarter. This record level of logic and other shipments is the highest percentage for us since the June 2015 quarter and is the highest in absolute dollars in the history of Lam. This increase in shipments was driven by the ramp of our application design wins at 10-nanometer, as well as broadly higher demand for applications in image sensors, as well as power management devices. September quarter revenue came in at $2.478 billion which is up 6% from the June quarter. Gross margin for the period came in at 47.2%, which was an improvement of 70 basis points and again above the midpoint of our guidance. Our gross margin performance as always is determined by several factors, such as overall business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter Operating expenses were essentially flat at $438 million, compared to $440 million in the June quarter. Expenses came in a bit lower than the implied guidance as we adjusted our outlook for variable compensation for the year. We continue to focus our spending toward innovative R&D programs that are enabling our customers\u2019 roadmaps. Operating expenses declined as a percentage of revenue to 17.7% which was down from 18.8% in the prior quarter. Operating income in the September quarter was $733 million, up 13% from $650 million last quarter. Operating margin increased to 29.6%, which was up from 27.7% in the June quarter and again above the guidance range. Operating profitability was very strong in the quarter driven by higher revenue, as well as the improvement in gross margin. The tax rate for the quarter was 14%, compared to 13% last quarter. For the December quarter I'd be modeling a rate in the low to middle teens. Based on a non-GAAP share count of approximately 181 million shares, earnings per share for the September quarter came in at $3.46, which was above the guided range. The share count includes dilution from both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes. The net dilute of impact from the notes is approximately 17 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. As we noted during last quarter's earnings call, with the increase in our stock price we've received requests for early conversions of our 2018 and 2041 convertible notes. Conversions that settled in the September quarter totaled $302 million of which $209 million related to the 2018convertible bond and $93 million to the 2041 bond. Dilution schedules included updated notional amounts for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with remodeling. We continue to execute on the capital return program we announced in November last year spending approximately $230 million during the quarter in share repurchases, as well as dividends and over $1 billion in the first three quarters of the calendar year. As of the end of the September quarter we had completed approximately 88% of our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization buying back a cumulative total of 6.3 million shares at an average share price of $139.17. We paid out $0.45 per share in dividends or $73 million during the quarter. We now move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash in short-term investments, including restricted cash of approximately $6.4 billion. This was up from $6.3 billion in the June quarter. Cash from operations was strong at $858 million, up from $729 million we generated in the June quarter. Cash generation in the quarter was at a record level enabling us to grow cash while funding the convertible note redemptions, as well as our capital return programs. DSO came in at 56 days down from 65 days in June. Inventory turns came in at four, compared to 4.1 of the prior quarter. Deferred revenues were $938 million. This number excludes $344 million in shipments to customers in Japan, which will revenue in future quarters. Company non-cash expenses including $42 million for equity comp, $39 million for amortization, and $40 million for depreciation. We incurred $60 million for capital expenditures in the quarter. We exited the quarter with 9,800 regular full time employees. Headcount additions came primarily in the field and factory with further additions in the technology areas. Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect record shipments of $2.600 billion plus or minus $100 million. I just mentioned that 30% of the system shipments in December are to new greenfield fabs. We expect record revenue of $2.550 billion again plus or minus $100 million. We expect gross margin of 47.50% plus or minus one percentage point. We're forecasting operating margins of 30% plus or minus one percentage point.  And finally, we\u2019re forecasting earnings per share of $3.65 plus or minus $0.12 based on a share count of approximately 182 million shares. So in summary, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance delivering another quarter of solid operational execution and we\u2019re on track for record financial results for calendar year 2017. Things could always change. As we look into 2018, we continue to see what appears to be a strong year. Our current bias is that shipments in the first half of 2018 will be stronger than the second half of 2017. Shipment momentum heading into the March quarter seems meaningfully stronger to us than it is in December. Before transitioning to the Q&A part of the call, I wanted to share some information about the timing of our Investor Day. We\u2019re now planning to host this event in the March quarter timeframe on an ongoing basis. This timing aligns well for us with executive availability, with the timing of our planning cycle, and with what we think will be a good investor attendance. We\u2019re excited about the sustainable outperformance opportunity we have ahead of us and we look forward to sharing with you a comprehensive update on the company\u2019s plans and objectives at that time. Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Please open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Farhan Ahmad : Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on operating margin. You\u2019re guiding to December quarter to 30%, which is meaningfully higher than the long term target model that you\u2019ve shared last time, which was at 28%. Can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s a sustainable level of margins for the business and assuming that the business can grow from here. Do you \u2013 should be thing that there\u2019s upward bias to the operating margin? Martin Anstice : Yeah, Farhan I mean, I\u2019ll give you new \u2013 formally give you a new model when we get to the Analyst Day. I mean the way we\u2019d would be thinking about it, when I look at gross margin right now, it\u2019s probably not going to get much higher than it is right now. In fact, there\u2019s really a bias to be a little bit lower than it is. And then it all comes down to what do you think the revenue levels of the company are. We clearly have delivered in the last several years leverage to spending. And as business volumes increase we would continue to deliver that leverage, I\u2019m not going to quantify it for you, but that would be the way I think about it and then stay tuned, we\u2019ll give you a formal update when we get to be Analyst Day. Doug Bettinger : And just, I mean just to supplements, which is maybe some color relative to our thinking and that kind of guides how we run the company. I mean we run the company with a focus on absolute dollars of profitability and our aspiration is to increase the value of our company and outperform relative to increasing the value of our company. And so the profitability that we care about most is a dollar, not a percentage. And the execution of our business on a day-to-day basis requires a very careful balance and certainly the guidance that I provide to the company is intended to claim our fair share of opportunity, our fair share of profitability without compromising the success of our customers, because without the success of our customers our industry is going to struggle. So it is as much a choice as anything else, and the choice is defined by how we optimize performance, and we optimize performance according to dollars of profits and dollars of profit growth. Farhan Ahmad : Thank you. And a quick follow-up in terms of the segment outlook for DRAM, NAND for the December quarter in first half of next year, do you \u2013 how you\u2019re looking at the segment just qualitative guidance and with segment so stroger or weaker? Martin Anstice : Yes, so I would say, I mean Doug already provided a little bit of color relative to the first half of next year just to remind everybody he said, we bias first half of 2018 shipments stronger than the second half of 2017. And he said, shipments momentum meaningfully stronger in March over December as best we see it today.  What I\u2019ll add is, at a WFE level our expectation is probably in the mid-to-high single digit range year-over-year, hence we would expect more than 85% of the growth in the WFE year-over-year to come from memory. Farhan Ahmad : Got it. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Farhan. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from C. J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C. J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question Martin, longer term question on the memory side. Hyperscale guys are asking for longer term supply agreements from chip makers, which is clearly a strategic change and speaks to how much more important memory is and how much more strategic it\u2019s becoming. And so my question to you is, is that changing your relationship at all, your visibility, how you partner with chip makers given this kind of change? Martin Anstice : Yeah, the simple answer to that question is, yes. I do think we have more visibility. We are clearly more relevant to the success of our customers today by virtue of the scope of the portfolio and the relevance of the portfolio to the technology inflections that are \u2013 that we\u2019ve been talking about for some years. We still have to work very hard to do what we do, but I would say relatively speaking visibility and our engagments is stronger consistent with the strengthening of strategic relevance of Lam to the industry. C. J. Muse: Okay. And I guess as a follow-up. Doug you talked about OpEx coming a little lighter in the September quarter related to I guess bonus plans. And so curious does that suggest perhaps a delay in terms of timing of clean room coming online or other factors like that have pushed shipments into the first half of calendar 2018? Doug Bettinger : No, not really C.J. I mean the two are somewhat independent. You always \u2013 I mean, when you get to the second half of the year you start truing things up and your perspective could be a little bit different, and it\u2019s more got to do with what\u2019s going on internally than clean room coming online. There\u2019s a lot of clean room space coming online as we speak, and I think for the most part it\u2019s consistent with what we expected to see, what the industry is communicated its doing. There really isn\u2019t any difference there. Martin Anstice : And just to add, I would say it\u2019s almost completely independent, because bonus plans accrue on revenues and profits on revenues not on shipments. C. J. Muse: Great. Very Helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks C.J. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. One is Martin or Doug, if I look at your revenue as a percentage of WFE is it running it on 22%, 23%. This one I\u2019m curious like you know to get to like a 24 or higher percentage what needs to happen, is it just the SAM expansion or do you think share gains are going to be more critical to get to a higher percentage of WFE and I have follow-up? Martin Anstice : I think they\u2019re both relevant. We\u2019ve articulated for a number of years, the opportunity for SAM expansion beyond the boundaries that we\u2019re currently reporting. So the technology inflections are far from done and they\u2019re relevant for many, many years yet to come. And as you also know from prior disclosure and their reported financial results they have the market share momentum in the company is targeted to be positive and is positive. This is a stronger market share year for the company than it was true last year and that\u2019s sits in the context of the long term models, which you\u2019re pretty familiar with. So whether it\u2019s 50-50 conversation or biased slightly to the SAM expansion conversation there\u2019s certainly some exciting business opportunity and upside for the company in the years to come. Doug Bettinger : Krish, this is Doug. What I get excited about is just looking out to growth in the installed base and what\u2019s going on with our installed base business, which as you know isn\u2019t part of the WFE necessarily, it just grows along with the installed base, which is as Martin said in his prescriptive remarks is doing really, really nicely this year. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. Thanks. That kind of leads into my second question of the follow-up which is, so can you talk a little bit about your services business, how much is it as a percentage of revenue and what are the margin structure there like and what do you think the CAGR for that is going to be? Thank you. Martin Anstice : Yeah, I mean Krish, what we\u2019re talking about is, we\u2019ve got objectives to grow up faster than the installed base and it absolutely use doing that over the last several years, I got really excited about what\u2019s going on there. Profitability isn\u2019t all that different than the rest of the company. When we look at it an aggregate the gross margins maybe a little bit less than selling new equipment, but the level of investment isn\u2019t anywhere near what we need to invest in the new equipment side. So the operating income in the cash generation is very attractive in this part of the business. Krish Sankar : Thank you Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Martin. Martin Anstice : Thanks Krish Operator : Okay. Our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great, thank you. Wonder if you could talk a little bit about the NAND market in the next few quarters, how do you see the spending shifting between sort of conversion of planar NAND 3D. How much do you think now is shifting over towards 3D scaling, and what happens to your I assume your share of the market potentially goes up as you move to more of a 3D scaling environment? Just some color on that would be good. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, I mean the construct of this year\u2019s spending by the customer in the NAND space is reasonably evenly balanced across the kind of three implementation scenarios, right. So you\u2019ve got kind of the addition of a new 3D NAND capacity you\u2019ve got a conversion from 2D to 3D and then you\u2019ve got this kind of vertical scaling of some 3D capacity from let\u2019s say generation 2 to generation 3. And they\u2019re all representatvie. The smaller of the three is the 3D NAND scaling segments. As you\u2019ve heard us characterize a couple times now, we\u2019re actually almost agnostic to the part of the customer between the addition of new capacity and the conversion from 2D to 3D it\u2019s more or less the same size opportunity for the company, and I think that\u2019s unique in the industry as the byproduct of the process flow and the position of the company\u2019s products to support that inflection.  As the 3D capacity becomes a bigger proportion and still even by the end of this year, I think it may only be about half of the installed base capacity and that half is in various forms, not all of it is latest generation, highest layer accounts kind of 3D. The the opportunity for 3D NAND is vertical scaling investments is going to grow overtime and that\u2019s the most efficient pass for our customers, it\u2019s also the pass, which is most biased to action deposition.  So the segment concentration of a vertical scaling is even stronger for us as a relative opportunity to the rest of the industry. So at the end of the day the customers will make the right choices, they\u2019ll optimize fabs and optimize economics and that\u2019s a pretty dynamic space. So it\u2019s one that\u2019s pretty difficult to predict and we actually don\u2019t need to for the reasons what I\u2019ve just summarized. Joe Moore : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Martin Anstice : Thanks Joe. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Well, good afternoon and congratulations on another well executed quarter. My question is kind of similar to the last one it except it\u2019s more DRAM and the industry and DRAM has done extremely well, tight supply, very strong demand environment, all eyes are starting to turn to next year when the capital spending trajectory in DRAM is going higher.  And the question from investors again is, are the DRAM competitors going to remain disciplined on a capacity expansion perspective, and do you guys have talked previously about 2017 maybe kind of 1% to 3% increased in total DRAM industry capacity pretty disciplined. So as you guys looking to your forward pipeline talk with your customers, how do you view total DRAM capacity expansion next year, are you guys continuing to see sort of focus on profitability? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I would say intensely. So it\u2019s a consolidated industry and everybody fights for their share of economics, and I think the evidence of the last several years is reinforcing of everything it was embedded in your question. To that\u2019s variablity to model, the capacity for DRAM at the end of 2017 is similar to the capacity at the end of 2015 and that\u2019s kind of wafer start out statements, and that\u2019s a statement of slight growth after the contraction year in calendar 2016. But maybe a little bit different today than was through three months ago is the proportion of the installed base that is converting to the 20-nanometer technology node is actually progressing a little bit faster than the assumptions we had three months ago. So if you look at the constructive DRAM capacity at the end of this year between 1x capacity 20 series product and then more than 20-nanometer we would guess probably 25%, 55% and 20%. It\u2019s for sure incredibly disciplined and the balance of conversion is obviously very high. So it\u2019s a very efficient investment for our customers and to the extent that any capacity gets added it will get added as best we can tell from legitimate demand drivers and you know we have the same bit growth assumptions as everybody else in the kind of low 20% range for DRAM. And it will come from the relative transitions and density per wafer out, and as I think everybody appreciates that the density per wafer out improvements at the latter stages of the DRAM roadmap are little less than was true, let\u2019s say five years ago in a transition.  So that\u2019s part of the story as well. But I mean as a basic premise, we absolutely expect descipline to continue and we can\u2019t guarantee that we don\u2019t have the crystal ball, but that\u2019s the planning assumption and that\u2019s the behavior especially we can help from our customers. Harlan Sur : Thanks for the insights there. And you guys are almost completed with the $1 billion share repurchase program. I guess you\u2019d be done with that by year end, free cash flow generation sitting in kind of in the high 20% range. So there\u2019s a team late for potential tax reform or can you take on some debt to fund sort of the next tranche of your repurchase activity. And then just roughly what is the additional debt capacity that the team can take on while maintaining their investment grade status? Doug Bettinger : Yeah Harlan, I\u2019m not ready to give you a definitive update on that right now. Obviously we\u2019re paying close attention to what\u2019s going on relative to tax discussion in Washington. Your guess is as good as mine in terms of what might happen as well as the timing. We certainly have an ability to take on more debt should we choose to do that and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll be talking to the Board, Martin and I\u2019ll be talking to the Board about, when I\u2019ve got some update channel I\u2019ll share it with you, but I don\u2019t have that right now. Harlan Sur : Great, thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Harlan. Operator : Our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Yeah, great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. The uptick you saw in Logic shipments in the quarter, it was a nice surprise. Doug, you talked about the ramp of 10-nanometer, I think image sensors, and if I call you correctly power management. I guess the question is, is this level of shipments on a quarterly basis, the new normal given that 10-nanometer is ramping or was this quarter kind of a one-off in terms of shipments? Martin Anstice : Yeah, things will always ebb and flow as you know, I mean we\u2019ve been talking about the applications when is that 10-nanometer for a while now obviously as that ramps into production that will continue. Image sensor is kind of it comes in, it goes and likewise for the power management stuff. But I expect the trajectory to continue here, we\u2019re doing real well. And we\u2019ve been waiting for this for a while and the ramp is beginning to happen. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, two things to add. One of them is it is more of the new norm than not. And I hope it really isn\u2019t so surprise. We\u2019ve been talking about it for long enough, so it\u2019s really nice to actually finally answer the question for everybody and demonstrates the success of our engagements in Logic and foundry in etch and deposition both it\u2019s taken a lot of hard work from a lot of people and it\u2019s really nice to see a further increase in the balanced engagements of the company in the industry. We\u2019re fortunate to be in a very strong position around technology inflections. We\u2019re fortunate to have the strength for the company in memory at a time when memory is clearly an increasingly relevant and critical part of the roadmap of success for all of our customers and this is icing on the cake at some level. So the really nice result. Toshiya Hari : Okay, great. And then I had a follow-up on the Coventor acquisition in the quarter. Martin you went through the acquisition in your prepared remarks. But if you can kind of reiterate what the rationale was, what you gain from this from a technology perspective, and how it could potentially impact your incumbent businesses that would be great? Thank you. Martin Anstice : Yeah, thank you for the question. In many respects, it\u2019s a repeat of much of the rationale we\u2019ve talked about in the context of prior M&A focus for a process control in the company and in some respects this is consistent with the messaging on data and AI having the potential to change the world and that includes being relevant to how industry and the industry of our customers as well. So we believe that we have value to deliver to our customers and value deliver to our shareholders through an enhancement of process controlled capabilities.  And we are generally collaborative in execution today as strategies, but we have an opportunity to acquire and fully harness the capability of Coventor in the mix, it brings expertise and competency into the company that\u2019s for sure supplements and strengthens our pre-existing computer science algorithm analytics, capability, modeling capability and it\u2019s a really nice partnership I would say for a virtual modeling business hence a true process and a hardware characterization business. So the combination of those two things, we believe has an opportunity to grow faster then was true for a standalone business, the pre-existing products and services, the Coventor business, and it has an opportunity to provide us vehicles to introduce new products and services in that space.  And last but not least, it\u2019s an opportunity to increase the competitive differentiation of the etch and the deposition in the clean portfolio through enhanced control and faster cycle time in development and better predictability and opening up process windows and so on and so forth. So it\u2019s part of what we\u2019ve been talking about for some time, it was a nice opportunity to take custody over a valuable asset and we\u2019re super excited about the opportunity in front of us, and I think that optimism is shared by our customers. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Toshiya. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Brian Chin : Hi this is Brian Chin, calling in for Patrick. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Looking at your shipment distribution for the September quarter, China is only your fourth largest geography, but shipments were down sequentially by decent amount in September. Just curious what was attributed to and whether you can comment on how the pipeline or trajectory in China looks moving through next year? Martin Anstice : Yeah, I\u2019d say that what happened in the quarter relative to China is completely unrepresentative of any broader trend. So certainly don\u2019t read anything into that other than the same for any customer, any region. Investment is a byproduct of discrete projects in any one quarter and that\u2019s all is going to happen ebb and flow.  If we look at kind of new fab projects maybe I kind of give you an updates from the disclosure of prior periods. From now through the end of calendar 2018, we\u2019re tracking I think 2018 fab, greenfield fabs today, and the greenfield fab can be a second floor on a double stacked fab just to be fully disclosed on that. 12 of the 18 are in China and about eight of them I think are classified as domestic China and four of them are kind of Global China.  And when you look at the distribution of investment that we\u2019re expecting next year between global and domestic players in China it\u2019s actually close to 50-50. So equipment purchases, wafer starts, capacity additions in China, domestic community and global community looks 50-50-ish at this point in time. That could change, but that\u2019s the headline today. So we\u2019d still say the same thing today that we said before, China for global companies and domestic community is a relevant part of our future. We believe that execution is as disciplined in execution in China as it is anywhere else in the world, and I hope that continues and we\u2019re we\u2019re very focused. We\u2019re investing heavily and our position in memory and Logic both in China is very strong. So hopefully that is helpful to you. Brian Chin : Thanks, very helpful. And just one quick follow-up question on your comments about shipping being very healthy to March quarter. Just wondering a very discernible shift you\u2019re seeing in spending within memory between NAND and DRAM over that horizon? Martin Anstice : Too early for us to comment at this point. I think both segments of disciplines, both segments have overlapping demand drivers, but they have unique demand drivers and we\u2019re kind of hold off until January to get specific. What I should say by the way are you going back to the China question is, when I gave my reference to eight domestic I was referring to memory and logic both and both segments are represented in the plans of our customers. Brian Chin : Okay, great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Brian. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Well, thanks for taking my question. A couple months ago you guys suggest that the WFE opportunities for NAND would be in the $70 billion over the next five years, and that\u2019s assuming 40% net growth. Now that one of the suppliers actually suggested that market will go 50% next year and it seems like you agree with that, does that make your forecast too conservative now? And if it does become 50% per year going forward and is at a 40%, how do you think about the NAND WFE? How will that change? Doug Bettinger : This was announcement, positive and negative table. This will be \u2013 we have no basis to update $70 billion reference at this time, same message today as was through the flash memory summit. Sidney Ho : Okay. Maybe switching over to DRAM, is a follow-up to earlier question. There is a quite a bit of increase in DRAM CapEx by your customers, and it seems like is the consensus here is that maybe CapEx per wafer is going high obviously cost, but it is still going down. If it is getting more expensive per wafer, how do you think customers justified the high cost? And are they either gearing into cost grand they are making a lot of money these days or do you think that\u2019s being passed alone to the end users? Doug Bettinger : I think you might have answered your own question. They\u2019re making more money than they ever have done. They\u2019re making more money than I do. So I would say, is a basic headline it looks like they\u2019ve rationalized an ability to make an investment and get paid for it and I think going back to the questions of discipline, consolidated industry in a disciplined capacity addition is kind of part of that story. I think your question is very good, because it is appropriate that everybody recognizes that the cost of density is higher and that\u2019s one of the reasons why the next generation memory conversation shows up in the industry today when it didn\u2019t do several years ago. But what I want to remind everybody is there is tons of life left in the DRAM device. There are multiple technology nodes ahead of us in the roadmap of our customers today and there are many years of investment still left in that product and technology. And I\u2019m sure a year from now we\u2019ll see something even better than that because the industry has a tendency to innovate its way to some pretty outstanding solutions. Sidney Ho : All right. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks. Operator : And our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Weston Twigg : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on one earlier about the record shipments in ID analogic. I\u2019m just wondering when you mentioned your growth in 2018, I think you mentioned 85% of the growth looks like it\u2019s coming from memory. Why not a little bit more of growth coming from the logic and or maybe the foundry side given the 10-nanometer and 20-nanometer ramps? Martin Anstice : Okay, I\u2019m glad you ask that, because I maybe wasn\u2019t quite as clear as I should have been. When I referenced 85%, I was trying to describe our outlook for calendar 2018 WFE compared to calander 2017 WFE. So our expectation is calander the 2018 is higher than 2018, I introduced a mid-to-high single digits reference for that and I provided a perspective to said we expect 85% of the growth in WFE year-over-year to be memory based. Appologise for the confusion. Weston Twigg : I think, I understood it properly. I\u2019m just wondering with say your 10-nanometer ramp one of the big logic customers in the 7-nanometer activity at the foundries way, you wouldn\u2019t see more of the growth coming from those segments, and I don\u2019t know if your particular exposure to memory is just higher or if it\u2019s a broader reference? Martin Anstice : Well, we do the best we can to take every piece of data that\u2019s available to us in terms of demand, device demand the implications of that device demand on various kind of manufacturing segments to the best of our abilities. We look at kind of reuse capabilities, which is relevant for every segment of the industry. We take into account public and private diclosure of a company\u2019s \u2013 of our customers and we tell you to the best of our abilities what we think our outlook is. So the 85% headline is the best communication we can give you at this point. Weston Twigg : Okay. And then as my follow-up. Just on the guidance you\u2019ve had several quarters of beats and raises and I know the market is very strong. Are you guiding too conservatively, do you think that that \u2013 I guess what are you missing when you\u2019re guiding over the last few quarters was demand running your expectations a little bit? Martin Anstice : It\u2019s not running it by an enormous amount, Weston, I mean we\u2019ve done a little better the last couple of quarters in terms of gross margin, and I just guided you to the highest gross margin, I think in the last decade of the company. So it\u2019s not conservative by nature. We\u2019ve done a little better over the last several quarters for sure, but I just tell you \u2013 we tell you what we see as we look into the quarter. Doug Bettinger : And maybe again just a supplements, it\u2019s actually not easy to give guidance, just to be clear, I mean this is a consolidated industry, and the investments of our customers are big. Any one application is big, anyone investment is big. And so the potential to predict this at the quarterly level can actually be quite challenging. And I would say our guidance is really good because consistently we are guiding and performing within the range of our guidance. So with due respect to your question, maybe we're not as precise as you'd like us to be, but I feel really good about the integrity of the guidance conversation and then performance of the company inside of the guidance range consistently. Weston Twigg : All right thank you, very helpful. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Wes. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Edwin Mok : Hey guys thanks for taking my question. So I guess just a quick follow-up to Wes\u2019 question, I think the general consensus is that China's spending will grow in 2018. [Indiscernible]? Martin Anstice : We've lost you, Edwin. Edwin Mok : That is the contribution from China. Doug Bettinger : Edwin ask your question again, sorry you broke up midway through there. Edwin Mok : Sorry about that. I'm trying to understand how much China is contributing to your growth on 2018 within your expectation of mid-to-high single digit growth. Doug Bettinger : Too early for us to disclose at this point. We'll give you better color on next year. I mean, it's a little bit early. Normally at this juncture we wouldn\u2019t be talking about 2018. We\u2019ll give you the normal color when we get to next quarter's earnings. Edwin Mok : Okay. All right. I think that's fine. So I guess, the question I have on EUV, there's a lot of talks about EUV adopting 7-nanometer. And I remember you guys have talked about doing some about etch and deposition. [Indiscernible] to help with challenges like line etch softness [ph]. Is it possible you can give us some update around that, where do you stand that? And do you think, that can potentially be a SAM [indiscernible] as EUVs are adopted? Doug Bettinger : I would say the basic message \u2013 and I apologize again, we lost you mid-sentence, but the basic message of the company today around our opportunity in the context of an EUV implementation is almost identical to the scenarios we characterized in the investor and analyst meeting about a year ago. So the insertion plans of our customers appear to be consistent, and the balance of space-based patterning implementations in the industry appears reasonably consistent with the assumptions we made before. So I don't think we can give you anything better than we already did. I apologize. Edwin Mok : Okay, thanks. Sorry about my line. Doug Bettinger : Yes, no problem Edwin. Thank. Operator : And we\u2019ll take out next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead. Craig Ellis : Yes thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the very fine execution guys, as well as numerous financial records. I just wanted to follow-up with some of the China commentary with a clarification question. I think you mentioned of the 2018 Greenfield patch you're tracking, 12 are in China, and there's a split between domestic and global, but even looking at the number of domestic fabs, the company has cited that, that could mean that either that exposures with some of the smaller fabs that are trailing-edge Logic or there may be with some of the larger fabs. Can you clarify if you're participating with that number that you provided in some of the larger China fabs next year? Do you see those coming on thereafter? Martin Anstice : Yes is the answer to your question. It includes the reference of eight includes the bigger domestic guys and the smaller domestic guys. Its memory and Logic both. It's DRAM and flash. The flash investment is obviously materially greater than the DRAM investment in the context of market opportunity, primarily. But we are seeing the emergence, as we've talked about for some time, of investments by domestic customers in calendar 2018, big and small; memory and logic. And it's still a fairly gradual implementation, so there's no pendulum swing, there's no paradigm shift, but there's a commencement of pilot-line investments and then transition out of pilot-line into first phase, high-volume manufacturing. But the discipline that we all hope we are seeing to the best of our abilities today. Doug Bettinger : And Craig, when we think about WFE and pilot investments that Martin was referencing, I mean, it's \u2013 for the local guys, it's an incremental $1 billion or $2 billion in terms of total WFE. A lot of the activity continues to be as it is this year. The global multinationals doing projects in China. Craig Ellis : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful, guys. The follow-up is just regarding the comments for first half 2018 shipments to be up meaningfully versus the second half of 2017. And acknowledging, Martin, your point that the business is a hard-to-forecast business. I'm just wondering if there's any color that you can give us on linearity as we think about the first half of 2018 for the business. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes let me just clarify Craig. What we said is first half 2018, higher than second half 2017. The meaningfully comment was relative to the March quarter, not necessarily the entire half. And it's really too soon for us to call linearity into next year. Again, that's something we typically would do at the end of the December quarter, and you can expect to hear from us then. Craig Ellis : Thanks guys. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Martin Anstice : Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Craig. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Tom Diffely : Yes another question on the DRAM side of the market. You talked about how wafer starts are roughly flat from 2015. Do you expect them to go up over the next couple of years or mainly just going down to the sub 2 \u2013 the 20-nanometer node? Martin Anstice : The planning assumption we have today is up a little, but it really is a little. And it will only go up a little if there's legitimate demand for devices that require that investment. So there really is no headline in terms of capacity expansion in DRAM unless there's a dramatic change to the demand statement for the segment. So it might go up and down a little bit, but it's basically headline of technology conversion. And the technology conversions, to the point I made before, are less effective gradually in terms of delivering density per wafer out than was true five years ago. But they're still incrementally valuable, and our customers appear to be making lots of money manufacturing and selling those devices. Tom Diffely : Okay. So when you look at the 80% to 85% of the growth from memory next year, is that mainly NAND then? Martin Anstice : No, it's not, but I'm not going to give you specifics at this point in time. I felt like I was super extravagant with my 85% memory disclosure, so apparently, you have a never-ending appetite for more. Tom Diffely : We always want more. Martin Anstice : Unfortunately, I don't have a never-ending appetite to provide more, so if you\u2019ll just wait on that question until we get a little further into next year, we'd appreciate it. Tom Diffely : Alright, thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks Tom. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : And it does conclude out question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Satya for any additional or closing remarks. Satya Kumar : Yes thank you once again for joining us. And have a wonderful rest of the day. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks guys. Operator : And once again that does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you all for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Satya Kumar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Satya Kumar : Yes, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment; review our financial results for the December 2017 quarter, and our outlook for the March 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slide in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 P.M. Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Satya, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I will now provide an overview of December quarter results, summarize calendar 2017 relative to the multiyear outperformance opportunity for Lam, and provide a first outlook for 2018. As previously noted, we plan a comprehensive Investor Analyst events in a few weeks and so our prepared comments today are crafted in that context. The December quarter was a strong conclusion to an extraordinary year with record performance for Lam reported in shipments, revenues, and non-GAAP EPS. As noted in our earnings release, that positive momentum is expected to continue into calendar 2018 with our March quarter guidance indicating mid-point shipments at $3.175 billion and revenues at $2.85 billion, both levels of strategic relevance and levels of business not previously seen in our history. While scaling the company at essentially a 50% pace in calendar 2017 was not our expectation one year ago, competitive business model flexibility and a commitment from our employees to the success of our customers was everything about how we responded to the incremental opportunities presented. Without the tremendous effort of the team, and the supports of our customers and partners globally, these accomplishments would not be possible. It is my privilege to acknowledge this great work and express my personal gratitude. At the same time, it's important to reinforce the prominence of our culture and values and specifically our focus on increasing customer trust and codependency through the delivery of enabling technology, productivity, and speed now and in the years ahead. As an established multi-product and services company delivering results on wafer to the semiconductor industry through complex systems engineering innovation, our primary objective is to promote our customer success through an increased proportion of their spending that we actively compete for and through differentiation to win and sustain more of that business over time. In 2017, our reported shipments were approximately 21% of WFE versus 18.5% in the prior year and that compares with 14.2% in the first full-year after the Lam Novellus merger in 2013. Reflecting on 2017, Lam delivered a remarkable sixth consecutive calendar year of growth and industry outperformance, a by-product of high quality strategies and execution jointly with our customers. Over that period, Lam has grown shipments by a cumulative annual growth rate of 24% approximately three times the rate of WFE growth. In 2017, through a commitment to invest more in our future and to sustain the economic success for our customers and suppliers in partnership with Lam, we grew our shipments by approximately 50% well above WFE growth of 30% and reported record non-GAAP earnings per share of over $13 almost double the prior year. With fundamental industry trends that we believe provides a platform for sustainable semiconductor ecosystem investments and growth, we remain focused on making the necessary investments in our company to increase the probability of achieving our long-term vision and we plan for another expansion in the proportion of WFE that we actively compete for and win in 2018, said differently, we plan for continued outperformance. 2017 recorded more than two percentage points of shipments based share gains across the equipment segments that we serve. Our market share performance was broad-based with strengths coming from areas that are most critical to the success of our customers with a focus on technology enablements across the full suites of industry inflections anticipated as relevant for our customers for the next five to 10 years. We had very strong momentum in atomic layer deposition products which has been a focus area for new product introductions for several years. We more than tripled our shipments of ALD products in 2017. We had record shipments in dielectric etch with more than a tripling of the installed base to over 1,000 process modules for our Flex G Series products which address the most challenging aspects of 3D NAND scaling. We had a record year for conductor etch with application wins across foundry and NAND markets. We strengthened our position in tungsten CVD and ALD as well as electrical deposition. We had a strong year for clean products with a 50% growth in our EOS clean product installed base. As you know, broadening our customer base has been a key part of our strategy in the last decade and we are pleased to see it deliver results, with record shipments in logic for the year. Strength here was driven both by ramp of etch application wins at leading edge Logic as well as trailing edge Logic shipments to a broad set of customers for IoT applications. There should be no question about the fundamental relevance of the Lam product portfolio in etch and deposition to the device architecture and manufacturing processes planned by our customers broadly now and in the long-term. We have much more comprehensive engagements across all device segments than ever before creating a platform of learning and optionality that enhances our competitive differentiation and the quality of our earnings. Increased strategic relevance to our customer success creates expectations and also significant opportunity for the company not least relative to the performance of more than 50,000 Lam processed chambers in the global semiconductor installed base today. Our Customer Service Business Group grew profitable revenues in 2017 faster than the pace of our installed base growth. More importantly, they took us to the over the delivery of a portfolio of productivity solutions that we believe created more value for the customer and enhanced competitiveness of Lam than in any prior year. Over the last decade, Lam has transitioned from an edge company highly levered to memory customers to a multi-product and services company with broader customer exposure across all device segments. That transition speaks to the quality of technology leadership. It speaks to cycles of learning and also business momentum. As device performance is increasingly driven by adoption of new structures and new materials, as the traditional scaling solutions are limited by physics or economics in high volume manufacturing, enhancing our edge clean and deposition portfolio with disruptive and value creating technology is a strong focus. Illustratively, shipments for new memory solutions which have extremely demanding requirements more than tripled for Lam in 2017. Our strategy for differentiation extends well beyond technology enablement for unit process and co-optimized or integrated products. Our fundamentally collaborative culture and values create an unmatched potential as a participants in the semiconductor ecosystem we are committed to harness the holistic value of Lam for the benefit of all stakeholders. Now turning to the overall equipment spending trends of 2017 and our expectations for 2018. We believe that WFE investments in 2017 ended at a little over $47 billion which was up approximately 30% from the prior year. Slightly more than half of the investments made in 2017 were for memory and were weighted primarily towards NAND flash. Semiconductors are fundamental to enabling the generation, transmission, storage, and analysis of increasing quantities of data which has the potential to transform every segments of the global economy. We remain optimistic about the potential for continued global economic stability and growth. We anticipate healthy demand for semiconductors across the full spectrum of consumer and enterprise markets. We expect year-over-year growth in overall WFE in 2018 in the low-double-digit percentages led by DRAM and logic investments and supported by the fundamental demand drivers for silicon and the confidence we have in the continued motivation for investment discipline by all key market participants. We still anticipate that approximately 85% of the year-over-year spending growth is memory based. Preliminarily, we plan for double-digit growth in overall memory WFE in 2018 with a greater balance between DRAM and NAND spending that was true in calendar 2017. Sustained to slightly increased investments in NAND overall is the year-over-year headline for 2018. More of the incremental growth is from DRAM where supply and demand balance tightened last year. Importantly, in DRAM, technology trends are resulting in meaningfully higher levels of investments required to drive similar levels of bit supply growth compared to historical levels. We do expect a modest market demand led expansion of the wafer starts per month installed base in DRAM particularly supporting data center, content expansion, and we are aligned to the consensus view on bit growth in both markets. On the demand side, NAND continues to be increasingly qualified into the data center and density not units increases; continue to be the important driver for clients mobile and PC devices. We continue to see Lam's addressable markets, net of customer yields and productivity in NANDs growing faster than NANDs WFE as customers' transition from 64 layers to 96 layer investments starting late in 2018 and into 2019. We expect growth in non-memory CapEx led primarily by Logic investments in both leading edge 10-nanometer as well as trailing edge 28-nanometer and above investments offset by flat to slightly lower investments in leading edge foundry from reuse among other strategies. As I headlined, 2018 looks to be a very solid year of demand led equipment investments by our customers within the exciting context of increased prominence of silicon as a foundation of global innovation and presence enhanced opportunity for Lam. Now I would like to touch briefly on the topic of capital allocation in light of the passage of recent U.S. tax reform legislation. Doug, will address more details later, but at a high level, the guiding principles for capital allocation at Lam remain unchanged. First and foremost, invest in the long-term profitable growth of Lam, deliver increased optionality to create value from the strengths of Lam with accretive investments in our core and non-core markets, then return excess cash to our shareholders through strategies that include sustaining and growing dividends over time and excess capital redistribution to shareholders as appropriate. We are obviously inspired by our opportunity and proud of our operational execution to-date. On this last subject of tax, it is worth emphasizing that we implemented a comprehensive global strategy in 2003, as such, we have compelling value created from this recent legislative action. Illustratively, strategic optionality is accelerated with cash available to U.S. operations increasing from $1 billion to $5 billion. In the hypothetical events of 100% U.S. repatriation, we saved $1 billion of cash from the tax rates previously applicable. 85% of our gross cash balances are now available for repatriation and that represents $25 per share or 12% of the Lam share price currently. How much and when we repatriate and plans for capital allocation are framed by a broad set of strategic choices, which we will discuss in our upcoming Investor and Analyst Meeting. Unrelated, you will have seen another announcement today about Lam leadership, specifically the promotion of Tim Archer, our Chief Operating Officer to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. This promotion is recognition of Tim's contributions so far on the journey of Lam and it is a commentary on the partnership that we continue to share. Except for some tweaks in emphasis, our fundamental responsibilities will remain unchanged, our commitment and passion for seeing Lam realize its full potential only strengthens. The full complement of global leaders at Lam have made possible our vision. Tim and I both look forward to the challenges and opportunities in the years ahead. In conclusion, we're optimistic about our opportunity, our strategies, and the potential for continued outperformance for Lam. We look forward to sharing more aspects of our vision with you in March. With that, let me turn the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. We ended calendar year 2017 with strong performance exceeding the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter on all of our financial metrics. In addition to the milestones that Martin mentioned during his scripted remarks, during calendar year 2017, we generated over $2 billion in cash from operations, that was an increase of 37% compared to calendar year 2016, and we returned $2.193 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases as well as dividends. We're very pleased with what we've achieved this quarter as well as this calendar year. Shipments continued at a healthy level in the December quarter totaling $2,000,632 which was a little above the midpoint of our guidance. Memory shipments increased in the quarter with the combined memory segment representing 77% of total system shipments and that compares with 66% in the previous quarter. Customers continue to ramp NAND and other non-volatile memory technologies which made up 53% of the system shipments. This was up from the 49% level that we saw in the September quarter. The NAND investments were directed towards meeting increased bit demand through a combination of capacity additions, 2D to 3D conversions, as well as 3D installed base layer count growth. DRAM shipments made up 24% of the system shipments and this was up from 17% in prior quarter. This was the highest dollar value of DRAM system shipments since the March 2015 quarter. Strong DRAM pricing supports these investments which continue to be largely directed towards 1X Nanometer convergence. December quarter foundry shipments were 15% of system shipments, down from 21% in the prior quarter. Foundry spending was primarily directed towards 7-nanometer pilot capability as well as 10-nanometer volume production projects. And finally, the logic and other segment accounted for 8% of system shipments that was down compared with 13% in the last quarter. Revenues for the quarter came in at $2.581 billion above the midpoint of guidance and up 4% from the previous record high level that we saw in the September quarter. Gross margin came in at 47.6%. As I always mentioned you should expect to see some quarter-to-quarter variability in gross margins due to multiple factors such as product mix, customer concentration, and overall business volumes. Operating expenses in December quarter increased to $449 million coming in at 17.4% of revenue that compares with 17.7% in September. Approximately 63% of the OpEx spend in the quarter was allocated to R&D which was around the same ratio as we've held for the calendar year. While we continue to see opportunities to further leverage OpEx, we will continue to increase our funding of strategic R&D programs to maintain our technology as well as productivity leadership. These investments are critical to meeting our commitments to customers and to our objective of growing the company at a faster pace than the industry. The growth and the size of our served available markets and the market share gains that Martin mentioned are the result of investments we've made and work that we've done over the course of the last several years. Operating income in the December quarter was $779 million, which was up from $733 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin came in at 30.2%, up compared to 29.6% in the September quarter and again a little above the midpoint of the guided range. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately negative 1% down compared to 14% last quarter. The primary reason for the reduction in the non-GAAP tax rate is a reduced statutory U.S. rate combined with a delayed implementation of U.S. tax and foreign earnings. This is attributed to the application of the recently enacted tax changes for a non-calendar year filing. The new tax law applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, which for Lam will be in the second half of 2018 onwards. Excluded from the non-GAAP tax rate is a one-time charge of $757 million. This is primarily made up of tax on accumulated foreign earnings to be repatriated. The cash tax payments will be made over the next eight years. The tax rate in the mid-single-digits for the first half of 2018 and mid-teens in the second half of 2018 would be reasonable for you to include in your models. Based on a share count of about 182 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter totaled $4.34 above the high-end of our guided range. The biggest contributor to the earnings per share being above the range was the favorable impact on the tax rate. Without the impact of the tax rate change, we would have been approximately $0.10 above the midpoint of guidance. The share count includes approximately 18 million shares of dilutive impact on a non-GAAP basis from the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes. And I just mentioned with the increase in our stock price, we've continued to receive requests for early conversions of both the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes. Conversions that settled in December quarter totaled $44 million of which $32 million related to the 2018 convert and $12 million to the 2041 bond. To-date, we've also received requests for conversions totaling $175 million that will settle in the March quarter. And I will remind you dilution schedules for the updated notional amounts in the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website to help you with your modeling. We continue to execute on our capital return program. As you may recall, we announced in November, a new $2 billion buyback authorization. In the December quarter, we spent approximately $1.1 billion on share repurchases largely through an accelerated share repurchase program. And we paid out $73 million in dividends to our shareholders. Consistent with our prior comments we're committed to growing the dividend over time and in November we also announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share which was payable earlier this month. Now we move to the balance sheet. During December quarter we initiated a $1.25 billion commercial paper program and as of the end of the December quarter we had $800 million outstanding. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments including restricted cash of about $6 billion. Approximately $5 billion of the $6 billion was domiciled outside of the United States. This is the amount that comes more flexibly available with tax reform. Cash from operations was $29 million, down from $858 million in the September quarter. The low cash generation during the quarter was a result of the timing of certain receivables as well as a growth in inventory to support the strong shipments we see in the March quarter. And I would just mention we collected approximately $700 million at the end of December which was after our fiscal quarter had closed. Day sales outstanding increased to 80 days versus 56 last quarter. Inventory turns came in at 3.6 compared to 4 in the prior quarter and I just mentioned I expect the March quarter will be a very strong cash generating quarter. Deferred revenue at the end of a quarter were $1.114 billion which was up from $938 million last quarter. This number excludes $289 million in shipments to customers in Japan which will revenue in future quarters. And I just remind you that these Japan shipments remain as inventory carrying cost on the balance sheet. I should mention that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 starting in the second half of calendar year 2018 to coincide with the start of our fiscal year 2019. I have more to tell you about this as we get closer to the second half of the year. Company non-cash expenses during the quarter include the following : $42 million for equity compensation, $41 million for amortization, and $39 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $85 million which was up from $60 million in the September quarter. This growth was driven by factory and lab expansions as well as lab tool investments. CapEx for the year came in at $224 million. We do expect to see a further increase in CapEx in calendar year 2018, as we continue to expand our manufacturing network and support growth in strategic R&D programs. We ended the quarter with approximately 10,200 regular full time employees. Majority the headcount was added in the factory and field to support the growth of our business. As Martin mentioned in his remarks, company is enjoying significant business momentum heading into the March quarter. Our non-GAAP guidance for the quarter is as follows : we're expecting shipments of $3.175 billion plus or minus $125 million. We're forecasting revenue of $2.850 billion again plus or minus $125 million. We're forecasting gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point. I do expect to see a stronger gross margin percentage in the June quarter as compared to March. We're forecasting operating margins of 29% plus or minus one percentage point and finally, we forecast earnings per share of $4.35 plus or minus $0.15 based on a share count of approximately 181 million shares. Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to provide an update on our plans for Analyst Day. We will be hosting this event on Tuesday, March 6, in New York City. We will be providing additional details regarding the event logistics in the next week or so. And for 2018, we continue to be pleased with the positive momentum in our business and the progress we're making towards our ongoing business objectives. We remain optimistic in the strong demand for our products and services and we look forward to sharing a comprehensive update on the company's plans at our Analyst Day in March. Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Please open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from C. J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. C. J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide some help around that the cost down efforts in the NAND market. And so as you think about moving from single-stack to multi-stack QLC perhaps some other techniques that you're helping your customers met with. We would love to hear how you think about the bit guys and their ability to drive down their costs such that the hard disk drive market becomes achievable to penetrate? That would be very helpful. Martin Anstice : My, that's a comprehensive question, C.J. So maybe I should start with our assumption that we communicated in the Analyst Meeting a year ago. We actually when we articulated our perspective on the opportunity for Lam and we gave this reference to $70 billion of investments. Our assumption was actually that SSD would not be disruptive to hard disk drives. Our assumption was that the demand for storage and memory in the world would essentially be serviced by this new mode of nonvolatile memory, all these new product with nonvolatile memory. And then hard disk drives would just kind of be kind of caped out that was the modeling assumption that we presented to you. So to the extent the scenario plays out in the way you articulate it, you should presume that's kind of upside to the commentary of the company because of what I just said. Obviously NAND is probably the poster child for a market with elasticity of demand. And the industry has universally adopted a new technology and it is scaling that new technology in terms of playing the 3D transitions and layer counts. And when our customers make investments they make it because they have performance enhancements on device and they have cost roadmaps that creates opportunities for incremental demand to get kind of created. So there's an awful lot I could say about the subject, the headlines that I hope everybody retains here is we think the world of silicon and we think the world of nonvolatile memory specifically has tremendous opportunity in the years ahead as a byproduct of this innovation that's emerged around the value of data in the world. And the good use of Lam from a lot of hard work and a lot of partnerships with our customers we position the portfolio of products and a product pipeline that's focused on enabling that roadmap. C. J. Muse: That's helpful. Appreciate, it. And I guess as a follow-up as you think about your 1.7 times outperformance in 2017 and it looks like mix is going to be there for you again in 2018 would love to hear your thoughts in terms of how whether you can rank order or not, how you think about perhaps gains in share and logic service growth and other areas where you're seeing increased patterning that will drive faster than expected industry growth for you guys we'd love to hear thoughts on that? Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Appreciate the question C.J. and maybe I can just restate something I said in my prepared remarks because it's a very important disclosure from the company relative to our focus, our definition of success, and our priority. And I share that because I have some anxiety that the investment community gets trapped in fairly incomplete disclosure from the totality of the industry on market share hence our focus. So our focus is the following. Our primary objective is to promote our customer success through an increased proportion of their spending that we actively compete for and through differentiation to win and sustain more of that business over time. That means that our focus at a product line level and a business unit level and a segment level has to be on the share that we have but what really counts is where that share is and our focus is on the most critical applications, that most value to applications for our customers, and the sustainability of that share through the economics that were associated with it. And the most basic measure of performance for any company in any market is the one that I characterized and we will continue to answer these questions on market share by a focus around that kind of basis. And our headline for last year was 21% of WFE against 18.5% in prior year against 14.2% in the year, the first year after bringing Lam and Novellus together. So momentum is really good. The technology inflections still have tremendous opportunity for us, more or less the headlines that we communicated in NAND flash at the Analyst Meeting are only I would say a little better one-year on and we'll spend more time talking about that in a few weeks. And in the world of patterning, I think the headlines that we communicated in our Analyst Meeting a year ago are as valid today as they were then. And that includes the various scenarios of adoption of EUV and that includes the various technology advancements that have played out since that time in multi-patterning process flow. Satya Kumar : Thanks C.J. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead. Romit Shah : Yes, thank you and congratulations. The March shipment numbers obviously a very big number and I feel like there could be some skepticism around that shipment number and how strong it is and whether or not that's really sustainable and so I was hoping you could comment on just if we look throughout the year and just triangulate between the outperformance you delivered in 2017 and your outlook for low-double-digit WFE growth this year it would seem like the March shipment guidance is a number that you could sustain throughout the year, I wanted to get your feedback on that? Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean we're obviously we're not in the game of guiding every quarter of the year or even the year with any specificity but to the spirit of your question, I hope there isn't skepticism around the quarter itself because I hope at this point we've got a track record of actually delivering on the kind of quarters commitments relative to sustainability. Obviously this is all about fundamental demand and if you sign up for if you sign up for the conventions that I described in my prepared comments, the convention that silicon has established itself quite differently in terms of potential and work data, then you would sign up for sustainability of investment. Now you might get ebbs and flows one quarter after another or one month but the fundamental headline that we believe in and we're investing to create value in is a scenario of sustained and disciplined investment by our customers at a more discrete level just to put some more substance on it for you, our expectation is that relative calendar 2018 we see it is not perfectly but a reasonably balanced year for the industry and for the company both. And I would say that we see memory could be slightly first half biased and foundry could be slightly second half biased, with Logic as fairly neutral in the year. And as was proven last year, everything I just said to be entirely wrong and probably is precisely wrong but it's the best we have for you today in terms of trying to give you some color around quarter-to-quarter or half-to-half. Romit Shah : I appreciate it. I'm curious just as my follow-up how China plays into your forecast for this year because there's obviously a lot going on between domestic and global and memory and foundry is how does China play into your outlook? Martin Anstice : Yes. So the China -- obviously for the domestic community and the global players that are investing there is a big deal and the headlines in terms of new fab projects are exactly the same today as they were three months ago when I detailed them the only incremental disclosure today obviously is there are more projects that we're tracking. But when we look at WFE investments in calendar 2018, we think that the domestic community combines all segments, so the domestic community in China DRAM, flash, and logic foundry, probably invest slightly less than $5 billion which is a little less than 10% of global WFE and the way we've described it to you and that's up between $1 billion and $2 billion maybe $1.5 billion compared to that kind of the 2017. So it's an increasingly important component of spending, it's a big focus for us in terms of building infrastructure, supporting our customer success, and their visions and putting in place qualified people to support them. One last piece of data relative to our shipments when we look at the Lam shipments in China two-thirds of the shipment dollars will be probably for the global players investing their one-third for the domestic community. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Well thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to some of the structural changes especially with 3D NAND. I want to get your view how we should think about migration from 64 to 96 and in that context with the new fab and a change in layout have any impact in architecture especially as the 3D NAND could lead to higher manufacturing cycle time. So perhaps a new clean room could help with that versus converting existing planar NAND. Is there anything or any changes between these two sort of variables that we should add to our thesis? Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean I don't know I would characterize the kind of line layout complexities from 64 to 96 much differently I would from the other versions that have preceded this and I don't think I would characterize it as more challenging or complex than a planar to 3D conversion. But I think your question is a very important one and you know there are I would say fairly dynamic customer plans around how best they service the opportunities in the marketplace that they see and we would expect to continue to see this portfolio of investments from clean Greenfields to the planar to 3D scaling and 3D scaling vertically itself. We are as we've said number of times we're agnostic actually in terms of the opportunity between the planar 3D conversion and the new fab addition from a business perspective and I would expect based on what I know today that somewhere in the range of two-thirds of the investment by the industry is conversion related and maybe a third is additions. But that's a proxy that will change for sure as discrete opportunities for sure for customers and as they optimize their plans. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. And then and just quickly as a follow-up as we think about the longer-term, how should we think about the service component especially with some of the new areas like ALD would that carry different service attach rate versus the rest and I know Analyst Day is coming up but is there anything you can share with us? Martin Anstice : Yes, probably it's a way to the Analyst Meeting and there are some very important headlines I think for the company around the pace of growth in excess of the installed base and the product portfolio and the segments that we're growing are part of that story, the emphasis that we're investing in around advanced services is part of that story and I think there's something quite unique about where we are in the ecosystem that presents opportunity as well. So it's definitely an increasingly valuable annuity to the company and it's an increasingly important part of creating and delivering value to our customers. Operator : And we will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great, thank you. I wonder if you could characterize the service and supplies business and it seems like that's been consistently holding the same proportion of your overall revenue. Is how is that business kind of growing as fast as the systems business and how sustainable do you think that growth is? Martin Anstice : It's actually been growing faster than the installed base which is a kind of a statement of the breadth of the product and services portfolio that we're making available to our customers and we're investing and creating and dialogues around our social intelligence and machine learning are as relevant inside of our company and is relevant in terms of developing products and services for our customers, as it is for our customers and ensuring their customers and the consumers. So don't disconnect the AI and the big data analytics headlines from the realities of our company as well. So it's a broadening portfolio, it's growing fast in installed base and in a periods where we've had extraordinary growth in our systems business, it's a testament to the strengths of our Customer Service Business Group that we have we're able to say what we're saying and preserve in essence the same percentage of revenues coming from that business. Now what that means in terms of modeling purposes, if you happen to choose best, you're going to model less growth in calendar 2018 than was true in 2017 which is essentially what we've guided. Then the value of that installed base business kind of goes up over time. So I think it\u2019s a great commentary on value, sustainability, and quality of earnings. Doug Bettinger : And Joe I always tell you it's my favorite part about the company's business model is just it's an annuity that just keeps going, keeps growing, keeps generating enormous amounts of cash it's a great part of what we do. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Great, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. And Martin, I had a question on UV. I guess as we approach the timing of insertion particularly in the foundry space and you learn more about the recipe that your customer might follow. Has your view on your opportunity set, as it relates to patterning changed over the past six or 12 months or has it remained kind of the same? Martin Anstice : It's remained the same. Toshiya Hari : Okay, fair enough. And the second one on the tax rate, Doug, I think you guided fiscal year second half the tax rate to kind of the mid-teens. Should we consider that rate as the new normal for the company or should we expect some variability going forward post tax put planning or whatever maybe. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Toshi, if I was modeling out beyond the second half of 2018 I'd probably keep it pretty steady with what I gave you which is mid-teens for the second half. But it always changes a little bit depending on where the geographic distribution of our business ebbs and flows, so it's not going to be precisely that, but that would be the best planning horizon or the planning number that I'll give you. And just to remind make sure everybody heard first half of calendar 2018 mid-single-digits, second half, mid-teens. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Martin Anstice : Farhan, I think you are on mute. Farhan Ahmad : Hello, can you hear me? Martin Anstice : Yes, we can hear you now. Go ahead. Farhan Ahmad : So my first question is on memory and NAND DRAM. What level of bit growth do you expect from the CapEx outlook that you have for the year? Martin Anstice : I think we kind of signed up for the consensus on bit growth. So the low 20s for DRAM and mid to high 40s for NAND for calendar 2018 and obviously the server phone content in DRAM is a decent kind of content headline and the same is true for the Smartphone bit growth for NAND. And I think one of the illustrative headlines that we should all be conscious of is the average Smartphone today is got maybe 4 gigs of NAND content and the best phones have 256 -- 40 I'm sorry I should have said 40 gigs of content and the best one is 256. So when you think about applications innovation and you think about the content headlines not the unit headlines that's one of the most fundamental drivers for the business prospectively. Farhan Ahmad : Got it. And then one question on the services you have very strong growth in your systems business this year. Does that mean that we should see much stronger growth in your services business over next year, one year as these systems come off warranty? Martin Anstice : Well, I'll say the objective of the company, as we said many, many times is to grow the service business the spares and service and upgrades business faster than we do the installed base. And you're right to say there are warranties and so when warranty periods end and you roll into that space and we try to position for very, very strong market share and sustainability. So I would tend to lean towards a very positive answer to your question. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and congratulations on the well executed quarter and the outstanding performance in 2017. You guys have given great leverage on the OpEx with the scale and the revenue growth. If we assume that WFE is sustainable above 40, 45 billion plus kind of going forward, seems like 28% to 30% up margin plus or minus seems sustainable. So more and more investors are focused on free cash flow and free cash flow margin so how should we think about the sustainable free cash flow margin at say the 28% to 30% operating margin level? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Harlan, we're front-running an update to the model which we will give you in early March. But generally speaking we would expect operating cash flow to be close to operating income. Now if you look at what happened in the last year the business grew so rapidly that we actually did less well than that because the consumption of working capital as the business scaled up we needed to build more inventory, receivables grew along with the level of revenue so we didn't do quite as well as that. But on a ongoing basis assuming kind of a steady state of business shipments and revenue that's about where we should be. Our CapEx is nominally 3% to 4% of revenues so that's your free cash flow answer there. Harlan Sur : Got it. Thanks for the insights there. And shipments are up 40% in December versus the year ago quarter versus two years ago there will be up strongly again in March. Obviously my congrats to the operations, logistics, and manufacturing teams but just given the significant strength in the [indiscernible] are customer lead times increasing and anyway to quantify the increase? Martin Anstice : Yes, way to qualify everything but we don't disclose lead times for obvious competitive reasons in respect for the roadmaps of our customers. But what I will tell you is obviously it takes a lot of work to do what we're doing it's much more difficult. And I think for an industry. I think we've for those of us that have participated in the scale of growth that we have, we've all been very challenged by that scale of growth. But I would say that from a benchmarking perspective as best I can tell which is why I spoke to kind of flexible business model and commitment from employees in my prepared comments, we've executed as well if not better than most or maybe all. So it's a big focus, it's get more difficult and certainly 50% growth here is a quite extraordinary challenges for operations and also field resources. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I'm always amazed Harlan when I sit for the quarterly business reviews with the supply chain, the global operations team, as well as the field, just how well they're executing. It's been actually quite amazing when you see how it's all happened. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Well thanks for taking my question. My question is the first question is on DRAM. There has been a lot of chatters that the strong DRAM that the market expects and what you alluded to for next year could be because of capital intensity of DRAM going up but it could also be yields on suboptimal what is your view on that? Martin Anstice : Well my basic view is I don't think customers spend money if a yield is suboptimal. I think that's a very important kind of test for them making their investments and I guess that's all relative. I mean we have characterized obviously today that the relative investments the industry has to make are a little higher for a bit outs in the context of the technology conversions that are playing out today in this year compared to last year and the year before. But I would also make the point that it's still an investment that is dominated by conversion. And it is still an investment that is made with extraordinary discipline by our customers managing supply and demand balance. And I would also say that the capital intensity data point is actually a lot less than the points in history that have triggered kind of corrections so I think if you look at kind of memory today, the capital intensity for the last four years including the outlook for calendar 2018 is not even two-thirds of the level seen in 2007, so it's a dramatically different profile of risk. Sidney Ho : Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question is if you look at your forecast for WFE, what are some of the biggest swing factors in your forecast that can move above or below your forecast of low-teens; just want to see if I can get something out you to be more precisely wrong? Martin Anstice : No, Sidney, I appreciate that and good luck with that. Well I mean macro positive negative is always there and always will be -- this is a pretty extraordinary time for the industry I think holistically because there's an irony here of consolidated participants and a diversified kind of statement of demand. So I guess may be more difficult not more easy to forecast the future at a device to my level. You have an industry that is I think singularly invested and try to take advantage of this opportunity and contribute to broader tech economy and broader innovation. And so, it's all about creating incremental demand and the memory, storage, datacenter, AI, Big Data Analytics advanced process, I mean it's all relevant. Right, I mean we live in a world where devices and silicon that support connectivity are critical to the roadmap. Devices that create the capacity to store efficiently and cost effectively all that collected data are critical. And the high performance computing that is relevant to take all of that data and do something with it that creates value either in an enterprise or in a consumer context has to kind of show up. So I think it's a very integrated system which is perhaps why I answer the question may be less precisely than you would like me to because I think we live in a world where this is much less about discrete segments of a semiconductor industry as we traditionally described it and much more about the integration of technologies from a chip integration point of view, from an embedded memory and logic solutions perspective, we live in the world of systems, designed systems architecture and it all has to be there and all is part of answering this question around incremental opportunity or incremental risk. Operator : We will take our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead. Craig Ellis : Yes thanks for taking that question. Martin, I appreciate the comments on the positioning for 2018's memory spending and DRAM starting to catch-up and balance with NAND. Could you extend your view a little bit further and comment on maybe the multi-year trend for DRAM, I know the company's typically been comfortable talking about longer-term such as your five-year NAND spending piece. So could you give us a longer term look with what you see at DRAM? Martin Anstice : I thought you started with NAND and you ended with DRAM. Doug Bettinger : He kind of boomeranged. Martin Anstice : Which one do you want to talk about? Craig Ellis : DRAM. NAND was simply used as an example of -- Martin Anstice : Okay, okay. Craig Ellis : Kind of in the past for the longer-term deals. Martin Anstice : The first thing I'd say it's a content story not a unit story. I don't think we're going to stand up and say hey we got this great view that all of a sudden PC units and software units take off again because I don't think that's the headline. It's all about content and there are two drivers of bit growth in DRAM one of them is the server which is the most comprehensive demand driver and the second is expansion of phone contents. And we are, I would say, I'd probably be stronger than conservatively optimistic I'd say we're optimistic about those long-term trends and we think they're fundamental to answering the questions about investments in silicon capacity and the investment we make in a business. Craig Ellis : That's helpful and then the follow-up I'll shoot it over to Doug. Doug as you look at the company and the flexibility that you have now with cash, can you talk about what that means for debt levels and capital structure and if we should expect that that would stay at current levels or if there's potential for whatever reason for debt to rise from here as a percent of your capital structure. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Craig. I'm going to decline to answer that one but I will promise you that when we get to the March Analyst Day we will have lots more to tell you as you might appreciate all the tax changes are kind of late breaking we're talking internally about it debating some things. We'll have more to tell you know in our remarks from and I'm going to punt on this one for now. Craig Ellis : Can I take a swing at another one then? Doug Bettinger : Yes, go ahead. Craig Ellis : Okay, I'll pop it back to Martin. Martin, this is more of a -- maybe I'll have better success more of a qualitative question. I'm interested in knowing the degree to which your discussions with customers have changed over the last few years as capital intensity is stepped up dramatically and as there's more signs that industry is on a steadier growth profile rather than boom/bust what's changed with the duration of the discussion the way that you may be collaborating across different types of technologies etcetera. Martin Anstice : Yes, I mean actually maybe that last kind of sub question is actually a great response. I mean I think the scale and scope of technical challenges and business challenges for everybody in this ecosystem is much more difficult today than was true five years ago. And the companies that I think excel and sustain in the long-term have attributes of partnership and collaboration and codependency that are quite fundamental and that's why almost every single quarter I see something like culture and values because that's a fundamental elements of competitive differentiation. If you are not trusted if you are not legitimately collaborative, if you are not sincerely invested in the success of your customers then your opportunity to sustain your business is limited. Operator : And it does conclude out question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Satya for any additional or closing remarks. Satya Kumar : Yes, thank you once again for joining us. And we look forward to seeing you at our March Analyst Day in New York. We'll be sending you more details shortly on that. Thank you. Operator : And once again that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Riley Operator : Please standby. Good day and welcome to the Lam Research Corporation March 2018 Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Satya Kumar, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Satya Kumar : Yes, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will share our outlook on the business environment; review our financial results for the March 2018 quarter and our outlook for the June 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. It can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slide in the presentation for additional information. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 p.m. Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up, so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. Due to some technical difficulties, our presentation today will be audio-only and the slides accompanying today\u2019s presentations have been posted on our website separately from the webcast. With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Again, thank you all for joining us today. As reported, Lam delivered strong financial results for the March 2018 quarter, with revenue, gross margin dollars and EPS all at record levels and above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, we completed our first ever quarter with over $3 billion in shipments. Including the June quarter outlook, Lam will deliver revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in 23 out of the last 24 quarters, which is a testament to both the successful scaling of our company and a multiyear environment of demand led and more sustainable customer investments. I would like to take this moment to thank our customers, our employees and our partners for the opportunity they provide us for their trust and contributions made, without which the performance of Lam would not be possible. I will keep my comments brief today given that we provided a comprehensive update on our vision, strategy and objectives at our recent Investor Day. Cost effective scaling of semiconductor device performance remains critical to addressing opportunities provided by the transition to the data economy and now is substantially more diverse in scope than traditional shrink. In this context, our focus is on systematically strengthening the competitiveness and relevance of Lam\u2019s product portfolio to the success of our customers. Broadly recognized, etch and deposition technologies are now foundational and permanent features in the current roadmap of vertical scaling, multi-patterning, advanced packaging and advanced transistor architectures. These inflections have resulted in substantial growth in our serviceable addressable market, or SAM and reiterating a headline of the recent Investor Day, we are on track to grow our SAM to over 40% of wafer fabrication equipment spending by 2021. As an acknowledged leader in etch and deposition markets, we have an opportunity to capture a greater proportion of our customers spending by delivering unit process excellence, leveraging our multi-product capabilities and engaging in closer collaboration within the semi-ecosystem. We are making substantial comprehensive and disciplined investments in R&D to fund innovation that is intended to extend the differentiation of our products and services portfolio and we continue to prudently scale the infrastructure of the company to support our 2021 objectives. Customer equipment selection decisions in the March 2018 quarter were consistent with expectations in the context of our long-term objectives. Irrespectively, we secured additional wins in dielectric etch one for a high aspect ratio DRAM application and another for NAND flash, both at leading memory manufacturers. We also won a new nonvolatile memory application with an advanced etch capability harnessing value from our unit process excellence and unmatched collaboration between Lam etch and deposition business units. We see solid momentum with our deposition portfolio and we are pleased recently to celebrate our 500 VECTOR Strata PECVD product shipments. This platform continues to offer industry leading productivity and film property control that together creates custom enablements and competitive differentiation for Lam creating value and enhancing codependency in multi-stack deposition applications in 3D NAND for example. Our systems business is augmented by our installed base business where we have been focused on enhancing the breadths and competitiveness of our products and services as a means of further enabling our customer\u2019s success. Customer support business unit revenue growth continued to outperform that\u2019s of our installed base growth in the March quarter and we achieved key customer penetrations within our reliance and advanced services business. At our recent Investor Day we provided several metrics of our long-term growth not only to illustrate the value of this annuity like business, but more importantly to emphasize the integral role it plays in value creation, value capture and increasing codependency with our customers. Now, turning to the macro and wafer fabrication equipment, WFE spending environments, expectations for global economic growth remains strong and are healthy. We believe that content growth remains a powerful multiyear driver of demand in the data economy. Context for multiyear customer investments is not simply a byproduct of market efficiency from consolidation and disciplines operational execution through the semiconductor supply chain, it is more fundamentally endorsed by the evergreen verticals of climate change, education, food and water, healthcare, security and transportation that together define the opportunity for silicon based artificial intelligence, AI technologies and applications and services innovation globally. In the smartphone end markets innovative data intensive services will increasingly be deployed leveraging AI and using a range of enabling artificial and virtual reality technologies. The deployment of 5G networks will improve the quality of these services, but to deliver the best user experience the smartphones themselves will require a combination of higher screen resolution, faster refresh cycles and lower power. This will drive the need for nearly 2x the DRAM contents in smartphones relative to the current global average. Additionally, density increases associated with higher layer counts in 3D NANDs create the opportunity for terabyte level storage in smartphones within the next few years. For 2018 WFE investments by our customers remain prudent and demand led. Since our update in January WFE continues to track up low double-digits in 2018 compared to 2017 with slightly higher DRAM mix and slightly lower logic investments compared to our earlier baseline. For NAND and nonvolatile memory broadly the totality of our perspective would be that long-term demand drivers are compelling. Customer investments in 2018 appear essentially equivalents to those of 2017 and considering the impacts of customer specific to our moving plans this year spending we expect will be first half biased. For Lam aggregating all customer segments, we currently anticipate a first half second half shipments waiting at the low 50s high 40s level in 2018. We expect relatively balanced revenues through the year. As always this prospective account will likely change as our customers seek ways to exploit their competitive advantage and market timing later in the year. It seems that the perpetual bull-bear debate surrounds the sustainability of memory based investments. In that context, we think it is worthy to note that associated with the emergence of cloud and collectivity, the 7-year cumulative annual growth rate for memory WFE is 15%, 10x greater than the comparable foundry logic WFE CAGR. Combined with the concentration to etch and deposition technologies, a strong memory business in the new data economy is a sustainable asset and not a liability from our perspective. In addition and perhaps still somewhat underappreciated is the strengthening of Lam business, the diversification of Lam business into foundry and logic. In only the 24-month period ending December 2018, we expect Lam shipments in these segments to grow 2x faster than the pace of the underlying foundry logic WFE. In short, we feel that\u2019s the historic strength of Lam has never been more valuable. Further, the historic relative weakness of Lam is becoming much stronger. In closing, we target outperforming overall industry growth again in calendar year 2018 and we are focused on successfully executing to our near and long-term objectives growing some and increasing market share with an enhanced product and services portfolio. Strong March quarter performance is consistent with our expectations and we remain pleased with the company\u2019s execution in financials in an overall healthy industry environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay, great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with our results for the March quarter delivering record levels in shipments, revenue and operating income dollars. Each of these items grew double-digit percentage sequentially from the December quarter. Execution from the company continues to remain very strong. Shipments for the quarter came in at $3.135 billion, which was up 19% sequentially and within the guided range. Shipments were up 30% year-over-year. Timing of shipments to certain new customer projects was a primary factor in our shipment profile coming in slightly below the midpoint. As we expected, memory shipments continued to grow in the quarter, with the combined memory segment making up 84% of total system shipments and that compares to 77% in the previous quarter. Our overall nonvolatile memory shipments remain very strong representing approximately 57% of system shipments compared to 53% last quarter. DRAM shipments represented 27% of system shipments, which was up from 24% on prior quarter. The NAND and DRAM markets continue to benefit from density growth as we transition to the new data enabled economy. The Foundry segment was down accounting for 10% of system shipments relative to 15% of system payments in December. The logic and other segment contribute 6% of both system shipments compared to 8% in the prior quarter. And we would point out we expect that both foundry and logic shipments will be stronger as we go through the remainder of this year. We delivered record revenue of $2.892 billion in the March quarter, which was an increase of 12% from December and above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin for the period came in at 46.8%, which was down 80 basis points sequentially, but towards the higher end of our guided range. And as we shared before, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and we expect to see variability on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Operating expenses in the quarter grew to $486 million, but decreased 60 basis points on a percentage basis to 16.8% of revenues. On a dollar basis, R&D spending and SG&A both increased sequentially and we continue to have approximately 63% of our spending allocated to R&D. Investments in R&D are fundamental to driving long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders within the S&P 500 sectors the semiconductor and equipment group flagged the highest in the percentage of R&D spend on average for the last several years. Our strong R&D investment strategy is central to maintaining our technology leadership as we position the company to benefit from the multiple technology inflections and to deliver the growth that we have highlighted during our Investor Day in March. Operating income in the March quarter came in at a record level of $867 million, which was up over 11% from the prior quarter. Operating margin came in at the high end of our guidance at 30% due to the stronger gross margin performance and slightly better operating expenses than we expected. Excluded from non-GAAP earnings are approximately $47 million in losses from the sale of investments in anticipation of cash repatriation under the recent U.S. tax reform. We are essentially liquidating our fixed income portfolio to enable the cash to come to the United States. The tax rate for the quarter was 1%. We expect the tax rate to be in the mid single-digit percentage range for the first half of calendar 2018 of high single-digit percentage for the June quarter. I will just remind you in the longer run a tax rate in the middle teens remains the right level for you to include in your models. Based on the share count of approximately 178 million shares, earnings per share for the March quarter were $4.79, above the high end of our guidance, excuse me. The primary drivers of this upside versus our guidance were higher revenue, higher profitability, lower taxes and the lower share count. The share count includes dilution from the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes with the total dilutive impact being approximately 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Total conversions that settled in the March quarter were 228 million with 193 million related to the 2041 bond and the remainder related to the 2018 convertible note. The dilution schedules for the 2018 and 2041 convertible notes are available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. And just a reminder at our Analyst Day in March, we announced the plan to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to stockholders over the next 5 years. This included a plan to increase quarterly dividends by 120% to $1.10 and an additional $2 billion share repurchase authorization for a total of $4 billion authorized since November of last year. At the end of the quarter, we had completed approximately 25% of the current $4 billion share repurchase authorization. This was primary executed through an accelerated share repurchase program that is still ongoing. We are planning to complete our authorization over the next 12 months to 18 months in tandem with the expected timing of our cash repatriation. During the quarter we paid roughly $80 million in dividends. So now let me switch to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments including restricted cash increased during the quarter to $6.7 billion compared to $6 billion at the end of the December quarter. Approximately 87% of this total cash is still offshore. We do expect to be able to move some portion of the offshore cash to the United States during the June quarter. Cash from operations was slightly over $1 billion, up from $29 million in December. Cash generation was partially offset by our capital return programs and capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding decreased by 14 days to 66 days. You may recall me talking last quarter about the timing of certain collections falling just outside of the December quarter. All of those were collected in the March quarter. Inventory turns remained roughly consistent the prior quarter at 3.7x. And as we mentioned in our December quarter earnings call adoption of the ASC 606 new revenue recognition standard will start in the September quarter for Lam. We will provide additional clarity on the impact of the standard in our next earnings call, but I wanted to highlight that adoption of ASC 606 will make our revenue more closely aligned with the timing of shipments. Company non-cash expenses included approximately $41 million each for equity comp, amortization and depreciation. Capital expenditures were $49 million, which was down from $85 million in the December quarter. And as a reminder, we expect CapEx in 2018 will be higher versus 2017 levels to support manufacturing network expansion and growth in strategic R&D investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 10,600 regular full-time employees. The headcount additions were primarily in the factory and field with other additions in R&D. By looking ahead, we would like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June quarter. We are expecting shipments of $3 billion plus or minus $150 million. We expect continued strength in memory and slight growth in both foundry and logic. We\u2019re forecasting revenue of $3.100 billion plus or minus $150 million, gross margin of 47.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, operating margins of 31% plus or minus 1 percentage point, and finally, earnings per share of $5 plus or minus $0.20 based on the share count of approximately 178 million shares. We are pleased with our performance in the March quarter and with the guidance we have just shared for the June quarter, we anticipate our shipments to be biased to the first half primarily due to heavier first half NAND spending by our customers, we expect comparatively more balanced to our revenues half-on-half. Overall, we continue to execute well by having the right products, making the right investments at the right time to take advantage of the technology inflections driving the transition to the new data economy. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from CJ Muse with Evercore. CJ Muse : Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, clearly a lot of debate around sustainability of memory and I was hoping maybe you could help out on the DRAM side. As you think about shrinking at the next node, what kind of bit growth are you seeing overall for the industry and what kind of new greenfield capacity do you think is required each and every year as we proceed from here? Martin Anstice : That\u2019s a very precise question, CJ, each and every year. So, I mean, I think the headlines that you have just highlighted with your question is that where at an inflection relative to the economics of DRAM in two respects, one of them is the cost of the investments it costs more for bit density today than it did 5 years ago. But on the other side of that coin, the value proposition associated with what our customers are selling and what they are ultimately getting paid for those devices is dramatically different as well and to the point that we tried to make in our investor meeting, while it\u2019s true to say that our customers have never spent more money, it\u2019s also true to say that in many respects they have never spent a smaller proportion of their profits. And so when we look at bit density per wafer out, it is obviously lower today than it was 5 years ago, but pricing stability in DRAM appears there. Profits for sure are healthy in the memory community. Last time, I looked most of our customers were reporting 40% to 50% operating income levels. And I think when we look at the spending, the best of our ability is to figure out, CJ, it looks disciplined, it looks balanced and it looks healthy in the context of how customers are executing with a prudent investment in additions and significant investment in conversions. CJ Muse : Very helpful. And as my follow-up, I guess, Doug, can you kind of walk through how you are expecting mix in gross margin to be impacted by mix as we move into the second half of the calendar year? Doug Bettinger : CJ, we don\u2019t really give guidance one quarter at a time, but what I would suggest to you is as I always do in my scripted remarks, gross margin will move around quarter-to-quarter depending on business volumes, product mix, customer concentration. If I looked at the last, I don\u2019t know year or two, we have bounced around between 46% and 47% and that\u2019s kind of what we have got baked into the financial model, so that\u2019s probably a good signpost used relative to how to think about it C.J. CJ Muse : Very helpful. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks C.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. First one, Doug I think you mentioned on shipments some timing of shipments came out of March, went into June if you could had to quantify that. And then as we look into June you are guiding to some small decline in shipments quarter-to-quarter which I believe is somewhat different than the seasonal norm if you could provide any color around that would be also useful? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Vivek, I mean quite honestly, we missed the midpoint in guidance by $40 million which honestly is four or five tools when you think about in the grand text of what\u2019s happening with our numbers, so as always you have got things that shipped and they moved around every quarter. And I am not really going to comment on any specific customer, but it was a pretty modest variance in terms of how to think about them. Martin Anstice : I think on the seasonality components of the question, one of the themes of the investor meeting was the irony of consolidating kind of customer base, but a more diversified demand portfolio. And in transitions away from kind of simple units to a density and the role that enterprise and clouds and data center has in the construct of this marketplace, I am not sure any of us would agree what the headlines of seasonality are. I am not sure I could articulate as the guidance only being in this industry close 20 years I wouldn\u2019t be able to describe to you what seasonality is today, because it\u2019s a dramatically different profile of demand for IC and the discipline of our customers is very different today than it was 10 years ago. Vivek Arya : Alright. And the follow-up, Martin our foundry contribution, only about 10% in march, I think probably one of the lowest levels we have seen, how do you think about that the contribution on a quantitative basis as we move throughout the rest of the year and especially the pipeline ahead of some of the node migrations that your foundry customers are going to go through? Thank you. Martin Anstice : Yes. I mean the foundry headline for company is awesome. I mean it could be better, it can more awesome, but we have made a significant amount of progress in the last of couple years and I talked about in my compared comments that\u2019s not only do I think we have foundational strengths from the memory presence in the company, but the diversification of foundry and logic is the strength, but perhaps it\u2019s a little underappreciated. The objective we have running the company is to ship products to customers when they ask for them not early, not late and so when you see these quarterly kind of movements it really is nothing more than a customer\u2019s request. And frankly I mean we would love to live in the world of perfectly calm and predictable and unknown variable world if we don\u2019t, so we do the best we can to ship to customers when they ask for it. So there really is no headline associated with the 10% number that you referred to for the foundry other than that just happened to be the schedule of the customers request compared in contrast with December and compared to contrast with the June quarter. So the strength what we characterized is real we believe sustainable and we are working hard to make it even more valuable going forward. Doug Bettinger : And Vivek we expect foundry will grow as we go through the year as well and just to reiterate the comment I had in my script. Vivek Arya : Got it. Thank you very much. Martin Anstice : Thanks Vivek. Operator : And your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. Martin, I was hoping you could provide an update on China, I think there have been a couple of media reports recently about some of your customers winning real business for the first time and some of your customers planning on ramping capacity later this year and to 2019, so it does feel like we are getting closer to a decently sized ramp if you will. So, I guess the question is what are you seeing in terms of bookings today and what are your expectations over the next 12 months to 18 months? Martin Anstice : Yes. Actually, I think our expectation today is almost exactly the same to the expectation that we started the year with, maybe even had almost a year ago. I mean we believe in the vision that\u2019s being articulated and we see our customers investing to build competency, capability and know how to go execute that vision. And indeed we are aware that the customers kind of reported real end customer business and outlet that presumably legitimizes this. So, going back to where we started this conversation in earlier in the year, we expect a couple of billion dollars of incremental WFE this year in China and that represents 10%, 12% or so of the overall WFE kind of marketplace. So, the bulk of the industry is still outside of China and obviously included in China or at least the global company investments as well as the domestic community. So, I would say it continues to appear like there is steady progress. Toshiya Hari : Okay, great. And then as my follow-up I was hoping you guys can talk a little bit about the ALD opportunity longer term I think you touched on the subject briefly at your Investor Day, but if you could remind us how you use size the opportunities at longer term, if you can talk a little bit about the competitive landscape there? That would be helpful as well. Thank you. Martin Anstice : Yes. I mean, I think we have obviously articulated not just for deposition business unit, but also for the etch business unit, the importance of control and repeatability and opening our process windows for our customers and atomic level processing is an important part of delivering that. There are other significant challenges for our customers, not least aspect ratios, but atomic level processing is increasingly relevant to the success of the company and the success of the customers. So, it\u2019s big investments. It\u2019s one of the biggest areas of competitive momentum. We don\u2019t actually characterize in any detail the proportion of WFE that we think is directly assignable because that we obviously have competitive sensitivity to that, but I think we got fundamental differentiation on technology and productivity and the engagement with the customer is comprehensive. And I am pretty pleased with the momentum we have. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Romit Shah : Yes, thank you. Martin, I definitely appreciate your comments around just DRAM spending looking balanced and disciplined, but seeing that shipments here over 30% sequentially and 50% year-on-year, I mean, obviously realized that higher cost per bit is a factor, but at what level do you become concerned that your DRAM customers are adding too much capacity? Martin Anstice : I would say I would be concerned that our customers are adding a few much capacity if the analytics in our company in terms of end use demand concluded that there was a dramatic imbalance and we have no evidence of that. I mean, we are trying to articulate and our prospective may not be the best that\u2019s a choice obviously that you have to make, but we do our best to analyze kind of end markets. And when we look at bit mind and bit consensus and then the construct of the market and isolate, for example, a 45% servr bit growth assumption in DRAM and that impact on investment levels and then to the best of our abilities understands, bit per wafer and the investment choices for customers between conversions and additions. We end up in the same place that our customers are articulating plans. And so it\u2019s left to do with how big the number is in my opinion and much more to do with whether it correlates to the statement of demand. Doug Bettinger : As well as affordability, Romit, as you know, I mean, DRAM revenue and profits are all-time record levels. Romit Shah : Yes, got it and helpful. Thanks for that. And then could you also just talk about what\u2019s happening in logic you have \u2013 or at least my understanding is you have a very strong position at 10-nanometer, certainly a better position than you did at the previous node and we have seen revenues in this category run up last year, you had a very strong Q3, but shipments down the last couple of quarters and I think you mentioned that logic was a little weaker than you anticipated in the first quarter? Martin Anstice : Yes. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s particularly material in the long-term. Again, I go back to my answer to the earlier question in foundries, I mean, all we try to do if I am very correct and honest is ship product to customers let me ask for it, not earlier and not late and that\u2019s our focus and that\u2019s priorities. So, you are going to see up and down as customers adjust schedules and most of the time we get that light fairly well to our midpoint guidance and we almost always get it correct in our range, in fact, I think always in our range. So, I mean, I don\u2019t think we are doing that job a signaling here. But it\u2019s just a matter of the timing of investments by customers and that goes up and down and we just roll on truly. But focus of the company to where you started is making sure that we have a product portfolio that\u2019s more relevant to our logic and foundry customers and to making sure that we are gaining more market share and in the microprocessors and foundry both hopefully we have been effectively communicating pretty positive market share in the last couple of years. Doug Bettinger : And Romit the only other thing I would add on that is I do think probably when you look at the logic shipments for the course of 2018 it will go up from where it is in March. Romit Shah : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Well, good afternoon and great job on the quarter of the execution. As a follow-up to the prior questions on DRAM, maybe a different way of asking the question is to see if the team can help us quantify some of the reviews, overall DRAM industry capacity has been trending about 1.1 million wafers products per month and relatively flattish for the past several years, the market has been getting nervous in the amount of announced DRAM CapEx spend announcement of new fiber expansion product or projects, but a lot of it I think is just to offset capacity declines and technology conversion and just to maintain a stable bit supply output, so wanted to get your views on how much you see total industry capacity going this year? Martin Anstice : So I 100% agree with what you articulated in terms of the rationale for investments whether tradition or conversion, I mean it\u2019s for demand and it\u2019s the consequence of capital intensity relative to the incremental bits of various kind of nodes transitions. So I mean not exactly the same place, we are in exactly the same place that you articulated in your question. Unfortunately in a world of very few customers today it\u2019s almost impossible for an equipment company to answer directly the question that you just asked. It\u2019s too competitively sensitive for our customers. So we do respect I have to ask you to ask them, but what I will say is we do see a modest increase in capacity in DRAM associated with the driver of demand to the consensus of the kind of low to mid-20 bit growth number that everybody seems to kind of talk about these days. And it seems like it\u2019s perfectly relevant to the choices that our customers are making. So unfortunately, quantification has to come from them and that\u2019s what I can tell you is it appears modest and balanced and rational. Harlan Sur : Great. Thanks for the insights there Martin. Doug a question for you, great job on the strong free cash flow almost I think 35% free cash flow margins in the March quarter, although you did tell us that you are going to play some catch up here versus the weaker December quarter, but at the high level, going back to last earnings call and Analyst Day, we will just assume that you can maintain operating margins in sort of the 30%, 31% plus range this year, we would anticipate free cash flow margins for the full calendar year in the range of about 26% to 27% for the full year is that kind of the right way to think about it? Doug Bettinger : Yes. That\u2019s the right way to think about it Harlan. I mean CapEx in the model in terms of how we think about it is 3% to 4% of revenue typically so yes, that\u2019s what\u2019s company had it in the model we gave in March. Harlan Sur : Great, alright. Thank you very much. Martin Anstice : Thanks Harlan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad : Thanks for taking my question. Doug, we saw a lot of volatility in the share prices in the March quarter, so a bit surprised that we didn\u2019t see more significant buybacks, can you just talk about what are some of the variables that you think about in terms of buying back the shares, is there any constraints that stopped you from buying more? Doug Bettinger : The primary thing Frahan relative to the $4 billion authorization is just availability of cash domestically, 87% of the cash that the company has still is domicile outside the United States. It takes time to move that around. We have taken step one of that in terms of beginning to liquidate the portfolio, but there is administrative paperwork to dividend things up and down, the tax structure to get the cash and that\u2019s the primary thing that we need to have. We need the cash before we can buy significant stock and that will come over the next 12 months with almost all of the cash will be available by the end of year. Martin Anstice : So I think in the context of the questions were certainly important to emphasize kind of the long-term vision for the company that we talked about at the investor meeting which is kind of redistribution of 50% of free cash flow generated over the long-term and nothing new to say today. So, it\u2019s a transactional moment in time, but a bit longer term commitments adding us the important message. Farhan Ahmad : Got it. And then one question on the non-CapEx at the beginning, you had talked about non-CapEx being kind of modestly up this year and DRAM being up more significant. If I look at your March quarter shipments up a lot and I was just wondering if your outlook in NAND has changed in any way in terms of the overall CapEx spending this year? Martin Anstice : Not really. It\u2019s more or less the same today as it was kind of 3 months ago kind of what you are seeing is first half bias, which Doug talked about in his prepared comments more or less the investments that we expected is the one that seems to be playing out. And any 1 month or any 1 week or any one quarter that can go left or right a little bit, but pretty much where we expected it to be and no fundamental message is in terms of kind of bit growth that are different from the consensus and maybe the only incremental thing I would say is our expectations of investments this year which kind of lead to approximately a similar level of shipped capacity not yet qualified at the end of \u201818 to the level that existed in \u201817, which obviously definitely means the same level of discipline at the end of the beginning that existed at the beginning of the year. Farhan Ahmad : Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Farhan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. Can I ask a slightly annoying question I guess that people are asking me as well? You said on the last call that you thought that the shipment levels would be relatively balanced through the year, they are down a little bit in Q2, they are going to be down a little bit in the second half, is that just at the noise level, I realized these are very small changes? Has anything changed in terms of the way you see the pattern that you see through the year? Martin Anstice : Not really. And I don\u2019t want to sound dismissive about the short-term, but again in context whether it\u2019s in the context of the answer to the shipments kind of midpoint question or the difference between what we said last time and what we said this time and I think it\u2019s the same message in slightly different words and none of it changes in our opinion the long-term opportunity and the importance of investing for long-term and the potential that we described in the investor meeting. So, from the inside out, this is transactional noise more than anything fundamental and if that changes we will tell you, but that\u2019s about it right now. Joe Moore : Great. That\u2019s what I thought. Thank you so much. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, thank you. I had two questions guys. First on China trade, well actually both of them on China trade. First of all, is there the potential is there any President for the government to restrict exports of equipment into China? Martin Anstice : Well, we have lived in that world before. And it wasn\u2019t I would say a fundamental restriction it just made the process of doing business in China a more bureaucratic. We have to file for licenses and so on and so forth. So, there is President for U.S. export restrictions of technology, not so much into semiconductor, but into semiconductor when there was a dual use that the defense department or the commerce department we are trying to manage. Maybe if I take the essence of your question and go somewhere beyond it\u2019s precisely to kind of the conversation of our tariffs. We don\u2019t see an impact today on our business or on our customers\u2019 business or on our industry that would cause us to say that there is a new kind of long-term message. But we are attentive to two very important things. If tariffs starts to be disruptive to consumer confidence that has an impact in the global economy and it will eventually impact semiconductors and in turn equipments and we are attentive to domestic equipment company agendas as well. And I am not seeing that today, but if things got a little bit tit for tat, then there are obviously risks at a minimum that we need to be attentive to, but the end of the day, there is the fundamental value proposition that comes from every equipment company that\u2019s 30 years or 40 years old and we win business and we enable based on our expertise competency and know-how. So, I am not seeing kind of risks today, but we are attentive to the other two things that we have just \u2013 that I just described attentive to consumer confidence changes and attentive to domestic equipment company agendas. Timothy Arcuri : Got it. Thank you. And then just this, it seems to be a school of thought that maybe this could accelerate the pace of the build out of some of these indigenous projects, I mean they seem pretty rational and pretty return focused, but have you seen any signs that they may want to pull forward some of the timelines because of some potential down the road for this to evolve into something that is bigger than it is today? Martin Anstice : No. Timothy Arcuri : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Edwin Mok : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So first my questions is on our foundry just to clarify your comment, you said that foundry CapEx you expect to be largely in line will it tell you something, is that correct, we will see more conversion from 10 nanometer to 7 nanometer, I would expect maybe slight decline in foundry. And then kind of looking beyond this year kind of based on how will you guys look at demand and the foundry capacity, do you see a scenario of what a foundry spending can potentially grow beyond this year? Martin Anstice : I think we started the year with a kind of flat to slightly down kind of concrete for foundry year-over-year and no change today. And I think if I heard the second part of your question it relates to whether there is upsides, did I get it correct? Edwin Mok : Yes. These are just \u2013 is there upside probably laid on this year or going into 2018 there is some speculation\u2026? Martin Anstice : I would say maybe I mean we are doing our best to articulate what we think is likely to happen. And there maybe is interwoven in this conversation around advanced computes as the components of this value proposition in AI and data economy and it serves in the purpose to have a great cloud with great storage and great memory without great competition. So, if the value proposition accelerates, then I think it is an industry-wide opportunity. But in the context of the pilot line timings that we understand with our customers for 5 nanometer, the investments in 7 nanometer and 10 nanometer plans, the outlook that we have described is the best we have to offer right now. Edwin Mok : I see, okay, great. I think that\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, two follow-ups. You mentioned your revenue for the second half of the current year is more balanced with the first half and we have the revenues for the first half, does that suggest that we should assume a quarterly revenue that has provided you the free handle for the September and December quarter? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Mehdi necessarily relative balance could be plus or minus 51.9 something like that, it\u2019s \u2013 and I have given you guidance for every quarter through the rest of the year right now. Mehdi Hosseini : Alright, okay. Doug Bettinger : Martin described shipments low-50s, high-40s half-on-half, my comment was revenue would be a little bit more balanced in comparing that. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. In terms of the guidance, I wanted to go back to some of your commentary from the Analyst Day and obviously we have been debating sustainability of the memory spend since your shipment hit the $1 billion target and now we are at the $3 billion and sustainability of memory spend keeps coming up, in the mean time revenues are actually diversifying you have recently started to highlight the services mix and especially with the new tools for non-customers is the higher services content and if you really believe in a new paradigm shift why can\u2019t you help us to better model and kind of shift away from these seasonality where if I take your shipment for the March quarter and analyze it, that would suggest shipment up, well over 20% for the year and perhaps maybe some additional color on the revenue mix could better help us and move away from this seasonality that is being just lingering? Martin Anstice : I am not sure exactly what you are referring to the seasonality, but I mean at the end of the day shipments and revenue mix will be exactly the same, one is timing shipments sometimes happen sooner than revenues. So at the end of the day, it all normalizes to the same thing which is why we give you the shipment probably the way we do. Doug Bettinger : If I can add just one more thing, I would say if I mean for anybody on the call at any point in time listening to Lam Research, if you have recommendations on specific disclosure that you think would be helpful if we feel like we can do it in the context of respecting our customers and if we can do it in the context of preserving competitive advantage, we have every motivation to do that. So, we are doing the best we can to articulate an outlook in an opportunity and risk and so on and so forth. And if you have specific recommendations, please make the most line and we will do the best we can. Mehdi Hosseini : Does your shipment represent services and parts or is it just a system? Martin Anstice : When I gave you the color on the percentages every quarter, Mehdi, I specifically say system shipment, so it\u2019s system. Mehdi Hosseini : Right. If you are going to realize the $1 billion of incremental revenue from services that won\u2019t be captured by shipment and that\u2019s what could become the difference looking forward? Martin Anstice : Potentially, yes, Mehdi. Mehdi Hosseini : Alright. Just I think the suggestion with the customer with the guide? Martin Anstice : We will consider. We will think about how we can give you better understanding on what\u2019s going on the services which I think at the end of the day is what you are asking for right. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Martin Anstice : Alright. We will think about it offline if you want to share with us what would be helpful too. That would help us think about it. Mehdi Hosseini : Thanks. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Mehdi. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Atif Malik : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just want to go back to the shipment mix and you made point of expectations on the timing of the projects, can you share with us if there is one end-market that\u2019s responsible for this $40 million shortfall, is it more foundry or is it more NAND? Martin Anstice : Atif, as you can appreciate, we have a very small set of customers and we are giving more color than just timing of certain projects \u2013 with certain customer projects is probably the best we can do for you. Atif Malik : Okay. And then as a follow-up just broadly speaking can you share with us your expectations on the timing off the 92, 96 layer 3D NAND for the industry versus the 64-layer NAND migration, when should we expect the majority of the NAND makers moving to 92, 96 layer NAND? Thank you. Martin Anstice : I think the best we can do is refer you back to the flash memory summit presentation we made last year, which to the best of my recollection details all of our assumptions in terms of phases of development for NAND flash and rather be selective to ones and risking being inconsistent with that, I\u2019d ask you to kind of go back to that disclosure. And if there is the remaining question then, please follow-up with Satya. Thanks, Atif. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Mart, maybe first off in terms of foundry logic commentary you detailed, given a lot of the noise out there surrounding EUV, can you detail from a Lam perspective \u2013 what applications and what new areas do you see etch and deposition that are helping you grow that serve the available market in spite of I guess some of the air concerns about EUV reducing the capital intensity of those two processes? Martin Anstice : Well, I guess, at the very basic level we have attempted for the last several years to articulate a set of assumptions, which I think are generally consistent with the assumptions that our customers communicate and the assumptions that ASML would communicate around adoption of EUV and using those assumptions we have attempted to communicate this through the 5-nanometer transition, our SAM increases in etch and deposition. So, I would say the first part of answering the question is we have articulated to the best of our ability increasing SAM through 5-nanometer and we will see what integration scheme show up a 3 before answering that question. In addition to that, the company is making a very specific set of investments and you have seen one of them quite publicly or maybe two of them quite publicly, but I will pick one of them now and that\u2019s the world of advanced equipment process control. So we have articulated incremental SAM that we are targeting for the purposes of delivering more control and process and more a repeatability or uniformity so on and so forth. And that is directly relevant to foundry and microprocessor opportunity for the company as well and I am not going to go into details, but we have 3 or 4 pretty significant SAM expansion objectives above and beyond the inflections we have been talking about for the last several years and that\u2019s all obviously incorporated in the long-term financial models that we presented a few weeks ago. Patrick Ho : Alright. Thanks for asking that. And Doug, as a follow-up, I know you probably won\u2019t say that visibility has significantly increased, but just based on customer projects and timing of them, it seems like your equipment industry as a whole is getting much better visibility than they have ever gotten. Your balance sheet metrics in the procurement and everything you have done seems to be reacting very well. What changes have you made that has allowed you to adjust to I guess maybe increase visibility as well as the higher demand levels? Doug Bettinger : I mean all the technology inflections you have seen happened over the last several years, Patrick that required our customers to have very advanced conversations those are well in advance of when they need certain capability, because we need to develop the equipment quite honestly. So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s new. It\u2019s been happening over the last several years and it\u2019s enabled us to plan our company to be able to support where we are at today. So, the conversation is very deep and rich when you are enabling the customer\u2019s roadmap in the way that we are. Patrick Ho : Right, thank you. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Craig Ellis : Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the color on the call so far, guys. I just wanted to ask a question to get some longer term context around the full year shipment commentary. I think if I look back over the last 2 years there have been years when we have looked for a half-on-half profile that would be down in the second half and yet the year played out and it wound up being up. So as you look at the risks on both sides, can you just recap the upside risk to that shipment outlook as well as the downside risk? Thank you. Martin Anstice : I guess, I am not sure it\u2019s bigger. I mean at the end of the day, if you believe the statements that we are making around discipline and demand led investments, then the kind of known commodities at this point in time relates to the capital intensity of any one technology node or any one kind of device architecture. So, I don\u2019t think there is kind of too many risks or opportunities relative to people\u2019s understanding of kind of cost consequence of a DRAM or a 3D NAND transition. Individual customer plans in a short-term can create artificial kind of disruption I would say in terms of WFE. In the long-term, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all, because if one customer decreases and other one likely increases, if one increases and other one slightly decreases, so you kind of see kind of customer risks and opportunities. And if your window of focus is a quarter, then that will be disruptive to you if your window of focus is the year, it\u2019s irrelevant, because it\u2019s a dynamic kind of marketplace. I do think \u2013 and I would extend the customer conversation into a regional conversation, something like China. Right, I mean, I think our hypothesis still remains that with any of the regions of the world, including China that the investment will be demand based and rationale. So, I do think where there is still a significant amount of variability in plans is kind of how people choose to go execute and you can change the WFE investment profile quite materially through the choices you make around new capacity additions versus plaintiff to 3D transitions versus 3D transition scaling versus that maybe modifying a DRAM line to flash line or vice-versa. So \u2013 yes and even some of these strategies and that will sound maybe quite transactional, but it can have a fairly significant impact. So, we do our best to try and get a dialogue with customers to understand where they are going to head. I would say the simplest headline to your answer is if demand is stronger or weaker, it has \u2013 for ICs associated with these AI transitions and value propositions of the data economy, whether you will see it in the calendar year was debatable, but you will see it over a couple of year period in a positive or negative direction. And the rest of it I think is more operational execution as customers try to optimize their fabs, their line layouts and they try to optimize their use of cash. Craig Ellis : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Martin. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Satya Kumar : Yes, that\u2019s all the time we have for the call today. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good day and welcome to the Lam Research June 2018 Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Odette Go, Treasurer for Lam Research. Please go ahead, ma'am. Odette Marie Go - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our outlook on the business environment, review our financial results for the June 2018 quarter, and our outlook for the September 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. It can be also found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 PM Pacific Time. And as always, we ask that you limit your questions to one per firm with a brief follow-up so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Good afternoon. I've firmly established that Lam is the priority of contributing to the success of our customers through the increased strategic relevance of our product and services portfolio. Ultimately, this focus is measured by our financial performance and the June quarter financial results were outstanding. Worthy of note, we achieved the milestone of revenues exceeding $3 billion and non-GAAP operating income of approximately $1 billion. Short-term performance is not simply our goal, however. We have delivered and we aspire to continue to reward our stakeholders with multi-year industry outperformance measured by competing for and winning a greater proportion of our customers' investments; greater in quantity and greater in quality through the degree of codependency and annuity. In this context, we also concluded the strongest fiscal year in our history by delivering approximately $11 billion in revenues, representing growth of almost 40%, $3.4 billion in non-GAAP operating income, and $2.7 billion in cash from operations. At this point of our journey, I would like to thank our customers, our employees, and our partners for their active support and confidence in the company. Our intense focus on technology and productivity leadership, operational execution, and a genuine model of collaboration, we believe, are together the essential foundations for an exciting long-term future. Well-published at this point, customer equipment investment spending has softened near term as industry participants continue to strive for discipline and sustainability in their businesses. While it is true to say that the short-term headlines reflect themselves in lower calendar Q3 guidance than we were anticipating earlier, we consider the change a strong, positive long-term influence. We offer the following perspectives. While not true for every customer, the segments of memory and foundry have both seen, although for different reasons, some reduction in equipment's demand short-term, but the largest single adjustments occurred in DRAM. We now plan overall 2018 WFE up year-over-year in the single-digit range. We expect the September quarter to be the low point of our calendar year. We remain optimistic about our mid-term and long-term opportunity and continue to target Lam's outperformance this year and long-term. With the comprehensiveness of our disclosure earlier this year in our Investor and Analyst Meeting combined with the abundance of disclosure from other industry participants on the increasing role of silicon, the increasing role of data, and the acceleration of innovation in the cognitive computing environment, there's not so much more to add currently. Bottom line, our customers have inspirational ambition and we exist to support them. Arguably, there's not been a more exciting time in our industry in decades and the intensity of focus at Lam to mitigate risks and maximize strategic opportunities combined, we believe, to create a compelling editorial. While it is true to say that our customers have never invested more absolute dollars in their future, with the recent device ASP trends, they are investing a lower proportion of their annual profits and in any point of the last 15 years. That is the new industry and new value proposition headline that we have cited on several occasions now. We noted last quarter that we expected low double-digit WFE growth in 2018 and a first half, second half shipments allocation in the low 50s, high 40s, with revenues a little more balanced. We now expect single-digit WFE growth, with the adjustments reflecting themselves primarily in the September quarter. Having previously anticipated a first half, second half reduction in memory WFE of between 20% and 25%, we now expect a larger reduction, with the long-term demands trends intact. To fully understand our September business volume trajectory, the following headlines that underpin our belief in the extraordinary value proposition of memory strength long-term are important. We have the confidence in the long-term value and opportunity because memory and storage is increasingly prominent in the computer and systems integration roadmaps of the industry with fundamental and broadening demand drivers. Analytically, that reflects itself in the trailing seven-year cumulative growth rate for memory WFE, which is approximately 10 times greater than the equivalent logic foundry CAGR. Similarly, since 2013, memory WFE as a percentage of total WFE has trended from 40% to 60%, with the corresponding etch and deposition memory markets growing faster and to a higher level. This is our SAM expansion commentary. Considering these data points and the approximate 25% contribution from our installed base business, our September quarter guidance should be quite intuitive. Turning to some of the business headlines of the company this quarter. There should now be a greater awareness to the earnings quality delivered from our installed base business, the so-called annuity of Lam, and that is where I would like to concentrate my prepared remarks here today. You will remember our objective to create value for customers through productivity solutions and the development of advanced services to facilitate improved value capture for Lam and growth at a pace faster than the growth of our installed base units. Our installed base business has grown more than 2 times faster than our installed base unit growth this year, with our worldwide process chamber counts now approximately 55,000 units. In a world where our customers' focus appropriately seeks optimal asset utilization, our reliance in reuse business recorded first half 2018 growth of approximately 50% year-over-year. This is a commentary on the broadening of our product offerings and the demand for more than more IoT and MEMS silicon capacity. As a reminder, our SAM expansion focus has three foundations today : first, fully realizing the opportunities of multi-patterning and 3D device scaling over multiple years. Second, broadening our systems applications, and films capabilities where there is opportunity and unmet customer need, and third, increasing value creation from advanced productivity services. On this last point, the portfolio is now quite comprehensive and harnesses the technologies of big data that we helped create. Customer engagements are now extensive, ranging from demo and evaluation to fab wide adoption. We are pleased with our progress and excited by the opportunity to increase customer value to codependency, at the same time increasing the quality of Lam Research earnings. For the systems businesses of etch and deposition, our investments in SAM expansion, market share defense and penetration, and disruptive technologies continues at pace and we're pleased with the comprehensiveness and the complements of our technology and product roadmaps to the expectations of customers and the competitive dynamic. In closing, this is a year characterized by the following. First, the increased prominence of silicon and in turn, the equipment industry in the creation of value for the global economy. Two, rational, disciplined spending by our customers at the highest level in history, supported by the highest revenues in profits in their industry. Three, unmatched outperformance opportunity, we believe, for Lam. To emphasize a few key points. September P&L guidance for Lam is impacted by four things : first, the relative strength of memory and the strength of Lam in memory; second, the actions by some customers in recent weeks to adjust their short-term investment plans; and third, the implementation of new revenue recognition rules and the specifics of customer delivery and acceptance dates leading up to the new accounting policy adoption; and fourth, the variability of our operating expense cost structure without compromising our long-term focus. Current knowledge indicates September will be the low points of our year and more importantly, the long-term trends of our industry and company, we believe, are as compelling as ever. On this last point, we look forward to sharing more of our long-term opportunities at the August 7 Flash Memory Summit conference where Rick Gottscho, our CTO, Doug, and myself will be hosting a reception. With that, I'll turn the call over to Doug. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Great. Thank you, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a very busy earnings day. The June quarter results represented a solid conclusion to the 2018 fiscal year. For the quarter, we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance for all financial metrics. For the fiscal year, we delivered record levels of shipments, revenues, cash from operations, gross margin dollars, operating income dollars as well as earnings per share. We're obviously very pleased with what we achieved this quarter and this fiscal year. Shipments for the quarter were again at the $3 billion mark at $3.028 billion, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. For fiscal year 2018, shipments were $11.176 billion, which was a 30% increase compared to fiscal year 2017. Memory shipments continued to be strong in June, with the combined memory segment making up 80% of total system shipments. Our overall non-volatile memory shipments remain strong, representing approximately 55% of the system shipments compared to 57% last quarter. DRAM shipments represented 25% of system shipments, down from 27% in the prior quarter. The foundry segment was up, accounting for 13% of system shipments relative to 10% in March. And finally, the logic and other segment contributed 7% of system shipments, just a little bit above the prior quarter's 6%. We delivered record revenues of $3.126 billion in the June quarter, an increase of 8% from March and again slightly above the midpoint of guidance. For the fiscal year, revenues came in at $11.077 billion, which was an increase of 38% from fiscal year 2017. Our installed base business contributed approximately 25% of our revenues in the fiscal year. Gross margin for the June quarter came in at 48%, which was up 120 basis points sequentially and the highest level in over a decade. As we shared before, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix, and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter to quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter grew to $507 million, but decreased 60 basis points on a sequential basis to 16.2% of revenues. On a dollar basis, R&D spending grew while SG&A spending slightly declined as compared with the March quarter. R&D comprised nearly 65% of our total spending. We continue to believe that disciplined R&D investments will increase our likelihood of achieving our future revenue growth objectives. Operating income in the June quarter came in at a record level of $994 million, up about 15% from the prior quarter. Operating margin came in close to the high end of guidance at 31.8% primarily due to the stronger gross margin performance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was 6.7%, in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. We expect the tax rate in the low to middle teens for the remainder of calendar year 2018. In the longer run, a tax rate in the middle teens remains the right level to include in your modeling and there will be fluctuations around this quarter to quarter. Based on a share count of approximately 175 million shares, earnings per share for the June quarter came in at $5.31, above the high end of our guided range. Primary drivers of the upside versus our guidance was the improved profitability and a little bit lower share count. The share count includes dilution from the 2018 warrants and 2041 convertible notes, with the total dilutive impact being about 13 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. In the June quarter, our 2018 convertible note, which had a remaining balance of $172 million, matured and was settled in cash and stock. But dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. For the June quarter, we had $6 million in early conversions for the 2041 notes. The remaining balance of the 2041 notes is $327 million and I do expect we will continue to see requests for early redemptions. In the June quarter, we spent $1.3 billion on share repurchases. With that, we have completed almost 60% of the current $4 billion authorization and we repurchased approximately 12 million shares. We're planning to complete the remainder of the authorization over the next nine months in tandem with the expected timing of our cash repatriation. During the quarter, we be paid roughly $80 million in dividends and we also declared a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share that will be paid in the September quarter. Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments including our restricted cash decreased in the quarter to $5.2 billion compared with $6.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, largely due to our capital return activities as well as debt repayment. In addition to retiring the 2018 convert, we also paid down approximately $640 million of commercial paper. Approximately 80% of the total $5.2 billion cash balance was offshore at the end of the quarter. Cash from operations for the June quarter was approximately $718 million, which was down slightly from over $1 billion in the March quarter. DSO decreased by three days to 63 days. Inventory turns came in at 3.5 times compared to 3.7 times in the prior quarter. And for the fiscal year, the company has generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations. Company noncash expenses included approximately $47 million for equity comp, $40 million for amortization, and $45 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $80 million, which is up from $49 million in the March quarter. And as a reminder, we expect CapEx in 2018 to be higher compared to 2017 to support manufacturing network expansion and growth in our strategic R&D programs. We exited the quarter with approximately 10,900 regular full-time employees. And as we previously noted, we are adopting ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard effective in fiscal 2019 which for Lam begins in the September quarter. Under ASC 606, we generally will record revenue at the time of shipment rather than at the time of customer acceptance. Under our prior accounting methodology for more than a decade, our results have shown revenue recognition lag in shipments. However, with this new accounting change, a change in shipments will essentially be equivalent to the change in revenues and adjustments in customer spending activity will have a quicker impact on our revenues and profits generally within the same quarter. Because revenues will become more closely correlated to shipments, shipments will cease to have value as a leading indicator. As a result, we have decided to discontinue reporting shipments. With the implementation of the new revenue recognition policy coinciding with some of our customers trimming their near term investment plans, most notably in NAND, you will see the impacts right away in our next quarter's results. Looking ahead, I'd like to provide a non-GAAP guidance for the September quarter. We are expecting revenues of $2.3 billion, plus or minus $150 million. We're expecting a meaningful downtick in memory spending in the September quarter. Gross margin of 46%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; operating margins of 26%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $3.20, plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 163 million shares. As we sit here today, we believe the September quarter marks a near-term trough for our business. Ticking back on our messaging at our March Analyst Day, we remain very optimistic on our longer term growth prospects. We continue to believe that we have competitively differentiated products and disciplined investments that will continue to drive Lam's outperformance into the future. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Martin and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a two-part question in one. Can you speak to how you're expecting the ramp of the recovery and into December? And then I guess more importantly, given this extremely rational behavior by your memory customers, how does that, I guess, make you think about the health of this industry overall and also the impact for your vision for WFE into 2019 all things equal? Thank you. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Obviously, the first part of the question, C.J., we're not going to guide December specifically in this meeting. But as Doug and I both said in our prepared comments, we do expect September to be the low point and we'll be on a positive trajectory in December. And we'll report, I guess, at that time the magnitude of it but we would not have commented if we didn't think it was material. On the second point, I mean, it's a terrific commentary on the maturity of the industry. That the corrections happened at the pace they do and I mean, this is a pretty amazing industry at this point. If you look at kind of memory companies, their revenues are up. I think they're going to be up maybe 25% this year. After they were up 60% last year, which is a $100 billion DRAM business probably this year and the profitability levels of memory companies today are trending 40% to 50% operating income. So there's some really nice headlines in terms of discipline and some really nice headlines in terms of profitability and sustainability and their business is a different business today. And if you kind of \u2013 if you went even higher than the memory statements and opines on the semiconductor industry holistically, in the five years 2014 to 2018 inclusive, semiconductor revenues are up by about $125 billion, if you believe in that $450 billion or a $460 billion revenue for calendar 2018. In that same timeframe, there has been an increase in wafer fabrication equipment investments by probably $18 billion in the low to the high end of that period. That means the incremental capital intensity of that 15%, I mean, that is an incredible level of efficiency of spending and a great commentary, I think, on sustainability in light of probably the most exciting set of demand drivers and the most diverse set of demand drivers we've had in a decade. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Great. Thanks, C.J. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Next question, please. Operator : And next, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you very much. I had two. I guess first thing, Doug. I wanted to ask what the guidance would have been net of ASC 606. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I'm not going to give you a specific number, Tim, but I will tell you at the end of every quarter and the 10-Q, you'll see for the next year old way and new way. I'm not going to get into guiding it because lots can change around it and I'm going to just stick to the current accounting rules. But you will be able to see it at the end of every quarter, Tim. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, awesome. Thanks. And then Martin, you made a comment when you were talking about service that it's up 50% year-over-year. Was that just a particular piece of the service business? Or were you talking about service as a whole? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I kind of attempted to deliver two messages on the installed base business. The first one is the growth of the entire installed base business which is spares and service and upgrades and training and the reliance in reuse business and that was the 2 times faster in the six months of this year than the pace of growth of the installed base units. The second reference, which is the 50% reference you just spoke to, related to our reliance and reuse business. So I was focusing on one segment for reasons that hopefully are quite obvious. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Tim, as I was thinking about, maybe just a little color on the rev rec thing so we don't continue to get questions on it. I mean, guys, think about it in the right way. At the end of the day, this is just all timing, right? Shipments always turn into revenue, they never don't. That always happens. And so, holistically thinking about this change, it's meaningless at the end of the day. It's purely timing. It has no impact on cash flow. It has no impact on how we manage or think about the business and in the long-term, it really doesn't matter. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : And I guess, Doug, just to that point, so the shipments basically would have been about 2.3. That's kind of how to think of it, right? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: What I said was revenue and shipments are going to be much more closely correlated and we're going to stop guiding shipments as a result because it's not as useful as a leading indicator as it used to be. So we're not going to be talking about shipments anymore, Tim. Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Tim. Operator : And next, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the breadth of the spending base as you look into the second half. Memory companies are driving 60% gross margins and 50% operating margin profitability so very strong. Logic and foundry guys also strong profitably levels so I guess profitably is a proxy for the health of the fundamental environment. So there's really no red flags which would cause your customer base to downshift on your tech migration and capacity plans. So it seems like what you're seeing in the September quarter is more of a project shift, seems to be more maybe customer-specific and maybe limited to one or two customers. Is that kind of the right way to think about it? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: It's definitely not all customers. I mean, there are some pretty kind of selective adjustments. It's a combination of a push from September to December and a combination of some movement from the second half of this year to the first half of next year. But I mean, everything embedded in your question, Harlan, I think we would endorse. I mean, there is a fundamental commentary of health measured by profitability and growth of the semiconductor industry as it has completely redefined it's kind of purpose and value proposition in this broader kind of data economy and ecosystem. And the long-term drivers are quite compelling. So individual companies make individual corrections. That will always be the case, and you've seen some come together in ways you haven't seen that in the past so it's a good thing, pretty short-term. We expect September to be our low point. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Harlan. Operator : And our next question comes from Krish Shankar with Cowen. Krish Sankar - Cowen and Company LLC : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one was on \u2013 thanks for the clarity on the December guidance or I should say September being the downtick. Is there a way to quantify what is driving the recovery in December? Is it DRAM, NAND or is it both of them? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, I mean, the interesting thing about the world we live in now, the value proposition that's available in the world of technology requires connectivity, it requires cloud memory and storage, and it requires computes. So there's always going to be some kind of ebbs and flows between one segment and another. But the value proposition requires investments in all. And I think that's the fundamental headline that people should internalize. And what we've tried to do is supplement that headline with the commentary on the importance of memory in that ecosystem and the role that memory plays as an embedded component of systems and even eventually in the world of computes. And I gave some statistics today that I'm not sure fully internalized but the CAGR of memory investment compared to the CAGR of logic and foundry investment has no comparison almost in the last five to seven years. And that's the strength of our company in many respects. So that's why we speak to unmatched opportunity because we think it's a very balanced investment and the strength of our company from a product portfolio point of view and a segments exposure creates something that's unmatched. Krish Sankar - Cowen and Company LLC : Got you, got you. That's very helpful and if I could just have a follow-up for Doug. On the September quarter, is there a way you can give some color on the segment mix between DRAM, NAND, and foundry? And also historically, your services has been roughly, say, 25% of revenues. How much do you think it's going to be as a percentage of total revenues in the September quarter? Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yes. Krish, I'm not going to give you the exact percentage except to say that when business ticks down a little bit, the installed base really doesn't. And so it's probably going to be a little bit higher in the September quarter but I'm not going to quantify it for you. And then relative to the -- what's going on in September by segment, we don't typically get into the detail. We do that backward-looking but not necessarily forward-looking. But what you heard both Martin and I say is relative softness in memory, so you could assume there's probably some stuff going on there. Krish Sankar - Cowen and Company LLC : Okay. Thanks, Doug. Thanks, Martin. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Krish. Operator : And next, from Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Toshiya Hari. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Martin, you talked about 2018 WFE being up in kind of the single-digit range. As a housekeeping question, what are your updated expectations for DRAM, NAND, logic and foundry, respectively? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: As a housekeeping response, we didn't disclose that before and I'm not going to kind of increment the disclosure today. Obviously, I think common knowledge at this point, the memory bias is first half, and the logic foundry is much closer to flattish, right? So you've got that as a kind of broad reference on WFE and that's where I would sit responding to the question, specifically. Maybe I could kind of provide some quality to statements as well that are helpful in response to the question. The adjustments we've seen from customers in DRAM, I would say, have avoided overinvestments. That's a nice, simple way to kind of characterize it and we still believe from the analytics that we can form, it's still a tight marketplace. In NAND flash, the pace of the adjustments that we have seen have been moderating. They've been slowing, hence, the commentary that we're giving today around September and then expansion of the company again in December. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And then as a follow-up, just wanted again an update on what you're seeing in China. Obviously, the political landscape is unstable, to say the least. Don't know if that really impacts what your customers do in China but I'm just curious, your outlook on CapEx in China both for the back half of this year and more importantly, longer term, if that's changed at all. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I don't have the crystal ball, obviously, to kind of opine on the political dynamic and how various elements of this conversation play out. But our assumption today around the execution of our plans is the same as it always has been. We see legitimacy in the ambition and we see investments in capacity in China that are synchronized to the demand for units out of fabs and I would make that statement on a global basis and I would make it in regards to China as well. Obviously, tariff-based conversations can and do impact the operations of companies like Lam and so left unattended, tariffs create incremental cost structures for us and we make the impact immaterial by modifying kind of our supply chain. We have to take actions to mitigate that risk and there's no material exposure embedded in our forecast for tariffs. Relative to long-term China, if the environment of export control it is what it is today, the plans of customers will execute. If it changes, then we have to kind of revisit the assumptions at that point in time. We don't see evidence today of planned changes, so nothing to report. But I would say we're attentive to the very same things that you are and we can control only so much of this conversation. So \u2013 and we'll be on the same boat as everybody else if and when things change, I guess. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for the color. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question will come from John Pitzer at Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Martin, if you kind of look at your growth over the last several years, there's been multiple components to it, but market share gain has been a meaningful driver of your growth profile. I'm just kind of curious as you look towards the 9x layer NAND and then 1y, 1x, 1z in DRAM, how are you thinking about your share potential from here? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: It is kind of a shorter term message and a long-term message. The shorter one is we are in for a busy second half because the decisions of the second half, have a \u2013 I think a three times greater in the impact than the ones at the first half. So, the second half is a busy period for the company. The objective of the company, I hope, is well understood. We are investing to increase our relevance to the success of the customers and gain market share in etch and deposition, in memory, and in logic foundry. And we've put together multiple years' worth of momentum that we intend to build upon. We don't win everything, we don't defend everything, but we've demonstrated over a multiple years that we win more than we don't and that's the objective kind of going forward. The best reference still is the long-term models that we gave, that's the call out market share references. And the last thing I would say is when you think about the holistic growth opportunities of Lam, let's remember market share is $1 billion component of a $3 billion reference. So we're seeking $1 billion of SAM expansion, we're seeking $1 billion of growth from market share and we're seeking $1 billion of growth in the space of the installed base business of the company. So it's kind of one element of three and all are very important and all are being invested in. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's helpful, Martin. And then as you think about kind of the recovery into the December quarter, obviously, if your memory customers are more profitable of recovery becomes easier and so there is clearly a price element embedded in the recovery. But I'm just kind of curious to what extent could it be somewhat ASP independent on the memory side? It's just the timing of when these technology transitions your customers are working on begin to inflect again. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yes. I mean, I think the profitability levels and the revenue levels, it eliminates the limitations on investments, but I don't think profitability levels on their own drive investment. I think demand for chips and elasticity of demand from pricing and attachment rates drive demand for investment. So I think profits have taken off the table the limitations, but certain points in our history have limited investment so there's much more flexibility for our customers today than ever before. But I think our customers hold themselves accountable to investing capacity when they have chips to sell. And that's a great commentary on health of an industry. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Helpful. Thank you, guys. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, John. Operator : And next, we have Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. Martin, historically, when we have seen a weakness over your memory customers, they have all happened at the same time or maybe one after another. What's different this time? I mean, you talked about not all customers are changing their plans and why should we believe others won't follow the leaders? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, I've tried to articulate again not just in memory, but broadly in the industry, how I think the industry is different today than it was through kind of 10 years ago. And one of the differences is that I see very significant customers in leadership positions with very clear segment and market focus that has some differences with very clear strategies and very clear opportunities and risks and limitations on strategies. And our customers, and I'll use 3D NAND as a great example, there was a -- I think a four-year separation between the first adopter on 3D NAND technology to the last of the four. And that's illustrative of how their strategies are quite unique. And that's not a good or bad. It's just a statement of uniqueness optimized in their minds to the opportunities in the marketplace to be successful growing a business. So I think customers -- they are all attempting to pursue the right ambition, which is profitable market share, not just market share, and we have the same aspiration. But there is, for sure, a uniqueness of a device targeting in the marketplace, market segmentation. There's also uniqueness of clean room capacity, there is also uniqueness of investment coming online from a timing point of view. And there's uniqueness in terms of the installed base roadmaps of these companies. And so, all of that means, I believe, that the power of the customer is greater than the power of the segment when it comes to analyzing the direction of the industry. Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And Doug, fairly aggressive share repurchase here, 60% through. Is there any consideration of annuity purchase program? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: At the end of the quarter, we were still only 60% on the way through. We need to get a little closer to the end before we'd start thinking about what's next after. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: But the framework, again, is pretty simple for answering that question, right? I mean, the priority is investing the profitable growth of the company and when we have cash that is excess to that need, return it to our shareholders. And we've operated with that philosophy for probably at least a decade, maybe more. And it's the guidance under any conditions going forward. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. We're obviously going to continue the program. We talked about that. I'll remind you the Analyst Day commentary about 50% of cash, but still how we're thinking about the framework. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Atif. Operator : Then our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. If you go back to June quarter, when did you start seeing the weakness in orders or shipments? I guess it's more orders than shipments, and so shipment for the June quarter was above expectation. I'm just trying to reconcile the timing because your other competitors in the equipment space seems to be seeing that a little earlier than you did. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: I think you got two problems with the question and the answer I could give you. The first problem is none of us have any idea of the assumptions and the original disclosure of the companies that you're talking about, and so any reference is kind of hard to interpret. I'm not going to get into specifics on dates, but the changes are fairly recent. Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Maybe a follow-up question is that related to ASC 606, I know you talked about the product side. But is there any impact on your service revenue as well? There are some multi-year service contracts and others like that? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: No. To a much lesser extent, service looks very similar; old rules, new rules. Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Sidney. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered, so just one question for you, Doug. In terms of the installed base business that continues to grow for you guys, you've always talked about how it's very accretive to your operating margins. As that business grows, how do you balance the investments needed to continue to grow that business and I guess streamline those operations to have it continue to drop the bottom line? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I don't think I've ever said, Patrick. It's really accretive. It's maybe a little bit up the operating income line but it's not wildly different. And some of the things we're doing to try to drive growth in that business are the advanced services you hear us talk about, setting objectives around growing faster than the installed base, driving new programs to help solve some of the problems customers have inside of the fab in unique ways that we know how to do given our familiarity with our own equipment. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. And from an investment point of view, I mean, I wouldn't characterize that we run the installed base part of the company any differently than we do the systems piece. I mean, we do our best to anticipate and identify opportunities and risks. We do our best to invest timely and proactively to be successful, and we do our best to make sure that when there are changes in business levels, the cost structure of the company in the short-term is appropriately responsive without kind of compromising that long-term view. And so it's the same gig for every business unit and every element of the portfolio of the company. Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Patrick. Operator : And our next question is from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Yes, good afternoon. To getting back to the memory side of the business, curious if there was any difference in your view of the bit growth for either the NAND or the DRAM market. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Not really. And no difference, frankly, from the view that's opined by most of the market participants. I mean, we've got an assumption of the low 20s for bit supply in DRAM and we've got an assumption of the low 40s for NAND. So I think that's kind of genuinely consistent with what folks are talking about. From a transition point of view, maybe a little bit more to help you out. I mean, our assumption is that the kind of 1x, 1y investment levels in DRAM will represent somewhere around the 50% level, plus or minus kind of 5 points or 10 points by the end of the calendar year. And we're assuming by the end of the calendar year that the 3D capable parts of the NAND installed base is a little over the 1 million wafer stat per month level. And obviously, it exists in various forms. So 3D isn't all Generation 4 or Generation 5. It's the full portfolio but we're well on the way to making that the primary output technology of non-volatile memory. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, great. And then Doug, when you look at the margin in your guidance still remains fairly healthy, are there any one-time or mix benefits in the quarter or are those expected margins based on the revenue? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Nothing I'd specifically point to, Tom. And business goes up, it goes down a little bit. We do have fixed costs so that's probably a piece of what's going on. But there's also a product mix, a customer mix component. There's always a lot of things that move around quarter by quarter. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: And the best profitability metric for the company forward-looking is the long-term model again. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yes. That's right. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Operator : And next, from RBC Capital Markets, we'll hear from Mitch Steves. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one in terms of kind of a modeling question if I look out for fiscal year 2019 essentially. Just your margins have improved both on the gross margin and operating margin front of the last several years. Is there any reason that shouldn't continue or how do we think about by and large the operating margin profile for the next year or so? Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yes. Mitch, what I'd point you to is we put out in March an update to the long-term model, kind of looking at that, looking at revenue levels, looking at where we've been in recent history and correlating the two data points, I think, is the best guidance I can give you to answer the question. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Mitch. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I actually have a question around foundry. If I look at the numbers, it's been down quite a bit in fiscal 2018 versus 2017. I think we have heard it from other people so I'm not surprised that it's down. But just curious in the context of the September guidance, it's down mostly or not all in memory. Do you actually expect your foundry revenue to continue to grow sequentially? Or how do you think about that in 3Q or in the calendar second half of the year? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Well, I mean, from a marketplace point of view as I mentioned a few moments ago, there's much more stability at WFE and foundry logic combined first half and second half than is true in memory. And the specific purchasing decision timings for etch and deposition are, I think, kind of well understood at this point in time. They're a little later in the flow because of shorter lead times perhaps than the lithography investments at this point in time. And we have objectives to gain share obviously from 10 to 7 and in turn to 5. And this year is largely a year of 7 nanometer build-outs and 5 pilots with, as you I think well understand, a pretty broad set of participation at the 28 nanometer level. And we don't have any new headlines today on the EUV. It's exactly the same as it was when we spoke in our Analyst Meeting. So it's a nice opportunity for the company, it continues to be a big focus and yeah, that's, I guess, the best I can share. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Actually, that's very helpful. And then Doug, just on the guidance. If I \u2013 my background math tells me your OpEx is down around 10% on the September quarter. Is that all just from call it the leverage or the model or is there any call it programs that you might be delaying that may come back in December? We just wanted to understand how we think about that. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: What I'd tell you relative to R&D programs is nothing is delayed. Everything is going forward at the same pace that it always has been. We're not \u2013 if there's a near-term move around in the business, we're not messing around with any of that. I think I talked maybe a year or so ago about you are going to see more variability quarter-to-quarter in our spend modulated by profit levels. Our variable compensation varies with the level of profit of the business. And so as profitably varies, spending varies along with it. And as we look at a softening in business for the quarter, we're very aggressively managing discretionary-type spending, things like travel and entertainment and whatnot just to be responsive to the level of the business. So it's a combination of all of those things. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: But I appreciate you asking the question and recognizing the efforts of the company that respond to balancing short-term and long-term because it's really hard to do. It takes a lot of time and effort to create the guidance that you've just spoken to. So thank you for recognizing it. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: No, thanks for answering my question. That's all I have. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. Operator : And next, we'll take a question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Weston David Twigg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to take a stab at -- C.J. at the beginning had asked your views on 2019 demand. And I don't need a number, but I'm just wondering at this point, do you think you could be -- see a similar level of overall with WFE next year? Or up or down, do you have a directional indication based on your conversations with customers? Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I think there's a number of kind of industry participant statements in the marketplace today of equivalency are slightly up. I've seen being kind of the $100 billion references over a couple of years. And I don't have a basis to kind of disagree with those. To more specifically speak to something of substance from Lam, I would say as well as having the expectation that December is higher than September, our expectation is that the first half of next year is a stronger half than the second half of this year. And the order of magnitude, we'll speak to over time. But we feel really good about the health of the industry as I've tried to speak to. We feel kind of really good about the value propositions that our customers are seeking, the discipline throughout the ecosystem, and the opportunity for the company. And so while at some level it all feels like a pretty kind of negative moment in the history of our industry when we get these episodes, it's really good because it's a commentary on timeliness of response and discipline and health. And what should not get lost in this conversation is the fact that if you didn't believe us and you just thought that December EPS would be the same as the September EPS, we have growth in non-GAAP earnings of like 20% year-over-year. And in most of the companies I've ever had an experience of working with, that's not such a bad number, right? So and adjustments exists in the context of some pretty nice growth for the industry and for the company and obviously, for our customers, that's even more true. So we feel pretty good. Weston David Twigg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I think I heard you definitely say weakness in memory in Q3 or in September. But, Martin, I think I heard you say it was more of a DRAM shift. And then I thought I heard Doug say there was more trimming in NAND. And I was just wondering if you could clarify what's the bigger driver of the downtick in September and that helps us understand the rebound a little bit better, I think. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Yeah. So I was kind of conscious of that potential risk as well as I listened to it. So what Doug was speaking to was kind of like the absolute kind of dollars comparison between the output of the company in the June quarter as compared to September and he's right to say the biggest change there is NAND. What I was speaking to was the prominence of the adjustments in the last kind of month or so. And DRAM was the biggest adjustments in the next month or so, so that's how you reconcile the two statements. Weston David Twigg - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Helpful. Thank you. Martin Brian Anstice - Lam Research Corp.: Thank you much. Douglas R. Bettinger - Lam Research Corp.: Thanks, Wes. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers for closing comments. Odette Marie Go - Lam Research Corp.: That concludes our call. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining, and have a good afternoon. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Miss. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead. Tina Correia : Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Martin Anstice, Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will share our outlook on the business environment and review our financial results for the September 2018 quarter and our outlook for the December 2018 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1\u2019o clock p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. It can be also found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3\u2019o clock p.m. Pacific Time. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, let me hand the call over to Martin. Martin Anstice : Thank you, Tina, and thank you all for joining us today. Lam delivered results stronger than targeted for the September quarter with revenues gross margin and EPS all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. In addition consistent with the commentary made during our last earnings call, we are forecasting the December quarter up sequentially and we would still characterize based on engagements with our customers in our markets and outlook for the first half of 2019 that is somewhat stronger than the second half of 2018. In aggregate there has been more semiconductor capital investment volatility both upside and downside in 2017 and 2018 than in the recent prior years and that is only extenuated by broader macro headlines such as trade, tariffs and interest rates. Despite this context, we remain very excited by the long-term drivers for data economy enablement from the world of silicon and the complements of our products and services portfolio to the technology roadmap of the industry. In our opinion, next generation device and systems architectures, the expansion of the materials in chip design and manufacturing creates compelling opportunities for our strength in etch and deposition. We remain committed to invest and innovate for the success of our customers and our company. As always the performance of Lam is defined by customer trust and employee commitments to our vision and values. We sincerely appreciate that partnership the opportunity created and the numerous contributions made. Since our July update, current year WFE expectations continue to track up slightly year-over-year although to a modestly reduced extent. At a segment level 2018, WFE looks a little stronger in logic, a little weaker in NAND and foundry to the assumptions we made three months back. With customer and Lam performance consistent with our December quarter revenue guidance provided today, calendar 2018 would represents a healthy revenue growth year of 14% for the company with profit performance marginally stronger versus the calendar year 2017 benchmark. In deposition, we continue to see evidence of Lam\u2019s growing strategic relevance to the success of our customers with key penetrations of new films for patterning, new specialty applications for 3D NAND and deeper partnership models emerging for 3D NAND applications. In etch perhaps our most critical area of focus in 3D NAND is the continued enablement of customers increasingly challenging technology roadmaps where we continue to strengthen our leading capabilities in high aspect ratio applications. Our solutions are invested in customers\u2019 vision for continued 3D NAND scaling targeted to accelerate demand elasticity in their markets for the next several years. Combined etch and deposition market share penetration and defense activity is a net positive so far for Lam in calendar 2018. Fundamental to the quality and sustainability of Lam earnings is the performance delivered by our Customer Support Business Group. Our installed base business has grown year-to-date at a pace more than two times faster than our installed base unit growth during the same period. Our worldwide process chamber counts now exceed 55,000 units compared to 36,000 units at the end of 2014 and this is the foundation for ongoing spares, service and upgrade revenues. We are increasingly focused on value creation for our customers through investments made in equipment intelligence products. We are providing performance enhancement in areas such as tool analytics, preventive maintenance and chamber matching to enhance productivity for our customers and create opportunity for Lam. In addition driven by our customers aspirations of better asset utilization in addressing the non-leading edge and also the emergence of new IoT and MEMS silicon opportunities, our reliance business recorded calendar year-to-date growth of more than 35% versus the same period in 2017, a good illustration we believe of Lam\u2019s ability to be flexible in addressing the full scope of our market opportunities. In closing, the September quarter and our outlook on December are largely as we shared with you last earnings call and should deliver more than $3 billion in cash from operations this year. We remain focused on investing in our profitable growth objectives at the same time delivering value through a balanced cash redistribution to shareholders. In this regard incorporating December 2018 quarter guidance provided today, year-over-year operating expenses increased by 9% with 75% of that growth focused on R&D and our fully diluted quarterly share count reduces by approximately 10% end of year 2018 versus end of year 2017. We anticipate a healthy long-term opportunity for our customers and our company both with continued attention placed on strategies intended to deliver targeted returns on the investments that each market participant makes. With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Great, thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Lam executed well in the September quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all of our financial metrics. Operating margin and earnings per share were at the high end of the guidance range provided demonstrating what I think is discipline in our spending during a decline in industry capital equipment investments. We\u2019re pleased with our execution and ability to respond to the challenging business environment. As a reminder to everybody, we adopted ASC 606 in the September quarter, which is the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year. Under 606 we generally record revenue at the time of shipment rather than at the time of customer acceptance. With this new standard, we are no longer providing shipment numbers. Our market segment disclosures will be based on the composition of our revenue numbers for the quarter and we\u2019ll do that now as well as into the future. So let me get into that. Memory revenue continued to be strong with the combined memory segment making up 77% of total system revenue. Our overall non-volatile memory revenue remained strong representing approximately 51% of the system revenue and that\u2019s despite the anticipated reduction of spending in nearly every one of our NAND customers. DRAM represented 26% of system revenue. DRAM spending in the quarter continued to be focused on conversions to both the 1x and 1y nanometer node. The foundry segment was stronger in the quarter accounting for 17% of system revenue. And finally, the logic and other segment contributed 6% of system revenue, pretty much consistent throughout calendar 2018. We continue to see strength in the China region with 25% of our revenue being generated there. The strength in China came from both foundry as well as memory. Nearly two thirds of the revenue in September came from domestic Chinese customers. We delivered revenues of $2,331 million in the September quarter, a decrease of 25% from June and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.4%. And as we\u2019ve shared before, our actual gross are a function of several factors, such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were down to $451 million, which was a decrease of $57 million from the June quarter. R&D comprised nearly two thirds of our total spending consistent with the composition of the June quarter operating expenses. We continue to maintain a higher concentration of spending in R&D as we believe that discipline R&D investments are critical to achieving our future revenue growth. One thing I\u2019d like to mention to help you with your future P&L modeling. When we get to the March quarter of next year, we will have an extra work week in our fiscal quarter. This occurs approximately every six years due to our fiscal calendar cutoff. March spending will be higher as a result of the extra work week. So, keep that in mind as you put your March models together please. Operating income in the September quarter came in at $630 million. Operating margin came in at the top of the guidance range of 27% primarily due to stronger gross margin performance as well as flexibility in our spending in a quarter of lower business volumes. The non-GAAP tax rate for the September quarter was 11.9% in line with the guidance provided last quarter. In the longer run, tax rate in the low- to middle-teens is a right level to include in your models. And I will point out that you will see fluctuations around this quarter-to-quarter. Based on share count, we\u2019re approximately 165 million shares. Earnings per share for the September quarter were $3.36, again at the high end of a guided range. The primary driver of the upside versus our guidance was stronger profitability. The share count includes dilution from the 2041 convertible notes and the 2018 warrants that are still outstanding. The total dilutive impact for each \u2013 for both of these, excuse me, was approximately eight million shares. And I\u2019ll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. In the September quarter, we had about $80 million in early conversions of the 2041 notes. Remaining balance of the 2041 notes is $248 million. We continue to execute on our capital return program. In the September quarter, we committed approximately $1.7 billion towards share repurchases deploying all of our current Board authorization from a dollar perspective. Our repurchases were executed largely through accelerated share repurchase programs that will cover repurchases until the March quarter of 2019. For dividends following the declaration of $1.10 per share the last quarter, we paid out $174 million in dividends to our shareholders. Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, decreased in the quarter to $3.9 billion and that compares with $5.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, the change largely due to our capital return activities. We continue to make progress bringing our cash on shore. Cash from operations for the September quarter remained strong at $720 million, which was roughly flat with the $718 million we generated in the June quarter. DSO increased by nine days to 72 days, which is related to the linearity of revenue during the quarter. Inventory was roughly flat in dollar terms, while inventory turns declined to 2.7 times. This compares to 3.5 times in the prior quarter. We do expect to see turns improve in the December quarter. Company noncash expenses included approximately $50 million for equity comp, $36 million for amortization and $44 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures were $56 million, which was down from $80 million in the June quarter. For the calendar year, we expect CapEx in 2018 will be flat to slightly higher, compared to 2017 levels. CapEx this year is going towards investment in manufacturing expansion for our installed base business, as well as strategic R&D investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 11,000 regular full time employees, which was relatively consistent with the June quarter. So now looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2.5 billion plus or minus $150 million. We\u2019re expecting a modest uptick in customer spending across multiple segments, gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point, operating margins of 27.5% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.65 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 163 million shares. Consistent with our prior comments we forecast that September quarter marks a near-term trough for our business. While near-term forecasts are subject to change we remain optimistic on our longer term growth prospects that we highlighted during our investor event back in March. We continue to prioritize disciplined investments that drive competitively differentiated products, as well as Lam\u2019s out performance opportunity into the future. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from C. J. Muse with Evercore. C. J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first question is, as you think about your first half, outlook for calendar 2019 definitely coming in stronger, I think, than many of us thought. Can you walk through, I guess, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of tools versus service? And then if there\u2019s anything that we should be thinking about that is perhaps maybe Lam specific or timing of say image sensors coming in, we would love to kind of hear your thoughts on that front. Martin Anstice : Yes needless to say we\u2019re much more qualified to speak to our business than we are kind of like the overall kind of WFE headlines. So, when we think about kind of calendar 2019, obviously there has been some continuous, I would say, muting of investment expectations primarily in NAND flash since our last earnings call. We\u2019re looking at 14 new projects next year, fab projects next year. And I would expect honestly in the second half 2018 to first half 2019 comparison, that our revenue levels will be incrementally higher in DRAM logic other including image sensors to your points and also foundry. I would expect NAND to be down half, over half, second half 2018, compared to first half 2019. Relative to the proportion of our kind of revenue headlines that is the spares and services, the installed base business, obviously it\u2019s a very important part of the economics of the company. And we\u2019ve given some color today on the pace of growth of that business by referencing the installed base and the annuity that comes with it and it\u2019s an important part of the value proposition here. But I would say our headlines for first half WFE are through the systems\u2019 headlines for the markets and the customers that we have. So hopefully that helps C. J. C. J. Muse: Very helpful. And if I could ask a follow-up, you\u2019ve always done a great job of managing OpEx. And given, I guess, the increased volatility Doug, how are you thinking about incremental margins from here? I think targeted model is roughly 40%. Is that still the right kind of model up or down depending on the revenue run rate? Doug Bettinger : Well C. J. I think you rewrote our model. Our model is 32% to 33% in the longer term. Martin Anstice : Yes you see you\u2019re too used to C. J. these memory companies with 40% to 50% operating income, that it tainted you. C. J. Muse: Yeah. Doug Bettinger : But, C. J. to more directly ask you question, at these revenue levels kind of high 20s, you just saw us print 27 and guide 27.5, and as things recover and get stronger, you\u2019ll see us kind of inch our way towards that low 30s level. That\u2019s the right way to be thinking about things. There will be variability in spending. And one of the things I\u2019ve purposefully pointed out is the March quarter is a 14-week quarter, so there\u2019s an extra work week in there. And I\u2019ll remind you that in the first half of the year you get certain spending coming back in like payroll taxes and things like that. So don\u2019t forget those things as you\u2019re modeling the next couple of quarters. But hopefully that answered your question. C. J. Muse: Very helpful, thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks C. J. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the solid results. I guess Doug my first question really kind of an accounting question around 606 and deferred revenue, there was a big draw down in the September quarter, sequentially in deferred revenue. How does that line sort of transition over time? Under 606 will that eventually get a zero? How quickly will you get there? And is there going to be uptick in December sort of revenue guidance, a function of just deferred revenue coming down off the balance sheet? Doug Bettinger : Yes so briefly I\u2019ll go through it John and you can ask me more if you to understand a little more. I mean basically what happened is we crossed into the new fiscal year is there was a bucket of deferred revenue that just fell straight to retained earnings. So that just fell off and is largely why our deferred revenue went down so much quarter-on-quarter. You\u2019ll continue to see deferred revenue though, John, for first of a kind tools, and certain BPA accrual type things that isn\u2019t completely delivered yet, it\u2019ll bounce around a little bit. And generally the way I think about the difference between 605 and 606 is, it\u2019s all just timing. We\u2019re still shipping tools, we\u2019re still collecting cash, all of that is happening in the same timeframe that otherwise would have. In some quarters 606 revenue recognition will be higher than 605, in some quarters I would expect it\u2019ll flip and go the other way. But at the end of the day this is all just timing and what really matters in my mind is when cash is coming into the company and as I think you saw, we had a really strong cash collection quarter at $720 million. Does that help John? John Pitzer : That\u2019s helpful, it does. And then maybe for my follow-up to Martin, Martin, I think, one of the investor concerns out there is, as the industry transitioned from planer to 3D NAND and the rush to get there by your customers just created kind of a once in a lifetime type kind of bulge in NAND CapEx that\u2019s not repeatable. I\u2019m kind of curious as we go through this soft period in NAND, has your view of capital intensity, your SAM or the rate at which your customers are making these transitions changed. And are you still have the mindset that 32 to 64 was probably the most efficient transmission for the industry and as we go from here things get more difficult. Any color there would be helpful. Martin Anstice : Yes. I mean lot of questions here. So at a fundamental level no real change in our long-term outlook and that\u2019s a commentary on capital intensity needed for the industry. And we floated at $70 billion reference at the Flash Summit conference a year back, I think maybe repeated again this year actually, so two years in a row same message. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever really offered an opinion about efficiency of one node or another, but I would certainly align to the fact that\u2019s the challenges gets more complex over time as aspect ratios increase, which is a big part of the opportunity for us. That\u2019s where we\u2019re strong and differentiated. So I think that trends well. And we don\u2019t see the opportunity for 3D NAND as a once in a lifetime gig or a one time event, right? Clearly there were some transitional investments associated with playing a capacity to 3D, there are also investments associated with one generation 3D to next and we did a pine in earlier disclosure that over the next five years I think we expect about 1 million wafer starts per month of incremental capacity to get brought to the system associated with the long-term outlook for nonvolatile memory in this world of data. So from an industry point of view more or less the same. And I guess the one thing I didn\u2019t say is independent of what your view is, good or bad, you should recognize that the segments of action deposition are entirely central and fundamental to that transition. And so, if everybody does well or everybody has opportunity, we should have more and if nobody does so well we should outperform. So that\u2019s an important headline as well. John Pitzer : Helpful. Thanks guys. Martin Anstice : Yes. Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Krish Shankar with Cowen and Company. Krish Shankar : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Few of them, first one, Martin, if you look at this downturn clearly or this downdraft clearly led by memory. Looks like the CapEx for the WFE cuts have been in retaliation to pricing declines. So from your vantage point, do you think pricing is a key metric to look for to see when it trough and if so, do you think WFE trials for memory along with pricing? And do you have any view on when it\u2019ll happen? And I have a follow-up? Martin Anstice : Well, I mean, I think that\u2019s a very important question and quite a complicated one. Clearly there\u2019s a relationship of pricing to investment levels. And I would say that in two ways. The first one is, ASPs should reflect supply and demand balance of capacity. So to the extent the prices are going up or going down, there\u2019s an implied message around the need to add capacity or the needs to kind of reign in capacity. So, that\u2019s been the world we\u2019ve lived in for many, many, many years. What\u2019s a little different today is that pricing is not actually a great leading indicator right now of the customer\u2019s ability to afford to make investments. So back to my rather amusing response to Tim\u2019s earlier question, when the memory companies are making 40% to 50% profits when DRAM is $100 billion business, when flash has grown in the way that it has the sustainability of investments is clearly enabled in ways that wasn\u2019t true three or five years ago. Now having said all of that, I think our customer spends money adding capacity when they have demand from their customers to ship devices. So I don\u2019t think people get carried away at any level these days. So it\u2019s a bit more complicated than it used to be. Pricing is relevant to help you understand supply and demand, but it\u2019s not so relevant in assessing sustainability and the customer\u2019s ability to make capacity or technology related investments. So good luck with your modeling, I guess. Krish Shankar : Got it, got it. That\u2019s really helpful, Martin. And then just a follow-up, clearly, everyone understand the long-term upside potential for Lam and the industry and WFE bond. I\u2019m just trying to frame the downside. If you look at the first shoot of drop with NAND followed by DRAM, do you worry that things will get worse before they get better? Or do you think they\u2019re kind of a dropping at these levels? Martin Anstice : Well, we are \u2013 if anything, we\u2019re super consistent, right? So my approach has always been to describe what I see and we\u2019ve done that. And we\u2019ll always do that. Good or bad, we\u2019ll tell how we see it. And so, we\u2019ve offered perspective that says December is stronger than September and we expect the first half of next year to be stronger than the second half of this year. And of course we might be wrong. And you have to kind of judge the confidence level of our disclosure and kind of move forward, I guess. So best I can offer you. Krish Shankar : Got it. Thanks Martin. Thanks for the insight. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Krish. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks so much. I had two, I guess the first question Martin is, if I just hold your wafer fab equipment share and now I\u2019m putting everything in there. But if I just calculate your WFE share for this year and for the last year, it\u2019s up a little bit this year. So if I just hold that into the first half of next year, you\u2019re still annualizing if I give you say, $5 billion worth of revenue in the calendar first half, which was just up a little bit half on half, that would imply that we\u2019re still analyzing to like high 40\u2019s to close to $50 billion WFE. So, I guess the question is, who really knows about the calendar second half? But would you sort of endorse a number close to $50 billion for 2019 WFE? Martin Anstice : Technically it\u2019s too early for us to answer that question. It\u2019s pretty customary that we have a response to that in the January earnings call. But fair question, I don\u2019t have the crystal ball, so I can\u2019t answer it with the same level of confidence, so I can answer the near-term questions. But a very interview question might be how do I feel today about the $100 billion two year reference that\u2019s been floated around for the last kind of few months. It\u2019s not a bad reference. We\u2019re trending a tweak below that right now to our analytics. But we\u2019ve trended a little above it at times and a little below and I can\u2019t really tell you what the variability is around it. But that would probably be the best I could give you at this point in time. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome. Thank you. And then Doug, it was a pretty big repo this quarter and I understand that it\u2019s going to sort of play out through the end of March. But I\u2019m curious if you can help us on share count for December and March as this kind of flows through. And then also how you think about when you\u2019re going to kind of re-up for the repo, how you kind of think about that? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I mean, Tim it\u2019s always an ongoing conversation at a board level. We described when we first launched this current authorization at 12 to 18 month timeframe, maybe we\u2019ve gotten through it a little sooner. I did purposefully point out that those ASRs are going to execute kind over a six month timeframe or not out of the market even though all the cash got deployed. When I have something to update you on, I\u2019ll update you relative to what we\u2019re going to do in the future. Obviously it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be talking about, but I don\u2019t have anything to tell you today. Timothy Arcuri : But just on the share count though, how it actually plays out, how it actually plays through for December and March. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I just guided you that December number of 163 million. I didn\u2019t give you anything for March and we only guide one quarter at a time, Tim, so. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. Awesome, Doug. Thanks so much. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We were at the Flash Memory Summit when the Lam team had its investor event and we also had the opportunity to hear from some of the existing NAND leaders in the market as well as some potential entrants from China who seemed to be making some progress and talked about increasing their manufacturing footprint next year. We\u2019ve also heard the same thing from some of the China domestic DRAM suppliers, albeit at lower levels of production activity. Do you think that China domestic memory starts to become a bigger part of your memory WFE mix looking into next year? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Martin Anstice : Yes, probably does, Harlan, yes. Harlan Sur : Both NAND and DRAM, you think? Doug Bettinger : Yes, probably. As you observed from Flash Memory, the NAND guys in China were a little more visible, maybe a little more confident there. But I think they\u2019re both going to increment\u2026 Martin Anstice : But I don\u2019t think our fundamental view on China is any different today than it was for the last couple of years. I mean, it\u2019s clearly an ambitious, but in our opinion, quite rational strategic agenda. And as each quarter passes there\u2019s more substance to what they\u2019re doing and we don\u2019t have anything more to add than what I think they\u2019re speaking to in the public markets on their. And obviously independent of all of that the long-term market participants are also investing for next-generation device architectures and market share growth and so on and so forth. So, I mean, it\u2019s a global system and that\u2019s what we respond to. But I think it\u2019s likely that the investment level in China increases in absolutes and proportional terms next year per Doug\u2019s response. Harlan Sur : Great, thanks. I just had a quick follow-up. It\u2019s pretty amazing, the amount of supply side, disciplined and focused on profitability and free cash flow by your memory customers and clearly they want to maintain strong profitability levels by modulating supply. If I look at the last time there was a strong focus on sort of reign in supply that was kind of 2016. It took about two quarters of strong equipment spending declines before we did see a positive response in memory placing fundamentals and economics for your customers. Is that how the Lam team still thinks about it as well i.e. that supply discipline in the second half of this year potentially positively impacts supply dynamics and maybe stronger possibility in the first half of next year for your customers? Martin Anstice : Wow. I\u2019m not showing that, but I\u2019ll answer that. I mean I would say everything moves faster. So, I think our customers adjust faster and therefore that\u2019s probably true on the upside as much as it is on the downside. We\u2019re a big part of feeding variability along with other market participants for the economics of their business. And I think they take actions anticipating risks as much as ever and that\u2019s a lot more than would be true five or 10 years ago when action would get taken when there was a clear problem statement. So yes, there are supply and demand imbalances that are getting adjusted too. There\u2019s also proactive actions to manage the risk of that. So that\u2019s a good thing I think in the long-term. Harlan Sur : Yes. Martin Anstice : I mean it kind of gets to this \u2013 it gets to the message that the secular headlines for us feel like they\u2019re more important than stronger than the cyclical launch, but you have to make your own decision I guess. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Harlan. Harlan Sur : Thanks for the insights. Martin Anstice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Moore [Morgan Stanley]. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. Following up on that last question. I guess, I was surprised at how strong China was in the September quarter and I think you talked about two thirds of that being from domestics, that seems like a pretty big deviation. Is there anything we should be aware of there and how much of that is kind of memory versus you\u2019re sort of the foundry customers, who you\u2019ve seen more frequently? Doug Bettinger : Yes. I mean Joe, I\u2019ve pointed it out, because it was an uptick from the local guys and I want them to let you know that. I don\u2019t know you\u2019re going to see that every single quarter in fact, I know you won\u2019t. And interestingly, when I look at kind of who the customers are, and I won\u2019t name them by name that there was relative balance between foundry as well as memory. Martin Anstice : And logic actually\u2026 Doug Bettinger : Actually in logic, you\u2019re right, Martin. So, it was \u2013 it was a strong quarter for us in China and it was a balanced quarter. I mean, my take on this thing answer is, we tend to talk about collectively two or three \u2013 two or three core domestic participants in China. Reality is, there are kind of six or seven. Martin Anstice : Yes, there\u2019s more. Doug Bettinger : And some of them are active at 300, some of them are interactive at 200 millimeter, some of them are active at leading edge technologies and some less leading edge, but there\u2019s a fairly meaningful population that doesn\u2019t maybe get fully internalized. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you very much. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Romit Shah : Yes, thank you. I guess just, as outsiders that all the data points on memory equipment CapEx and fundamentals to seemingly seemed all bad during the quarter and yet you exhausted your entire buyback and you\u2019re reiterating your expectations for growth in December. So, is it fair Martin, just to sort of sum up this report by saying that maybe, your business is more diversified than we realized and you\u2019re confident in September being the bottom. And the question really is just sort of the shape of the recovery from here being either U or V-shaped? Martin Anstice : Well, I think we\u2019ve been talking to the subject of diversification now for, it\u2019s kind of three or four years. No question we\u2019re more diversified today than we were. I think we\u2019ve tried to reinforce that message even more than talking about share gains in foundry and share gains in logic by speaking to the SAM expansion headlines. And in the last kind of the year or so, we\u2019ve segwayed into the installed base business of the company, which is not only a great asset relative to creating an opportunity for competitive differentiation in the core systems products of the company, it\u2019s a source of revenue and profit growth at a rate that is faster than the pace of growing our installed base. I mean there\u2019s a massive difference between 55,000 process chambers and 36,000 process chambers relative to the annuity. So that\u2019s all kind of in the mix as well. So, the business is more or less as we had anticipated slightly muted to the expectations of three months ago. But not that much different, I mean, I actually think our calendar 18 WFE number is 98% or 99% exactly what it was three months ago. So, I mean, that\u2019s kind of basic headline there and we\u2019ve expressed an outlook for the first half of next year and we\u2019re not going to put numbers on it now. We\u2019ll kind of deal with that in January. So that will be the time when we or you become some obvious disclosure from the Lam. Romit Shah : Okay. thanks for that. And just on the buyback you\u2019ve exhausted it. So do we have to wait till the next conference call to hear about the size and scope of the next authorization? Doug Bettinger : Well, even though the cash like I said, Romit, the cash got all committed. We\u2019re still in the market through these structured products, so\u2026 Romit Shah : Okay. Doug Bettinger : And that was purposeful, right, taken a view of pricing, where things were at and wanting to get on with it. But the way this generally works is Martin and I all agree, here is what we think we should do. We\u2019ll go on and we\u2019ll have a conversation with the board and the board will have opinions. So, we\u2019ll modify it and when we have a decision, we will communicate it to you and we\u2019re not at that point yet. Romit Shah : Okay. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Romit. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Martin, maybe a question on your services business. If say, hypothetically WFE goes down 5% or 10% next year, what does that imply for your services business? Can you still keep it flat or even grow it? Just what is just the conceptual sensitivity to WFE? Martin Anstice : Well, in the calendar year, there\u2019s not so much sensitivity, because in general, when we ship a system to customer, it has a 12-month warranty, so it\u2019s kind of on our dime during that period. The single biggest influence over the size of the installed base businesses, the number of kind of units in the installed base for which we disclosed and then the utilization of fabs. So if you \u2013 if we show up in the worlds with the WFE reduction that you\u2019ve just characterized and there is no change in utilization of the installed base, then there\u2019s no consequence. If the utilization of the installed base goes up, you\u2019re likely to see accelerated growth and if the installed base utilization goes down, you see a contraction and spares of service business in the industry. So, our assumption is in the context of customers have done a really good job kind of managing this issue, utilizations will run pretty high and we have no reason to be anxious about a dip in our installed base revenues. In an independent world, as spoken to you for some time now, a little bit here today in prepared comments, we are perpetually building a portfolio of installed base productivity related products and service offerings and invested in contributing more to the success of our customers and creating opportunity for Lam. So, there\u2019s some things in our control and some things that are out of our control. Vivek Arya : Got it. And as a follow-up from what you see today, do you think memory CapEx overall is up or down next year and when do you typically get visibility around what the spending environment will be? Martin Anstice : Perfectly normal timing where it will give you more color on next year would be in next quarter\u2019s earnings call. It\u2019s just a little bit too early for us to give on the specificity you\u2019re asking for. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Yes. Thank you so much. Martin, you\u2019ve talked about logic revenue being up in the first half of 2019 relative to the second half of 2018. Is the big driver there basically your key customers CapEx budget going up or is it more due to your positioning improving from say 14 to 10 nanometer or is it both? Martin Anstice : It\u2019s both. Doug Bettinger : It\u2019s a little bit of both. Toshiya Hari : Okay. And then kind of related to that, if you were to \u2013 in terms of magnitude, you guided DRAM, logic and foundry all power for over half. If you had to rank order those three in terms of the magnitude increase from the second half to the first half, is that something that you guys can do? Martin Anstice : I haven\u2019t written down on a piece of paper in front of me and now decided like that \u2013 I\u2019d like to tell you. So, rank order without any numbers, I would say logic and it\u2019s kind of other logic, which includes, the image sensor opportunities and the legacy stuff, it\u2019s probably the fastest-growing. And DRAM is the slowest-growing and foundries probably in the middle. That would be kind of \u2013 and I\u2019m not speaking to kind of industry level here, I\u2019m just characterizing the revenue kind of outlook for Lam, and as I said, NAND\u2019s contractions, so that will be our rank order. Toshiya Hari : Okay. Martin Anstice : Yes. It\u2019s like pretty early to be having those conversations. So, take it for what it\u2019s worth at this point. Toshiya Hari : Sure. As a quick follow-up, I just had a question on market share. Martin, clearly, if you\u2019re growing your business 14% this year, you\u2019re gaining a bit of share. In your prepared remarks, you\u2019ve talked about some of your net wins, both in dep and etch. Is it fair to say in relation to your long-term model, where you\u2019ve attached $1 billion incremental revenue for market share gains? Are you tracking in line or ahead of that plan or how would you describe, where you stand today relative to the long-term plans? Martin Anstice : Was never linear as it\u2019s a tough question to answer. But a couple of data points. So, when we talk about kind of penetration defense activities this year, we\u2019re actually talking more about the economics that will play out a year from now or maybe even in 2020, right, because there\u2019s a leading a timeframe on DTOR decisions and PTOR decisions and you might remember that in the last earnings call, I think I made referenced to the fact that there were tons of decisions in relative terms in the second half of this year compared to the first half of this year. So, that\u2019s kind of a loss still ahead of us. So, fair game for you to ask the same question to me to try and answer it in January. So far, again, we don\u2019t \u2013 we never think though that we defend everything, but we have a net positive to forward-looking kind of economics from the penetrations and defenses in the first nine months of this year. So pretty, pretty pleased. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Toshiya. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Martin, first off, just I guess follow-up on some of your comments on named capital intensity, but looking at it from the DRAM front, as the industry continues to push the 1X, 1Y, eventually to 1Z, we\u2019re seeing a lot of new fab projects in DRAM. Do you believe these capital intensity trends are also impacting DRAM and this could provide a little bit of, I guess, sustainability on some of the equipment spending trends that we\u2019re seeing today? Martin Anstice : I think it\u2019s all about kind of the economics on the revenue of the customer honestly. I think what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years is, obviously, an emergence of significant discipline, managing supply and demand, and there has been an ASP consequence, but more than that, we\u2019ve seen a transition away from units to content and density in a broader set of demand drivers. And that has allowed our customers to kind of reset the value of the bits that they\u2019re selling to their customers. So, the average bit is worth kind of more by virtue of the value that\u2019s created in this kind of broader cognitive computing environments. And so if there continues to be discipline and if our customers continue to be successful getting paid for the enabled ones in their industry, the fact that from one generation to the next, the DRAM cost transitions are kind of less significant compared to the baseline of five to 10 years ago. It\u2019s much less relevance, right? I mean clearly when no transitions deliver less than they did in history, there\u2019s a lot of intensity by the customer and there\u2019s a lot of intensity by Lam and our peer companies. I\u2019m sure to try and continue to improve the productivity of the DRAM installed base, because we have a collective interest in that. But I think the bigger question to answer relative to DRAM capital intensity is the revenue side of it, not the cost side of it. But as I said three times today, in my \u2013 go ahead? Patrick Ho : As my follow-up question for Doug, in terms of the services and spare parts business, you mentioned that you have a little bit of the CapEx spend; the increase is incrementally going into that business segment. How much can you leverage, I guess your existing workforce in terms of growing that business on the labor side of things, or is that an area where you\u2019ll also have to increase OpEx to keep up with the fast pace of growth in that business? Doug Bettinger : Patrick, it\u2019s a different physical factor in a different location. So, there\u2019s not a lot of leverage from a labor standpoint and we have to invest in manufacturing, the parts for manufacturing. So, it\u2019s all goodness at the end of the day, it\u2019s supporting a higher installed base and we got to make investments for that. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one on kind of nano-secular technology. Is there any of your customers that have already started working on that or is that something that it\u2019s told to come next year? Martin Anstice : Unfortunately, our customers have to answer that question. Mitch Steves : Okay. Got it. And then secondly, on the DRAM side, do you guys see any, I guess \u2013 I guess, when would you guys think that the pricing would stabilize in DRAM in general, or do you guys have no view right now? Martin Anstice : Well, we have a view, but I think the view of our customers again, is worth a lot more than ours. I mean it\u2019s all about supply and demand, and our customers have taken action, I would argue proactively as much as reactively. And so everything moves pretty fast these days. So again, customer\u2019s disclosure is worth a lot more than ours on ASPs of devices. Mitch Steves : Got it. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Mitch. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc. Weston Twigg : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any change in customer behavior related to trade work insurance whether that\u2019s in terms of the conversations you\u2019re having with them or the visibility that they\u2019re providing or commitments regarding new fab capacity heading into 2019. Any color would be helpful? Martin Anstice : Yes. To the best of my knowledge, nothing\u2019s really changing directly related to that, although I\u2019ve kind of heard a few statements and read a few things quoted about customers\u2019 kind of referencing terrorists or the costs of terrorists when it comes to the pace at which they\u2019re making investments. In fact, I think I read one today out of Taiwan. So, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not irrelevant. I mean, to the extent that a company has more of costs, because of terrorists and we probably all do at some level. There is a consequence of that and there is a reprioritization of things in the company. So, not irrelevance, but hard for us to kind of directly correlates. I\u2019m just conscious that I\u2019m seeing statements and I\u2019m hearing some things. And so it\u2019s in the mix of the outlook that we\u2019ve described today. Weston Twigg : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up question is just on DRAM strength in the first half that you mentioned, is there a strength from \u2013 more from some of the pushouts you\u2019re seeing from this half, is it related to new capacity or is it more just ongoing conversion activity? Martin Anstice : It\u2019s mostly as originally planned. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a massive kind of statements. So, there are not so many industry participants in any segment these days. So, you probably got a sense of who is chasing who and who is investing where for what purpose. So, I think it was pretty much originally as consistent with plan. Weston Twigg : Okay. Thank you very much. Martin Anstice : Thanks, Weston. Tina Correia : Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Doug, going back to your commentary by the extra week in the march quarter, which is leading to higher expenses, should I also assume that your revenue would be positively impacted for an extra week? Doug Bettinger : Well, technically we have an extra week to shift product, Mehdi, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to meaningfully move the revenue number. I do know definitively, it will impact the expenses. we\u2019ll give you the hard guide when we did get the end of the quarter though. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. And then just \u2013 I just want to go back to your comment about the deferred revenue. And if I just do a simple math, I get to shipment down 35% on a sequential basis. Is that \u2013 does that make sense to you? Doug Bettinger : Mehdi, we\u2019re not getting shipment anymore. We\u2019re not talking about shipment anymore. Mehdi Hosseini : No. this is for the September quarter. This is for the September quarter. Doug Bettinger : Yes, yes. We\u2019re done talking about shipments publicly; revenue is all we\u2019re going to be describing now. You can do analytics on whatever you want to get shipments, but at the end of the day, given the change in the revenue recognition timing, revenue is what we\u2019re going to be talking about. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay, that\u2019s great. Just a follow-up on your services, given the increased installed system, are these service contracts long enough to actually have an impact on your backlog? Does that help you with better visibility? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Mehdi Hosseini : So, if that\u2019s the case and assuming that services is becoming a larger part of your revenue mix, why not offer a longer guide on the revenues rather than just referring to WFE? Doug Bettinger : We\u2019ll think about it, Mehdi. I mean at the end of the day, we tried to describe what we think is important for you to understand what\u2019s going on in the business. There\u2019s still just a large amount of the business in any one quarter that\u2019s turns based. And to me, backlog isn\u2019t that meaningful, for services, it\u2019s certainly as just Martin said. So, we\u2019ll give you some thought. Mehdi Hosseini : Because just the growth in installed system is very compelling, but it still hasn\u2019t made a difference to how you guide and I\u2019m just wondering what is the disconnect here? Martin Anstice : I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s actually true. I think for the last couple of quarters you have perspective some times quantitative and some times qualitative on the progression for a couple of quarters including today. So, it\u2019s pretty hard to do what we\u2019re doing and as many people characterize that we don\u2019t have the visibility to say what we currently say as those to do. So take it for what it\u2019s worth, we\u2019re doing the best we can. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Mehdi. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Operator : And speakers, as we have no more questions, I\u2019ll turn it back to you. Martin Anstice : Okay. With that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. Thank you, operator. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. you may now disconnect and have a great rest of the day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correa, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead ma\u2019am. Tina Correia : Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the December 2018 quarter and our outlook for the March 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 o\u2019clock p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 o\u2019clock p.m. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, let me hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thank you all for joining us today. It\u2019s good to be here with you on my first earnings call as Lam\u2019s CEO. I have met many of you before Lam events, but I recognize there are some on the call that may not know me quite as well. So I\u2019d like to start by briefly recapping how my experience at Lam and Novellus over the last 24 years has shaped my perspective on what it takes to compete and win in this business over the long term. I have been fortunate to have opportunities that expanded the company\u2019s operations from being embedded as a process engineer inside the development fab of one of our leading customers to heading our technology organization in Japan to leading product groups through periods of key technology inflections to managing our worldwide sales organization. Most recently, I has been charged with driving company-wide business results as the CEO of Lam since the time of the merger with Novellus. During this period, from calendar 2013 to 2018, we grew revenue by 2.7 times and increased earnings per share two times faster than the increase in revenue. From my experiences I believe in the critical importance of building deep and lasting customer collaborations founded on mutual trust. I am committed to continuously investing in a pipeline of differentiated products that help our customers address their most difficult technology and productivity challenges. And as we see in the current environment, I value having a flexible operating model that enables us to respond rapidly to market changes to ensure we deliver on our commitments to our customers as well as our shareholders. I believe we are still in the early stages of a long-term secular growth story for the industry and particularly for Lam. What you can expect to see from my leadership as CEO is increased focus on leveraging our core strength to deliver technology and productivity solutions to the fastest growing segments of the semiconductor equipment market, which in the long-term we believe are those tied to the enablement of the emerging data economy. I am very proud of what our company has accomplished in recent years and I am honoured to have the opportunity to lead Lam to an even greater future. Before I continue, I want to provide an update on the investigation we announced in connection with Martin\u2019s departure. As you know from our December press release, our board formed an independent special committee to lead a thorough investigation into allegations of misconduct and conduct inconsistent with our core values. That investigation is now substantially complete and there have been no other personal actions and none have been recommended by the special committee. Core values have always been a foundation of Lam\u2019s success and I am committed to a culture of trust, respect and open communication built around an environment in which our employees feel free to speak up on workplace issues. To reinforce this culture, the special committee has recommended that we review our policies, practices and training related to workplace conduct and increased our communications on these topics. To reiterate what we said in December, the alleged misconduct did not call into question the integrity of the company\u2019s financial systems or controls, and the special committee\u2019s investigation has confirmed this. Now turning to our view on the business. In line with our prior guidance, we delivered a solid December quarter despite a more challenging environment. We also completed the strongest calendar year in the history of the company with $10.871 billion in revenues, a 14% year-on-year increase at the same time we delivered growth in EPS of 27% and an increase in operating cash flows of more than 50% from the prior calendar year. I would like to thank our customers, our employees and our partners for their support and contribution to these results. From Lam\u2019s perspective, industry performance for calendar 2018 came in largely as we have communicated in our prior earnings call. Overall, WFE was in line with our expectations of single-digit growth at approximately $50 billion with an increase in memory and a year-on-year decline in non-memory spending. Entering 2019, industry fundamentals have weakened, particularly within memory segments as customers continue to reign in both NAND and DRAM spending. At this point, 2019 WFE is looking to be down in the mid to high-teens range. For NAND, 2019 offers what we believe is a solid long-term setup for the industry as the supply bit growth rate is expected to decline throughout the year. NAND demand should continue to benefit from content increase in consumer and enterprise applications and we began to see initial signs of demand elasticity in the client SSD markets as we exited the 2018. In DRAM, while near-term dynamics remaining challenging, customer behaviour remains rationale and industry profitability characteristics remain compelling. We believe customers are making prudent adjustments to capacity in response to the overall demand environment they are seeing. We expect DRAM WFE spend correction to extend through 2019 with supply growth fall into the mid-teens as we exit the year. Non-memory segments are expected to grow in 2019 and with the continued rise in the importance of 3D architectures, technology innovation for transistor, interconnect and advanced packaging applications remains a critical priority for us as we grow our strategic relevance with our customers in this segment. In aggregate, we feel confident that we\u2019re operating in a rational industry environment, one that is well positioned to deliver attractive long-term growth and opportunity. With that as context, we are executing to the growth strategy that I described during our Investor Day earlier last year. Our strategy focuses along three primary vectors : expanding the size of our served available markets, gaining market share in the segments in which we compete and increasing the recurring revenue stream we derived from our installed base. Etch and deposition processes are central to the success of our customers technology roadmaps and we continue to make substantial, comprehensive, yet disciplined investments in R&D to fund the innovation required to create differentiated solutions and long-term value. In the December quarter, we continued to build on our leadership position in both NAND and DRAM for critical applications with key penetrations for high aspect ratio Etch, and 3D NAND dielectric stack deposition applications. Furthermore, we continued to extend our high aspect ratio Etch leadership into non-memory segments with critical wins for metal interconnect and spacer applications at a leading logic customer. In atomic layer deposition film quality, repeatability and productivity are fundamental elements of differentiation for Lam. During the quarter, we gained momentum in both DRAM and NAND with new application wins. While we are pleased with these wins in critical applications, we are committed to strengthening the performance of our product portfolio across the board. Our R&D investments are squarely focused on achieving our vision of best-in-class products everywhere we compete. Turning now to revenue derived from our expanding installed base, our customer support business group delivered another record year. Installed base revenue growth exceeded installed base unit growth again in 2018 with installed base units in the field ending the year at roughly 56,000 chambers. We closed out the year on a high note, signing with a key customer, the single largest installed base deal in our history. Our focus with CSBG is to provide innovative products and services, which create value for customers over the entire life cycle of tool ownership. We partner closely with customers as we help them extract increased technical capability and higher productivity from existing assets. And in return, we are building a strong recurring revenue stream for Lam. 2019 is shaping up to be another solid year for our customer support business group and our progress remains aligned with the long-term growth objectives communicated to the investment community early last year. In closing, the business environment is more challenging than just a few quarters ago, but we are committed to delivering on our multidimensional growth strategy and at the same time responding to near-term revenue trends through a strong focus on operational efficiency. Lam has a proven track record of execution and we believe we are fundamentally well positioned in the right segments of the market. The new $5 billion share buyback program we announced earlier today in our press release reflects our continued confidence in Lam\u2019s long-term opportunities. Doug will provide details on the program in his comments. Additionally, I\u2019d like to mention that I\u2019ll be on the road in the coming weeks and look forward to meeting with many of you. I will also be participating in the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco on February 13. Thanks. And now, here\u2019s Doug. Doug Bettinger : Excuse me. Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Lam delivered solid performance in the December quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics. Operating margin and earnings per share exceeded the high end of the guidance range provided, mainly due to our proactive management of our operating expenses. Overall memory revenue increased slightly from the September quarter with the combined Memory segment making up 79% of total system revenue. NAND volume and memory revenue drove the increase in the Memory segment and it represented approximately 55% of system revenue. NAND investments were driven primarily by conversions to higher layer cut wafers. DRAM represented 24% of system revenue in the December quarter, which was roughly flat with the prior quarter. The majority of spending in all of memory was targeted at conversions. The foundry segment declined quarter-over-quarter, accounting for 13% of system revenue, mainly due to reduced China foundry investments. You may recall on the September call, I spoke about how strong that was and it declined somewhat in December. The logic and other segment was up slightly, contributing 8% of system revenue. From an industry perspective, Tim discussed our view of 2019 WFE. Currently, we believe WFE spending is weighted to the first half of 2019, driven by Foundry and Logic investments. We believe memory investments will be meaningfully lower in 2019 while the combined Foundry and Logic will be up. Our assumption based on our customer interactions is that there is not a significant recovery in memory spending throughout 2019. We expect the year in memory will be mainly driven by node conversions to lower our customers\u2019 cost per bit. DRAM spending will be primarily on conversions to 1y and a little bit of 1z and NAND converting to 96-Layer devices. Let me now turn to our P&L performance. We delivered revenues of $2.523 billion in the December quarter. This was up sequentially by 8% from September and was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.3%. As I always do, I\u2019ll remind you, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volume, product mix and customer concentration. And we expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter came in at $440 million, slightly down from the operating expense level in the September quarter. Worth noting, I think, we decreased our operating expenses for the first half of 2018 to the second half by approximately $100 million as we managed spending relative to the software business environment. R&D comprised nearly two thirds of our total spending, consistent with the composition of spending in the previous two quarters. We\u2019ve maintained a high percentage of our OpEx and R&D to support the long-term growth objectives for the company. Operating income in the December quarter was $728 million. Operating margin came in over the guidance range at 28.8%, mainly as a result of the reduced spending within the quarter as well as gross margin that came in slightly above the midpoint of our guided range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the December quarter came in at 10%, which was slightly lower than the long-term rate. This was due to discrete tax benefits realized relative to statute of limitations explorations within the quarter. In the longer run, the tax rate in the low to middle teens is the right range for you to continue to include in your models. And there will be fluctuations in the tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. Based on a share count of approximately 162 million shares, earnings per share for the December quarter came in at $3.87, which exceeded our guidance range. The share count includes dilution from the 2041 convertible notes, and the dilutive impact was approximately six million shares in the December quarter. I\u2019ll remind you that the dilution schedule for the 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. I\u2019d also point out that the 2018 warrants mature during the December quarter. We continue to execute on our capital return program. For the December quarter, we paid out $168 million in dividends. Related to the share buyback, in January of 2019, we completed our previous $4 billion share buyback authorization, repurchasing over 23 million shares in total. Additionally, as Tim mentioned and that we noted in the press release we issued today, our board has approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $5 billion of our common stock. Today\u2019s capital return announcement is consistent with our current plan of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders. And in summary, for the calendar 2018 year, we returned $3 billion share buybacks and over $500 million in dividends, which along with the new authorization that was announced today, continues to demonstrate our commitment to shareholder return. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, was flat with the September quarter at $3.9 billion. During the December quarter, our cash from operations came in at $642 million, which was offset by pay down on our commercial paper program of approximately $360 million as well as the dividends that I have previously mentioned. For the 2018 calendar year, our cash from operations was over $3 billion. This was consistent with what I mentioned in the last earnings call. DSO during the quarter decreased by five days to 67 days. Our inventory levels decreased, and consistent with our expectations, inventory turns increased to 3.2 times, which was an improvement from 2.7 times in the prior quarter. Company noncash expenses included approximately $39 million for equity comp, $36 million for amortization and $46 million for depreciation. Capital expenditures came in at $106 million in the December quarter, which was an increase of $56 million from September. Due to the timing of certain projects, December quarter CapEx was a little bit on the high side of what we expected. I expect that as we go into calendar 2019, CapEx will be somewhat lower than the 2018 level. As we noted in the last quarter, our CapEx investments are focused on manufacturing expansion for our installed base business as well as strategic R&D investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 10,950 regular full time employees, which was relatively flat with September quarter. I think it\u2019s worth noting that we maintain flexibility in managing our cost by adjusting our temporary workforce for short-term changes in business conditions. We reduced our temporary headcount by over 700 people since the peak levels we were carrying earlier this year. So now looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2,400,000,000 plus or minus a $150 million. We\u2019re forecasting gross margin of 44.5% plus or minus one percentage point. Gross margins will decline sequentially due to customer concentration, product mix and lower factory volumes. And as I just mentioned, as we sit here today, we expect the gross margin percentage will be at a low point in March relative to the rest of calendar year 2019. We\u2019re forecasting operating margins of 25% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.40 plus or minus $0.20 based on the share count of approximately 159 million shares. And I just remind you that in the March quarter, we have an extra work week in the fiscal quarter, which happens approximately every six years due to the fiscal calendar cutoff. March spending is expected to be higher in cost of goods sold as well as operating expenses as a result of the extra work week. I\u2019ll also remind you that the March quarter has seasonal impacts due to payroll taxes that go up in the beginning of the year. Both of these things are included in our stated guidance. For 2019, first half business view is lower than our prior outlook, given the recent announcements of reductions that you\u2019ve seen from commentary from others in the technology space. With this current environment, we continue to exercise and discipline in our spending, and we\u2019re focused on prioritizing investments to support Lam\u2019s SAM expansion, market share gains and installed base growth. Operator that concludes my prepared remarks, Tim and I will now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question today from C. J. Muse with Evercore. C. J. Muse: Yes good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question. As you think about WFE levels in the 4Q and 1Q time frame, can you share with us what you think the implied forward \u2013 growth rate is for both DRAM and NAND? Doug Bettinger : C. J. it\u2019s Doug. I think, generally speaking, as Tim mentioned, we expect bit growth as we go through 2019 to decline as we go through the year as customers adjust their spending. Overall, I think 2018 ended from a NAND standpoint in the low-40s. DRAM, I think, is low-20s. And we expect that to decline as we go through 2019, Tim, as customers adjust their spending levels. Tim, would you add anything? Tim Archer : No, I think that\u2019s \u2013 the comment is we, at this point, see us ending the year below what Lam has said about the long-term sustainable demand growth rates. So I think that, it\u2019s why we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the setup exiting 2019. C. J. Muse: I guess, if I could clarify the question. If you look at order run rates today, what is the implied bit growth that would come online, say, three, four quarters from now? I think you\u2019ve done analysis on that where I think Q4 DRAM, we\u2019re tracking maybe up 10%. If spending just stayed at those levels, is there any analysis you can share there with us on both DRAM and NAND? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim. I don\u2019t have specific numbers for you except what we describe, which is as we go through the year, it\u2019s going to decline as customers adjust their spending level. C. J. Muse: Okay. And as a follow-up, I\u2019m trying to do a little bit more work here and better understand your leverage to technology versus capacity buys, in particular, as it relates on the 3D NAND site in high aspect ratio etch. So can you walk through what percentage of overall etch spend or etch is in 3D, particularly as we scale up the layer counts? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim. We haven\u2019t given hard numbers on that. But as I think as customers invest in conversions, they spend less money but they spend more as a percentage on etch and deposition. We describe that consistently in the past, and that\u2019s very much what we see happening this year. Tim Archer : But I think if the question was the percentage of high aspect ratio applications where Lam\u2019s position is very strong, it\u2019s increasing node by node. And that\u2019s just based on the fact that it takes longer in general to complete those etches. And that\u2019s, obviously, our task to make those continuously faster. But it is increasing at each technology node. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, C. J. C. J. Muse: Okay, thanks. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you. Doug and Tim, I had a question just about the trajectory of the year. So if I take the WFE you guys are guiding to like 42 for this year, it looks like your product WFE share, you don\u2019t tell us what services are. But it looks like your product WFE share is somewhere in the low-15s the past couple of years. So if I could just assume that they flat, which I wonder that it will given that UV\u2019s ramping, that implies that revenue kind of like is flat throughout the rest of the year from this level. Is that the wrong way to think about it? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Tim, I think what we try to describe in short. Yes, Tim, I\u2019m getting confused who I\u2019m talking to. I think as the year sets up, we expect the first half of the year is going to be weighted towards Foundry and Logic. It will be stronger in the first half from the second half. And memory is may be a little bit stronger in the second half than the first half. We don\u2019t see a significant recovery occurring on memory, I would point that out. But I think, as you know, we tend to be very, very strong in memory. So with memory down year-on-year, our share likely trends along with that. That\u2019s not a statement around any application, win or loss. It\u2019s just a statement of who\u2019s spending money. Tim, would you add anything? Tim Archer : Yes. I think internally in the company, I don\u2019t think your thinking is too far off. And we look at the most important measures of success for us this year. And it\u2019s how we\u2019re doing on the applications that we want to make sure that we own when the spending does pick up. And as long as we\u2019re doing that, then the precise timing of when spending comes back in NAND is less important to us. So it\u2019s really our focus. Timothy Arcuri : Got it. And then Doug, I had a question on deferred revenue. It was down about $130 million again. So it sounds like shipments were more like maybe $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter. So my question is how much more can you draw down deferred revenue? Because obviously, it sounds like if you give a shipments in March, it will be lower than $2.4 billion. But where does that number \u2013 where does that $493 million worth of deferred revenue? Where does that bottom out? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I think I\u2019ve described it, Tim, in the past. It\u2019s going to bounce around $100 million quarter-on-quarter. I think some quarters, it will be down as you\u2019re seeing now. Some quarters, I think, it will also be up. I don\u2019t know that it meaningfully changes from the level where it\u2019s at right now. But it will very depend on the percentage of new tools we\u2019re shipping, how strong the business with certain customers is, certain regions of the world is little bit different. I don\u2019t view it as going to zero at any point, Tim. But it will bounce around plus or minus $100 million, it is how I would be thinking about it. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, got it. So Doug, so I mean shipments are about equal to revenue for March, is that right? Doug Bettinger : Yes. I\u2019m not guiding shipments anymore, Tim. What I said was it will be plus or minus $100 million quarter-by-quarter. Some quarters will be down. Some quarters will be up. It\u2019s all just timing, quite honestly. Timothy Arcuri : Got it, okay. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, thanks, Tim. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Doug, maybe another way to ask Tim\u2019s question. I was intrigued that you commented that March quarter should be the bottom in gross margin for the year. I\u2019m just kind of curious, is that because you expect March to be the low point in revenue? Are there mix drivers that helped gross margin going forward? Doug Bettinger : I always say, John, there\u2019s a variety of different things that impact gross margin. I usually mentioned three things. Overall business volume is a component. But as I think, we have a highly variable cost structure. This isn\u2019t a big fixed cost business. This isn\u2019t like our customers. We\u2019re highly variable in our cost. Tool mix is important. Not all of our tools have the same gross margin. And sometimes, that mix will be beneficial sequentially. Sometimes, it will be negative. And then customer concentration, when you get the bigger customer spending more or it\u2019s that more concentrated customers, you might have a little bit of margin headwinds. All of those things are important to think about relative to the trend in gross margin, and all of those are relevant to the comment I had about March being a low point. John Pitzer : That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe kind of a follow-up to CJ\u2019s question, just relative \u2013 appreciate the fact that in this volatile environment, your willingness to give us a view on the full year on WFE being down mid-to-high teens. I\u2019m just kind of curious when you look at your SAM and whether that be some incremental share gains on the Logic front at 10 or some incremental SAM gains as we go from 64 to 96 and/or 1x to 1y to 1z. Do you think your SAM outperforms, performs in line or underperforms the overall WFE this year, Tim? Tim Archer : I think if we \u2013 taking all those things into account you just said, I would think that we feel that our SAM actually underperforms to be a few this year. And that\u2019s primarily because of the heavy concentration of our SAM in 3D NAND as you know. And so I think that should be the expectation if the year plays out as we have described, which is no material increase in 3D NAND or NAND spending through the year. John Pitzer : Helpful, thanks, guys. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Joh. Operator : Krish Sankar with Cowen has our next question. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, Doug and Tim, just on the reconcile what you said in the front of WFE year versus what ASML said, is it fair to assume is it because the back half is mainly concentrated on EUV from the foundry side? And then I had a follow-up, too. Tim Archer : I think there is a few things, and I will let Doug jump in here with his comments as well. But when you look at ASML\u2019s comments and as best we understand them kind of talking about the recovery in DRAM in the second half of the year, that\u2019s not necessarily inconsistent with us exiting the year with a better setup for the first half. And I think that you have to think about the way the tools come in into new \u2013 into fabs and new projects. Our experiences that litho and metrology tools usually lead etch and deposition tools sometimes by as much as a quarter or so. So that made those statements maybe not inconsistent, and that\u2019s kind of why we\u2019re thinking about it. I mean, I guess, our view, everybody in this environment will have a slightly different view in spending to come back. But we\u2019re wanting to state at this point that our best view from conversations with customers is no material increase in memory spending throughout 2019. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I don\u2019t have anything to really add, Krish. I think as Tim said, litho usually leads our stuff. And we\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re seeing right now. We could have it wrong. But when we parsed what we heard from ASML, I didn\u2019t really feel inconsistent to us. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. Actually, that\u2019s very helpful, Tim and Doug. As a follow-up question, when you talk to your memory customers, I\u2019m kind of curious how do they look at CapEx? Are they waiting for their pricing/margins to bottom before they start getting comfortable about buying semi cap equipment? Or is it going to be in tandem? Or does one lead the other? And as a subset to that, which thing is going to recover first from here onwards in NAND or DRAM? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Well. It\u2019s a tough question. I mean I think that actually, when they\u2019re going to spend is a question better asked to them. I mean, exactly what metrics they\u2019re looking at. I guess, if we look at which of the two, NAND or DRAM might recover earlier, I mean I guess, if we look back, we saw NAND correction starting earlier in 2018 than DRAM did. And so we\u2019re \u2013 I guess, at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about demand. But we see both of them tracking as we get to the end of the year, well below what we think are the long-term demand growth bit rates. So either one could recover. Neither one could recover. I mean that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not a great view, but we think that in both cases, the market sets up for investment in either one as we exit the year. Doug Bettinger : Well, what I would tell you, my personal view, Krish. It will recover at some point. That I know for sure. And the trend we see relative to spending in the year that we just described suggests to what Tim and I that they\u2019re going to need to invest relative to long-term bit demand. We just don\u2019t necessarily see it happening in 2019 quite yet, at least not in a meaningful way. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Krish. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the detail and outlook for 2019. But can you guys just true us up on your prior view first half of 2019 versus the second half of last year? Relative to the weak spending environment, how are you seeing the first half of this year relative to last year second half? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Harlan, what I tried to described in my remarks is first half of 2019 now looks weaker than it previously did. And I\u2019m not going to give quantification of it because then I\u2019d essentially be guiding you for two quarters. We\u2019re going to get back to our normal practice of guiding one quarter at a time. But given the well-understood weakness of smartphones and inventory adjustments in some of our customers as well as the cloud guys, it\u2019s somewhat weaker than it was when we describe it last time. Harlan Sur : Great, appreciate the insights there. And given the view on WFE being down kind of mid to high-teens this year, at the same time, the team had a strong shipment growth the last couple of years. You were driving \u2013 I was looking at it first half of last year, you guys were driving like 25% year-over-year shipment growth. Many of these tools are coming off warranty and on to service contracts this year. So this should be a tailwind for the team. So how should we think about the installed base business trajectory relative to your WFE outlook? Tim Archer : Well, I guess, I\u2019ll try to cover some of that in my opening remarks. But clearly, we feel very good about our installed base business on two dimensions. One, the strengths of Lam\u2019s business over the last several years has caused our overall installed base to grow. So there is more tools for which we can sell things. And two, we\u2019ve been investing in that business to create new products and services. Some in the areas of vis-\u00e0-vis the data economy, using data to make our tools more productive for customers. And those products and services are getting traction, and this will be another strong year for CSBG for our installed base business. So that\u2019s a focus of mine, and I think it provides a very important revenue stream for the company long-term. Harlan Sur : Yes, thanks for the insights. Tim Archer : Yes. Thanks, Harlan. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great, thank you. On that topic of installed base business, I wonder if you guys have considered providing sort of better disclosure around that? It seems like that will go a long way towards understanding the sustainability of that business versus the other parts of the business. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I guess, we haven\u2019t really accomplished our objective very well, Joe. We\u2019ve been talking a lot more about it more recently than we have. We\u2019re providing you with tools kind of the installed base on a consistent basis and I will try to make it easy to understand everything we talked about in the past. Relative to segment reporting, we\u2019re not going to do that. We don\u2019t need too, because we\u2019re not tripping the roles up there. And from a competitive standpoint, we don\u2019t necessarily want to have an out quite as visible unless we have to. But it is a meaningful part of how we generate profit. It\u2019s a meaningful part of how we generate cash for sure. And we\u2019re trying to talk more about it, so you understand it. I mean, Tim talked quite a bit about it. So we\u2019ll keep trying to do a better job, Joe. Joe Moore : Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, in terms of the buyback and the pace of the buyback and 50% of free cash, what\u2019s your assessment of the right amount of cash to have on the balance sheet? And do you need to have any? Can you be leveraged? How do you think long-term about what the balance sheet should look like? Doug Bettinger : Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Joe. I haven\u2019t communicated specific numbers. We need a certain amount of cash. We like to be able to fund a certain amount of R&D and CapEx and so forth. We\u2019re carrying more cash today than we need to run the company. What we decide to do relative to that, I think, we\u2019ll evolve over time. But I don\u2019t have a hard and fast number that I\u2019m going to share with you necessarily. We certainly could have more debt on the balance sheet know if we chose to do that. And the pace of the buyback, I think we\u2019re going to be opportunistic. I\u2019m not going to communicate a timeframe and I will let you know quarter-by-quarter on how we\u2019re thinking about it and what we\u2019re doing. Joe Moore : Very helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, thanks, Joe. Operator : Patrick Ho with Stifel has our next question. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Maybe first question in terms of the installed base business, I think in your last Analyst Day, you talked about $1 billion incremental opportunity. Over the next three to five years, how do you see the revenue growth rate? Is this a 10% type of growth business? Or do you see a higher to get to that incremental billion dollars you talked about? Tim Archer : Well, I guess \u2013 yes, so you recall the billion-dollar number. I mean, as I mentioned, we\u2019re on \u2013 we feel we are on track for that trajectory. At the Investor Day, we said that the installed base business was approximately 25% of our total revenue. And so, I guess, with that information, you kind of healthy growth rate. It\u2019s a business that is definitely growing. Our objective is to have the installed base business itself grow faster than the rate of growth at the installed base. And now again, we provide information this year with the installed base growing from approximately 50,000 chambers to an ending \u2013 year ending 56,000 chambers at the end of last year. So maybe with those, you can triangulate the numbers. We can also maybe do it for you and get back to you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Patrick, how I think about it and Tim described it the way I think about it, which is on a normalized rate, it\u2019s been about 25% of the company\u2019s business. If you recall back at the Investor Day, Tim described three growth vectors, each about the same size. So if you think about installed base, it\u2019s a third of the growth and normalized at 25% of the business, so you can triangulate that way relative to the growth at that. It will grow faster than the installed base for sure. Now in the year like 2019, if it shapes up the way perhaps, it\u2019s going to with WFE down as much. It will be more than 25%, obviously. Tim Archer : I think one important point since we\u2019re talking about installed base business. I just mentioned, I think it can sometimes get lost in terms of how we are driving this business faster than the installed base itself is growing. And it all comes down to investing in the creation of new products and services. Things that help the customer relocate tools for new applications, extend the technology for those toolsets the new applications, higher productivity, higher throughput from owned assets. And as we\u2019ve seen in many ways, the lagging node business gets stronger and more heavily utilized. We find a lot of installed base business for tools that have been around and out in the field for quite a number of years. We have just lot of interest in getting new products and services for that fleet. So it\u2019s a pretty attractive business. Patrick Ho : Great. That\u2019s also very helpful. Tim Archer : Go ahead. If you can do one more, if you got it, Patrick. Patrick Ho : Real quick on the DRAM on the memory side of things, we know that capital intensity trends increase on the 3D NAND side of things with the layer count. How do you see the transition for etch and deposition as you go from 1x to 1y and eventually to 1z? Doug Bettinger : Our SAM continues to grow as we step through that. That\u2019s all about self-aligned patterning and that is very etch and deposition SAM, Patrick. Tim Archer : Yes. And actually, these technology nodes also create new opportunities for films. I mean I spoke a little bit about our effort in atomic layer deposition. As you step from 1x to 1y to 1z, there are new applications being created for atomic layer deposition for instance that wouldn\u2019t have existed in prior nodes. And so we\u2019re looking at it both from growth in our existing applications as well as our ability to win new ones also. Patrick Ho : Thank you. Tim Archer : Yes, thanks, Patrick. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, quick clarification on the last earnings call, you guys expected DRAM up in first half this year versus second half last year and NAND down. Is it fair to say that you\u2019re seeing both the DRAM and NAND down in first half of this year versus second half last year? Doug Bettinger : Yes. We\u2019re not going to provide segment level color on the quarterly guide except we gave a little color on how we see WFE setting up in that [indiscernible] like, which is foundry logic is first half weighted. Memory, probably a little bit stronger than the second half. Atif Malik : Got it. And then can you just talk about what you seeing with respect to domestic spending in China? If I recall correctly, you have talked about China domestic was $5 billion in spending last year. What could it be in the $42 billion to $43 billion WFE this year? Tim Archer : Yes. Actually, we did say that we saw 2018 was going to come in at about a $5 billion range. I think when all is said and done, it may have come in a little bit lower than that but pretty close. We actually see 2019 shaping up to be a bit stronger. And if we look actually at the SAM and share position that we hold where the money will be spent this year NAND\u2019s China domestic business should be up. Atif Malik : Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Atif. Operator : Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson Companies has our next question. Tom Diffely : Yes, good afternoon. Maybe just a quick end market question, you know after three or four quarters of the price declines in the NAND market, are you seeing evidence of the elasticity of demand that we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years? Tim Archer : Yes, I had a very small comment in my opening remarks about the fact that we believe we have seen some demand elasticity at the end of last year and it was primarily driven by an uptick that we\u2019ve seen in the adoption rate of SSDs into client. And there was some data to show the percentage of laptops or client devices with the SSD in the lower price ranges had a material uptick. And so it\u2019s just one data point, but we do think that as prices have come down we\u2019re starting to see increased demand. Tom Diffely : Okay. And given that when you look at kind of the long-term view, the next two to five years, do you still \u2013 or do you view NAND market as the real big opportunity for you versus the DRAM market knowing that both our strong? Tim Archer : Both for us without doubt. Our SAM position if you think may be just the world we\u2019ve gone through, the transition from 2D to 3D NAND, we had a very meaningful increase in the intensity of etch and deposition in that space. And when you think about also end-demand, we see NAND outpacing all other markets. And so that\u2019s why when I talk about our focus on applications that we want to hold continuously in that critical space in the NAND area. Now, of course, we want to do well in all markets, but NAND is our biggest opportunity going forward and in the long term. Doug Bettinger : Just, add-on from me Tom, independent of where things are at in 2019, I\u2019m extraordinarily optimistic on the opportunity for both NAND as well as DRAM going forward. Again, Tim alluded to the data economy. We talked about that extensively at the Investor Day. All of that stuff is still completely intact. It doesn\u2019t mean it will happen every single year, it won\u2019t. But data is exploding in society. It is not useful unless you can store it and you need a low latency memory to do anything in computer architectures. Memory is critically enabling for all of that and none of that has changed. Tom Diffely : Great. Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Tom. Operator : Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company. Quinn Bolton : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Just want to come back on your prepared comments. You mentioned share gains and high aspect ratio at 3D NAND deposition and ALD wins in both NAND and DRAM. Can those share gains help offset some of the SAM underperformance you see in 2019 or do you really think that that we need to see the memory markets recovering before you see the full benefit of those share gains? Doug Bettinger : Well simple answer is no. They cannot offset the magnitude of decline that we see this year. But the other aspect that is one of timing. Typically, the types of applications and wins I was speaking to, we focus on critical application wins, usually one to two nodes before that node ever ends up ramping. And so in the majority of those cases those would be entering production sometime next year or the following either. And that\u2019s why the start of like \u2013 those are the applications once you win it you kind of know that your businesses is pretty well locked in for the foreseeable future. Quinn Bolton : Just a quick follow-up on the China domestic is that fairly well balanced between memory and foundry logic or just one segment lead the other end in 2019? Doug Bettinger : It\u2019s fairly well balanced. Quinn, I mean, memory is probably somewhat stronger than foundry logic, but there\u2019s a broad base set of customers that are spending it\u2019s not just one or two. Quinn Bolton : Great, thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Quinn. Operator : Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank has our next question. Sidney Ho : Well thanks for taking my question. I will start off with a clarification you said revenue will be first halfway weighted in 2019. Is that an expectation for your revenue or is it for the industry? Doug Bettinger : No, it was a statement Sidney around WFE. I didn\u2019t say anything relative to Lams revenue. It was a statement on WFE. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. And then my question, it looks like from three months ago to now the change is primarily coming from the DRAM side CapEx slowing down. Would you say the NAND side is also incrementally weaker or do you think there\u2019s more stability there and then NAND CapEx everyday you start cutting earlier? Doug Bettinger : Well, we haven\u2019t, so far Sidney in the past, given you any color on the full year of 2019 this is first time we\u2019re making statements on the full year or so I\u2019m not sure I can\u2019t even say anything about trajectory what we thought before because we hadn\u2019t done all the full analytic work that we\u2019ve now have done on 2019. Sidney Ho : All right, maybe just a housekeeping one. Your operating expense is obviously much lower than what you guided for the December quarter, understanding March is an extra week, should we think about June quarter kind of go back to the December level or is it just something higher than that? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I\u2019m not going to guide it beyond the current quarter Sidney, everything else equal, flattish to maybe slightly down if you just take the one week out, but we\u2019ll give you the hard guidance when we get to earnings in the quarter. Sidney Ho : Okay. All right, thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks Sydney. Operator : We\u2019ll hear now from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had one on kind of your commentary in the back half in memory dynamics. So I guess what is the reason why there wouldn\u2019t be a significant increase in investment when you move to 96-Layer technology? Is that because the majority of the WFE spend or the increase in memory spend is because of the planar NAND transition or 3D NAND transition or is it because there\u2019s something special about 96 and makes it a lower investment cycle? Doug Bettinger : No, there\u2019s nothing special about 96 what we see happening, Mitch primarily is node conversions in both DRAM as well as 3D NAND and so that\u2019s the way to be thinking about it. It\u2019s a heavy focus of spending on node conversions which \u2013 that\u2019s a very cost effective way for our customers to invest because they just need to upgrade essentially etch and deposition equipment or add into the process flow. Tim, would you add anything? Tim Archer : No, I think that\u2019s fair obviously it\u2019s heavily driven by the ratio of node conversions to greenfield ads. On a greenfield basis, last year I showed a chart that described our increase in opportunity at 96-Layer and fundamentally on a greenfield basis, it\u2019s significantly higher as you go to 96. So the dynamic of the conversion versus greenfield ads that\u2019s Doug speaking to. Mitch Steves : Perfect. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, thanks Mitch. Operator, we\u2019re going to do one more. Operator : So now our final question will come from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Bank. Vijay Rakesh : Hi guys, good quarter. Just on your 2019, just wondering, when you look at 96-Layer 3D NAND, what do you \u2013 how do you see capital intensity at 64 versus 96? Doug Bettinger : If you do a greenfield-to-greenfield wafer, our capital intensity goes up, you\u2019ve got a longer process flow, you\u2019ve more tools and the process flow goes up. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve quantified it. The good part for our business is when you do that conversion, all you\u2019re really adding is etch and deposition equipment, you\u2019re making the stack bigger and the etch becomes a little bit more challenging to do and so it takes longer. Vijay Rakesh : Okay. And just as you talk about a little bit more softness in memory spending through the year have you seen \u2013 are you seeing any push out on either the 96 layer three 3D NAND or 1Y transition in DRAM side? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : From a timing standpoint, no, I mean we always had expected 2019 would be a 1Y investment year in DRAM with the, the beginning of 1Z and the investments in NAND would be on 96 layer devices and that\u2019s totally what we\u2019re saying and again, it\u2019s primarily focused on conversions right now. Vijay Rakesh : Got it thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, thank you. Tina Correia : Okay, so this concludes our conference call for this quarter. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia, CVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Tina Correia : Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the March 2019 quarter, and our outlook for the June 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 P.M. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that let me hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tina and hello everyone. After Doug and I go through our prepared comments, we look forward to your questions. Lam delivered a solid March quarter and continued to demonstrate strong execution in a challenging near-term industry environment. Key metrics including revenue, gross margin and operating income margin, all came in above the midpoint of guidance that we gave on our last earnings call. EPS of $3.70 exceeded the high-end of our range helped by a favorable tax rate and the benefit of ongoing share repurchases. This performance and continued execution in the business is attributable to the support of our customers and partners, and as always, the exceptional efforts of Lam employees around the world. Turning now to our perspective on the current industry environment and outlook. Industry conditions are directionally unchanged from our January call. We continue to expect customer WFE spending for calendar year 2019 to be in the low $40 billion. Though since our last call, we now see a marginal downtick in Memory spending offset by slightly better expectations in Foundry and Logic. Also consistent with our prior commentary, we expect Memory supply growth as we exit 2019 to be below the long-term demand trend line for both, NAND and DRAM. In DRAM we continue to believe the spending correction will extend through this calendar year as customers continue to rationalize long-term profitability with near-term focus on reducing channel inventories and bringing supply and demand dynamics into balance business [ph]. In NAND, recent industry data indicates that bit shipments where better than normal seasonal trends for the February month, and we continue to believe that market conditions are setting up well for future recovery as demand and supply balance improves through the year. On the Foundry and Logic side 2019 WFE spending is slightly higher than our prior baseline as customers appear to be ramping leading etch notes faster than we previously forecast which we believe is partly due to increased semiconductor content in smartphones related to 5G. While predicting the exact timing of cyclical change is always difficult, our confidence in the long-term demand drivers for Lam's business is unchanged. We're positioning Lam to capitalize on long-term demand through execution on our three growth vectors of served available market expansion, share gains, and revenue generation from our installed base. Semiconductor demand drivers such as Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, 5G and IoT are creating compelling served available market expansion opportunities for Lam; all require innovations in the transmission, processing and storage of data using a minimum number of computed cycles at lower power and lower costs. This is leading to changes in compute system architecture and driving growth in new on-chip and off-chip memory designs. Key trends include the use of high-bandwidth memory interfaces for leading accelerator designs, heterogeneous integration for system on chip solution, and the move to MRAM for embedded memories. I would like to provide a few specific examples of how Lam is set to benefit from these trends. First, new memory devices like GDDR6 improved bandwidth by adding among other things more bit lines which increases etching deposition intensity. Second, high-bandwidth memory and heterogeneous packaging integration are driving an increased need for through-silicon vias and other novel wafer level packaging technologies. Lam's SABRE 3D electroplating and Syndion etch tools are recognized technology and market leaders in the TSV market and provides a stable etch depth and VSL capability required for high-volume production. For wafer level packaging, the market-leading SABRE 3D system delivers technology-enabling co-planarity on our production-proven platform. And third, emerging memory devices such as MRAM are employing novel materials which require the introduction of new ion beam etch technology. Lam's ion-beam etch technology is differentiated by it's control over both, ion energy and angle to deliver superior device profiles and ultimately increased yield and bit density for our customers. Broadly, we believe the product and services portfolio of Lam Research is unmatched in it's fit to these emerging technology inflections, and our focus is to deliver disruptive customer-enabling technologies to expand our served available market. From a market share perspective, we continue to perform well on penetration and defense activities. In the first calendar quarter, we successfully defended all key positions in addition to winning multiple new opportunities, and we remain committed to our goal of growing market share in both, etch and deposition. Our confidence in our share gain opportunity is rooted in fundamental product architecture and technology differentiation. Lam's unique quad-station model or QSM is rapidly becoming the process chamber architecture of choice for 3D NAND. The QSM serves as the core high-productivity platform on which Lam's process teams build differentiated 3D NAND Technology Solutions. Examples where the QSM is delivering a capability advantage for our customers include our market-leading films for the ON-ON (ph) STACK, wafer bow management using backside deposition, new ALD films for high-aspect ratio gap fill, and low-resistivity tungsten fill for word line. Our ability to deliver compelling technology and productivity including fab-space saving using the QSM architecture is unparalleled. We hit a milestone this quarter with our 7,000 module shipped, a metric that signifies the growing importance of this platform for 3D NAND and other markets. In Logic and Foundry, gate contacts and interconnect layers require new materials for better device performance, reliability and scaling beyond 10-nanometer. In recent engagements we have shown our ability to leverage Lam's long-held leadership position in copper electroplating to win applications for new materials such as cobalt as leading etch notes. And in Memory, we continue to penetrate key semi-critical etch positions through our focus on productivity innovation. An example of this focus is the separate press release we issued today stating that in partnership with a leading semiconductor manufacturer we have successfully demonstrated one full year of uninterrupted production on Kiyo Etch System equipped with a unique productivity focused hardware set. We believe the Kiyo Etch System utilizing our Corvus R technology ushers in a new era of self-maintaining equipment. Today's announcement is also a demonstration of Lam's commitment to leverage Industry 4.0 technologies, advanced computing and Big Data to bring innovative products and services to our customers. And finally, in our Customer Support Business Group, we saw continued sequential growth in revenues we drive from our installed base. Our Reliant Systems business grew strongly in the March quarter reaching it's highest quarterly revenue level in our history. This was driven primarily by investments in non-leading etch notes in Foundry, as well as spending on more and more in IoT initiatives. Overall, our installed base business is on-track to deliver another record year, growing again at a rate faster than the installed base. In summary, Lam is well positioned to capitalize on the long-term demand drivers in the semiconductor industry. We are performing well in a challenging near-term industry environment. And by continuing to focus on execution and investing to meet our growth objectives, we believe we will emerge stronger as WFE spending recovers. With that let me turn the call over to Doug for his prepared remarks. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings season. Lam executed well in the March quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics. Earnings per share exceeded the high-end of the guidance range that we provided mainly due to a lower tax rate that we realized in the quarter. We had a more favorable tax benefit from our annual employee stock grant investing due to the increase in our stock price during the March quarter. I'd also like to highlight that during the March quarter our cash from operations came in at $933 million which on a quarterly basis is the second highest cash generation in the history of Lam Research. As we discussed during our last quarter earnings call, we believe WFE spending for the first half of 2019 would reflect lower memory spending levels and spending would be driven more by Foundry and Logic investments. Our view today is largely unchanged. Full year 2019 Foundry and Logic WFE might be a little bit stronger than we expected a quarter ago, and DRAM might be a little bit weaker. We continue to expect WFE will be down in the mid to high-teens percent year-over-year from 2018. WFE spending as a percentage of semi-industry profit dollars has been running at a fairly consistent level over the last several years. We continue to track a double-digit number of new fab projects this year spending leading etch Foundry, Memory and IoT driven legacy notes. Overall, Lam's system revenue for the combined Memory segment decreased to 61% of total system's revenue from the 79% we saw in the December quarter. The composition of the Memory segment was mostly driven by conversions and included non-volatile Memory spending at 40% and DRAM spending at 21%. NAND spending continues to be focused on both, 6x and 9x layer wafers, and DRAM spending is focused on the 1x and 1y notes. The Foundry segment more than doubled quarter-over-quarter accounting for 27% of system revenue which is the highest level in Foundry we've seen since March of 2017. Foundry spending in 2019 is focused on 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer. As a comparison the profile in 2017 was target at 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer notes. And finally, the Logic and other segment was also up contributing 12% of systems revenue. Let's turn to the P&L performance for the March quarter. We delivered revenues of $2.439 billion which was down slightly from the December quarter and above the midpoint of the March guidance we've provided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.1%; we came in slightly better-than-expected, primarily due to product mix and spending control. And as I always do, I'll remind you that our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and you should expect to see variability quarter-over-quarter. Operating expenses in the March quarter were $488 million which increased by approximately 11% from the prior quarter. Spending in the March quarter was negatively impacted by the appreciation of the stock market during the quarter and the resulting impact on the cost of our deferred compensation plan. We do hedge this to mitigate the exposure; however the offset to this expense shows up in other income and expense. It's neutral to earnings per share at the end of the day. R&D investments continue to be a focus for us with R&D comprising nearly two-thirds of our spending in the March quarter. In June total operating expenses are expected to be lower on a sequential basis compared to the March quarter. I'd also just point out one spending item that you'll see in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table of our press release. We incurred a charge of approximately $11 million related to severance payments for a workforce action we took during the March quarter. Operating income in the March quarter was $611 million and operating margin was 25.1%, pretty much in line with the midpoint of the guidance range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the March quarter was approximately 8% which is lower than our long-term rate due to the tax benefits related to the employee stock investing that I described earlier. For the June quarter in 2019 calendar year, we continue to expect the tax rate in the low to mid-teens and there will be fluctuations in this rate quarter-by-quarter. In March we completed the issuance of $2.5 billion in principal value of senior notes as we decided to take advantage of a favorable interest rate and credit environment. The note proceeds are for general corporate purposes including among other things to fund our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. For other income and expense, our newly issued debt added approximately $8 million in interest expense for the March quarter. However as I pointed out, this was offset in OINE by gains on assets related to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. Going forward, we expect to have approximately $26 million of quarterly interest expense related to our new debt. In total, interest expense on a quarterly basis is now around $45 million. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to capital return during the quarter funding more than $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases. For the March quarter we paid out $171 million in dividends and we completed $862 million in share buybacks through a combination of open market and structured repurchases. These repurchases were made under the new $5 billion authorization that we announced at our earnings call in January. And I'd just point out to you that in the last year we have lowered quarterly diluted share count by approximately 20 million shares; that's over 11% reduction. Earnings per share came in at $3.70 which was over our guidance range for the March quarter, mainly driven by that favorable tax rate. Diluted shares per EPS were 158 million shares which reflects a decrease from the September quarter related to the share buyback program. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the remaining 2041 convertible notes in the March quarter. And I'll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash increased notably in the March quarter to $6.4 billion from $3.9 billion in the prior quarter. This was driven by the $2.5 billion debt issuance that I mentioned, and the over $900 million operational cash flow. DSO improved by six days to 61 days. Our inventory levels decreased and consequently inventory turns increased to 3.4 times compared to 3.2 times in the prior quarter. Company non-cash expenses included approximately $53 million for equity compensation, $46 million for depreciation and $36 million for amortization. Capital expenditures were $76 million in the March quarter which was a decrease from $106 million in the December quarter. Due the timing of certain projects December quarter CapEx was somewhat on the high side and the decrease in the March quarter was in line with our expectations. The majority of the CapEx in March was directed towards investment supporting our installed base business. We exited the March quarter with approximately 10,800 regular full-time employees which is down slightly from the prior quarter due to the workforce action that I previously mentioned. For the long-term we continue to prioritize headcount that is supporting Lam's SAM expansion, market share gains, and installed base business growth. Looking ahead, I'd now like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2019 quarter. We're expecting revenues of $2.350 billion, plus or minus $150 million; gross margin of 45.5%, plus or minus one percentage point; operating margins of 26%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.40, plus or minus $0.20 based on the share count of approximately 155 million shares. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, this is Adaa (ph) calling in for John. I was wondering if you could maybe talk through what your OpEx trajectory is looking like for the remainder of the year given the lumpiness that we saw in March? Doug Bettinger : Yes. I mean we only really guide this one quarter at that time. The best -- I guess, the way I would give you to think about it is, it's going to be plus or minus where we're at in the June quarter. But again, we only formally guided numerically one quarter at a time. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And then, if you could maybe provide us with an updated view of the domestic China opportunity where you think that looks like this year in terms of WFE and then your puts and takes around that given the macro situation? Tim Archer : Sure, I can do that. We said on our last call actually that we had expected China domestic WFE this year to be little more -- greater than $5 billion, we haven't changed our view on that. And our position in China, we've also said is a bit stronger or at least as strong as elsewhere in the world, so we gave guidance on the last call that our business in domestic China would be up as well. You know, there really has been also no change in the regulatory environment that is impacting our results and while we're monitoring it closely, we don't really expect any effect on our business at this point. Operator : We will now take a question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you had given the backdrop of weak pricing across both segments in Memory; I think it's a great job on your part in terms of getting what I imagine roughly $1 billion plus per quarter in total shipments just on technology buzz alone. And so I guess the question is, as you look into the back half of the year and you think about the transition 96-layer and if we take into account what we've heard from ASML in terms of a second half ramp (inaudible). How should we think about that trajectory? Are there green chutes there into the back half for the year or is that something that would shine in the first half of 2019 -- 2020, sorry? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Tim and I will take it a little bit I think. You know, C.J. our outlook isn't really changed at all from what we communicated at earnings a quarter ago. We don't see a recovery in Memory this year, we do think it sets up well for -- what -- likely happens in 2020. We expect the exit rate of supply in both, NAND and DRAM to be under where demand is, meaning it's consuming some of the inventory which I think sets us up well, but we really don't see a meaningful recovery or recovery at all this year. Tim, you want to add anything? Tim Archer : No, I think that's -- it's a very clear statement of our position. We've been saying that we really don't see the recovery this year. You mentioned a couple of other items though like the 96-layer conversion and I guess from the standpoint of the job we're doing, you know, Lam is squarely focused in the middle of technology conversations and technology conversions are great way for customers to reduce their cost, increase their capability through cycles like this. And so Lam is just focused on helping our customers execute those technology conversions and when they come and there is capacity additions that will be as you say an additional green chute. But right now we've said, we don't see that right now through this year. Doug Bettinger : And C.J., just maybe one more comment from me. As I've said here and I think -- I do know it recovers at some point whether it's later in this year or early next year to me is somewhat interesting from a timing standpoint but obviously it will recover at some point. The industry is working through inventory in the channel and that will take some time, and at some point investment will be more than it is right now. C.J. Muse: Okay, very helpful. And as a follow-up; considering the magnitude of the debt offering in the quarter can you kind of walk through what net cash or gross cash rather you need to run the business? And are you contemplating perhaps a more aggressive buyback with the funds? Thank you. Tim Archer : Yes. C.J., nothing new to communicate relative to the buyback. We just announced the $5 billion a quarter ago, we executed $862 million last quarter, we view this as a favorable debt market as I described in my prepared remarks relative to rates and credit demand and whatnot, we've decided to take advantage of that. It really doesn't impact too much how I'm thinking about the timing of the buyback, the quantum of the buyback. Obviously, I think we've been pretty judicious with returning cash to shareholders in the past and will continue to do so in the future but I don't really have anything new to tell you except that that debt issuance helps fund what we plan to do. Thanks C.J. Operator : We'll now take a question from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job in a tough environment. Tim, I have a question on your market share. We all understand and WFE share is a complicated mix of end market, your customer mix; the Gartner data came out today and it shows your WFE share declined modestly last year. I just wanted to understand moving forward as EUV becomes a little bit bigger push and off the Logic spending, what are the things that you can do with your products that can offset -- kind of the natural headwind from EUV? And then looking beyond one to two years, when I was at SPIE Conference, there was a lot of discussion on horizontal nanotubes or nanosheets being used for 3-nanometer Logic devices similar to what we have seen from 2D to 3D NAND migration. So just your thoughts in terms of when your Logic share can start to improve because of architectural changes? Thank you. Tim Archer : Okay, sure. Lot of great questions in there, so I'll do my best. I mean, first, maybe just taking kind of the share question head-on. Obviously we looked at the Gartner report, note, we will be the first to acknowledge we don't win everything we compete for. But I want to point out, we feel -- when we think about market share we feel very good about what we've accomplished in last few years relative to our positions in critical applications. You know, critical applications are the hardest to win but once you have them, they are also the stickiest; I mean they are the applications that our customers are least likely to change. And -- so we really did, we focused on those and we made sure that in key fast-growing segments of WFE like 3D NAND, we made sure that we secured those critical applications because that's really the foundation on which we then can go build everything else. And those are the applications that get you closely collaborating with customers. I think when you think about share, I've said -- I said it last time and I'll say it again, I want us to do better in the semi-critical applications. But again, yet after the critical application foundation first, then you build semi-critical on top of that. What can we do in that area? A lot of that is you just saw in this press release. We're focused on productivity innovation, and as our customer scale up and you see it this year with focus on the pricing environment and spending environment in the Memory, productivity innovation is welcomed by our customers. So semi-critical is usually a battlefield of our productivity, the press release about the Kiyo Etch with Corvus R. I think Lam will continue to try to set benchmarks for productivity in this space and that will drive share for us. Those are all things that are within our control. Things that are not so much within our control; device mix, and so just to point out as you look at some element of spending last year what took place was that 2017 to 2018 saw a significant increase in DRAM WFE and not such a large increase in -- in fact, almost no increase in NAND WFE by our calculation. So again, based on choices we've made in strategic positioning, we have positioned Lam to be extremely strong in 3D NAND and I think you all know that. And so some years it will go -- some years it doesn't work out quite as well. Now -- but we feel really good, and quite honestly, I wouldn't trade our position we have right now for anybody else's. Now your point about Logic, kind of -- just finish on that one. We intend to improve, we're always investing to improve our position across the entire spectrum of applications. I'm not -- I won't play my (ph) expert on your 3-nanometer horizontal nanosheet's application note but we have our CTO office looking at every new inflection that comes and those inflections how we've proven our ability to use those inflections as a share gain opportunities for ourselves and we'll continue to do so. So hopefully that answers your question. Thanks. Operator : We'll go to a question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Tim, maybe first off in terms of the 2019 outlook. You detailed about the memory outlook remaining pretty much muted through the rest of this year. I guess what are some of the key variables the investors should look out for whether it be in NAND and DRAM, is it just the pricing environment? Is it the inventory situation? What are some of the key variables that you guys are monitoring that will lead to a change or a turn in positive spending for the Memory market? Tim Archer : Okay. Yes, I mean it's a great question. I mean, it's one we're asking ourselves all the time, every day. Our customers have a much better view on what their strategies are and what the trigger points are for them to begin investing. But what we're trying to say is that at least from our view what's happening right now is very rational, I mean the pricing environment -- we've seen some talk about taking small amounts of capacity offline, these are all things that we believe will accelerate in improvement in the supply-and-demand balance. So we just watch -- we're watching those, we're talking to customers continuously. And what we're making sure is that regardless as Doug said, we know it's going to come back, I talked about a lot of the demand drivers. There is no question for us about when -- whether Memory comes back, and so we're just focused on staying close to customers and making sure that when they do want to place orders for tools, there is no limitation in our ability to ship to them on the dates they want the systems. Doug Bettinger : Patrick, this is Doug. How I think about it is that I think we all understand there is inventory in the channel, there is inventory with the hyperscale guys, there is inventory with our customers that needs to clear itself out. And we can all do our best to model that, you can do it as well as we can; obviously, we model it, I know you do too. To me when I think about pricing, pricing is an indication of how supply and demand are clearing and until all the inventory is worked out, a lot of what you're seeing in pricing will be determined by how that inventory is moving through the channel; so you got to pay attention to that because that tells you how things are clearing out. And as Tim said, at some point it will clear up and we're all waiting to see when that does. Patrick Ho : Right. And as my follow-up question for you Doug; I know you've talked about the installed base business as being kind of a hidden growth driver for the Company and we've seen it now over the last couple of years. Can you just qualitatively perhaps give a little bit of color of both where the leading edges installed base continues to grow obviously with more shipments to 3D NAND and that front, as well as some of the opportunities on a trailing etch where you're saying upgrades, productivity improvements. Can you just give a little bit of color of how much that installed base growth is driven from both, leading etch versus trailing etch? Doug Bettinger : I mean a lot of it Patrick is leading-etch stuff, right, that tends to be the most technically complex chambers we have in the field and as a result it tends to consume more spare parts than stuff that's out in the field. But as we've talked about in the past, our tools will run for decades, that's a great part about this business, and this part of the business model is -- things need to be upgraded, things need to be maintained, they all need spare parts on a regular basis. At some point one customer might be done with the tool, he will buy it back, refurbish it, sell it to somebody else; so there is a very long tail to the profit generation from the stuff in the field, that's how I think about it. And we've described this in the past as being roughly a quarter of the company's business. Now in a year like this year when new equipment sales are down as much as it is, it will be more than that obviously, likely this year well north of 30%. And so that's a great part of the business this year is, this is actually growing this year Patrick; so it just keeps going. Tim, would you add anything? Tim Archer : Yes, I think the only thing I would add is, maybe even to reinforce Doug's point about the performance in this business this year; this is the kind of business that quite often when our customers are looking for opportunities to increase their capability without having to go to that next increment which is to actually add capacity which is definitely their mindset right now this year. They turn to us for productivity upgrades, capability upgrades, services that help them get more out of the existing installed base and that's what this whole business is intended to do, is to help them leverage the tools that they've already put in place and probably it's kind of a win-win but it means that in the year like this year it's a very good business. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you very much. So I had two. I guess, Tim first, I wanted to dovetail on the answer that you've just had. And obviously, you guys are a great leverage to 3D NAND but I still get a lot of questions sort of on capital intensity and what your share is of the wallet in the layer migration world versus kind of a planner to a 3D conversion world. So, can you sort of help us baseline that sort of per 1K or per 10K; how much you think the WFE spending is and what's your capture is of that wallet? Tim Archer : What I'd -- here is what I'd say; I mean, it's a great question and maybe I'll refer back to few other things we've said, and we can then see how close we can get to the level of detail you're looking for. Obviously, we participate as you're talking specifically for layer conversions and 3D NAND; we participate quite significantly in the technologies that are required to make the stack taller, right, basically to increase the density. So we're talking about going from say 64-layer to 96-layer. I don't believe and Doug can correct me if we have, but I don't believe we've actually quantified exactly what we think our share of that spend is externally. Doug Bettinger : Yes, we haven't quantified it numerically. Tim Archer : Clearly, we've done it internally, we understand that all. What we did show at the Investor Day last year was that -- obviously for a greenfield investment Lam's opportunity increases meaningfully at every layer of transition as you might expect. I mean you're building a taller stack and it's the taller stacks, deeper etches, the new films that -- I mentioned one; you know, when you get to a taller stack, these new films are required to control wafer bow (ph), are critical to being able to build those taller stacks on the wafer and still be able to process and yield the wafer. Those things do increase capital intensity for us when you're moving between layers. I think the other piece though that we did mention at Investor Day and I guess we can reiterate is that -- from a conversion perspective while the absolute dollars spent are less, our share of wallet as you'd say, our share of WFE actually increases quite significantly because the primary tools that are required to affect that layer transition are etch and depth heavy. And so in a year like this when most of the attention is turned towards conversion it becomes a year in which maybe we would be achieving and obtaining a higher share of total spend in that area. But I know that doesn't quantify for you, but I don't believe we've done that externally, probably not prepared to do so today. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks, Tim. Yes, that was kind of where I was getting at, just layer migration versus the 2D to 3D world. So, thank you for that. And then Doug, just a quick follow-up; so on free cash flow payout I think you paid a little more than all of your free cash flow this quarter. Is that still the sort of payout all of your free cash flow going forward? And I guess the question really is on repo and how opportunistic you were when the stock was lower versus now that the stock is higher? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim. I mean our formally committed metric that we are committed to return is I think we did this at our Analyst Day last year is at least 50% of the free cash flow and your observation is exactly right, last quarter it was more than 100% and the last several years it's been close to 100%. The way I think about it is, we are opportunistic, we are sensitive to what we perceive fair value of our business to be and where things are trading, we announced at our last earnings call a new authorization, $5 billion, I didn't communicate the timeframe for that and we'll see as it goes. But obviously the fact that in the June quarter year regarding the share count down again, you know we're going to be the market again in June and I've described it as I think about it as being opportunistic. I'm not going to exactly say what that means but we do pay attention to the value of the stock as we're executing. Operator : We'll now take a question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question, I have two of them. First one, Tim just to touch upon the market share last year; it looks like you guys did lose some share, especially on dielectric etch (ph) in NAND versus tail and my understanding was that tail is going to two of the customers because of productivity. Just trying to figure out -- I mean, maybe the press release we had was probably related to that. Is there a way that loss can be stemmed or do you think your share gains in the more challenging channel whole etches will more than offset any weakness in the flip etch? And then I'll had a follow-up question for Doug. Tim Archer : Well, I'm not going to talk about any specific applications but in general, my comments about semi-critical applications where both your technical capability to do the application as well as productivity are if not equally important certainly like in the mix of the decision that's an area where obviously it's more competitive. And what I'm basically messaging is, our Company is going to focus on delivering best-in-class products that are best-in-class both, for technology and productivity. In many areas we already do that, I talked about the QSM, the deposition tool for -- like the strata ON-ON tool; in terms of productivity it delivered the 3D NAND on many dimensions, cost per wafer, fab space per wafer out. These are all dimensions we're -- as we said we believe we're unparalleled in terms of productivity delivered. Some of the etch applications; we may have some room to go and so when you say can it be stemmed; it's an area of focus for us and I think our track record of both, equipment and process development in critical application demonstrates we have the capability to do it, we have the productivity know-how inside the company to do it as well, and though I will say I'm not overly concerned but it is somewhat coming from our strategy if we needed to ensure we were securing critical applications that will continue to pay -- offer us for many years to come first and I think now we can definitely take on some of the challenges we've had in semi-critical. Krish Sankar : Got it, that's helpful Tim. And then a follow-up for Doug. If I look at your OpEx and try to normalize it on a weekly basis given that March had an extra week in the quarter; it looks like the OpEx run rate really hasn't changed, it looks like it's about $35 million on a weekly basis. But you guys did takeout 150 headcount, so I'm just wondering was it more flexing on the COGS side or should we expect maybe a downside to OpEx going forward? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I mean the best I'll give you prospectively is that we just got the June quarter. I don't know what it will be precisely, I'm not going to tell you September and December and beyond. What I said in response to an earlier question is the best guidance to give you is plus or minus where we are in June. And I think, Krish, in the first half of the year you have some unique things that happened the first, you're absolutely right, it was our 14-week quarter that occurs every six years, something like six years. We have that elective deferred compensation program, drive spending up that was offset in OINE. I don't anticipate that happens again, but if the market significantly moves you will see some permutations for things like that. In the first half of the year also you get payroll taxes come in that go away later in the year. So that dynamic comes and goes and then quite honestly with our R& D spending it's based on programs and projects and schedules and it's not perfectly linear, it's not the same every single quarter, there will be some lumpiness to that and that's why we'll guide you quarter-by-quarter as we go. We're conscious of the profitability of the Company, obviously we're conscious of wanting to maintain that profitability, it's why we undertook the workforce action we did. And the last thing I'd say is, part of that workforce action Krish was in cost of goods sold, it wasn't just in direct spending. So there is lots of things moving around. Operator : We'll now take a question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Nice job on the quarterly execution. We're going to see the focus on semi-critical layer applications. The market doesn't tend to focus here a whole lot but there appears to be a lot of opportunity here as you mentioned where the team can win on attributes like productivity, reliability, tool footprint and all of this obviously have a significant impact on overall wafer cost for your customers. So, of the share gain targets that you guys have set forth in your 2021 model how much of this share capture is due to winning semi-critical applications? Doug Bettinger : We haven't quantified it Harlan but a piece of it certainly is, a piece of it certainly is. And you know when I think about it is and what I hear Tim say all the time is, obviously, productivity is a technology challenge, right. The most productive platform doesn't necessarily mean the cheapest, it doesn't, right? You innovate in productivity, you innovate with the architectures as Tim talked about. You can win business at nice profitability which is what we're aspiring to do. Tim Archer : Yes, it's a great question. Some element of it, I mean in many ways you're improving performance even on critical when you're working on things like artificial differentiation for semi-critical, so this isn't where you need to drive completely different attributes. I think it's just a natural part, especially in the 3D NAND space actually -- of how the technology has also evolved and matured as well. I mean, if you go back a couple of years ago, maybe there was a lot more focus on the technical enablement of 3D NAND, it meant a lot more applications looked critical. And I think now as it's matured we figure out which ones we can push the boundaries of our throughput and cost reduction in a way that we can make 3D NAND lower cost for our customers to produce and therefore maybe drive increased volume, I mean basically through elasticity. So it's a focus of ours and like I said it's not something new; I mean the -- many of the deposition applications for a long time have competed in the semi-critical space and that's why you see unique tool plans that bring back up the QSM, architectural differentiation specifically for productivity, it's a winner. The Kiyo Etch and Corvus R announcement; Doug's point about almost every cost problem requires a technology solution, now that's a technology solution, I mean it may sound easy but the idea of a tool that can replace it's own hardware without human intervention, that's a technology solution to a cost and productivity problem. And I think it's just the first example of the types of things that we want to drive out of our technology organization focused on cost. Harlan Sur : Thanks for the insights there. And then as my follow-up, as your Memory customers continue to focus on profitability and free cash flow, they started off by cutting CapEx, now they are limiting supply to the market by building inventory and then more recently idealing (ph) capacity or even cutting wafer starts. I mean, now that utilization in fab activity does drive a part of your installed base business and so wondering if you can comment on whether or not you expect to see any potential impact of these customer actions on your services business on a go-forward basis? Doug Bettinger : Yes, maybe a little bit Harlan. Honestly, as I think you well know, our spares consumption often -- well, not often is correlated with fab utilization; so if utilization comes down the consumption of spare parts will reduce a bit. Independent of that, we still see a nice growth here for the installed base. We still are going to deliver record levels of revenue and profits in that part of the business. So yes, we're still feeling great about what's going on. Tim, anything? Tim Archer : No, no. I think I'd just point you back to the comment I made. The utilization portion that was what Doug was commenting on, obviously some work dependence there on utilization to things like spares and consumables etcetera. But I made the comment which I think is also shouldn't be lost; it's in years like this the customers are looking to us to help them improve the productivity of their installed tools through upgrades and services, and so you maybe getting a little bit of a balance between those two elements of our installed base business and that's why even in face of this business we're telling you we'll deliver a record year in installed base. Operator : We'll now take a question from Westin [ph] with KeyBanc. Unidentified Analyst : I actually wanted to follow-up on the installed base business. I'm wondering that if you have a significant slowdown until shipments this year; does that impact your installed base revenue growth trajectory next year and come more importantly, does it put that 2021 target model at risk? Tim Archer : No, we're still tracking to where we want to be relative to the growth drivers in this business. You're right, if the growth of chambers slows there will be a lag effect to the growth of the installed base business but we're still feel really good about where we're headed here. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, you talk about the self-maintenance chamber, that's sounds really interesting. I'm wondering who would be the typical customer and is that something that could help you accelerate revenue growth next year as the Memory CapEx begins to recover? Doug Bettinger : Well that's what we're doing. Yes, obviously it could apply to all applications; it's first application here was in a Memory focused etch application, and I think that we -- just again, it will be more sensitive to places where you're wanting to manage very high-volume production with minimal human intervention. I mean what it really does is, it allows us to not have to interrupt the tool by opening into replaced arps (ph). And so I guess any high-volume application could be a target for it. If it's successful as it's proving out right now then sure it represents a share gain opportunity for us, and therefore better position when spending recovers. Unidentified Analyst : All right, that's helpful. Just to clarify, so you think there will be a product in the marketplace next year helping generate revenue growth? Tim Archer : Yes. Doug Bettinger : Westin, it's in the market right now. Tim Archer : Yes, that was the announcement whether it is manufacturing and manufacturing right now high-volume in manufacturing. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mitchell Steves with RBC. Mitchell Steves : First one, during your prepared remarks you guys stated that you saw a little bit more softening in DRAM; but then you didn't have a comment on NAND. So my reason is mostly in between lines, I think maybe NAND price is bottoms high of DRAM or is that I guess a bad assumption to make? Tim Archer : I mean, it's just read it be our outlook for NAND is unchanged. Mitchell Steves : Okay, got it. And then secondly in terms of the China demand right now. And obviously has been a lot of growth in terms of what the impact has been between the tariffs. So (inaudible) kind of quantify the impact of the tariffs U.S.? Tim Archer : Well, if you mean specifically the impact of the tariffs on Lam results -- what we have said is that we've been able to mitigate close to the point that they are included and reported in our financials and their part of our guidance and then I would say that they have been very minimal impact at this point. Doug Bettinger : How to mitigate what might have occurred Mitch. It's gotten material impact on anything you're seeing from us right now. Operator : We'll now go to a question from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya : Tim, I'm wondering how is the visibility and outlook for the second half now versus what have thought quarter ago. We have heard from some of the Memory customers that they are expecting some optimism about the second half but the inventory situation is not getting much better. So I'm just wondering how you're looking at the second half what's on your dashboard as you look at visibility and at what point do you think you will be shipping demand? Has that view changed in the last quarter or so? Tim Archer : Yes, it's a great question. We have been -- I mean where do we look at, I mean, we're said in constant contact with our customers. The message we delivered today and are delivering on this call is that there a year is playing out pretty much as we stated on the last call which is we cheese no meaningful recovery in Memory spending through this year. And we exit with supply growth meaningfully below the long-term demand both in DRAM and NAND. And so we have said 2019 is a year in nature kind of the balance of supply and demand and then inventory issues gets resolved in away that we exit the year and are set up for a much stronger outlook in 2020. That's what we said in January. I guess I'd say we just are a reiterating that we still see it playing out that way. And that's how we're looking at it. Doug Bettinger : Yes, we'll give you one follow-up. Operator just a heads-up we have a time after this for one more call. Vivek Arya : So very quickly, I don't know whether you answered it before. But what's the sensitivity of the services business to what you're seeing on those businesses. So you will mean historically to see our historically does it mean services go down next year or do you think that enough growth in the installed base and consumables to still have conceptually a positive year consummately positive year next year? Doug Bettinger : We that when we look at this we see this is a growth year for the installed base business and it will grow next year too. Operator : We'll take a question from Mehdi Hosseini (ph) with SIG. Unidentified Analyst : All the good questions have you asked. I just have one quick follow-up. When you talk about Logic and Foundry, and others, does that include advanced packaging and image sensors? And if not what does that put in which pocket? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Mehdi for us it's Logic and Other as you rightly pointed out. So yes, that's where image sensors goes, that's where advanced packaging goes, it's Logic plus everything else. Unidentified Analyst : When you talk about a slight upside to Logic and Foundry, would that include better-than-expected advanced packaging and image sensors? Doug Bettinger : That's not what's driving the upside and spending that we're seeing, it's more leading etch stuff. Operator : That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back to Ms. Tina Correia for any additional or closing remarks. Tina Correia : Thank you all for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. Tina Correia : Great. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the June 2019 quarter and our outlook for the September 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 P.M. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, let me hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tina, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. In the June quarter, Lam delivered strong results. Revenues, gross margin and operating margin exceeded the midpoint of the guidance we've provided on our last earnings call, while EPS exceeded the high end of the guidance. Our ability to deliver these results was made possible by the support of our customers, our employees and our partners and I would like to thank them for their ongoing commitment to Lam's success. I would like to start by offering some perspective on Lam given the uncertainties surrounding trade and other influences on the market environment. Through the first half of calendar 2019, we have executed at a high level by focusing on what is in our control. And despite a difficult memory market, we have delivered on or exceeded our commitments. As you will hear from Doug later, we generated another $880 million in cash from operations in the most recent quarter. At the same time, we have continued to prioritize investment in innovation and product differentiation, shifting a higher percentage of our total OpEx to R&D than in any prior quarter in our history. We remain committed to our long-term growth vectors observed available market expansion, market share gains and increased revenue from our installed base. Specific proof points are emerging that validate our progress in each of these areas and I will touch on them later in my remarks. But first let me update our industry outlook. Our view on total WFE remains directionally unchanged, with calendar year 2019 down mid- to high-teens percent from 2018. However, since our last earnings call, Memory spending is incrementally lower, while Foundry spending is tracking higher, we believe due in part to acceleration in 5G development leading to strong demand for 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer products. We now view Foundry Logic WFE to be second half-weighted versus our prior baseline of first half-weighted for calendar 2019. Within Memory, customers have continued to take meaningful actions to restore supply and demand balance, reducing investment and lowering utilization levels for both NAND and DRAM, as we progressed through the June quarter. As a result, we see year-over-year bit supply growth for both NAND and DRAM continuing to decline, with bit supply growth rates exiting the year well below the long-term demand trend lines. On the demand side, we are encouraged by early signs that NAND price declines are leading to an acceleration of content growth in devices. For example, SSD penetration in PCs is expected to reach nearly 60% by the end of 2019. But more importantly, the average density per drive is also growing. The predominant SSD configurations in the PC market are now 256 gigabyte and 512 gigabyte versus 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte a year ago. The demand impact is amplified as both units and content per unit grow together. Similarly, we have seen acceleration in bit content growth for NAND and mobile devices. This is evident not only in the premium phone segment, but also in the mid-tier and lower-end phones, where 128 gigabytes offerings are seeing the fastest growth versus 64 gigabyte models a year ago. We believe the combination of factors influencing supply and demand creates a favorable setup for Memory as we enter 2020. Our actions are focused on ensuring Lam is in the best possible position to benefit from the anticipated recovery in Memory spending. This focus is contributing to gains in both served market and market share as evidenced by wins this quarter across various applications, as well as in road maps for emerging 3D architectures. In NAND, we are working closely with customers to develop differentiated solutions for potential limiters to 3D scaling. An excellent example is the wafer processing challenge created by stress-induced wafer bow as the number of 3D NAND layer scales to 100 and beyond. Given Lam's leadership position in critical 3D NAND etch and deposition applications, we are best positioned to address this problem. The new Lam tool, which deposits a counter-stress film on the backside of the 3D NAND wafer, using an innovative single-step process has been introduced to leading-etch customers with multiple repeat orders received. Importantly, the learning we gain through our investments to scale 3D NAND will be broadly applicable as new 3D architectures emerge in other segments. For example, we believe Lam's leadership in enabling 3D scaling will become increasingly valuable as logic devices migrate to a 3D gate all around structure in 3-nanometer as new memory such as PC RAM scale vertically for cost and bit density improvement, and as 3D heterogeneous integration is adopted as a preferred packaging option for high-performance system solutions. For 3D heterogeneous integration, several leading companies across Foundry and Logic have announced architectures to connect different IP blocks using high-density interconnects with through-silicon vias. Lam's SABRE 3D electroplating and Syndion etch tools offer best-in-class technology backed by years of high-volume production leadership in the TSV market. During the quarter we secured an important win at a leading logic customer for our SABRE 3D electroplating system for 3D chip stacking applications. This is a significant validation of Lam's ability to leverage its industry leading position in 3D scaling to new and emerging manufacturing inflections. We are also seeing successes from our customer focused investments in DRAM. We are collaborating with customers on critical new technologies required to scale to the 1Z and 1A nodes. For instance, as DRAM shrinks, devices shrink to 1Z and beyond, the performance impact of resistance capacity delays becomes a challenge that must be addressed. This quarter, we won critical spacer applications at multiple leading DRAM manufacturers for the 1Z node due to our ability to deposit highly conformal low-k films that help reduce RC delay. In addition to our progress on critical applications, you might recall that I have spoken previously about the NAND semi-critical process space and is an area of increased focus for Lam as we drive to gain market share. In the most recent quarter, we began to deliver on this opportunity with significant conductor etch wins at multiple NAND customers for mask open applications. Specifically, Lam's ability to create a highly productive, single-step etch process to replace our competitor's multiple step approach allowed us to differentiate on system throughput, a key decision factor in the semi-critical space. Another example is seen in dielectric etch where we recorded a key win for a semi-critical metal contact application at a leading memory maker. As 3D NAND scales, the peripheral context becomes deeper and aspect ratios increase. Our dielectric etch system demonstrated faster etch rates and superior profile control, leading to greater capital productivity and less frequent maintenance. For our Customer Support Business Group, we continue to see 2019 as another year of solid revenue growth despite lower WFE spending. In the June quarter we achieved a second consecutive quarterly record for revenue from our Reliant Systems business as customers invest to address robust non-leading etch demand from end markets such as IoT, automotive and powered devices. The combination of our focus on leading-etch technologies and installed base performance is being recognized by our customers. In the most recent quarter our top customer completed their annual supplier evaluation process, ranking us as their number one supplier as measured by a broad set of installed base performance, cost reduction and R&D engagement metrics. With this newest rating, we are now in the number one position in more than half of our top customers. To wrap up, the near-term environment remains challenging. But the long-term growth opportunity for both our industry and for Lam is compelling. We are focused on executing to our commitments and extending the differentiation of our product and services portfolio. I believe that our continued prioritization of customer focused investment would yield lasting benefits. And as Memory spending returns to normalized levels and non-Memory technologies increasingly rely on 3D scaling for performance and cost improvement, Lam will be in an excellent position to outperform. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today during what I know is a busy earnings season. Lam executed well in the June quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics. Earnings per share exceeded the high end of the guidance range we provided due to stronger gross margin as well as proactive management of operating expenses. Our EPS performance is I believe are testament to our continual focus on delivering on our ongoing commitments. As Tim noted, our expectation is that 2019 WFE will be down from calendar year 2018 in the mid-to high teens percentage level. Since our last call we're seeing some upside strength in Foundry, which was partially offset by a reduction in Memory spending. From a segment perspective, our systems revenue for the combined Memory segment increased slightly to 64% of total system revenue from 61% in the March quarter. We had an increase from the March quarter in the non-volatile memory segment from 40% to 46%, while DRAM decreased to 18% from 21%. Memory revenue continues to be mainly targeted towards conversion-related investments. In DRAM spending, it's targeted towards 1Y and some initial 1Z investment. In NAND, it's primarily convergence to non-auxiliary devices. Additionally, we are seeing initial investment on 128-layer structures. We're continuing to see healthy spending in the Foundry segment which came in at 23% of our system revenue for the March quarter. And as Tim mentioned this is heavily focused on the 5 and 7-nanometer nodes. This was slightly down from 27% last quarter although still quite strong. The Logic and Other segment was flat with the prior quarter level contributing 13% of system revenue. We expect to see continued strength in the Foundry and Logic space throughout the remainder of the calendar year. It's worth noting that from a geographic perspective, 33% of our revenue was generated in the China region. The majority of this came from indigenous Chinese customers. We expect to see higher than our average concentration level of revenue in the China region for the September quarter as well. We executed well on income statement performance for the June quarter. Revenues came in at $2.361 billion, which was above the midpoint of the June guidance. Gross margin for the quarter was 45.9% which was better than expected primarily due to customer mix and improved field resource utilization. Also as we've stated in previous quarters, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as our raw business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter. Operating expenses in the June quarter declined to $450 million from the prior quarter. We are proactively managing expenses with our lower revenue levels. We continue to invest in our strategic R&D programs however and remain focused on our commitment to technology and productivity leadership. The percentage of R&D spend increased to approximately 66% in the June quarter, which was a high watermark. Operating income in the June quarter was $635 million and operating margin was 26.9% at the high-end of our guidance range. The non-GAAP tax rate for the June quarter was approximately 11% which is slightly lower than our long-term rate. For the remainder of the 2019 calendar year, we expect a tax rate in the low to mid-teens. And I'll just remind you, you should expect to see fluctuations in the rate from quarter-to-quarter. For June, other income and expense was a total of approximately $6 million of expense. This total includes interest expense for a full quarter related to the issuance of a $2.5 billion senior notes that we completed in the March quarter. The quarterly interest expense is partially offset by the interest income earned on higher cash balances for the company. I'll just remind you that total interest expense on all tranches of our debt is approximately $45 million per quarter. We continued to execute on our capital return program during the June quarter. For the quarter, we allocated $1.3 billion to capital return with $1.1 billion coming in share repurchases and $165 million in dividend payments.  Our share repurchase activities were from a combination of open market as well as structured repurchases. The structured repurchase program that we entered into is intended to continue to execute throughout our December quarter. We've completed approximately $2 billion of the $5 billion authorization that we announced in the March quarter. Over the past 1.5 years, we've utilized approximately $6 billion in buybacks and lowered diluted share count by roughly 15%. I believe this demonstrates our continued commitment to return meaningful cash to our shareholders. Earnings per share was $3.62, which was over our guidance range for the June quarter. This upside was driven primarily by better gross margin and lower-than-expected operating expenses. Diluted shares per EPS were approximately 154 million shares which reflects a 5% decrease in quarterly diluted share count since the beginning of the calendar year. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. The dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 converts is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. Let me now move to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased in the June quarter to $5.7 billion from $6.4 billion in the March quarter. The decrease is mainly due to the capital return activities within the quarter, offset by strong cash generation from operations of $880 million. This is the second consecutive quarter, where we had cash from operations in the $900 million range. DSO decreased by five days to 56 days. Our inventory balance decreased by $82 million. Inventory turns remained at industry-leading levels coming in at 3.3 times. Company non-cash expenses included approximately $45 million for equity comp, $47 million for depreciation, and $18 million for amortization. Amortization was down from last quarter by 50% as a portion of the intangibles from the Novellus acquisition have now fully amortized. Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter, which was a slight decrease from the $76 million that we saw in March. The June quarter ended with approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees, which is down somewhat from the prior quarter. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that, we used temporary labor as part of our operating model. We have reduced this temporary labor by almost 40% or 600 head count in the last year. This flexibility is a critical part of our operating model enabling us to deliver sustainable operating profits during a time of reduced revenue levels. So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2019 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2.150 billion plus or minus $150 million; gross margin of 45% plus or minus one percentage point; operating margin of 24.5% plus or minus one percentage point; and finally earnings per share of $3 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 150 million shares. Before closing my scripted remarks, I'd like to reiterate some of the tone that Tim shared in his script. We continue to not see a recovery in Memory spending which is our strongest market for 2019. We do observe dynamics in those markets, however, that are positive signs. Some examples of these signs are demand elasticity, pricing trends, and management of factory utilization to bring inventory down. We are tracking a double-digit number of new fabs ready to receive equipment shipments during this year and we see plans for that to happen again next year. We continue to believe as a result that 2020 sets up as a better year than 2019. Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open-up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take are our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A quarter ago, the supply side situation in Memory was one of disciplined spending and sort of reining in supply. It was really the demand side that was still uncertain, but just even over the past few weeks it seems that the demand side is starting to materialize here in the second half of this year PC market looking seasonally stronger cloud spending set to accelerate this quarter and you even have several big sort of AI in deep learning programs that are starting to fire. Your customers are also talking about inventory starting to come down. So is the Lam team feeling more confident, and more importantly your customers feeling more confident about the prospects for a healthier market environment exiting this year relative to three months or six months ago? Tim Archer : Sure. Harlan, I'll take that and then Doug can add what he would like to. Clearly, I maybe \u2013 I walk you back since you kind of sets us as a baseline three or six months ago. The very first call of this year we laid out a view that Memory spending really wouldn't recover for this entire year. You just heard Doug kind of reiterate that again. But that didn't mean that through the year we wouldn't see progress, progress in sentiment progress in both the supply side and maybe the demand side. And so I guess, what I would say is incrementally you are hearing commentary about the demand side. I talked about elasticity. You've heard that also from some others even closer to those markets than us. So I think that you're starting to see some sentiment in NAND that is \u2013 are positive signs. Back six months ago we also said that, given the timing in which NAND corrected versus DRAM that NAND corrected earlier, and therefore would be likely the first market where we would see end demand increases as well as pricing and market improvements. What we've tried not to do and it's just challenging given the uncertainty in the market is pin down exactly when that happened. So we have put an end year supply growth rate number out there which was we said on the last call and we reiterate now in the range of about 30% supply growth for NAND as we exit the year. And that's about 10 points below what Lam sees as long-term demand growth. And so again, what we said is at that point it feels like the market will have tightened and investment could return, but obviously pinning that exact timing is challenging. I feel like the year in terms of supply improvement demand improvement discipline is playing out very close to what we thought it would with a whole lot of moving parts but in general and as I said directionally very much likely we thought at the beginning of the year. I don't know if Doug has anything to add. Doug Bettinger : No. Perfect Tim. I don't really have anything to add. You're starting to see Harlan you alluded to it some of the early indications that the market is getting healthier is turning. And inevitably I think we all know it's a question of when not an if that memory spending will recover and that continues to be how we see it. Harlan Sur : Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on the heavier China domestic mix just, given the continued trade tensions U.S. and China which is actually motivating a number of the China-based companies to bring in more chip design domestically especially given some of the recent component bans and the delist additions. Have you guys seen an increase in dialogue or programs that suggest a step up on China domestic activities to accelerate their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities? Tim Archer : Yes. I think it's hard to say to tie one directly to the other. What we said as we came into this year is that China domestic spending would be stronger this year than last year. And I would say that at this point in the year, we feel maybe it's even somewhat stronger than that and so demand from domestic China or indigenous Chinese customers is strong as Doug pointed out. I think to this point of exactly what's driving that I think there is obviously long-term demand and a long-term desire to build more domestic capability. When I think about China, it's -- the biggest challenge for us really is the uncertainty that a lot of the trade discussions probably put not only the investment plans of indigenous Chinese customers, but also in the global players who are a little less certain about how those issues might play into the demand environment. So we're just trying -- we're managing through this. We've said our position in China is strong from a market share perspective and I think as you start to see some of the indigenous Chinese customers move into Memory, I would assume that our market share position should get even stronger. So, it's an important region for us but we track what's going on there closely and manage it as we see best. Harlan Sur : Great. Tim Archer : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : We'll go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you talked a little bit about your focus on addressing semi-critical applications in your prepared remarks. And I think you threw out an example in conductor etch where you managed to have some wins in the quarter. Just curious to semi-critical applications in general how meaningful is that part of the market as a percentage of etch and deposition? Where is your market share today? And how do you see that evolving over the next couple of years? And then I have a follow-up. Tim Archer : Yes. That's a great question. In fact we said last time that as we move through the year and perhaps our Investor Day when we hold it next we might break out a little bit more detail on the size of semi-critical as a percentage of our total so we're not prepared to do that today. But it is -- the semi-critical is a meaningful part of the etch market. In terms of -- but I think it's also important and I really want to make sure that the message doesn't get lost. Our core strength, our core business is the critical market, but if you have ambitions to grow and outperform the industry in the long-term, you have to also be competitive in semi-critical. And so, I think that we look at our performance in the last quarter I didn't talk about it, but we successfully defended critical positions in all markets in the last quarter. And so that was a statement and that's kind of how we go every quarter thinking we have to get done is defend our critical positions. Where we have the opportunity to grow is by taking semi-critical positions away from the competition. There the defining factor is much more about productivity. As I think I mentioned in the last call or at least in one of our conferences, productivity is something that the company knows how to do by learning from what has been done for a long time on the deposition side where I would say a larger fraction of the market exists within the semi-critical space. And so what we tried to highlight in the prepared remarks today is refocusing some of our efforts to ensuring that our productivity that we're delivering to customers is best-in-class can yield wins for Lam in the semi-critical etch space. We gave you examples both in the conductor etch space as well as the dielectric etch space. And so obviously that's -- can be interpreted as against two different competitors. So I think we're making progress there. I think just stay tuned and we'll continue to report how we're doing against those efforts. Toshiya Hari : Got it. Thanks very much. And then as a follow-up, I was hoping to get an update on how you guys view EUV. How fast -- or how slow rather the technology is progressing on the Foundry and Logic side? How you see that impacting your business into 2020? And then more specifically I guess one of your customers recently sort of talked about potentially inserting EUV on the DRAM side of their business at the 1Z nanometer node. How do you see that evolving over the next 12 to 18 months? And how that could impact your business? Thank you. Tim Archer : Sure. Okay. Great. It's funny, so maybe I'll just come out with a very clear statement at the beginning, because we get asked -- when the EUV question gets asked, it's often -- at least, I interpret it as kind of like, is this going to have a negative impact on Lam's business. So, I guess, what I'd like to start just by saying is, at this point we view Lam -- EUV as being good for Lam. And maybe I'll just run you through a couple of reasons for that. I mean, we're aligned with this idea, which, I think, is held be many of our customers, that EUV is part of the answer to cost-effective scaling. And cost-effective scaling is what's needed for new technology nodes. New nodes are important to Lam, as you can guess. I just said our critical application business is the core of our business. Critical applications, kind of, new ones get created when technology advances from node to node and so that's part of our growth strategy is, continue to win the next critical applications are being developed. New nodes also create SAM expansion opportunities for Lam. When there's a new node, I mean, there's new materials and new architectures where Lam can use etch and deposition more effectively. We win new positions. And in terms of a negative impact, I mean, multiple patterning, we've said also very clearly, continues to grow even with EUV. We've said obviously, it doesn't grow -- multiple pattern, it doesn't grow as fast as if EUV doesn't exist. But, again, our view is, that's one of those hypothetical futures that, it's hard to say exactly how many wafers will get produced in the future of future nodes without EV. So, it's a long way of saying, I think, EUV in total is good for Lam. Now, I also said, I think, on our last call that EUV is a big technology transition and you kind of pointed out, the speed with which it gets introduced has a lot to do with productivity. And we think that Lam has a significant role that we can play in helping improve, by using etch and deposition we can improve the productivity over the patterning module as a whole. And if we can do that, then it creates new opportunities for etch and deposition and we're partnering with ASML on those opportunities and I think we -- it's a big area of focus for us. Specifically, to your question, like, for introduction in Logic and Foundry, I think, our view is consistent with industry consensus. So I don't have a lot to say there. Around the question of 1z insertion, again, I think you know probably what has been said. It's clearly not the general consensus that DRAM and D1z will commonly use EUV. I mean, it's a node where people will talk -- at least one customer, as you said, is talking about putting it in kind of as maybe the learning node. But I think that I don't have anything else to add to it than that. Toshiya Hari : Thanks very much. Tim Archer : Thanks, Toshiya. Operator : We'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Tim at least by our math, if you look at kind of your June shipments into the Memory market, they're down about 50% plus or minus from sort of peak, but they're still up if you look at -- you're almost 50% from sort of the 2014 to 2016 average and there's been a lot that's going on with capital intensity, your SAM expansion, market share gains. You guys have been very clear about not calling a recovery in Memory, but I'm kind of curious, how do you think about the current level of spending relative to prior troughs in Memory spending when you adjust for capital intensity going up, SAM growth, market share. Do you feel like we're bouncing along a bottom here in Memory, or how should we think about that? Doug Bettinger : I mean the one thing, I would say, John, is that -- I would say and we've been saying this all year is, when I look at the spending in Memory this year, it is almost entirely allocated to conversion-related investments right? Which is always a cost-effective thing for the customer base to do, it lowers cost per bit. I don't know that I would say, it's a maintenance level or it's a bottom level, John. But it's always something that economically is -- it makes sense for the customer to do it. And that's pretty much what we're seeing happening this year. And your observation about SAM intensity, capital intensity going up and all of that is absolutely valid. It's gotten more expensive to put wafers in place, because complexity of architectures have grown. And, obviously, that's part of the calculus as well. I don't know, anything to add, Tim? Tim Archer : Yes. No, I think in terms of, especially, etch and depth intensity has changed in a pretty dramatic way since, what's the time? But I agree with everything Doug said. Our comments are -- have been, we're clearly at a point where we believe that supply growth spending is insufficient to meet long-term demand growth. So, however you want to call that, Doug, bottom or trough, as Doug said, we don't really want to do that, but it's -- this feels like the majority of investment is really around technology at this point. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then, as my follow-up, I was wondering if you can just give us update on kind of your view of the service business for this year, especially in lieu of sort of the some of the utilization cuts we've seen from customers. I know the installed base is growing, which will give a tailwind to service, but is that still expected to grow? And as you answer the question, one of your customers with the power outage this quarter, what kind of impact might that have had, either on the services or quite frankly in the shipment business? Doug Bettinger : Yes. John, it's Doug again. Yes, I still expect our installed base business to grow this year. And again, your observation is absolutely right. This business will ebb and flow somewhat with industry overall utilization. And I think it's pretty well understood that some of the Memory -- some of our Memory customers are reducing utilization to a certain extent, including from a power outage. And so, as a result of that, things like spares consumption will decrease for a period of time. But this business will still grow this year. And it grows along with growth and chamber count. And as we've been saying, our view even though WFE is down so much, chamber count will still grow this year. So the tailwind of the business over the next several years continues to be pretty good. John Pitzer : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, John. Operator : We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks so much. Doug, I guess both of my questions are for you. The first one is I'm wondering if you can update us on the comments you gave, I think on second half versus first half loading? Obviously, your full year WFE has not changed. But the mix has changed a little bit. It seems like maybe a little bit less in your favor. So can you update us on the second half versus first half of this year? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Tim, yeah you're right the puts and takes. We're still suggesting WFE this year is down, mid-to high teens. And within that there are puts and takes. Memory is somewhat softer than we were describing, a quarter ago. And Foundry is a little bit stronger, maybe a decent amount stronger. And when I look at the profile of that investment, the spending in Memory is somewhat first half weighted. The spending in Foundry and Logic is somewhat second half weighted. And when you put it all together, I think WFE this year will be a little bit weighted to the second half. Timothy Arcuri : I guess Doug, I was more talking about your shipments, but I think you had previously guided your shipments or your revenue second half versus first half. So I'm wondering if you can update that. Doug Bettinger : No. We've never guided revenue half on half. We've always and maybe I was misinterpreted talking about WFE. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, awesome. Okay and then I guess my second question Doug is you're doing $12 annualized in a pretty nasty Memory cycle systems for Memory are cut in half and total system shipments are down somewhere in the range of 14% from the peak. Obviously it's much down than really anything in the past. So I guess the question is how do you think about how to optimize the capital structure in the balance sheet as you come out of this? You have bought back a ton of stock but I'm wondering how you think about the right balance sheet leverage targets, as you look out over the next few years? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Tim, I mean, I haven't communicated a numeric target for leverage or total cash or anything like that. But if you look at what we've done over the last several years I think we've had an inclination to provide meaningful cash back to shareholders. The cash generation capability of the business, continues to be amazingly strong right? We're coming off two quarters now of nearly 900 -- or approximately $900 million from operational cash flow. So our confidence in the ability to sustain cash generation is obviously much higher. And if you look at a metric like net cash, it's also why we've been comfortable bringing that down. And we've done that through raising, a little bit of debt and consuming the cash by both dividends and more towards share buyback. At some point, we'll probably have an investor event again and talk a little bit more about it. But I'm not ready to change what we've described in the past, which has been we're going to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. And what you've seen us do is a whole lot more than that over the last several years. Timothy Arcuri : Okay Doug got it. Thanks so much. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, thanks, Tim. Operator : We'll go next to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, can you speak to on both Foundry Logic side. Your revenue intensity at the 16, 14, 10, nodes and how we think about share gains and/or greater opportunities for you as we migrate down to seven and five? And if there's any way to kind of quantify what the incremental revenues per wafer start or any sort of math like that, that will be very helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. C.J., I'm going to let Tim actually talk about the direction. We haven't quantified it. And we're not ready to do that on the call. But Tim is pretty well versed in the trajectory. So if you can cover that. Tim Archer : Good they took the numbers off the table for me. But I think maybe the first time we've said and we feel quite confident is, in kind of the Logic Foundry world. Our share gains for a variety of reasons both through wins, but also new applications that we've gained our share gains are gains between 10, 7 and 5. And so we feel quite confident that part of that is intensity in etching that deposition, part of that is new applications that created get created its new processes. And so, while we haven't quantified it, I would say that, as I said in my EUV commentary, every technology transition is an opportunity for us to gain new applications and gain share. We feel really good about the progress we've made. It sometimes gets lost in the -- in this overlying story about memory and memory spending. And how much impact it has on our business. But we're feeling quite good about our momentum in Logic and Foundry both. C.J. Muse: That's helpful. And as my follow-up, any update on your self-cleaning etch offering? I'd love to hear about the Kiyo module coupled with Corvus. Anything you can share with us would be great. Tim Archer : Okay. Well, I'm not sure I can share with you other than it continues to progress in the marketplace. It's again, when I talked about semi-critical applications, where customers are really focused on trying to optimize the productivity of existing fabs. And one element to productivity of fab is how often you have to actually have technicians or people going and doing maintenance on tools. And the Kiyo product with the Kiyo -- product with the Corvus Are, the self-maintaining tool is part of that answer. Now, obviously, there's not a lot of spending going on in some of those segments, but we feel this is another example of where we've introduced the right product that one spending recovers in the Memory market, they should be perfectly targeted to the types of tools that customers want to put in to all those new fabs they're building right now. Thanks C.J. Operator : We'll go next to Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Krish Sankar : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Tim, one of the things I've been hearing is that actually go to higher and higher layers in 3D NAND, the process time for etch keeps going up. Is there a way to quantify in either absolute minutes or relative to prior nodes, what kind of increase in process times are we talking about, and what does it mean for Lam? Tim Archer : Okay. Well, I don't think that we're going to quantify that because it's kind of a competitive piece of information that would -- we wouldn't want to divulge here, but it does, I mean, to your point it takes a longer time to etch higher aspect ratio features, and I think that it's relatively well known that that increase is non-linear with the number of layers, meaning, the etch becomes longer non-linearly with the number of layers that are being created. And that's simply due to the etch process physics themselves, physics and chemistry. And so more layers has a positive impact on -- for Lam on the number of etch tools that are required to accomplish that etch. Now what I would say is that there's a constant battle, I mean, to keep the cost of ownership reasonable for customers, we're continuously working on productivity of every etch we deliver to the customer, including critical etches like the whole -- the 3D whole etch. So not prepared to quantify today, but it is a positive grower for us. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Okay. And then as a follow-up Tim. When you start gaining more share refocus more on the semi-critical etch applications how should we think about the margin structure, because it seems like productivity is key in this segment. Is productivity a euphemism for lower price, or just trying to figure out how to think about margins and you get more share in semi-critical etch? Tim Archer : No. Definitely in my mind, it's not a euphemism for lower price. Productivity is in many ways is much of a technology challenges as any other. And so we're attacking productivity, we are attacking it fundamentally from equipment and hardware and process design in a way that we deliver increased productivity with the cost structure of the tool that allows us to deliver corporate average gross margins for those applications. That's our expectation. And so that sometimes takes time and will require us in many cases to think long and hard about how our tools are designed, but that is the expectation that I have for winning in that space. Krish Sankar : Thanks Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Krish. Operator : We'll take our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Weston Twigg : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to probe a little bit about your comments on 2020. You said you think it's shaping up to be an up year, but I was wondering if you could just walk us a little bit through the puts and takes maybe both in Memory and Foundry what it would take be an up year? And sort of what your expectations are regarding those? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, West. Too soon for us to get into specifics on this. Really the commentary around setting up for a better year next year, it's all about Memory recovering in terms of investment levels. We'll give you more color on it when we get a little closer to next year, and I'm sure a lot's going to move around in there. But as we sit here today and look at the level of investment occurring in Memory and the growth rates of bits exiting the year and whatnot, we believe the level of investment there needs to go up next year and that's the nature of the comments. Weston Twigg : That makes sense. I guess related to you talked about some new wins and focusing on market share gains and SAM expansion, some of the Syndion line today, can you help us maybe put some numbers around what -- how much that could expand the opportunity in 2020? The revenue opportunity deal for you? Tim Archer : Well, I think maybe kind of no, but you should come back to the -- but you we're getting closer and closer to our market share targets that we put out for 2021. So I guess you can think of these as we've come out and we have said that we would gain four to eight points of share within etch and four to eight points within deposition by 2021. That was our last stated set of objectives. And when you think about progress we already made in our share positioning critical that's where you move to semi-critical and you say a fair bit of that share gain four to eight points is going to come from those types of wins. That's why what we wanted to highlight today that we feel we're just at the start of making some of the progress towards that type of share gain. Weston Twigg : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks West. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the strength in the indigenous China spending. How does that break down between Foundry DRAM, NAND and just generally your view on the sustainability of that spending into next year? Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Joe, we described in the past view that plus or minus there's investment levels of $5 billion from indigenous China relative to WFE this year. As we look at it now, a little bit stronger than that quite honestly. The strength is coming from Memory primarily. And I think you know what's going on. There's several Foundry customers there the big one is SMIC. They continue to be a very important customer for us. You got YMTC investing in NAND and then emerging DRAM investments. The uptick relative to prior communication I think it's been primarily related to Memory both a little bit of NAND a little bit of DRAM. Joe Moore : And the majority of the output that they're getting from that spending I mean is that something where you could see more kind of a larger capacity as we move forward, or is it more pilots and kind of getting things figured out? Doug Bettinger : Yes. I mean, Joe, I think they're going to continue to keep innovating on the technology, they're going to keep getting better and better at what they do and it wouldn't surprise me if they can continue to invest at higher levels as we go forward. I'm not ready going to quantify it for you, but they're working very, very diligently on innovating the technology. Joe Moore : Very helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Thanks, Joe. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. I wanted to also ask about China. So sales were up 20% in the last fiscal year, non-China was down about that number. How do you measure utilization at your customers? Because their purchasing has gone up right around the time when trade tensions have increased. So is there a risk that there have been pull-ins and this becomes an issue later on? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Vivek when I look at it, I don't think there's significant pull-ins occurring in what we're seeing happening. And I say that because we sort of knew our customers' plans as the year began. And when I look at it for the most part, they're executing to those plans. It's also important I think to understand that a lot of the investment in China is not indigenous Chinese customers, right? You've got the Koreans building fabs, Taiwanese, U.S. companies. So understand that a broad swathe of the spending in China isn't necessarily the indigenous Chinese customers. That's generally how I see that. Vivek Arya : Okay. And then for my follow-up Doug, on gross margins, you are guiding to 45%. And I know you mentioned a few times that mix changes from quarter-to-quarter. What in the mix is driving gross margins lower? Because when I look at the revenue level, it's kind of back to where it was in March 2017. But at that time gross margins were higher. But I recall at that time Foundry, Logic was a lower part of the mix. So is it Foundry, Logic that has an impact on gross margin? And I think you also alluded to the fact that you do expect to continue to grow in Foundry, Logic. So just how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins over the next several quarters? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Vivek, I wouldn't assume or you shouldn't assume there's differential gross margin by end of market necessarily meaning Foundry to Logic to Memory. That's not the way it works. Generally, there are -- it's what I always say that the larger customers, because they're buying more may tend to get a little bit better pricing simply because they're buying more from us relative to discounts sometimes. Not always, but obviously when you look at revenue down the way it is that's probably one of the bigger contributors right now. And Tim, would you want to... Tim Archer : Yes, no. I think there's a -- you referenced back to a point in 2017. We look at those all the time to think about what's different in our business. And what you have to look at is that as we transition through 2017, it was a massive growth cycle for us. And while we have a very flexible operating model, some of the physical infrastructure that we have to put in place to meet a $3 billion quarterly revenue run rate some of that physical capacity has not been taken offline and it does affect gross margin to some degree. We are confident that that kind of physical capacity is what's needed to be able to respond when our customers do ramp as Memory spending recovers. So flexible operating model Doug talked about temporary workforce, but in some cases there were costs put in which are still with us. Doug, I don't know if you have... Doug Bettinger : Yes. No perfect. Vivek Arya : Great. Pretty helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Tim, maybe to follow-up from your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the new emerging technologies such as gate-all-around and the industry transition in DRAM to 1Z and 1A. On the gate-all-around given that it's a similar format to FinFET, are there any capital intensity increases for etch and deposition that would benefit you guys when the industry makes that [ship] because you guys clearly benefitted from the transition of FinFET? Tim Archer : Yes. I think that I mean what I was trying to message is that at almost every node our customers, the industry has realized that 3D scaling is a key part of the answer both to device performance as well as cost scaling. And for us 3D scaling really means etch and deposition intensity tends to increase. Obviously we're still a little ways away, I mean we're highly engaged with 3-nanometer but final decisions ultimately get made relative to structures and architectures in the future. But it's really a message around etch and dep intensity to create 3D architectures. It's also why I pointed out in case it was missed the 3D architecture that's emerging in the heterogeneous integration or advanced packaging space, which again is 3D chip stacking and how Lam's etch and deposition will play a role in that. So what I was trying to just translate it I believe that 3D and etch and dep intensity kind of is fanning out across all device types in the future. Patrick Ho : Great. And my follow-up question for Doug in terms of the installed base business that's probably providing you a lot of support this year, given the pressures on the systems business. Can you give a little color if you're seeing a lot of upgrade business for I guess the trailing etch, fabs that are trying to upgrade improve their productivity, is that a key driver to the installed base business, and the strength that you're likely seeing this year? Doug Bettinger : That's certainly a piece of it. In fact last quarter, record level for our Reliant business, which is our refurbished equipment. So the answer Patrick is yes. Patrick Ho : Thanks so much. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : All right thank you. I've got two questions on the Memory side. You talk about NAND to supply growth rate exiting this year at about 30%. Can you give us a sense how you think the CapEx or the equipment spend needed to support say, every one percentage point of this supply growth from the current \u201cconversion-only\u201d trough? And can you do the same for DRAM? I guess we have -- you have given us the estimated cost for greenfield fabs before but just trying to put those pieces of information together. Doug Bettinger : Yeah Sidney. No, I don't think we've quantified this in the past. And I don't think we're ready to on the call right now. So I'm going to decline to answer the question. Sidney Ho : Okay. I'll move on to next one. If I take your reported revenue by end market and compare to what we think the WFE dollars for the various segments I can see that your share has been moving up steadily across all the different segments in recent years. But the one that stood out to me is NAND, which gets to be pretty high just take your revenue number that's probably including services and divide it by WFE, you get to somewhere around 40% from call it 20%, 25% a few years ago. Do you think that number could go higher as the market transitions to higher layer count? I guess, this question is whether it's sustainable? Tim Archer : Well, I guess as -- what we've said is that etch and deposition are really key to continued scaling in 3D NAND and so etch and deposition intensity scales with number of layers. So from that perspective measuring share of the customer's total spend on 3D NAND, it will -- we do believe it can and will go higher. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. Thanks. Tim Archer : Thanks. Tina Correia : Operator, I think we have time for one more question please. Operator : Yes, ma\u2019am. We'll take our final question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves : Hi guys. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just have one extra one on focusing on the share gain potential here. So I don't expect you guys to know exactly what happened to Japan and Korea, but if you look at the etch and deposition tools you guys sell, where do you guys think you had the most opportunity to gain share against Tokyo Electron? Tim Archer : I'm not going to get specific but okay. Well, this is -- look and this is also why I talk about the importance of performing really well in the semi-critical space. Critical applications that the reason we like them is they're hard to win and it takes often a generation or two to sort of prove yourself out. Those are less likely to switch due to some short-term event. Semi-critical or less critical applications are much more driven by can you accomplish that task at a certain targeted productivity point? So I think that there are a number of applications that we would be targeting where we're highly capable of doing those. And if the customer is motivated to give Lam a try, we're motivated to jump in there and show what we can do. Mitch Steves : Got it. And just one real quick high level one. I don't know the exact math off the top of my head, but roughly speaking from the last downturn you guys have seen, do you guys see anything irregular in terms of buying patterns? Suggest that people are buying ahead, or buying additional equipment than normal down cycle, or do you think this is essentially a normal semi cap cycle that you see in the past? Tim Archer : No. Nothing from my perspective that's out of the ordinary. In fact that was why I kind of started my comments with. For the most part, given some different puts and takes the year's playing out not that differently than we had originally thought from the standpoint of moving through a down cycle in Memory. Mitch Steves : Perfect. Thank you. Tim Archer : Yeah, thank you. Doug Bettinger : So, operator, I think that's the end of the call. If you want to sign us off. Tina Correia : Thank you, everyone, for joining. Operator : Yes, certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. Tina Correia : Thank you, operator. Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the September 2019 quarter and our outlook for the December 2019 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 P.M. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosures of our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 P.M. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that, let me hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tina, and welcome everyone. In the September quarter, Lam delivered solid results. Our continued execution to commitments, combined with our guidance for the December quarter increases our conviction that Lam is in a strong position to outperform as wafer fabrication equipment spending inflects higher. Doug will cover the financial results in more detail shortly, but I\u2019m especially pleased with the demonstrated earnings power of the Company. At the midpoint of our December guide, calendar year 2019 diluted earnings per share will be the second highest in our history despite the current industry cycle. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and partners for their continued support of Lam and our employees throughout the world for their contributions to these results. From an industry perspective, we have revised upward our view on 2019 WFE to the mid $40 billion range versus our prior estimate of down mid-to-high teens percentage year on year, which implied a low $40 billion level of spending. We are beginning to see improvement in the memory market, led first by NAND. NAND\u2019s demand dynamics are improving and oversupply conditions should continue to abate as we move through the December quarter. We expect to exit 2019 with a bit supply growth rate for NAND of approximately 30%, which is well below our view on long-term demand; and as a result, NAND inventories are expected to decline to normalized levels in the first half of calendar 2020. While the timing of the memory equipment spending recovery is always hard to predict, we are encouraged that customers continue to manage supply growth even as we are starting to see favorable end-market demand indicators. This is a sign of a healthy industry and a good setup for increased NAND spending in 2020. On the DRAM front, inventories have remain elevated, and we do not expect them to reach normalized levels until the second half of 2020. However, we see positive demand catalyst ahead in both the server and smartphone markets. Our server CPU upgrade cycle is expected to begin next year with increased adoption of new generation platforms from leading manufacturers. For smartphones, major vendors are planning to launch additional 5G models which is expected to drive content growth for the overall smartphone market in 2020. Turning to foundry and logic, spending in this segment has been strong throughout 2019 and based on recent customer commentary, looks to remain so heading into next year. Diverse end market applications are driving higher levels of foundry and logic spending, moreover, challenges in scaling functional block such as SRAM and logic devices are leading to increases in die sizes and these in turn are accelerating changes in device architectures and chip manufacturing technologies. Lam's growing position with key foundry and logic customers has positioned us to incrementally benefit from these secular trends. Competitively, we are executing at a high level. Based on the midpoint of our December guidance, Lam's 2019 foundry and logic revenues are set to significantly outgrow announced customer CapEx plans. The share gains we are now seeing in the foundry and logic segment are the result of close customer collaboration and strong product execution over many years and multiple technology transitions. They are evidence of the benefit of sustained investment in R&D throughout industry cycles. Looking at the market as a whole including memory, foundry, and logic, we are on track in 2019 to deliver our best ever penetration and defense performance, as measured by net forward-looking, three-year revenue opportunity for application decisions made in this calendar year. A key contributor to our strong penetration and defense performance has been continued focus on technologies that enable 3D device architectures, which are becoming increasingly important to performance and cost scaling across all market segments. We invested early in 2D to 3D inflections; and as these transitions are occurring, we are seeing expansion in both our SAM and market share. Etch and deposition processes are critical enablers for 3D scaling, and we are investing aggressively to deliver the technology and productivity innovation required to satisfy customer roadmaps. As evidenced by our penetration and defense wins this year, we believe we are extending Lam's leadership in this space. In 3D NAND, we're successfully defended 100% of our memory whole dielectric etch positions and continue to be the supplier for this application at all 3D NAND manufacturers. We are also winning 3D NAND applications where productivity is the primary point of differentiation. Notably, Lam has been the first to deliver production proven edge-yield solutions for etch. In this quarter, we used our Corvus tunable edge hardware on our flex dielectric etch system to improve profile tilt uniformity and win an important productivity sensitive slit etch application. On the conductor etch front, we won a 3D NAND application for a new vertical architecture that reduces die size and is a technical solution for lowering bit cost. In deposition, we recorded an important 3D NAND win for the VECTOR DT, which deposits backside films to control stress as layer counts increase. Another significant deposition win was for our Striker ALD tool used to deposit high quality liners and gapfill as aspect ratios get higher. We also continue to extend our 3D expertise and position outside of the 3D NAND space, including in rapidly growing markets such as advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration. Over the last three years, the installed base for our SABRE 3D electroplating system has grown by more than 70%, and we are the leading electroplating supplier for TSV, for DRAM, CMOS image sensor, and logic devices. Our SABRE 3D electroplating solutions embed best-in-class technology backed by years of high-volume production experience. With each successive win across our served markets, the installed base of Lam equipment continues to grow, resulting in an expanding long-term revenue opportunity for our customer support business. To create value for customers over the entire lifecycle of tool ownership, we are actively developing upgrades and advanced services targeted at extending technical capability and increasing productivity from existing installed base assets. These offerings help our customers reduce their total cost; and as a result, we continue to see growing demand. Revenues from our customer support business grew in the September quarter on a sequential basis and our Reliant business achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row. We expect 2019 overall will be another growth year for our customer support business. Looking at our year-to-date performance, we have made tremendous progress against our objectives of expanding our SAM, increasing our market share, and building our installed base business. Importantly, 2019 has been a year where Lam has strengthened its position in the foundry and logic segment. Also, with early indications of improving NAND demand and positive catalyst on the horizon for DRAM, we are increasingly optimistic the calendar year 2020 is setting up to be a year of outperformance for Lam as spending mix moves back in our favor. Thanks again for joining today and now here's Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay, great. Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today on what I know is a busy earnings season. We're pleased with Lam's performance in the September quarter. Our results once again exceeded the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics. Operating income and diluted earnings per share came in at the high-end of our guidance range as we remain prudent in managing our spending throughout the quarter. Let me begin as I always do by talking about our revenue segmentation in the September quarter. The combined memory segment was flat with the June quarter at 64% of total systems revenue. We had a decrease in the September quarter in the nonvolatile memory segment, moving from 46% to 38%, while DRAM increased from 26% from 18% of assistant revenue. Spending in the NAND segment was focused on multiple nodes and we're beginning to see the first ramp of 128 layer structures. On the DRAM side, apart from the 1x and 1y nodes, we're seeing initial investments at 1z. As I noted on our last quarter earnings call, foundry and logic spending was strong and we expect strength from this segment to continue to the remainder of the calendar year. The foundry segment represented 25% of our systems revenue in the quarter. Strength in this segment is related to spending on the 7 and 5 nanometer nodes. Logic another segment was down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 11% of system revenue. We continue to demonstrate strong progress in the foundry and logic segments, enabling us to maintain solid profitability levels during a period of depressed memory spending. I believe probably foundry logic spending will be even stronger in December. Revenues for the quarter came in at $2,166 million which was again above the midpoint of guidance. Our revenue had a slightly broader geographic mix in the September quarter, compared to the June quarter. Our top reasons continue to be China, Korea and Taiwan. The China region quarter performance remains higher than our historic average concentration of revenue. And similar to what I talked about last quarter, the majority of this came from indigenous Chinese customers across multiple segments. Gross margin came in at 45.4% which was 40 basis points above the midpoint, mainly due to customer mix. And as we stated in prior quarters, you should expect gross margins to be a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration, and we expect to see variability quarter to quarter. We continued manager spending levels in the Company as operating expenses in the September quarter declined to $431 million which was down from $450 million in previous quarter. We remain laser focused on investing in research and development programs, as we saw the percentage of spending and R&D increased quarter-over-quarter to 67% of operating expenses. The December quarter the guidance reflects total spending, increasing back to the June level, primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense. A variable compensation fluctuates based on the level of quarterly profitability. I'm going to also remind you that as we look ahead to the 2020 calendar year, you will see the normal seasonal spending increases related to the March quarter, comes from things like payroll taxes. Operating income in the September quarter was $552 million and operating margin was 25.5%, at the top of our guidance range. Our September quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 11% which was slightly lower than our long term rate. There will be fluctuations in the rate from quarter to quarter and we now expect our long term rate to be in the low teens level. Other income and expense was a total of approximately $11 million in expense in the September quarter. The main components of other income and expense our interest income from the cash and investment balances we hold, offset by expense related to our outstanding debt. The total interest expense and all tranches of our debt is right now about $41 million per quarter. You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, based on several market related items such as; our deferred compensation assets, venture capital investments and foreign exchange. We continue to execute on our capital return program during the September quarter. We allocated $234 million to capital return in the quarter with $75 million related to open market share repurchases and $159 million in dividends. I would like to remind you that we continue to have an ongoing structured repurchase program that is expected to mature in the December quarter. This will continue to reduce our share count. We remain on track with our committed capital return. We currently have approximately $3 billion remaining in our Board authorized share repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share came in at $3.18, which was at the high end of the guidance range that we provided for September. We ended the September quarter with diluted shares for earnings per share at approximately 151 million shares, which is the seventh consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. Let me now switch to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased slightly in the September quarter to $5.8 billion from $5.7 billion in the June quarter. Cash flows from operations were $464 million, which was offset by share repurchase and dividends. Year-to-date in calendar year 2019, we have had strong cash from operations performance and we're on track to end this year with the second highest level of free cash flows in the Company's history. DSO increased to 69 days versus 56 in the prior quarter. The DSO increase is related to the timing of customer payments occurring at the end of the September calendar month, which falls within our December fiscal quarter. Our inventory balance declined sequentially by $57 million, which is the fifth consecutive quarter where inventory balance decline. Inventory turns were 3.2 turns, which was just a little bit less than the 3.3 turns that we saw in the June quarter. Non-cash expenses included approximately $43 million for equity compensation, $49 million for depreciation and $16 million for amortization. September quarter capital expenditures came in at $39 million, which was a decrease from $66 million in the June quarter. Our September quarter-end headcount was flat with the prior quarter at approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees. So now looking ahead I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2019 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2,500 million, plus or minus $150 million. Gross margin of 45% plus or minus 1 percentage point, operating margins of 27% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.80 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 150 million shares. I'm pleased to share with you the results we've delivered throughout calendar year 2019 and what has been a challenging industry environment. As Tim noted the supply demand environment is improving for the memory segments and we've made good progress in our foundry and logic positioning. Our installed base business continues to be on track to deliver a growth year in 2019. We're well positioned heading into 2020 and are optimistic about our future performance going forward. Finally, I'd like to announce our plans to host an Investor Day on March 3rd, 2020 in New York City. Details on the venue and precise time will be forthcoming. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Question on the WFE, Tim, you mentioned WFE going from low $40 billion to mid $40 billion. I wanted to understand if the majority of the increase has come from the foundry/logic segment in terms of the revised outlook? Tim Archer : Maybe a few modifications, I mean, clearly, as we've said, we've continued to see strengthening in foundry and logic. So that is a portion of it. The -- some very early indications of NAND spending increase as we have now guided for December quarter. And finally, continuing strengthening in the China WFE as we've, kind of, seen increased strength throughout the year. So a combination of all those things, lead to our upward revision in WFE. Atif Malik : Okay. And then a follow-up in your prepared remarks, you mentioned foundry/logic share gains above foundry/logic CapEx this year. How should we think about the outperformance of your foundry/logic business into next year and out given there\u2019s some of the elements like reuse and growing EUV steps? Tim Archer : Well, that's a great question, we basically -- as we have said on a number of occasions, the intensity of etch and deposition we see continuing to increase at every technology node. Our SAM grows, whether it'd be 10 to seven to five to three on into the future. SAM increases even in the face of EUV increased usage. And there's a number of reasons for that; patterning complexity continues to increase regardless of the introduction of EUV, and so there are additional steps for deposition and etch. EUV itself introduces new requirements for hardmask, which gives Lam opportunity to participate from a deposition perspective. And EUV also, we have talked about in the past introduces opportunities for new steps like and processes like atomic layer etching that can be used to help increase quality and productivity of the EUV pattern itself. So, I think the way you should think about it is our SAM is expanding, competitively our -- we're gaining share at some of these new layers, and we feel we're well setup in both the foundry and logic space going forward as technology transitions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, if we look back through to 2018, it looks like your share of wallet for WFE with NAND is roughly 30%. So curious as you think about moving to a rising layer count and your leadership in the high aspect ratio etch, and the just announced deposition wins on the call tonight, how should we think about your share of wallet as we go to 128 layer and above into 2020? Tim Archer : Our SAM as a percentage of customer spend continues to increase with layer count, and that's for two reasons; one, I mean obviously the simple fact of building and etching the higher stack, but also the fact that, as I mentioned there are new steps and new opportunities that get created for dealing with issues such as; in the VECTOR DT case the stress associated with those taller layer counts. So, I think that our view is SAM grows as layer count increases. C.J. Muse: Thanks, Tim. And I guess as a follow up, Doug, I'm not sure if you spoke to the entirety of installed base revenues, but did they grow sequentially in September? And how should we think about the trend? Or what should we kind of model it to into 2020? Doug Bettinger : Yes. C.J., I think, Tim, actually mentioned in his prepared remarks that they did grow sequentially and it was the third consecutive record quarter for the Reliant component of that business. I'm not going to quantify next year yet, a little bit too soon. But what we said in the past and I can continue to be very comfortable saying today is, I have a hard time envisioning a year when the installed base business doesn't grow, it should grow every single year because chamber count grows every year, it's growing this year, even in a depressed memory spending environment, and we continue to bring new advanced service offerings to market that we hope enable us to achieve more and more of the customer's OpEx spend. So that's how you should be thinking about that C.J. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : This is the second quarter in a row of the heavier China domestic mix. Do you guys anticipate this bias to continue into the December quarter and into next year and similar to my question last time? Is this in your view a focused effort by China to accelerate their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, given the trade tensions with the U.S. or more your China customers just having more confidence to move forward with their early memory and foundry programs? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Harlan, what I\u2019ve tried to describe in fact, I tried to foreshadow it last quarter in earnings that this is above normal run rate of local Chinese customers spend. But Tim did point out in his remarks that some of the strengthening in WFE came from local China, probably now and nominally somewhat about $6 billion in WFE. And as we look into next year, we absolutely think it will grow again next year, but it will ebb and flow, it will -- these big projects can be lumpy at times, and it will go up and it will go down depending on when equipment ships into any one fab project. Tim, do you want to add anything? Tim Archer : Yes, I think that -- as I commented, we've seen strengthening in domestic China spend through the year, anticipate that continuing and maybe the most important part of that story for Lam is that clearly a big portion of the new incremental spending in China is targeted toward the memory market. And obviously our SAM, and our share in the memory space is quite good, so from that perspective we see China as an area of strength for us. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Harlan, I forgot the one part of your question you asked, do we think anything pulled in? Actually really don't, I don't think it would make sense that they would be pulling things in sooner and because if you're concerned about our inability to ship being the reason they pulled in, then they can get spares and service from us, they can't actually really utilize the tools very well. So I don't believe that there was pull-ons really do anything like that. Harlan Sur : Great, thank you. Thank you for the insights there. And the team continues its strong design win momentum on non-critical and/or legacy technology node. As part of it, as you pointed out is the Reliant systems products continue to do well. We continue to hear from your customers that they're laser focused on productivity throughput, uptime, footprint all of the things that impact overall wafer costs. Are you guys now in a position to at least give us some sense on how fast the non-critical/refurbished business systems -- business is growing? And roughly the size of this business relative to your total revenue base? Tim Archer : Maybe you have to wait till Investor Day for that. No, we do plan -- we do -- we have promised for some time now to provide you more detail in those areas and we're just, we will do that. I think maybe a couple of points, your comment about customers being laser focused on productivity? I mean, it's one of the reasons why we have been talking about it, it takes some time for those products for our efforts to really start to show up in new wins. But you know we're starting to see in this area that Doug talked about in advanced services, where some of these intelligent database tools are really starting to help us reduce, for instance troubleshooting time on the systems, reduced unscheduled downs on the systems and those are things that the customers are pulling hard for because again it's productivity for tools that are already in place and relatively easy to implement. So we are prioritizing productivity, because it's in the best interest of the customer and the industry as a whole. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear now from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks, let me ask the question. Congratulations on the strong results. Tim, I just want to go back to the market opportunity in logic/foundry for you. If you kind of look at calendar year-to-date that business combined for you was up somewhere between 30% to 40% year-over-year? I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of how we think about your market position, maybe in North America as we see 14 go to 10 go to seven and maybe in Taiwan as we see seven go to five go to three, can you talk a little bit about how much visibility you have on product tool of record on some of these critical etch and deposition steps? And how we might think about your share opportunity as we migrate down these nodes? Tim Archer : Sure, I can do that without quite getting as specific as North America, Taiwan on those notes. So maybe I'll point you just a couple of comments, I made and then embellish there was a little bit, you know, as I said it within the logic and foundry space, it takes many years to establish yourself as the first -- the development tool of record. And then ultimately see that rollout into volume buys is the production tool of record. And so when we talk about I gave -- we gave a little bit of a new look into this penetration and defense. Forward-looking three-year revenue opportunity statement, that is designed to give some indication as to how long it takes from the time we win one of those selection decisions and you'll see that revenue opportunity will take place over those following three years, that's definitely true in the foundry and logic space. And so I think that when we talk about improving opportunity at 10 and then seven and then five, you know, you can kind of look out and say, if you're like a 5-nanometer decision is revenue opportunities that now we're roll in over the course of the next several years. So that may not be quite the level of specificity you wanted, but it basically says things that we are winning now will actually be our revenue for the next three years plus in that space. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then, Doug, you mentioned in your prepared comments, you still have about $3 billion left on the buyback, and I apologize in capital allocation call, but this most recent quarter, the buybacks dipped down a little bit, which I guess is understandable, just given the level of uncertainty. Any color you can give us around the pace at which you might want to try to execute buybacks going forward? And how we should think about, kind of, just remind us again the cash return policy you're trying to hit? Doug Bettinger : Yes, John, I mean, one thing I would point out to you and if you look over the last two years, you will have seen several quarters where the cash we actually deployed moved down somewhat. That was because in the quarter before that we put one of these accelerated share repurchase programs in place. You have the same phenomenon going on this quarter. So even though the cash that we deployed in terms of open market repurchases wasn't all that significant this quarter, that ASR was still executing buying stock back, and that ASR that's currently out there will complete in the December quarter. So we'll be thinking about what we're going to do incrementally as we go forward. So far, just remind you what we talked about and it's been a while now the last Analyst Day that we're committed to at least 50% of free cash flow returned to shareholders, and obviously if you look at our history, over the last five, six years, we've done a whole lot more than that. And I had went on the timing to complete the current authorization and I'm going to kind of remain that way. I've said in the past, we'll be opportunistic and that's as much as I have quite right now. Operator : Thank you, we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I guess my first question, Doug is can you help us a little bit with the mix in December. I'm curious, if the uptick in revenue is going to be more on the NAND side and more on the foundry side? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, what I said, Tim in my remarks, was I expect December will continue to be pretty strong with foundry and logic quarter. So that's a key piece of what's going on. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, awesome. And then I just wanted to -- I just wanted to drill down a little bit into the China piece. So China is about 25% of your revenues now on the trailing 12-month basis. So I guess, I'm curious how much of this is going into indigenous projects versus the multinationals. Because I thought you said China was about $5 billion of 2018 WFE, and I think at that time, you were talking about $3 billion of that $5 billion being domestic China. And I think you just said that China is going to be over $6 this year. So, can you sort of like level set us on how much of that $6 this year will be multi-versus domestic and maybe how much domestic can even grow next year? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, let me walk it back for you a little, Tim, because some things have moved around a little bit. When I look at what happened last year, local China ended up being I don't know $4.5 billion of WFE roughly. So it ended up being maybe a little bit more than that for that we have been talking about and the way we see it today, it's above $6, it's somewhat above $6. I don't know for sure what next year is going to look like. But as we look at our analytics in the fab projects that are coming in and whatnot, I do see pretty strongly believe it will grow next year. I'm not ready to tell you how much yet. We'll give you more clarity on our WFE view for next year on the next earnings call. But I think local China will continue to grow next year. Timothy Arcuri : And, Doug just to clarify those numbers are local China numbers right? Doug Bettinger : That's right, Tim. Yes. Operator : Thank you. We'll take the next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Tim, you talked about early signs of a recovery in NAND in your prepared remarks. And Doug, you just mentioned that most of the growth or at least implicitly, I think you commented that most of the growth in December quarter should be coming from foundry and logic? So should we expect some of the NAND projects that we're all collectively hearing about should hit the March quarter from a rev rec perspective? Tim Archer : Yes, it's maybe there is not such a big change here from what we've said. We -- you know, ever since beginning of the year, we said that memory spending would likely remain relatively weak throughout the year. And when I talked about early signs, it is the -- it's very early is in there, we're now starting to see some of those projects transpire as you just talked about, meaning a little bit of ordering occurring in the December quarter, but we still maintain our view that we exit the year with this 30% bit supply growth rate and that customers are prudently managing the supply growth, but I do think those projects, you know, it's kind of that early signs, it's a healthy industry and we're going to see growth in 2020. So exact timing, we really don't want to give you that right now, but it's -- it looks to be coming. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to hit the logic and foundry opportunity dynamic into 2020. Obviously, you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years and gaining share in both buckets. If we assume that spending in logic and foundry is largely flat in 2020, and if you assume EUV adoption continues to grow. Based on what you guys know from a design win or application win perspective, can you still grow logic and foundry revenues in that sort of environment backdrop? Thanks. Tim Archer : Yes, it's a great question and the answer is yes, we would expect to grow in that scenario, based on a couple of things; one, as you move forward, even on the same WFE, our SAM as a percent of that WFE should increase as transition still continued to occur to more advanced nodes. Etch and deposition opportunity increases at each successive technology node, even in the face of EUV. So I think in the scenario described, we would expect to have a larger opportunity and we do believe that we're winning share as well and therefore we would grow. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear now from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them; first one for either Tim or Doug. More a industry focused question you spoke about how NAND bit growth exiting this year is going to be 30%, kind of, curious like ask your customers start ramping 128 layer NAND, if next year demand bit growth is below 30%. Do you still expect the 120 layers spending to go through next year, because it's more strategic, low cost in nature? Or do you think it might get throttle back if demand bit growth is slower? Doug Bettinger : Maybe I'll take and then Tim you can add-on. I mean, Krish what -- one I don't think that's what's going to happen. But we're that to be what happened, I think you would see a year that looked something like this year in that most of the industry spending was allocated to node conversions as opposed to new capacity adds, because that lowers cost per bit, the economics are better and all of that. The other thing I would say, and then I'll let Tim add-on. When we look into early next year, I believe supply growth rate will continue to decline based on the investment set have occurred this year, right? Because they have reduced this year and so you're moving into a declining rate of growth, as we look into the first half of next year. Tim, anything you want to add? Tim Archer : Yes, I think just to reiterate Doug's point, I mean, technology transitions we think occur every year, simply because of the benefit to bit cost. And so, I guess, I would say that in any year, which is not our view of declining supply growth we would still see the majority of the spend in technology transitions. And I guess there is one other key point to think about, we've mentioned this a few times in a technology transition from say 96 layers to 128 layers, the majority of that spend is for etch and deposition. So there's definitely an outperformance statement there, if spend continues to be based just on technology transitions. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, I think, Tim in your prepared comments you spoke about how you guys are successfully defended 100% dielectric etch market share. I'm kind of curious on the NAND side, is that a fair enough statement, if you look past 128 layer higher than 128 layer DTOR tools or is it more up to 128 layers? Tim Archer : Well, in our statement is always as those decisions are made. So we always speak about accomplishing made. So I don't know if any decisions have been made well beyond the 128 layer node. So we -- it's obviously something that we compete for it every node. But, I guess what I'd point out is there is a very important piece of learning that has come from us running now millions of wafers through our dielectric etch tools. And there was a question earlier about, productivity, reliability, stability, defect performance. Those are all things that again we have millions and millions of wafers of experience. And so kind of come in with an edge every node that you have to compete for as the incumbent. So that -- but specifically, I think, you could bucket most of those in that 128 nanometer and below node since their decisions already made. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. And also congrats on a really nice quarter, maybe, Tim, first, a lot of the market questions have been answered on my end. But as you look at next generation memory technologies like MRAM, ReRAM. Can you just give a -- maybe a qualitative view of how Lam is positioning itself to capitalize on those next generation opportunities? Tim Archer : Yes, I guess maybe the simpler statement that I make inside the Company is we're not running from our leadership position in memory, and that includes in these new emerging memory markets. And so we're actively looking to develop new applications, new tools that meet the needs of those devices. We've spoken about, one of them in particular so far this year, which is the ion beam edge tool, that's used for MRAM and we have established a very strong position for that particular application, phase-change memory ReRAM, there are other devices we are actively engaged in development with the leading companies. So it is a target market for us, in fact, one might argue that we feel we, sort of, we already sort of own that memory space and I think it's our focus. Doug Bettinger : It's Dough. Just to add-on, if you really want more detail you can go look at the transcript of the Flash Memory Summit, where Tim and Rick Gottscho spent lots of time talking about how we view these emerging memory architectures. Patrick Ho : Great. Thanks, Doug. And maybe as my follow-up question, you talked a little bit about your atomic layer deposition opportunity. I guess from a big picture perspective, how do you see the total available market for you in that? And do you see it expanding from where -- it looks like you have a strong position on the memory side of thing. Can this also expand onto the foundry/logic side of things? Tim Archer : So we'd already has expanded, I mean, ALD is not memory specific. So we use these films also on the logic and foundry side. ALD atomic layer etching and atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching, these are technologies that will continue to be increasingly used as devices become smaller and smaller and structures become more complex. So I think it's an expanding market opportunity, and in fact I think in coming years, you'll start to see inflections for instance from batch processing tools to single wafer ALD just again for the type of wafer uniformity and requirements of those processes going forward. So it's an area where we're growing and we feel confident about our development activities in the tools themselves. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear now from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Craig Ellis : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I wanted to follow-up on the comments that you made that calendar '20 to be a year of outperformance for Lam. Can you just help us understand how much of that comes from moving deeper into the sweet spot of the foundry/logic share gain that you've been talking about versus help that you would get from what appears to be a nice and very encouraging upturn that's starting to occur in NAND or maybe something else like SAM expansion? Tim Archer : Yes, I think for us to give you more detail on the break out on that you'll have to wait until we actually speak to our 2020 WFE outlook next quarter. But you kind of hit it, I mean, we -- the way I think about outperformance in 2020, it's just what you said. First and foremost you -- everyone knows that we are highly leveraged to the memory market, and we do believe that spending mix moves back in our favor next year. And even in the face of stronger and continuing strength in logic and foundry memory will improve to some extent. We've strengthened our logic and foundry SAM opportunity, as well as share position and so that's a continued benefit as logic and foundry remain strong. And also as Doug mentioned CSBG continues to grow as we expand our portfolio of advanced services in that space. And so can break it out for you, how much each of those contributes, but each of them is important part of the story in 2020. Craig Ellis : Thanks, Tim. And then I'll do the follow-up to Doug. Doug impressive trough-to-trough operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points. And within that there is dramatic improvement with operating expense as a percentage of sales. And as you noted, there's been significant mix shift R&D. The question is how much further benefit is there in the model for increased operating leverage? And how much room do you have to further drive expense toward R&D from SG&A? Doug Bettinger : It's something we've been working on for years, I mean, Tim was driving those on years ago, honestly in rest of companies rally behind it. We're going to keep squeeze in efficiency out every SG&A dollar we spend. We want to be totally rigorous about that. So that we can allocate more of those dollars to R&D, I think that 60%, 70% last quarter might be an all-time high for the Company. I haven't gone all the way back, but in my recent memory that was an all-time high. We're going to keep at that, we're going to continue to try to get better, we do this every words part of the culture of the Company to be focused on continuous improvement. I don't know how we can get it obviously, but we're going to keep working on it. Operator : Thank you. We'll hear now from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. And I joined a little late, so I apologize if this was asked. But DRAM was quite strong in the quarter. And I'm wondering what caused that and how sustainable is that trend? Tim Archer : When I look at it, it's primarily conversion spending. That's really what we've seen for the entire year is focused on node conversions, it will ebb and flow. The important thing when you think about DRAM is to understand when we look at similar to what we were describing NAND exiting the year below where we believe demand growth to be, you got a similar story in DRAM. As we look at the investments that are occurring in DRAM this year exiting the year supply growth is probably in the low teens. And we believe long-term demand growth is in high teens maybe approaching 20%. There is a ways to go, Vivek to continue to burn inventory out of the channel. I think that's going to take a little bit longer. But what I do know is at some point the inventory will be burned off and spending will grow more significantly. In quarter-by-quarter, it's just going to be dependent on what projects are under way at what customers. Vivek Arya : Got it, very helpful. And then as a follow-up, kind of, looking at your cash flow generation, so fiscal '19 from what I noticed there was a lot of cash inflow from working capital that I'm looking at the model right. How should we think about the plus and minus from working capital this year? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : If you look at the first half of this year, Vivek -- calendar year again. I never really think too much in terms of fiscal calendar year. I mean we're -- cash was just super strong, I think we had two consecutive quarters around $900 million in operational cash flow and you're right. A lot of that came from working capital. Now what you normally see with the business when it's growing, it will consume working capital, meaning it will take cash to build inventory and receivables and so forth. When it levels off or contracts, it will generate cash and that's really what went on in the first half of the year. I mean, we managed cash quite proactively, but the practical reality of business ebb and flow was that's what happens. The right way to think about the free cash flow of the business is it's a couple of points below where operational cash flow should be on a sustainable basis. But it will ebb and flow around wherever read in the business cycle. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo. Joe Lachky : Yes, thanks for taking the question. You talked about improvements and inventory that you've seen across the NAND flash. I was wondering, if you could talk about, to the extent you can, factory utilization rates and your installed base? Tim Archer : It's hard for us actually to put our finger on exactly what utilizations are. I mean we saw it pulled back a little bit in both NAND and DRAM this year. And I think that was pretty well-telegraphed from our customers. But better -- it's a better question to put to them, we don't always know exactly what their utilizations are running at. Joe Lachky : Okay, fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up to that. You talked about exiting this year at 30% supply growth, I mean, for NAND and maybe and potentially going lower than that next year on the first part of the year. I guess, the question is how do we think about the level of capacity expansion needed to hit kind of the -- I guess, expected demand growth for 2020? Doug Bettinger : Tough question to answer Joe, to be honest. What's occurred this year and NAND largely has been conversions, maybe with a couple exceptions. But if you look at NAND, WFE through the year -- this year, but that's what was going on and you saw declining rate of supply growth such that as we exit the year obviously, we said 30% and I think long-term NAND growth is in the high '30s, maybe 40%. To have 40% supply growth, we need to be adding a few wafers every single year, and so it didn't happen quite so much this year and you've seen supply growth decline. I don't know if that helps you, but that's how I think about it. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I really had two and most of them have been answered. But from a high level, I mean, do you guys talking about kind of a better market for memory in 2020. So when do you think we'll see capacity upgrades or is this all going to be technology upgrades? And then secondly, you guys gave a lot of color on NAND, but not so much in DRAM. So based on the commentary about server demand and kind of an increase in Q1, does that mean you guys think that -- that's going to be kind of the bottom or do you think that exiting the year, we're going to start to see supply demand balance for DRAM? Tim Archer : Well, I think that what we've said about DRAM maybe just was that we think through the first half of next year. Inventory remains elevated and so it's really not, I guess our view at this point is DRAM maybe more of a second half story for next year. Obviously we'll give far more color as we develop our full 2020 outlook. It's just that NAND is much more upon us right now. Simply because the issues are being worked through more quickly as a result of the supply constraints that have been in place this year and maybe also the demand catalysts for NAND that are occurring right now. Mitch Steves : Got it. And is a capacity upgrades at what time in 2020 is that like back half or do you think capacity upgrades will begin earlier than that? Doug Bettinger : Mitch too soon for us to talk in any detail about 2020, hold off for one quarter we'll give you a little better visibility on it. It's still a little bit too far away for us to get into detail. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Correia for any additional or closing remarks. Tina Correia : Just wanted to thank you everyone for joining us today, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you and that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participants. You may now disconnect.",

A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our Web site. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tina, and welcome everyone. In the December quarter, Lam delivered revenues and diluted earnings per share above the midpoint of guidance, marking another quarter of solid execution and closing out a year of strong performance in calendar 2019. Consistent with our comments throughout this year, we enter 2020 with increasing momentum and an improved spending mix environment which we believe will lead to outperformance by Lam. I have now completed my first year as CEO of Lam Research and I am incredibly proud of what our people have achieved. Underpinning our strong financial results this past year has been a companywide focus on execution and an emphasis on our culture where all employees can perform their best. I want to thank Lam's employees across our global organization for their efforts and of course our partners and customers for their valued support. I also want to take a moment to address the coronavirus situation. Our concern first and foremost is with the health and well being of our employees, customers and partners and with this in mind we have implemented precautionary measures within our global business operations. Additionally, we are donating to Chinese relief efforts to support the people and communities impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Now turning to our business results. In calendar 2019, we generated solid operating cash flows and at the same time we invested a company record in research and development dollars to fuel technology innovation and product differentiation. Our EPS performance, the second best in the company's 40-year history, was especially noteworthy given that memory spending declined significantly year-over-year in 2019. The impact of lower memory spending was partially mitigated by record revenue from our customer support business group, highlighting the importance of our recurring spares and service opportunity to the overall quality of earnings of the company. In 2019, we also saw outstanding execution in our product organizations. We grew our revenue share of WFE spend in memory and foundry logic, and we laid the foundation for additional gains as we recorded our best ever performance in net penetration and defense application wins as measured by revenue potential over the next three years. We are winning by focusing on high-volume manufacturing solutions for emerging technology inflection challenges, including those associated with new scaling architectures, new memory technologies and new materials. We are capitalizing on the learning from our installed base of tools that today enables some of the industry's most critical etch and deposition applications. For example, for the three most critical applications in 3D NAND, our Strata, ALTUS and Flex tools each process well over 1 million wafers per month in high-volume manufacturing allowing us to partner early and in a unique way with our customers on next generation needs. In 2019, this led to the addition of new products to our portfolio such as the VECTOR DT which is designed to address wafer stress problems encountered during the high-volume production of 3D NAND stacks of 96 layers and above. Similarly, we enhanced the capabilities of our Corvus product family to improve device yield at the wafer edge by depositing and encapsulating layers for bevel protection. These products expand our served share of WFE spend, but just as importantly they exemplify our commitment to our customer success. In 2019, we improved to the number one or number two position at all of our largest customers that provide a competitive ranking of their suppliers based on detailed, quality, support and performance scorecards. In part, this improvement is due to our investment in productivity enhancing upgrades for our installed base. For instance, Corvus wafer edge solutions have become key differentiators for our conductor and dielectric etch systems in high-volume manufacturing and have been instrumental in helping our customers reduce cost of ownership. We announced in 2019 a Corvus-enabled self maintaining etch tool that ran for one year in high-volume manufacturing without human intervention. Multiple customers are now upgrading their installed base tools to include this high-value-added capability. In 2019, we highlighted heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging as new areas of opportunity to leverage our product portfolio in 3D learning to drive growth. In the December quarter, we built on our growing momentum in this space with additional wins for our SABRE 3D electroplating system at multiple advanced packaging customers. With these latest wins, we estimate that we have gained more than 15 points of market share in the last two years and we have firmly established ourselves as the technology leader in the increasingly important through-silicon via market. Another area of growth for the company has been in atomic layer deposition or ALD. Our ALD solutions are gaining significant traction in the market by delivering best-in-class film properties along with hyperactivity and low defects. Due to the inherent advantages of higher film quality and comparability, our Striker ALD oxide systems are replacing older process alternatives such as spin on dielectric and SA CVD for critical applications pulling more WFE spending into our served market. Similarly, RC scaling requirements are driving increased demand for our single wafer Striker carbide and ALTUS ALD metallization systems. When used for low-k carbide liner spacer applications, our Striker system has been able to achieve 30% better RC properties versus competing batch tools. The metallization we closed out 2019 on a high note with significant wins in logic/foundry for our ALTUS systems as customers look to replace the conventional barrier fill sequence with an integrated ALD approach to lower device resistance in a cost-effective way. Across all products, we exited 2019 with approximately 61,000 chambers in our installed base. Our installed base revenues grew year-over-year and reached record levels in 2019 with significant contribution from our Reliant business, which also reached record levels. Productivity upgrades and solutions grew more than 30% year-over-year as we have worked to help customers enhance the performance of their existing assets. Furthermore, we signed several new multiyear customer support contracts. These multiyear contracts enable Lam to significantly reduce customers running costs while generating a recurring revenue stream for Lam. Now turning to WFE. We estimate 2019 WFE ended in the $46 billion to $47 billion range, slightly higher than our prior mid $40 billion estimate. The increase was driven predominantly by higher foundry/logic spending. For calendar 2020, assuming no material impact from coronavirus on our full year outlook, our view calls for WFE spend in the mid-to-high $50 billion range supported by sustained strong spending in foundry and logic and significantly for Lam improved spending in memory led first by NAND. Overall, we expect spending in memory and foundry/logic segments to be up year-on-year in 2020. To wrap up, Lam delivered strong financial performance in calendar 2019. And as our March quarter guidance suggests, we are in a great position to drive higher in 2020 with the improvement in memory spending. Lam's product pipeline is very strong with more innovation on the way, and we look forward to sharing more with you at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. Thanks. And now here's Doug. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today in the middle of what I know is a very busy earnings season. We concluded calendar year 2019 with the strong December quarterly performance. Results ended up better than we expected, primarily due to a little bit stronger NAND investment as well as an uptick in our installed base business. Our installed base business delivered another record year and continued to be a stable profitable business for us. And as Tim mentioned, from and earnings per share perspective, it was the second best year in our 40-year history. The December quarter results came in over the midpoint of guidance for all financial metrics with diluted earnings per share essentially at the high end of our guidance range. As Tim also noted, we\u2019re pleased with our performance in calendar year 2019 and we delivered solid profitability levels within a challenging memory environment. As we discussed at our earnings call last quarter, there were continued strong investments in the foundry and logic segments in the December quarter. We had the highest system revenue dollars for the foundry segment in our history and the revenue concentration was at its highest level since the September 2016 quarter. Foundry spending continued its focus on the 7 and 5 nanometer nodes and it represent 36% of our December quarter system revenue. The logic and other segment grew in dollar terms and was essentially flat with the prior quarter intensity level coming in at 12% of system revenues. It was the highest logic and other revenue level in dollar terms in two years driven by 10-nanometer, image sensors and other specialty markets. For memory, the combined segment decreased to 52% of system revenues from the September quarter which was at 64%. We had a decrease in the December quarter in the nonvolatile memory segment going from 38% to 35%. Going from a dollar perspective, revenue in the segment actually increased. The DRAM segment decreased from 26% to 17% of system revenue. NAND investment continues to be focused on 64, 96 and initial 128 layer devices and DRAM spending continues to be primarily focused on node transitions. Revenues for the quarter were $2,584 million which was above the midpoint. In addition to the leading edge foundry and logic strength I mentioned, we saw continued investments in the China region with the majority again coming from domestic Chinese customers. China geographic revenue came in at 29% of total revenue in December. Gross margin came in at 45.7%, 70 basis points above the midpoint. The strength in the December quarter gross margin is related to customer and product mix as well as increased factory utilization levels relative to the prior quarter. I\u2019ll remind you as I always do that actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see some variability quarter-to-quarter. Operating expense for the December quarter came in at $481 million. Our variable compensation spending was higher in the quarter as it\u2019s tied to the increased level of profitability. Spending in the December quarter also increased due to the appreciation of the market during the quarter and the resulting impact on the cost of our deferred compensation plan. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we do hedge this to mitigate the exposure to the income statement. However, because of the accounting rules, the offset to this expense shows up in other income and expense. It's basically a neutral impact to earnings per share at the end of the day. We continue to invest in our critical research and development programs and you\u2019ll hear more about our commitment to technology and productivity leadership at our upcoming Investor\u2019s Day in March. I\u2019ll also remind you that as we look ahead to the 2020 calendar year, you\u2019ll see the normal seasonal spending increases related to the March quarter. Operating income in the December quarter was $700 million and operating margin was 27.1%, essentially at the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 12.5%. I would like to highlight that the difference between the non-GAAP tax rate and the December quarter GAAP tax rate which was 23.5% was related to the reversal of the tax benefit from the Altera stock-based compensation case. I think you're seeing this from lots of companies in the technology space. You should expect that fluctuations in the tax rate will occur quarter-to-quarter. And as we look into the rate for the calendar year 2020, I expect it to be in the low-teens level. Other income and expense was up slightly from the prior quarter at a total of approximately $13 million in expense. The main components of OI&E are interest income from our cash and investment balances offset by interest expense related to the outstanding debt. You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on several market-related items, things like foreign exchange are what I\u2019m talking about. Moving now to capital return. For the December quarter, $167 million of cash was deployed in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. As we\u2019ve frequently done in the past, the share repurchases were done through a structured share repurchase program that cover repurchases through the June 2020 quarter. We remain on track with our commitment to capital return. For calendar year 2019, we completed $3 billion of our current $5 billion buyback authorization. In total, our capital return activities represented approximately 158% of free cash flow in 2019. Diluted earnings per share was $4.01. Our diluted shares continue to decline and we ended the December quarter with diluted shares at approximately 150 million shares. This is the eighth consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 5 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you that the dilution schedule for the 2041 converts is available on our IR Web site for your reference. Let me now move to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased in the December quarter to $4.9 billion from $5.8 billion in the September quarter. The decrease quarter-to-quarter was due to the share repurchase and dividend activity, offset by cash flows from operations of $308 million. And as I\u2019ve mentioned before, when you see business levels grow, working capital levels generally increase which impacted our cash flow from operations in December. We concluded calendar year 2019 with the second highest level of free cash flow in the company's history at over $2.3 billion. I believe this truly demonstrates the sustainability of our business through a lower industry spend period. DSO increased slightly due to the timing of collections to 72 days versus 69 days in the prior quarter. Inventory turns improved to 3.7 turns from 3.2 in the September quarter. Both receivables and inventory grew in dollars during December as business levels increased by. Non-cash expenses included approximately $46 million for equity compensation, $49 million for depreciation and $17 million for amortization. December quarter capital expenditures increased to $62 million from $39 million in the September quarter. Ending headcount as of the December quarter was flat with the prior quarter at approximately 10,700 regular full-time employees. We expected as revenue levels are growing, we\u2019ll add headcount to support the increasing business. So now looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2020 quarter. We\u2019re expecting revenue of $2,800 million plus or minus $200 million; gross margin of 46.5% plus or minus one percentage point; operating margins of 28% plus or minus one percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $4.55 plus or minus $0.40 based on the share count of approximately 149 million shares. We see continued strength in foundry and logic spending going into the March quarter and additionally we see NAND spending continue to increase going into 2020. The March quarter guidance reflects our current view of the business environment, including our assessment of the potential impact from the public health situation in China. We see business disruptions potentially with both customers and suppliers that are essentially extending the lunar New Year holiday through February 9. Absent this situation, our numbers would have been somewhat higher. We also increased the revenue and EPS ranges to take into consideration the uncertainty of the impact from these activities. We believe this is temporary but the issue is developing day by day. I think we\u2019re taking a prudent approach to what we\u2019re doing with the numbers. So to conclude, we\u2019re well positioned heading into 2020. We\u2019re on a strong trajectory to outperform based on our product portfolio as well as operational strategies. And that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question just is been focusing on the domestic China market. Doug, you were kind enough to tell us it was the majority of the China business in the December. I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand how much of a majority it was. And what was the split between sort of memory and logic? And then as you look out to your WFE forecast growth of at least 20% in calendar year '20, how important is the domestic China market and how should we think about the memory versus sort of the logic/foundry side of that? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I\u2019ll answer it and then I\u2019ll let Tim add on. John, I\u2019m not going to get into the habit every quarter of giving a precise quantification except to tell you the majority in the December quarter was from domestic China. And that\u2019s been the case the last couple of quarters. And the reason I\u2019ve been mentioning that over the last couple of quarters is it\u2019s different than the last several years have been where the majority has actually come from the global multinationals. Then your question relative to how we\u2019re looking into 2020 in China, I think 2019 probably finished with WFE from the local China customers a little bit above $6 billion, something like that and it\u2019s growing in 2020. And as we look into 2020, I think John probably it\u2019s up $2 billion to $3 billion is my best guess from local China. And that spending is broad based; it\u2019s NAND, it\u2019s DRAM, it\u2019s foundry and logic. So it\u2019s not one or the other. It\u2019s broad based settled [ph] for customer spending. Tim, you want to add anything. Tim Archer : No, I think that pretty much covers it. John Pitzer : And then as my follow on just on WFE and kind of your share, Tim, you talked about in your prepared comments you did a nice job kind of gaining your share of WFE. Is 2020 a year where that becomes a little bit more difficult with sort of the addition of EUV or how important is EUV to your growth projections this year? And as we think about EUV deployment, is that a good leading indicator for your future business or how should we think about that? Tim Archer : Yes, I think that \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about EUV a number of times. And so I guess maybe I\u2019ll just repeat a few things I said and maybe add a couple of comments. In general, what we\u2019ve said is that technology transitions themselves are very good for Lam. We have highlighted a number of times that Lam\u2019s served market actually grows at each technology node within foundry/logic even with the introduction of EUV. So really what we want is we want the market and our customers to be able to keep moving their technologies forward. Specific to patterning as you move from say 7 to 5 nanometer, even in the case of EUV what you\u2019re starting to see is, is the increased use of more high-quality hard masks moving away from spin on dielectrics towards deposition metals like PECVD where Lam has a very strong position. And so in many cases, our SAM is actually increasing because we\u2019re pulling in applications that before were actually done with older processes and now they\u2019re coming into a more critical space. And so with that, we see SAM increase and therefore even with the EUV we see a growing market for ourselves. Doug talked about highest dollars from foundry and logic and that\u2019s just I think further evidence, because we\u2019re seeing technology investments right now at those EUV nodes. Now as far as the leading indicator, John, what we said is that EUV is obviously \u2013 those shipments are signs of these more complex technology nodes and again our SAM grows, so opportunity grows. Doug Bettinger : John, the only thing I would add, as you think about wallet share of WFE going into 2020, I think you know our SAM and share in NAND is very good. And clearly 2020 in our view is going to be a stronger investment period for the NAND industry as we\u2019ve seen kind of pricing and profitability stabilize. So our share of wallet actually in addition to the EUV commentary Tim had is actually going to have a tailwind from the fact that NAND spending I think will be stronger. Tim Archer : That\u2019s right. John Pitzer : Thanks, guys. Congratulations again. Tim Archer : Thanks, John. Operator : All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on WFE as you think about the roughly $8 billion to $10 billion increase year-on-year into 2020, can you tell us how much of that is memory versus foundry and logic? Is that kind of an 80/20 split? And then as part of that, are you including the material uplift in DRAM within that or is that something that could be a source of further upside? Tim Archer : Okay, C.J., great questions. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to give you the exact breakout, but I think we\u2019ve characterized it as \u2013 maybe you can look back to what we said as we were exiting last year. What we said was that we were seeing very strong spending in foundry/logic and that we were just starting to see the early signs of improvement in NAND and we felt that DRAM would come after the NAND market had improved. And so I think what you\u2019re seeing in our outlook for 2020 is that starting to play out. Except for again sustained strong spending in foundry and logic, certainly the emphasis on sustained and a strong uptick in NAND spending which as Doug just commented is a significant tailwind for us in terms of our SAM as a percent of WFE. Relative to DRAM, I think we characterized last year primarily as the technology investment year with very little capacity additions. And I would say that in general our outlook at this year is that that doesn\u2019t change much at least until much later in the year. So I\u2019d say primarily sustained strong foundry and logic and a strong uptick in NAND. C.J. Muse: Great. And as a follow-up question on the service side, thank you for providing the installed base numbers, very helpful. So up I think 12% in calendar '18, up 9% in calendar '19. Can you help us kind of think about what the growth rate for service could look like? And is it fair to say that service in 2019 reached roughly mid-30s of total revenues? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : So I\u2019ll take the last one. It wasn\u2019t quite that high, C.J., but it was comfortably above 30 in 2019, I\u2019ll give you that much. Tim Archer : I think that we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019ve said that because of the growing installed base, the overall customer support business grows every year. How it grows each year I\u2019ve talked a little bit about that dynamic where depending on where you are in kind of utilization and spending and customers will spend on different things. I highlighted a very strong year for us in 2019 on productivity upgrades which is \u2013 one of the things customers do when they\u2019re looking to squeeze a little bit more out of the assets they already have in their fabs and we saw a lot of that last year. I think that as you transition now to a very busy year and customers ramping aggressively, then you\u2019ll find yourself much more in this comparison and some of the value-added services part. But in general, given the dynamics with our market and our product portfolio, we feel very confident about its ability to grow year-on-year with the installed base. C.J. Muse: Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, C.J. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and great job on the solid business execution. With the complexity of the manufacturing process combined with higher specifications, maybe longer install and call times, on average from the time that you ship a tool to the time that that tool is put into full value production, I think greenfield is around six months. Is this lead time around the same time for conversion and incremental capacity expansion? And the reason why I ask is I just want to do a sanity check that for some of the memory shipment goodness that you\u2019re seeing, hopefully this is going to be layering on in-sync with the demand pull for memory which is typically more kind of middle to kind of second half of the year weighted? Tim Archer : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really broken it out. In fact, I don\u2019t know that I could even really speak to a material difference in lead times. I guess if I caught your question, it was does a conversion have approximately the same lead time for the upgrade to take place and the product to be called? If that was the question, I would say they\u2019re not dramatically different in terms of cycle time. Doug Bettinger : Yes. And Harlan, maybe I\u2019m guessing what your question might be. When we look at the way spending occurred in the second half of '19 in NAND, and I remind you we were saying this for a while. We exited the year we believe the industry\u2019s supply growth 30% year-on-year. Based on the investments we saw occurring in the second half of '19, we believe that rate will decline \u2013 supply growth will decline into the first half of '20, right. And so you\u2019re starting to see an uptick in investment that will have a lag effect to it and it won\u2019t immediately be producing output. I think that\u2019s inherently what you\u2019re asking, right? Harlan Sur : Exactly. That\u2019s exactly right and I appreciate the response. And actually as a follow on to that, so you guys had anticipated NAND bit supply growth exiting 2019 around 30% below the demand rate. I think some of your customers in DRAM were seeing bit supply kind of low to mid teens again before kind of the demand rates. So given the improving fundamentals in memory this year, kind of extrapolating from your customer equipment requirements this year, how do you guys see bit supply growth in NAND and DRAM this year from kind of the depressed levels exiting last year? Doug Bettinger : Yes, so you got it exactly right what we said. We exited the year well below the long-term demand trend. And actually even with the guidance we\u2019ve just given, we actually see ourselves under growing long-term demand this year in terms of bit supply growth both in NAND and in DRAM. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and a good job on results and guide. If I look at your top line growth historically, you outperformed WFE by 2x or so. How should we think about your top line growth relative to WFE for this year? Doug Bettinger : Atif, the color I\u2019d give you is again what I\u2019ve already said is I think it\u2019s an uptick in NAND investment. Our SAM and NAND is really strong. Our share in NAND is really strong. And so to the extent that NAND is driving an uptick in WFE, Lam will do really well. And you\u2019ve seen that over the years in times when memory is spending more, we do real well and when it\u2019s going to other way, we do less well. You should expect the same thing. I\u2019m not going to quantify it for you whether history is a good indicator, I\u2019m not completely sure. But I\u2019ll be very disappointed if we don\u2019t outperform this year. Atif Malik : Very helpful, Doug. And as a follow up, your WFE number for this year is even bigger than what we were thinking 55 billion. Can you just talk about the opportunity in which sensor, advanced packaging, things like that and how big that number is in your WFE number for this year? Tim Archer : Yes, we\u2019ve put that in the logic and other space. And what Doug indicated is we expect foundry and logic to grow '19 to '20. I don\u2019t know the exact image sensor number, so I can\u2019t answer your exact question. It\u2019s a secular grower for sure. But in the grand scheme of how big foundry and logic is, it\u2019s actually not all that big. But it is something we do really, really well in, in terms of the TSV aspect of image sensors. Doug Bettinger : Yes, all I would add is, is one of the reasons you\u2019ve heard us talk a lot more about specialty technologies and some of the products that we introduced in 2019 really focusing on heterogeneous integration and advanced packaging and MRAM and the image sensors was because many of those items are somewhat growing year-by-year from applications that are a little bit decoupled from the larger WFE cycle. And so again even last year\u2019s WFE was down, we were setting records in what we kind of prefer to as our specialty technologies business which is primarily served by the Reliant tools. Tim Archer : And so I think you can continue to see us focus in those areas because they\u2019re places where our technology plays very well. And as Doug said, we can by bringing the right technology and cost point we can really gain quite a large portion of that market. Atif Malik : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong and consistent execution. I have two questions as well. The first one, I\u2019m curious what goes into your WFE calculation just because it\u2019s such a strong outlook for this year. Is it orders, is it CapEx, is it memory pricing assumption? I\u2019m just curious what goes into it? And as part of that, if you could also give us some color on how you think the shape of WFE looks like first half versus second half? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I\u2019ll go through it and then I\u2019m sure Tim will have comments on that. We go at this in a couple different ways. We talk to customers first and foremost. Customers tell us here\u2019s our plans, here\u2019s what we think we\u2019re going to do kind of customer-by-customer, fab-by-fab. So that\u2019s the bottoms-up approach to it. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s exactly precisely correct. It changes. Customers\u2019 plans can change, but that\u2019s one aspect of how we come at it. The second aspect is actually a tops-down approach, which is we take a read on, okay, what is global GDP going to look like this year? What does that mean for electronics demand? What does that mean for IC unit and semi revenue growth? And what does that mean relative to wafers and technology? And then we try to correlate the two approaches together. We don\u2019t always get it perfect, but it\u2019s a pretty robust process and I think we do a decent job. But we don\u2019t always get it exactly right, but we do our best. Tim, anything? Tim Archer : Yes, I think it stems, as Doug said, from pretty extensive conversations with customers. One of the nice things about this business is that we have developed very deep relationships with customers and they\u2019re just as interested in having us deliver the technology they need on time. And so I think it\u2019s pretty open sharing about when tools are needed when the ramp is going to occur. So that factors quite a bit into the calculation. Vivek Arya : And anything on first half versus second half? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I think that it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a first half weighted year really driven by foundry and logic. I think memory spending is going to be pretty steady through the year, but I think foundry\u2019s probably a little bit first half weighted. Vivek Arya : All right. And for my follow up, your installed base has grown at a 10%, 11% annual base the last five years, which is pretty remarkable given the volatility in WFE. My question is how fast have your services kind of grown annually during those five years and how should we think about the installed base and services growth for the next two to three years? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I\u2019ll give you little color. The best indicator of how it\u2019s growing is just chamber count, because that really is what drives the business opportunity. Having said that, we\u2019re doing a lot of innovative things around advanced service offerings in different ways to deliver value to customers that drives our objective, Vivek, at the end of the day to have dollars grow faster than just the growth in chamber count. And if you come see us in March, we\u2019ll probably give you a little more color around what this business looks like. Tim Archer : Yes. And I think the only thing I\u2019d add, I made comments about the productivity upgrades and solutions a part of that business. It\u2019s \u2013 obviously every customer is driving to reduce their running cost in their fabs. And so between upgrades for existing tools as well as new really data-enabled services that we offer to help recover tools more quickly with less labor and with a higher probability of first-time right. That part of the business is actually growing very fast and I think has the ability just as it did the past year of growing 30% year-on-year the ability to outgrow the installed base. And so we\u2019re investing in that area. Vivek Arya : Thanks very much. Tim Archer : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats guys on the great results. Just two quick ones either Tim or Doug. When you look at the calendar year 2020 and like you mentioned WFE is probably front half loaded and mostly foundry/logic bias going towards memory in the back half. Are there any nuances in gross margin we should worry about or is there like one segment has a better gross margin profile than the other? And then I have a follow up. Doug Bettinger : No, there\u2019s nothing specific to gross margin by segment that you should be thinking about. It varies with customer mix, it varies with product mix and then overall business volumes is what I think I\u2019ve said every single quarter that I\u2019ve been at the company, it\u2019s the same language. So there isn\u2019t anything specific by segment. Krish Sankar : Got it, Doug. And then just a follow up on the OpEx. I understand March has the seasonality with all the merit increase, et cetera, but how do we think about OpEx on a go-forward basis? Is like 18% of sales a good bogey to use or is the 500 million plus run rate \u2013 quarterly run rate the right metric? Doug Bettinger : If you look at what we\u2019ve done over the longer term, we\u2019ve let spending grow at a rate less than the top line has grown over the last, I don\u2019t know, since we brought the two companies together. And I think you\u2019re going to see us thinking that same way as we see a stronger year in front of us. And again, come see us in March I\u2019ve give you an updated financial model as well. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : All right. Thank you. Next we have a question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Doug, I had two. First of all, China has been running about 30% of revenue for the past three quarters. Should we expect it to be about 30% as a percent of revenue in March? And I assume within that that it would still be \u2013 like the vast majority of it would be the domestic guys. Is that correct? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I\u2019m not going to get into kind of telling you quarter-by-quarter what it is, but I\u2019ll remind you what I said earlier. I think it grows $2 billion to $3 billion of a base of 6-ish \u2013 going a little above 6 for the year. It will lumpy. Tim, you know how this goes. There\u2019s a project that takes tools, then has to ramp it for a while and digest it, then something else kicks in. I\u2019m not going to give you exact color around \u2013 on the March guide, but I think it will be a good year for local China this year. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, great. Thanks, Doug. And then I guess this is kind of a bigger picture question, but given what\u2019s going on with export control, you\u2019re saying that domestic China is going to add maybe 2 billion to 3 billion to 2020 WFE. Do you think that there\u2019s any of this incremental stuff going on within China where customers are concerned about maybe someday down the road they can\u2019t get access to tools, and so maybe they\u2019re calling in timelines of these fabs? Thanks. Tim Archer : Yes, I guess I\u2019ll take that one, Tim. We\u2019ve answered this a couple of times. We see no indication that the China buys are pull-ins. There appear to be solid plans behind what they are trying to do and every tool we ship they\u2019re trying to ramp as quickly as they can. So I really don\u2019t think that plays into it. Having said that, we are watching what\u2019s going on with the talk about regulatory controls, but at this point no details that we could even really comment on. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome, Tim. Thanks so much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder \u2013 back to the topic of this China sovereign business, if you could give us some color on the number of customers. I think people tend to think about memory, but just I\u2019m not looking for specifics, but how much of it is memory versus other stuff and just an indication of the breadth that you\u2019re seeing? Tim Archer : Yes. So Doug made a comment about the demand being pretty broad based. We are seeing \u2013 and again, just sort of think about what\u2019s great about our market right is the breadth of driver \u2013 end market drivers. There\u2019s a lot of IoT in specialty technologies whether it be automotive, power devices, image sensors, you kind of see all of that being \u2013 people in China trying to address that end demand. And so it\u2019s not isolated to any one thing. Clearly the uptick in memory has outsized importance for Lam\u2019s revenue and basically we watch very closely what happens especially in the NAND and DRAM areas. But really our outlook and the $2 billion to $3 billion increase that Doug talked about in 2020 is pretty broad based across quite a number of customers. Joseph Moore : Okay, great. And then you guys have talked about kind of a $70 billion five-year WFE for NAND kind of keeping us on a historic supply growth trajectory. Is that still kind of the right ballpark? And we would seem to be quite a bit lower than that right now. Is that still kind of the right framework for thinking about what WFE ought to be if we stay in a historical demand context? Tim Archer : Yes. That\u2019s still the way we look at it. And our comment as you just said we were quite a bit below that at this point, that was part of our commentary as I said through last year we were actually under investing for long-term demand. That long-term demand is what establishes our $70 billion five-year investment. And even this year as we see a strong uptick in NAND, we still as we said expect ourselves to enter the year maybe slightly still below the long-term demand rate. Joseph Moore : Perfect. Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Joe. Operator : All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much and congrats also. Maybe, Doug, first in terms of being an installed base business and the growth you are seeing there and the sustainability of that growth, can you just give a little bit of color of how you\u2019ve seen maybe over the last few years and going forward how the business has kind of transitioned from I guess the transactional break and fix type of business to more of a contract base which gives you a better visibility into the revenue and cash flow stream of that business? Doug Bettinger : Patrick, I\u2019m actually going to redirect it to Tim because I think he\u2019ll give you a more comprehensive answer than I would. Tim Archer : Yes, Doug can certainly add something there, but I think we have seen that transition and it\u2019s not just something that\u2019s happened to us. It\u2019s been a strategy we\u2019ve been driving to try to make this business less transactional and much more value add and also much more long term. And I talked in my script about one way in which we do it. You transition the transactional to longer term through multiyear contracts. Even there you\u2019re able to help the customer control their costs in a much more predictable way and that gives us better visibility going forward, makes the business a little less transactional. But I think the biggest way that we\u2019ve transitioned this business from transactional to strategic is really through our focus on new products in the portfolio of services and upgrades that allow the customer to change the cost profile of running their install base. And so in that way you can make this much more strategic. I talked about the Corvus R technology, the self-maintaining tool where the system itself replaces some of its consumable parts rather than having to have technicians going and do that work. When we engineer that type of new upgrade, we then would create for yourself an entire new SAM within your installed base. And now as customers recognize the value of that automated replacement system, they go and they upgrade to all of those older tools that are in the installed base, and it creates another source of ongoing revenue for us. And in the meantime we\u2019re looking for that next upgrade to engineer and offer to the customers. And so I think it\u2019s becoming much more of a product and strategically focused business. It just happens that its targeted market is the installed base we\u2019ve already shipped. Patrick Ho : Great, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe as my follow-up question and maybe for Tim since you talked about it in your prepared remarks about the ALD market and the market expansion opportunity there. On top of the share gains you\u2019ve made in that segment as well as the market growing particularly in the foundry/logic space, do you see additional applications at foundry and logic driving this growth or is there an opportunity for it to expand to other segments, like DRAM? Tim Archer : Yes, it already is expanding into other markets. The only difference being again with ALD you\u2019re essentially creating a deposition technology, a platform and that\u2019s one thing that Lam is very good at is we\u2019re creating high-productivity platforms. And then we expand the portfolio of films that we can deposit and that creates more application opportunities for us. As I talked about oxides and carbides, there are other films that are also being developed same time. And I think that ultimately every device type reaches a point where it needs to do some level of atomic layer processing. And so the long term I think this is just where the technology is going and that\u2019s why you see ALD starting to replace, as I said, some older process alternatives for certain steps. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joe Quatrochi : Congrats on the results. I was curious on the NAND flash side. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the amount of clean room space that you see across the industry today that\u2019s empty. And then how do you think about just the industry\u2019s kind of use on filling it versus past cycles? Doug Bettinger : Joe, are you still there? Sorry, you broke up at the end. Okay. There\u2019s plenty of space out there in the industry for sure across all of the customer base. And so what I always say is \u2013 in fact I think I don\u2019t know a quarter or two ago we talked about the fact that we were tracking double-digit number of new fabs in 2019. I think the number\u2019s probably about the same in 2020, a lot of those being memory fabs. The thing to understand with our customers is building the shell is \u2013 it\u2019s a cheap call option on the future, right. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to equip it tomorrow, but it does indicate to you a long-term intention. And then they buy equipment when they really need the output. That\u2019s where the real money and capital gets deployed. But there\u2019s plenty of clean room space out there. Tim Archer : Yes, I guess the only thing I\u2019d add. I thought perhaps you were going to ask about the importance of clean room space and I was going to be able to tell you that that\u2019s one of the things that we focus on. You might have understood in the past from past commentary that a benefit of some of our products, like the Strata and why it\u2019s popular within the NAND market is the number of wafers that we output from that tool per square meter of fab space that consumed is actually the best in the industry. That\u2019s an important metric. Even when Doug says there\u2019s lots of fab space, which I certainly agree with, how they use it is always important to the customer. And so again as we think through platform, design and launching new tools what we call footprint density or throughput density is really one of the key metrics that we focus on. Joe Quatrochi : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just back on the services side, given that we should start to see I would think an acceleration in the growth of your installed base this year with just a rebound in memory demand, is it fair to us to think about accelerating year-over-year revenue growth for that business in 2020? Doug Bettinger : Joe, the way I generally think about it is the chambers ship and then they monetize over a period of time after they ship. And so the fact that you saw chambers grow in 2019, that\u2019s a good indicator of what\u2019s going to drive growth in 2020. That\u2019s how I generally think about it. There\u2019s a little bit of a lag to it after the chamber count, which is why historically we\u2019ve given you a chamber count number one time a year at the end of the year. Joe Quatrochi : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. All the good ones have already been asked. Just a quick follow up for Doug. How should I think about OpEx just roughly beyond the March quarter? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I kind of answered that already. I kind of didn\u2019t answer it in how I answered it. But what I said was that I\u2019ll give you a new financial model in March. And what I said is over the last several years the same management team is here that\u2019s been around the company for a while. We like to see revenue grow faster than we want to let spending grow so that we deliver some leverage to the bottom line. That\u2019s still very much how we think about it. Mehdi Hosseini : But your March quarter shows a typical seasonal uptick and I know we got to wait until March 3, but as we model this kind of fine tune our estimate, should I think of your OpEx remaining at the minimum at the same level? It\u2019s not going to just be a one-time event. Doug Bettinger : Yes, that\u2019s probably not an unreasonable way to be thinking about it for now, Mehdi. Mehdi Hosseini : Good. Very reasonable answer. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you, Mehdi. Operator : All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think the majority has been answered, but I just want to clarify maybe two small things. So number one is the comments on DRAM, so it sounds like that\u2019s going to be up year-over-year for 2020? I just want to make sure that\u2019s right and there wasn\u2019t anything to read between there? And then secondly, I don\u2019t expect numbers from this, but is the message that you guys believe you\u2019re going to gain more share in NAND relative to the other markets in '20? Doug Bettinger : I\u2019ll take the first one and then I\u2019ll let Tim comment on the share. I don\u2019t really see when I look at the WFE, the color that we just gave you, a real recovery in NAND I wouldn\u2019t describe it that way \u2013 sorry, in DRAM. But clearly in NAND, yes. Foundry and logic continue to be strong. DRAM is kind of push in plus or minus. And what we see happening is there\u2019s still a little bit of inventory out in the channel. It\u2019s got to get burned off. And at some point you can\u2019t continue to sustain supply growth below where demand growth is. And when we look at DRAM bit growth, we think supply growth in 2020 is below demand growth. Tim Archer : And I think a little bit longer term and also relative to clearing the inventory. We\u2019ve been very encouraged by comments we\u2019ve heard about what we understand are drivers for DRAM; the growth in the server market, the introduction of 5G where you\u2019re seeing pretty substantial step up in terms of DRAM content per handset. And so it\u2019s \u2013 and I think Doug said this in the past, but even for DRAM a little bit more matter of when, not if. So I think it\u2019s just \u2013 right now we have, as you said, maybe about a push for the outlook that we have just given you. Doug Bettinger : Your comment about NAND, I guess when we think about share or share of total spend, one of the things we\u2019ve talked about is the strength for us in NAND obviously is that we are \u2013 and our tools are key enablers of building taller and taller NAND stacks. And as those stacks increase, our share of total WFE continues to increase. And so given that year-on-year we continue to see a greater portion of spend being spent on taller NAND devices, our share of total spend will increase. Mitch Steves : Okay, thanks. Perfect. Just really a small one if I could. What was just like a dollar impact to the virus that you guys are taking out of the Q1 just to get an idea? Doug Bettinger : I\u2019m not going to describe those specific dollars. It was an amount that we think is consistent with what we\u2019re hearing from customers and suppliers. Mitch Steves : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Quinn Bolton : Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. One near-term question, one longer-term question. On the near-term question, given the travel restrictions in China around the coronavirus outbreak, can you guys say are you guys having difficulty accessing some of the fabs either in the installed base business or delivering new tools or is it still somewhat business as usual and you have access to service the tools in the fab and you\u2019re able to deliver tools here in the near term? Tim Archer : I think very specifically I think most people are aware of the travel restrictions have been placed on travel in and out of Wuhan. And so obviously you can\u2019t travel into that area where there are some customers located. But in general I think that as Doug said, we\u2019re moving to the Lunar New Year which now has been extended and got abundance of caution Lam is also implemented travel restrictions for our people to kind of business critical situations only. And I think from the standpoint of impact and the way we\u2019ve looked at it is there could be delays of a few weeks in supply chain or shipments to customers and we don\u2019t see that as any real change though to the demand picture that we\u2019ve outlined and therefore we\u2019re really talking about just hopefully seeing this normalize over the next few weeks. Quinn Bolton : Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. And then the longer-term question is your 2020 WFE forecast I think is higher than probably what many of us were thinking. I guess as I look out to 2021, it sounds like DRAM is not part of the 2020 forecast. Do you think 2021 WFE can continue to trend higher if that DRAM spending comes back? Doug Bettinger : You know we\u2019re not going to answer that. Even I don\u2019t know what '21 is. When I think about it though, the long-term growth drivers are totally intact. We\u2019ve been talking about this for years, right. You got data exploding in society. You got crowd and hyperscale, the Big 7 what have you investing in more in equipment this year, that\u2019s good. You\u2019ve got 5G on the come line, that\u2019s good. You\u2019ve got density growing there in every phone. So the long term is really very positive for the industry and our position in the industry enabling it we feel really good about where we\u2019re sitting. Quinn Bolton : Thank you. Tina Correia : Okay, operator, we have time for one more question please. Operator : Okay. Our last question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. My first question is on the memory spending this year. If things stay out the way you think, are you thinking that NAND CapEx will still be below that $70 billion run rate? I know you said that you waited [ph] below the 40% bit supply in growth. I guess in a way I\u2019m trying to parse out that $8 billion to $10 billion increase in WFE you guys are forecasting. Doug Bettinger : Sidney, you know we never give you segment by segment WFE numbers and I\u2019m not going to now. It is going to grow this year. And as Time described, we think bit growth in NAND is in the first half anyway below where long-term demand is and probably exiting the year it\u2019s getting closer to being in balance. But we still think it\u2019s below where demand growth is. I\u2019m going to leave it at that. Sidney Ho : Okay. How about DRAM bit supply growth exiting the year if there is \u2013 to your point if there is \u2013 DRAM CapEx being a push? Doug Bettinger : DRAM bit was also I think as we said would undergo long-term demand this year. Sidney Ho : Okay. Maybe a longer-term question, with the share gains you have in foundry and logic this year and I think it was as high as 48% of the total revenue last year. How should we think about your exposure between foundry and logic and memory through the next cycle? I think versus maybe last five years, memory was averaging like close to 70% sales. Doug Bettinger : We\u2019ve got nice trajectory rather than what\u2019s going on in foundry and logic. We had a really strong December quarter, record level in foundry. I expect our share of WFE in both foundry and logic to continue to be very strong. I\u2019m not going to pinpoint exactly what it is versus memory because we\u2019re very strong in memory as well. I feel really good about where we\u2019re positioned, I\u2019ll just put it that way. Tim Archer : Well, I think the simplest way to think about it, as a company our objective is to improve our revenue share of WFE across all segments. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Sidney. Operator : All right. Thank you. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to our speakers for any closing remarks. Tina Correia : We just want to thank everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference and you may now disconnect. Please enjoy the rest of your day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Tina Correia : Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the March 2020 quarter and our outlook for the June 2020 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 o'clock PM Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website. along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 o'clock PM Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Great. Thank you, Tina, and welcome everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well in these very challenging times. Against the evolving backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lam delivered solid financial results in the March quarter. I want to start by discussing how we are managing through the current environment. The impact from the globally-spreading virus began to materialize in our manufacturing and supply chain operations in the latter part of the March quarter as shelter-in-place orders went into effect across many regions. We've responded effectively to these disruptions and while near-term predictability remains more difficult than usual, I am pleased to say that our essential manufacturing facilities and labs are operating, allowing us to focus on critical customer deliverables. I'm very grateful to our Lam employees and partners around the world, who with tremendous commitment and dedication, have risen to meet extraordinary challenges. Our focus at this time is concentrated in three key areas. First, our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees, our partners and their families. From the start, we have actively sought the best available guidance to formulate our response plans and we are complying with all public health directives in the locations in which we operate. All employees that can execute their roles remotely are doing so. And through our expansion of our IT infrastructure capabilities, we have maintained a productive remote work cadence. To protect our employees that are working on-site at Lam locations, we have implemented rigorous safety practices, including on-site temperature monitoring, mandatory use of personal protective equipment and strict social distancing protocols. Second, we are executing our business continuity plans throughout our manufacturing and supply chain network. Our capabilities are still limited compared to normal operation, but as the pandemic has impacted different parts of the world at different times and to different degrees, we and our supply chain partners are successfully leveraging our global footprint to support our customers' most critical priorities. Past investments we have made to complement US production capability with operations in Korea and Taiwan have proven valuable as both of those countries have reported earlier stabilization of local COVID-19 conditions. Similarly, we have worked closely with our suppliers on their challenges in specific regions and we are beginning to see signs of improving material availability. Third, we are focused on increasing the capability and expertise of our regional field teams to meet our customers' ongoing installed base needs, including installation of newly-shipped systems. We anticipate the cross-region travel will be discouraged for at least the near future and therefore we are working closely with customers to significantly enhance remote support capabilities using advanced data collection and information sharing technologies. Overall, I am extremely pleased with how our teams have executed to mitigate the impact of this global pandemic on our employees, our customers and our business. I also recognize that we are very fortunate in this difficult time to be able to give back to our employees and the communities that have helped us build our strong company. In early April, we announced the creation of a $25 million relief fund to provide direct and immediate assistance to employees and others around us most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm happy to say that in only three weeks, more than half of our committed relief funds have already been deployed to help people affected by this crisis. I'll now transition to our results and the broader industry environment. In the March quarter, we delivered revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings per share of $3.98. Both results were below our original guidance, which we withdrew late in the quarter as we saw production and supply constraints emerge due to shelter-in-place orders. Customer demand in the quarter was unchanged from our original view. We believe that our revenue in the near term will be determined primarily by the capacity of our global manufacturing and supply chain network as social distancing restrictions are expected to continue for the next several months in locations in which we and our suppliers operate. While we are currently seeing improvements in both our own operations and those of our suppliers, risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 crisis remain. Consequently, we will not be providing our usual financial guidance for the June quarter. Doug and I will however provide our best assessment of the environment in our comments and Q&A. From our perspective, customer demand for equipment continues to remain very strong in the first half of 2020. We believe that WFE spending is largely being driven by customers investing in strategic initiatives, including both foundry and memory technology transitions that will be critical to both capability and competitiveness when global markets eventually emerge from the effects of the pandemic. The equipment industry is currently supply constrained. We exited the March quarter with record backlog and would expect to fulfill this unmet demand over the coming months. Looking beyond the near-term impact, we remain strong believers in the underlying fundamentals and resiliency of the semiconductor industry. Semiconductors have become so embedded into nearly every industry, so we expect broad portfolio semiconductor equipment companies such as Lam to see offsetting areas of strength and weakness to help support results. This was our experience through the trough of the recent industry cycle where we saw increased foundry and logic spending offset memory weakness. Despite a 40% decline in memory spending in calendar year 2019, our revenues held up well compared to prior cycles. As we assess the potential future impact of COVID-19 on our business, recent customer commentary points to cloud and enterprise strength as an offset at least in part to the weakness that may be seen in more consumer-oriented end markets like smartphones and auto. The need for equipment and capacity to support work from home initiatives is causing cloud service providers to increase CapEx, creating the potential for a surge in server demand. Third-party estimates suggest that cloud capacity would need to increase 10-fold to service the peak workloads seen as shelter-in-place rules went into effect. Although these heightened workloads are likely a short-term phenomenon, this event will underscore the need for companies to invest more in infrastructure and business continuity capabilities as the daily economy and our dependence on technology continues to expand over time. The PC and server markets account for nearly half of DRAM and NAND bit demand on average. And when you also consider that memory customers under-invested in capacity additions in 2019 causing the industry to exit the year with supply growth well below long-term demand, we believe there is good reason to be confident in the healthy fundamentals of the memory market, near-term uncertainty notwithstanding. Longer term, our focus is on executing the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day event in March. Our growing installed base business serves as a strong and stable foundation for Company performance. And as we committed, we have started disclosing our Customer Support Business Group or CSBG revenue this quarter. Doug will cover this in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that in the March quarter, our installed base revenues grew faster than installed base unit growth, consistent with our objective to increase revenue capture per tool with additional value added service offerings. Within CSBG, we also continue to see strong activity in our Reliant business, which grew for the 7th consecutive quarter and reached yet another record level. At this point, we see our CSBG business poised for another growth year in calendar 2020. From a share gain perspective, we are executing well on both penetrations and defenses so far this year. In etch, we've seen wins across all segments, DRAM, NAND, and foundry and logic. At our Investor Day event, we launched our innovative new Sense.i etch platform targeted at both widening our lead in critical applications and strengthening our competitiveness in the semi-critical space. COVID-19 related manufacturing and supply chain disruptions have set our schedule backed by a month or two from our original plan, but customer pull for Sense.i has strengthened since launch. Sense.i was designed to deliver advanced equipment intelligence, data analysis and self-maintenance capabilities to minimize required on-site human intervention with the system. Customers have a heightened awareness of the value these advanced capabilities can deliver and we expect they will look to accelerate their adoption of smart fab technologies. Sense-i is well positioned to deliver both the technology and data collection capabilities our customers need to be successful. In deposition, we're focused on served available market expansion opportunities that we believe can be accessed by accelerating conversions from older process technologies to our highly-productive enhanced atomic layer deposition or ALD solution set. We continued to execute on these opportunities in the March quarter with additional ALD metallization wins for advanced logic nodes and new dielectric gap fill penetrations in 3D NAND. In both cases, we displaced older process technologies from our competitors with a more extendable Lam solution. Overall, we are confident in the strength of Lam's position in the market and our opportunities for growth when the current crisis subsides. So to wrap up, the Company is executing well during a very difficult time. Our global teams are working tirelessly to mitigate operational impacts from COVID-19, and while near-term visibility is low, we believe that long-term secular demand for semiconductors will continue to drive sustainable WFE growth across cycles. Thank you all again for joining, and for your support. I'll now turn it over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today in what I know is a challenging time for all of us. I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. As you're aware, given the uncertainties with business disruptions around the world related to COVID-19, we withdrew our March guidance on March 17. Despite the operational challenges, we delivered solid results in the March quarter. Our revenues for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion, down $80 million from the December quarter. The decrease was entirely due to production interruptions. Customer demand remained strong through the quarter. I'd point out that we're exiting the March quarter with the strong level of deferred revenue at $726 million. This was partly due to shipments that occurred at the end of the quarter that had backordered materials. From an earnings per share perspective, the March quarter came in at $3.98, which was driven by strong gross margin performance, focused expense management as well as a favorable tax rate. From a system segment perspective, as expected, memory investments increased in the March quarter. The combined memory segment increased to 56% of system revenues, rising from the December quarter at 52%. We saw increases in NAND spending with investments focused on 64, 96 and initial 128-layer devices. DRAM spending continues to be focused on node transitions primarily on conversions to 1y and 1z. NAND was the majority of memory investments at 40% of systems revenue, with DRAM coming in at 16%. Foundry revenue strength continued with customer investments there focused on 7 and 5-nanometer. As a percent of system revenue, foundry represented 31% of systems revenue as compared to 36% in the December quarter. December quarter was the all-time high systems revenue level for our foundry business. March was the second highest. The logic and other segment was fairly flat in both dollar and percent concentration quarter-to-quarter, coming in at 13% of system revenue. Logic spending is driven by 10 nanometer image sensors and other specialty markets. The China region continues to invest and came in at 32% of total revenues for the March quarter. The majority of the China revenue again came from domestic Chinese customers. Also as Tim noted, our Customer Support Business Group revenue continued to grow in the March quarter. This is the first quarter we're disclosing the specific revenue amount. You've likely seen the tables in our earnings release. The installed base business came in at $856 million, which is an increase of approximately 3.5% from the same quarter a year ago. Gross margin for the March quarter was 46.3%. The strength in the March quarter gross margin is related to customer and product mix. Gross margin was somewhat negatively impacted from lower-than-expected output as well as increased spending in manufacturing and the supply chain. And just a reminder, our actual gross margins are a function of several factors such as business volume, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter. Operating expenses for the March quarter were $486 million, which was essentially flat with the December quarter. The March quarter has normal seasonal increases as it always does at the beginning of the calendar year. We managed other variable expenses down during the quarter as we address the COVID-19 impacts on our operations. We maintained our focus in critical business projects for our customers with two-thirds of our operating expense focused on research and development. I also want to highlight for you that the benefits and costs of our deferred compensation program are no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. As I've discussed in the past, we hedged this plan to mitigate the exposure to the income statement with the up - excuse me, with the OpEx offset to this historically showing up in other income and expense. You can see the impacts of the market fluctuations related to deferred compensation program in our GAAP reconciliation tables in the earnings release. These hedging offsets remain mismatched in our GAAP results. Operating income in the March quarter was $673 million and operating margin was 26.9%. Our non-GAAP tax rate this quarter was 8.3%. This rate was lower than expected due to incremental deductions from equity compensation related to exercises during the quarter. We will have fluctuations in the tax rate from quarter-to-quarter and we expect our rate for calendar year 2020 to be in the low teens level. Other income and expense was up in the March quarter, coming in at approximately $30 million in expense. The main components of other income and expense line are interest income from our cash and investment balance, offset by interest expense related to our outstanding debt. We did have a small amount of incremental interest expense from the drawdown on our revolving credit facility that occurred late in the quarter. You should expect that other income and expense will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on several market related items like interest rates and foreign exchange. Let me now move on to capital return. For the March quarter, $164 million of cash was deployed in dividends and $146 million in share repurchase. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we have a long-term plan for capital to return of 75% to 100% of free cash flow. We have approximately $1.8 million - excuse me $1.8 billion remaining on our $5 billion board authorized buyback plan. In the current environment, we will be slowing our buyback activity. It is likely, we won't buy any stock back in the June quarter. Diluted earnings per share again came in at $3.98. We ended the March quarter with diluted shares of approximately 148 million shares, which was down from the December quarter level. This is the 9th consecutive quarter where our diluted share count has declined. The share count includes a dilutive impact of a little more than 1 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. And I'll remind you, the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. Let me now move on to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash increased in the March quarter to $5.6 billion from $4.9 billion in the December quarter. The quarter-to-quarter increase was due to strong cash flows from operations of $541 million as well as a $1.25 billion drawdown on our revolving credit facility. We also had debt maturities and redemptions of more than $600 million in the March quarter that obviously reduced the cash balance. Our strong balance sheet and cash generation capability continue to provide robust liquidity. DSO increased to 80 days versus 72 days in the prior quarter. The increase was largely due to the timing of collections and invoiced, but not yet revenue shipments that occurred at the end of the quarter. And I would point out on the first day of the June quarter, we collected more than $370 million. Inventory turns were 3.2 in the March quarter compared to 3.7 turns in the December quarter. Inventory was higher due to the fact that output slowed from the COVID-19 situation. Non-cash expenses included approximately $40 million for equity compensation, $50 million for depreciation and $17 million for amortization. March quarter capital expenditures were $51 million, which was a decrease from $62 million in the December quarter. Ending headcount as of the March quarter end was approximately 11,000 regular full-time employees, which is an increase from the December quarter of approximately 300 people, mainly to support field and factory operations. For the June quarter, although we're not providing official guidance, I'll share some things for you to consider when thinking about our June quarter financial performance. We are seeing the following dynamics. Capacity limitations are coming from our supply chain as well as adjustments and factory operations to maximize output considering social distancing challenges. We plan to add resources during the quarter to increase our output capability. Demand remained strong. We are output constrained. These capacity challenges will negatively impact revenue and gross margins. If our current assessment of our output capability turns out to be correct, revenue in the June quarter should be higher than March. There is obviously uncertainty around that statement. CSBG business remains resilient. Our priorities are the health and safety of our employees and partners as well as taking care of our customers. We will spend incrementally in these areas and we will actively control cost in other areas. Interest expense will be up from the revolver drawdown and share count is likely to be flat. So to summarize, we see continued strength in foundry and logic going into the June quarter. We also see - excuse me, memory demand continuing to strengthen. The long-term outlook for our business continues to be solid and consistent with what you heard from us at our Investor Day in early March. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question and glad to hear you're all healthy. First question, I guess, revolves around demand side, obviously, you talked about supply constraints. How are you, I guess, prioritizing customer demand and have you seen any demand disruption given the uncertainty to COVID? Or just too early just to see anything works out on that front? Tim Archer : Yes. I guess we, C.J., we are working very, very closely with all of our customers to help prioritize shipments in the order of greatest need for the customer. So you can imagine critical R&D programs, where there's a technology conversion, it requires a one of a kind tool, specific capacity bottlenecks that are critical to their factory output or delivery to specific customers of theirs. And so one of the great things about Lam having built very strong customer relationships over all these years is that we really partnered with them to understand their priorities. And we do have fair flexibility within our own operations to prioritize certain tools ahead of others for a specific customer. And so I'd say through very, very close coordination with the customers who are trying to meet their needs. It's - I guess, I would say, maybe the simple answer is, we've seen no demand disruption, no change in demand. One could say maybe that's - it's too early to see that. But we really haven't sensed in any conversation with the customers today a change in demand. So our focus is really on how to get the tools to them that they need. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up, I guess, on the supply - supply chain side, is that more upstream in your ability to produce the tools, get parts, perhaps issues in Malaysia? Or is it more logistics of getting the tools actually to customers? And then I guess as part of that, Doug, if you could help at all, how do we think about the implications to gross margins as you obviously bring on more resources to satisfy customers' demand in this crazy world? Doug Bettinger : I'll take the first part of that. It - I'd say some of the supply challenges, they're kind of across the board, but clearly, I think most people are quite aware of the control orders that are in place in Malaysia, which is - tends to be for many equipment companies, a large subsystem supplier. Lam, we've - one of our strengths, both operationally and financially, has been a supply chain operation that allows us to do what we call merging transit. And so therefore, some of the subsystems never actually come to Lam facilities. They arrive directly at customer sites. If those don't arrive obviously, the system cannot ship complete. So it's across the board. Materials coming into our facilities, which we feel are operating quite effectively right now, but also coming out of major subsystem suppliers in places, as you noted, places like Malaysia and others. So that's\u2026 Tim Archer : C.J, I mean I'll give you a little flavor of how we're running things in areas that are probably going to be a little bit of a drag on gross margin. And I won't quantify it specifically, but I'll give you some stuff to think about. Basically, what's happening is, given the need to have social distancing, we're needing to space people out further away from one another in the factory environment. And obviously, that means we can generate less output per square meter, per square foot, what have you. So essentially, what we're trying to do C.J., is moving to incremental space where we have it, take some incremental space where we have it and bring incremental people into that other space. Obviously, in an environment like that, you're doing everything you can to take care of the customer and generate revenue for that matter, but you're going to be less efficient in terms of your ability to be super-efficient on the gross margin line. Other things that are going on, as I'm sure you're aware, freight and logistics is more expensive right now. It's up a decent amount in certain areas. So we're having to spend more to get materials coming into the factory as well as giving them to customers. I'm not going to quantify it for you specifically, but the way I would want you to be thinking about it is we've been in the gross margin range over the last five, six, seven years. I think what you're going to see is, we will trend towards the lower end of where you've seen our gross margin over that time frame. I don't think we'll go below the range we've been in, but I think we will be towards the lower end, given the dynamic I described. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, C.J. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Appreciate all the color you have given the uncertainty. Doug, I'm just kind of curious, can you quantify what the supply impact was to revenue in the March quarter? And is it going to be larger in the June quarter despite June revenue being up? And do you expect to kind of get most of these behind you by the end of the June quarter, so as you go into the second half of the calendar year, supply is less of an issue? Tim Archer : Yes. John, I'll take you back. Our original guide was $2.8 billion, plus/minus $200 million. And we kind of realized the last couple of weeks of the quarter and our limited ability, we might end up ending below the low end of that range, and we did. So that was the impact. We came into the quarter expecting to be able to deliver $2.8 billion. And I'll remind you that as we began last quarter, we basically said, demand is actually stronger than that, but it was the beginning of things beginning to break out in Wuhan, and we knew there was going to be some supply chain impact. So that's kind of what went on there, John. Now obviously, we're getting much better at operating in this environment. We brought the factory back online. We got people back to work. We're hiring people. We're moving into incremental space. So I think we're going to be able to mitigate it better than when it just kind of fell in our lap. And based on how we believe we're going to be able to operate and get more output and execute our business continuity plans, I think revenue will be higher in June. Demand continues to be much stronger than that. This is a supply situation. John Pitzer : And Doug, by the second half, do you think you will have mitigated all these supply issues or not? Second half of the calendar year? Doug Bettinger : I hope so. Yes. I mean, we're executing our business continuity plans. It's not going to take us longer than a quarter to get those in place. I hope, and Tim can maybe comment on this as well. Tim Archer : Yes. No, I think as I commented, we're continuously seeing improvements. Most important thing that we prioritized as well as I believe our supply chain did is, first, to establish a stable source of supply and production capability at a level that clearly is less than 100%. But stability being the key. We have customers, as I mentioned, with critical projects, critical production bottlenecks. And so what we wanted to ensure that we were avoiding beyond, of course, in any way endangering employees or our supply chain partners. But beyond that was endangering somehow taking a step back and moving too fast and then having to come back and not actually build the supply at that stable level. So I think day by day, we're able to inch that stable production level up. And I think as we exit this quarter, we'll be at a higher production output capability for sure. And as Doug said, probably working off this stronger customer demand over the next several months. Doug Bettinger : And maybe just one other comment as I was thinking while Tim talked, John. Obviously, we have a plan to execute to a number, and we know what that number is. The reason we decided not to formally provide guidance to a number is, we're just concerned things could change. This is a very dynamic and fluid situation. That's really why we decided not to give you a hard number right now. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, Tim, you guys did a good job in the March quarter, pulling some levers on OpEx and bringing OpEx down. But clearly, you still have a lot of investments on your plates for future growth. So I'm just kind of curious on how you're going to manage OpEx through this environment? Should we think about it growing in line with revenue? Or are there more levers on SG&A that you can pull, but keep R&D growth continuing? How should we think about that dynamic? Tim Archer : Yes, well, clearly, we will continue to prioritize R&D. We laid out some pretty aggressive plans, where we see really great opportunities for the Company at our Investor Day related to new system introductions, continued progress. I mentioned a couple of them today, new etch platform, new ALD progress. We will continue to fund those to the fullest that we can. We are seeing, of course, some very nice OpEx offsets. We're not traveling. And so there are elements of the expense lines that are coming down quite dramatically. So we're going to be prudent. We're not going to spend where we don't have to. A lot of discretionary spending around meetings and events and other things that kind of normally take the course of our normal business, those will not be occurring and we'll be reallocating that money to R&D and other things to ensure we come out of this stronger than we went in. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, John. John Pitzer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, thanks. Doug, I just want to follow-on to that question and see if maybe you could quantify the constraint in June. And obviously, we know what the constraint was in March. But if you could meet all the demand in June, can you give us a sense of maybe where revenue would be? Would it be sort of in excess of $3 billion, maybe $3.1 billion or $3.2 billion [ph]? Doug Bettinger : Tim, I know you were going to come with a question like that. I'm not going to give you a number, but demand is very strong. And I'll simply remind you, what we originally guided in March was $300 million higher than what we delivered at the end of the quarter. Demand didn't change. And I specifically mentioned the $700 plus million in deferred revenue because that's stuff that shipped, but it was an incomplete system. It wasn't a fully functional system. Obviously, that stuff is going to revenue. So there is decent upside to demand. It's just - we're in a supply situation right now that we're working our way through. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, got it. And then just on the suspension of the repo. The stock is down a little bit based on the balance sheet. I get that maybe the topics of share repo right now is not that great. And maybe that's the answer, but you are typically pretty supportive of the stock, and opportunistic around the stock. So can you maybe comment as to why you could retail now and maybe it is just the opposite, but if you could give us some comments there. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes Tim, a little bit of is OpEx [ph], a little bit of it's just being prudent, right? I think every CFO in the world today is focused on liquidity and making sure you have the utmost liquidity. And I'm highly confident in the cash generation capability of the Company. But it just felt like the prudent thing to do to just kind of take a pause on the buyback, get focused on conserving cash. Hook our head up to see where end demand ends up. I do think at the end of the day, there will be some demand disruption. We're not seeing anything from customers yet. But when I look at the consumer-facing semiconductor companies, their business is beginning to be impacted. So I just - I want to get a little more time behind us, Tim, and assess what might actually this look like at the end of the day. And just trying to be prudent with the cash right now is all. Timothy Arcuri : Sure. Okay, awesome. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and great job on the business execution just given the supply chain challenges. You guys characterized the demand environment to your system is remaining [ph] strong. Any way you can somewhat qualitatively or quantitatively describe this demand. You did say that you started this quarter with record backlog. Did you systems bookings actually grow sequentially in the March quarter? Doug Bettinger : You want to take that, Tim? Tim Archer : Yes. I mean, they did. I mean, it's - our comment about - I mean, I guess the best way to look at it is we gave on our January call, our outlook for the year. Now we're not reiterating the year because we recognize, as Doug just said. There's a fair bit of uncertainty about how things may play out with the macroeconomic environment later. But that outlook for the year that we spoke of and the strong demand at the January call, that's the demand we're talking about being unchanged, which means through this first half of the year, the continued strength in foundry and logic, the strengthening demand in memory because recall memory under-invested, we exited the year really in a situation where we felt very good about the need to add in the demand space and also eventually in the DRAM space. And we haven't seen those plans change and that demand remains kind of at the same level it was in January. And which means that we have a full order book, and we're - really, our challenge is how to get these tools to customers. And I would say 100% of my conversation with customers right now are about how to get the tools they need to them. And I think that will continue for some period of time. And as Doug said, we will reassess after that period to see how demand is being affected. Doug Bettinger : And just maybe one incremental comment for me, Harlan. I mean, our customers are investing in very long lead time items. I wouldn't have expected anything to change. We're just monitoring and trying to be cautious about, obviously anything that is a consumer-facing business at the end of the day isn't going to be as strong. We haven't seen anything move through from our customers yet, but we're just - we're trying to be aware of what's going on the environment, I think, is how I'm thinking about how Tim is thinking funny [ph]. Harlan Sur : Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on the innovation of design win pipeline, just given the short-term place here in the Bay Area, wondering if this has slowed either internal projects or collaborative engagement with customers at our research facility in Fremont or some of your other labs globally? Or are the labs considered an essential business process under state or federal guidelines and they are being staffed by the Lam team? Tim Archer : Yes, they are and they are staffed. And as I mentioned in my comments, they're operational. But just as Doug spoke to, Lam is being - our top priority is safety of our employees and others working in our labs. And so we've implemented very strict social distancing protocols, which does limit the overall number of people who can be in the lab at any given time. And so I would say we're not operating the labs clearly at our full capacity for this event. But we are operating. We're able to prioritize critical R&D programs for customers. I did mention in my comments some of these projects, they probably have taken, say, a one-month delay or maybe a two-month delay because of not only the couple of weeks we're shutdown [indiscernible], but then the restart here through the local orders and social distancing. So - but we remain focused on them, and I would say that in the long-term sense of R&D projects and how they play out over time, this is not a - it's not a major disruption to their schedules. Now, your other comment is just on how we're engaged with customers. Clearly, travel is more difficult. But one thing Lam is focused on over the years is building strength in our regions. And so we do have a lot of process engineers and hardware engineers that are deployed out into the region and engaged with customers. And in most cases, our customers have continued to operate in a way that's not dramatically changed from before. And so we're able to engage with them on-site on those critical projects. Harlan Sur : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good execution in these tough times. First question for Doug. Doug, China sales were very strong. Is there anything you can segment it between how much of it was memory versus foundry? How much of it is domestic versus multinational? Then I have a follow-up for Tim. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I'll give you a little color, Krish. Yes, 32% in the China region, a little bit over half of that local Chinese customers. Maybe like 60% might be a reasonable way to think about it local versus the global multinationals. We've got a broad-based set of customers in China, NAND, DRAM, foundry. So it isn't one or the other, Krish. It's broad across all of that spectrum. This is the way you should think about it. Krish Sankar : Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tim, just a big picture question, given that you have been in this industry for a while, and Lam has a broad suite of product. If and when demand slows down, where do you think you'd see [indiscernible] in the productivity products like single-wafer clean, would it be within upgrades of the customer business group. I'm just kind of curious where you think or would it all happen at the same time and it really doesn't matter nitpicking it? Tim Archer : Yes. No, it's a great question. I mean, in fact, I think if we look just to last year as maybe an example, and I'm not saying who knows, I mean, the future could be different than the past. But when we saw things slow down, say, in the memory market, and I talked about the fact that memory spend was down almost 40% last year, we actually see, in those cases, customers turn to how can they get and extract the most out of the installed base they have. So we tend to see things like advanced services and upgrades actually increase during those periods. So that's the strength of our installed base business and why we're so focused on it is because we believe that it is actually one of the areas that can help you weather worse market condition. Obviously, capacity additions would fall away. But again a lot of what we're looking at are technology conversions, ongoing strategic investments from customers, a lot of the investments that we've talked about in China and other places, is very long-term and strategic. And so I don't - I think those would probably be the last places to see R&D, technology, strategic investments, those would be the least affected. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Tim. Tim Archer : Thank, Krish. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. I understand visibility is limited. But when I hear you saying that capacity situation is slowly improving and your customers' CapEx plans are not really changing, I'm curious, what is your best guess on where WFE can land this year? Even qualitative comments would be very useful. Are there certain areas where you think it could be more resilient than others? Just any way to say, directionally where it can be this year would be extremely useful to us? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Vivek. We were debating how much to say about this. I mean, we came into the year expecting the beginning of memory recovery, continued strength in foundry and logic, all of that is still how I see things, how we see things, I think. But I think it would be remiss to just come in and tell you, it's exactly the same as it was a quarter ago. Something is going to get softer, although we're not seeing it yet, honestly, from what we're hearing from customers. To quantify it, I don't know, kind of hard. We said mid-high-50s, 90 days ago, probably low mid-50s might not be an unreasonable way to think about it right now. I do think we're going to see softness at some point and things that are facing the consumer. I don't know. Tim, anything else you'd\u2026 Tim Archer : Yes. No, I think that's a reasonable way to look at it. The other is, and maybe I thought maybe where you're going with this is, at some point, we must resolve the supply issues, otherwise, they start to affect the actual WFE that can be executed in the year. We can't pile everything up on to customers in the back half of the year as a makeup because that's not possible from our own manufacturing, shipping and also the installation and the customers' digestion of that equipment. So I don't think we're quite at that point yet, but we would be where at some point to a certain, if it couldn't be executed simply because of the supply constraints. But if things continue to progress, and as Doug said, we see the June revenue higher and us working through the backlog that I spoke to, then I don't know that we see huge issues with the constraints on WFE. Vivek Arya : All right. And on the services side, thanks for providing that disclosure, do you think that proportion kind of remains for June and the following quarters, so kind of one-third from the services group? Or is there something about the current macro environment? That impacts that ratio one way or another? Doug Bettinger : That's a hard one, Vivek. I mean, what I see happening over a multi-year time frame is the equipment stuff has a little bit more volatility to it and sometimes can accelerate in which case - I mean, installed base business is just kind of a slow and steady grower in some ways along with the installed base. So a lot of stability there. I think as total revenues tick up, probably equipment will pick up a little bit more quickly, at least over the next couple of quarters, I hope. And so the percent would go down, but it will ebb and flow. I mean, historically, how I've described it as 25% to 30%. And obviously, if you do the math on what we just saw, it's more than 30%. Tim Archer : But I think that the reason why we - I mean, obviously, we finally felt it was very important to disclose more details on this business is because the new system shipments and CSBG in any particular quarter are not so directly linked. That's why we like the business so much. And so I would start to recommend people not think about it as the percentage of our business as much as it is a business that we've said we would expect to grow every year. And it has multiple components that give it resiliency from the spares and upgrades and advanced services and Reliant systems. And so, I think in and of itself, maybe it does depend on the growth of the installed base, but that comes a little bit, there's a lagging time indicator there as tools have to ship. They have to go out of warranty, then they start to consume parts and upgrades and such. So I think we're disclosing it, so you can start to think about it as a business that's growing kind of on its own. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Vivek. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Good luck. Operator : We'll take our next question from Atif Malik of Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First one, have your lead times stretched in the current environment? And if yes, by how much? And as a follow-up, Doug, you talked about $8 billion to $9 billion domestic China spending in January. And given the strength in March, are those expectations looking up for the full year in terms of demand? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : I'll let Tim take the lead time question, first. Tim Archer : Yes, I guess - let me take it on. They clearly have stretched. I mean, that's what we're talking about relative to supply challenges and our own challenges. So lead times have stretched out. I don't actually want to quantify it for you on this call, though. I mean it's something - again, it's competitive reasons, but you can imagine, it's - lead times have stretched out, and that's why we're in conversation with the customers about how to get them their high priority tools closer to the original lead times that we would have originally provided. Doug Bettinger : Yes and Atif, what we've said about local China WFE is that in 2019, it was a little bit above $6 billion or above $6 million, and we expected an incremental $2 million to $3 million. Still kind of how I think about it, obviously. I don't know that a whole lot has changed in that regard. Atif Malik : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question is from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. If you compare to the midpoint of the guidance there, there's a $300 million shortfall. What end market or geography were most impacted? It looks like China still have pretty decent growth, but Taiwan was down quite a bit, which is different than what the big foundry guys over there saying. Any color there would be great. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : I don't know that there's any unique geographic distribution between what wasn't able to be supplied versus what we did ship. Nothing is in my head, Sidney, to give you an answer that said [indiscernible]. Tim Archer : Yes. I think it's - the way I would think about it and maybe back to even the previous question a little bit is that each of our - we have a lot of different products. And the makeup of the supply chain for those products is not the same. And even the manufacturing facilities for those products are not all the same. And so I would say it was less about any particular customer not receiving a big chunk of tools as much as certain tools the lead time having pushed out a little bit and those tools kind of slipping out of the quarter. So certain tool types were impacted, I would say, more so than us as a result of where their supply chain was heavily concentrated. Sidney Ho : Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up is, if your June quarter revenue does come in the way you expect, which you think is higher, I guess they're still two more quarters to go for the year. But what are your thoughts on bit growth for DRAM and NAND and maybe leading edge foundry capacity additions, I guess, based on how you think that the second half of the year is going to be? Doug Bettinger : Hard to answer, Sidney. I mean, first thing I'd tell you is our view of the long-term good demand really is unchanged. Now having said that, obviously, a lot of bits are consumed in the mobile space, and that's gotten probably softer given the more direct exposure to the consumer. That's offset, though, by what you see going on in the hyperscale space, which is also [indiscernible], right? The work from home, whatnot and the stuff. Tim had in his script about the likely uptick there. Those two are going to offset. I don't know that I'm ready to quantify it for you just because there's so many moving pieces unless Tim wants to quantify? Tim Archer : No, we debated it, but no. I think the challenges we said, we do recognize there will be areas of strength and weakness. And as Doug has said many times, I think we need to see how, obviously, later in the year, macro is really affecting consumer spending in other segments of the market. We wouldn't sit here today and say that this kind of economic disruption would have no effect. And so just hard to quantify. I think we just have some comfort in knowing that we feel like we came out of - we come into this year and ended this economic disruption without having been a situation of like a lot of spending last year. So if there's one overlining, it's that there was underinvestment last year, so we enter in a pretty good space from that perspective? Doug Bettinger : Yes. The trajectory of growth was declining as we exited last year, and that continues into the first half of this year and the second half will depend on the investments that occur. So maybe something to think about Sidney. Sidney Ho : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe Quatrochi : Yes, thanks for taking the question. Going back to your prior WFE growth expectations, could you provide us any color on just how we should think about - what was it baked into that for capacity expansion versus technology transitions? Tim Archer : Yes, Joe, we didn't - I didn't break it down specifically. What we said was continued strength in foundry and logic. That is what we're seeing. And then some level of a recovery in NAND read that to be - last year in memory, the spending was pretty much all about just node conversions, almost no wafer capacity. And that created a situation where the rate of supply growth continued to decline through the year such that our view was it was below where demand growth was going to be in both NAND and DRAM, right? We had inventory adjusting pricing getting better, all that kind of stuff. I think the real question that's on all of our minds is, okay, what is demand going to do this year. I'm not going to wait into that one quite yet. So that's what we saw. We saw NAND beginning to tick up a little bit, probably adding a few wafers. DRAM, no. DRAM really was a continued trajectory that we saw in '19 through most of '20, maybe a little bit of an uptick. And I think we're just going to wait and see how this plays out to assess what's going to happen there. But that's what we were seeing 90 days ago. That's what we described 90 days ago. Joe Quatrochi : Okay. And then on the strength in China, I mean, it sounds like it could have been even stronger in the March quarter. Is that fair? And then I guess if that's true, do you expect that to grow further in the June quarter, just given that some of that could have slipped into this quarter? Doug Bettinger : I don't know that it would have grown as a percent, Joe. I mean, the supply issue was across every geography, quite honestly. So if you think in percentage terms, I don't know that would have been all that different. Everything had challenges around supply. And then just to frame what we see going on in local China, again, we expected - not expected. Last year was a little above $6 billion, and we saw an incremental $2 billion to $3 billion in China, and that's still pretty much what we see from local China in terms of WFE - that was a statement of WFE. Joe Quatrochi : Okay. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Operator, we'll do one more question. Operator : Okay. Your final question will come from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Quinn Bolton : Thanks, guys for squeezing my in. First question, just trying to reconcile the lower revenue for you guys out of Taiwan in foundry when TSMC put up a record CapEx number in the March quarter. Is that just sort of a timing when TSMC recognizes CapEx? Or do you have any thoughts on that? And then the second question, the social distancing that you put in place in the manufacturing operations, does that slow your cycle times for an extended period of time and reduce your sort of quarterly revenue capacity? Or do you think the plan that you put in place to try and expand footprints can get your back to where your manufacturing output was, say, before you went into the COVID downturn? Thanks. Tim Archer : Okay, great. Let me take both of those. The - relative to Taiwan and your questions there, I think there's no story other than just timing. I mean as Doug said, we had systems impacted in that first quarter. So I don't think there's anything there. From the capacity perspective and social distancing, that was part of what Doug was speaking to. Clearly, within our factories, once we've implemented strict social distancing, we can have fewer people in the same area, I mean space. And so to that extent, our cycle time does stretch out. Some tasks take longer than they would have otherwise and so our overall capacity out of an existing space does decline from what would have been pre-COVID. Now, we're finding ways to reroute our lines and actually gain some of that capability back. But at the same time, as Doug also mentioned, we have access to additional space, and we're moving and expanding into some other areas to recapture that capacity. That takes a little bit of time, but we clearly will execute those plans. And as we see - if we see demand continuing to hold up as we would expect and we need that capacity, we will continue to grow our output. Quinn Bolton : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Quinn. Tina Correia : Okay, operator. I think that will conclude our call today for Lam Research. So thank you all for joining. Operator : This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day, everyone. Take care.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to Lam Research's June Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia. Please go ahead, ma'am. Tina Correia : Thank you, operator. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment and review our financial results for the June 2020 quarter and our outlook for the September 2020 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 o'clock PM, Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3 o'clock PM, Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website. With that I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thank you, Tina. And welcome, everyone. The global pandemic, volatility in the macroeconomy, ongoing US-China tensions. We are operating this year amid tremendous uncertainty and unprecedented challenges impacting people all over the world. We see technology playing a critical role, keeping people connected, enabling businesses to remain productive and accelerating solutions to the myriad of problems the world is confronting. I am very pleased with how Lam's employees have demonstrated care for each other and our communities and have responded with great effort to support our customers' success. As a result of their outstanding execution, today, we are reporting strong performance for the June period and guiding to another quarter of solid growth. Specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, our teams have demonstrated agility and resolve in establishing safe and effective protocols to perform essential work in our facilities, while also enabling the majority of our employees to remain productive while they continue working remotely. We have ramped and stabilized our supply and production capability after an initial period of disruption, to support revenues greater than $3 billion per quarter. As you have seen from our guidance, we will be nearing record output levels for the company in the September quarter, highlighting the effectiveness of our business continuity plans, our global manufacturing network and our trusted supply chain partners. We will continue to capture learnings to further improve business resilience and better serve our customers in the future, but overall, I am proud of what our employees and partners have accomplished during this challenging period. Before discussing our results for the quarter, I wanted to comment briefly on our review of the new rules regarding sales of semiconductor equipment into China. China remains an important part of the global semiconductor ecosystem and Lam has a solid track record of business in this market. We are closely monitoring and complying with all regulatory directives and based on our assessment we currently see no material, financial or business impact from the new rules. Turning now to the June quarter. Revenue and EPS came in above our expectations. Operating margins improved sequentially and we generated over $800 million in cash from operations. As the September quarter guidance indicates, we see continued positive momentum as we move into the second half of the year. The results also represents sustained progress towards our long-term objectives. As we mentioned earlier, our guidance indicates, we are nearing prior record levels of revenue, but we believe that our opportunity for growth remains robust. Key point supporting our view include, one, memory investments must continue to grow to meet secular demand drivers. Lam's memory mix year-to-date as slightly below 60% of system revenues is well below historic highs. We expect our strong memory position to drive outperformance in share of WFE spent, as NAND and DRAM investment levels increase. Two, our actions to improve our Foundry/Logic SAM and Share are yielding results. With our revenue growth in this segment outpacing Foundry/Logic WFE growth cycle-to-cycle. And three, our customer support business group at 34% of total revenues year-to-date is an increasingly greater contributor to our top line than in the past. Looking at the broader WFE environment, our outlook remains strong. While COVID-19 has created volatility for the semiconductor industry, in a larger sense it is underscored the rapidly growing reliance of individuals and businesses on semiconductors and the products and technologies they enable. For example, we are seeing accelerated growth in Internet video traffic, as video becomes embedded in a broad range of business and consumer activities. This is manifesting currently in work-from-home, e-Learning, telehealth, online gaming and of course, video streaming. Nearly 2/3 of global consumers, cite video as their preferred medium for obtaining information. The demand that this places on data transport, analysis and storage, will continue to rise. Mobile networks are migrating to 5G. Video quality is doubling from 4K to 8K and cloud and enterprise data centers are expanding to support the enhanced data traffic. A 2x resolution improvement in mobile video drives roughly a 70% increase in NAND storage content and newer server architectures are expected to have over 30% more memory channels versus prior generations. Despite the recent downtick in smartphone units, our own assessment of NAND content in smartphones, in calendar year 2020 has trended higher versus our prior baseline due to a greater mix shift towards 5G devices. We are also seeing increased NAND demand related to new product cycles in the game console segment, with some of the new platforms adding up to a terabyte of SSD based storage. Launches of the new game consoles are expected to add low to mid-single-digit percent growth to overall NAND bit demand in 2020. These demand drivers in combination with increasing semiconductor manufacturing complexity create a compelling set up for sustained strength in WFE spending. In 2020, we estimate WFE to be in the mid to high $50 billion, driven by growth in both Memory and Foundry/Logic investment. Although we have seen underlying demand drivers fluctuate due to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, our current WFE forecast in total is very close to what we expected at the beginning of the year. From a mix perspective, we see memory share of WFE growing in 2020, off a low 2019 level. This trend should continue into 2021. Particularly in DRAM, we believe inventory levels will be lower as we get to the end of 2020. In both NAND and DRAM, we see bit supply growth lower than long-term demand this year and NAND recovery progressing ahead of DRAM. By geography, domestic China customers continue to be a strong source of WFE demand, with expected calendar year 2020 WFE spend in the $10 billion range. Year-on-year growth in China investment is predominantly driven by NAND and foundry segments. Looking more broadly at longer term global WFE spend, we are increasingly confident that the accelerating digitization of the economy, along with the rising complexity of semiconductor manufacturing at each technology migration is establishing a higher base of WFE spending at the $60 billion level. With this outlook. We are focused on delivering on our objectives to drive greater than 50% growth in revenue and more than a doubling of EPS by 2023, 2024 compared to our 2019 results. Key to achieving these goals is to execute on the SAM expansion, market share growth in installed base revenue opportunities, we laid out at our Investor Day in March. On the system side, we continue to see positive momentum across our businesses. The June quarter marked a record for net penetration and defense wins in our Etch business, as measured by three year forward revenue, which is a metric we began tracking internally a few years ago. We achieved key wins in High Aspect Ratio Mask Open and Contact Etch applications in both DRAM and NAND and leveraging unique hardware capabilities for RF Control an edge yield enhancement that we introduced last year. We have further extended our technical leadership in high aspect ratio processes across both conductor and dielectric etch. We also combine these technologies with our hydro patterning system, which is enabled by Lam's equipment intelligence and uses fab data inputs to improve customer yield. With this system, we were able to secure new positions in Quad and EUV patterning for DRAM. In the June quarter, we also made good progress in our effort to disrupt older equipment segments with more innovative, extendable Lam solutions. With our enhanced ALD family of products, we achieved 2 new wins for 3D NAND gap fill applications and a multi-layer application win in Foundry/ Logic. Superior film quality, integration and architecturally enabled productivity were instrumental to our success. In DRAM and Foundry, we are also seeing accelerated adoption of our ALD solutions for critical spacer applications which have traditionally been done using furnaces. Overall, we believe our enhanced ALD solutions are helping to enable the performance and cost road maps our customers need. At the same time, we continue to help customers extract more value from their installed base of Lam equipment. In the June quarter, our customer support revenues grew approximately 8% from the March period and our revenue growth has exceeded installed base unit growth year-to-date. Our Reliant Systems business posted its eighth straight quarter of record revenues, driven primarily by shipments to analog-mixed-signal CIS and microcontroller segments. The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have also accelerated the deployment of important new technologies for remote equipment support. By enabling real time in fab access to Lam Service Experts located worldwide, we have reduced installation and troubleshooting time without the need for extensive travel. In addition, increasing adoption of our machine learning based analytics, leveraging big data at customer sites is enabling faster detection and resolution of issues. These advances are the result of investments that as we shared at our Investor Day, are targeted delivering services innovation that create value for our customers and also increases our revenue opportunity per chamber. So to wrap up, Lam delivered a very strong June quarter and we see continued strength ahead. We are seeing positive momentum in our efforts to grow our installed base revenue, expand our served markets and increase our market share. And as a result, we believe we are increasingly well positioned to benefit from the long-term secular growth drivers in the semiconductor industry. Thank you, all for joining and for your support. And I'll now turn it over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Awesome. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I hope all of you and your families have been safe and healthy. Our operation steadily improved throughout the June quarter as we executed well in this COVID-19 environment. We've become increasingly more efficient and effective in our operations, which I think are well reflected in the results from the June quarter. Our revenues came in at $2.8 billion driven by broad based demand. Our customers are investing in leading-edge technologies to service the growth you're seeing in 5G, data centers and product cycle driven demand in the gaming console market. Lam's solid execution is reflected in our revenue result, our gross margin performance, as well as our earnings per share that came in at $4.78. I'd also just point out that our deferred revenue balance is back to a more normal range as compared to the end of the March quarter. From a system segment perspective, the total Memory segment in the June quarter increased to 61% of System revenues from the March quarter level, which was at 56%. We saw increases in NAND spending, which contributed 45% of our system revenue which was up from 40% in the March quarter. Net investments are broad based, focused on 64, 96 and initial 128 layer devices. DRAM spending was consistent across the June and March quarters at 16% and continues to be focused on node transition, primarily conversions to 1y and 1z. The combined memory market remains in a healthy place due to proactive inventory management as well as a prudent investment cadence. In Foundry, demand across diverse end-market applications continues to drive the investment profile. While Foundry as a percentage of our system revenue slightly declined from the March quarter percentage of 31% quarter to the June quarter at 29%, revenue actually increased in dollar terms, coming in at the second highest system revenue level for Foundry in Lam's 40-year history. We continue to be pleased with our trajectory here. And finally, the Logic and other segment contributed the remaining 10% of systems revenue in the June quarter as compared to 13% in March. Term investments continue to be strong in the June quarter, with 34% of our total revenue coming from that region. We're seeing investments from customers in all market segments within China. The majority of the revenue again came from domestic Chinese customers. We continue to expect solid investment levels in this region throughout the calendar year. China is obviously an important market for Lam and we remain confident in the strength of our business there. The June quarter revenue for our Customer Support Business group was a record at $927 million representing an increase of 8% from the March quarter level, and an increase of over 17% from the same quarter a year ago. We're delivering sustainable growth across the components of our customer support group in spare parts, service, upgrades and our refurbished Reliant tool business. Within the June quarter, we executed two significant longer term spares contracts, further improving the recurring nature of the revenue streams in this business and demonstrating further evidence of the trust our customers have in us to continuously deliver value. Gross margin for the June quarter was 46.1%. At the start of the June quarter, driven by uncertainties related to the COVID-19 situation, we saw a potential capacity limitations both from our supply chain partners as well as our own internal production capability. However, as the June quarter progressed, we were able to increase our production efficiency. The resulting expansion in production volumes yielded better effect, better factory performance that enhanced gross margin from our original expectations. In addition, gross margins fluctuate, as you know, based on customer and product mix and in the June quarter, we ended up with a slightly more favorable mix than we anticipated at the start of the quarter. We are seeing higher cost due to COVID in several areas, most notably freight and logistics. We're doing our best to mitigate that headwind by managing other expenses in the factories and in the field. During quarter, operating expense came in at $493 million, slightly higher than the March quarter. We focused our spending in the research and development area, as we address our customers' most critical needs. Roughly two-thirds of our spending remains focused towards R&D. Our incentive compensation expense increased in the prior quarter which is tied to our improved profitability levels. At the same time we've managed expenses elsewhere, most notably travel and they came down throughout the June quarter. Operating income in the June quarter was $795 million and operating margin was 28.5%. It was an increase of 160 basis points from the prior quarter. Our tax rate this quarter was 7.6%. Our rate was low in the June quarter, primarily due to a more favorable mix of geographic income and maybe more importantly a one-time year-end adjustments recorded as we closed our fiscal year. We will have fluctuations in the rate from quarter to quarter. You should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low-teens level for your models. Other income and expense increased slightly in the June quarter, coming in at approximately $33 million of expense. Within the June quarter, we were opportunistic with our capital structure. At the end of April, we completed an offering of $2 billion of investment grade bonds with maturities of 10, 30 and 40 years. I was pleased with the demand for our paper, as well as the pricing which came in with coupons of 1.9%, 2.875% and 3.125% respectively. We used $1.25 billion of the debt proceeds to pay down the revolving credit facility that was then outstanding. That facility is now completely paid down. As we discussed in last quarter's call, the cost of our employee deferred compensation plan and the offsetting hedging balances, remain mismatched in the GAAP P&L. You can see these results in the GAAP reconciliation table of our earnings release. Given the volatility in the market in the June quarter, there were large fluctuations between our GAAP expenses in the O line and E lines that the hedge essentially offsets at the net income level. And you should note, the other income and expense balance includes the interest expense of our outstanding debt amounts, obviously, offset by the interest income from our cash and investment balances. You should expect that other income and expense will vary quarter-to-quarter based on several market-related items. Should think about things like foreign exchange. On the capital returns side, we noted in our March quarter earnings call, that we will be pausing our buyback activity during the June quarter, until we had a better line of sight in the business environment. As a result we had only a small amount of share repurchases in the latter part of the June quarter and that together with dividends ended up having us deploy approximately $200 million towards capital return. Long-term capital return of 75% to a 100% of free cash flow remains our plan. Diluted earnings per share, as I said, was $4.78. I mentioned that the one-time benefit from the tax items I referenced was roughly $0.14. Our diluted share balance for the June quarter rounded down to 147 million shares, only a very slight decrease due to the minimal share repurchase activity. The share count includes a dilutive impact of approximately 1 million shares from the 2041 convertible notes. The dilution schedule for the remaining 2041 convertible note is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. Let me now move on to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, increased in the June quarter to $7 billion from $5.6 billion in the March quarter. Cash flows from operations in the quarter were strong at $813 million due to healthy profitability and solid collections during the quarter. Remainder of the increase quarter-over-quarter was related to the debt issuance, offset by the pay down of the revolving credit facility. DSO decreased in the June quarter to 68 days from 80 days in the March quarter demonstrating strong collection performance and the resulting timing of customer payments. Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter at 3.2 times. We have consciously increased our inventory balance to support the higher revenue level that we see in the September quarter. Non-cash expenses included approximately $50 million for equity compensation, $54 million for depreciation and $17 million for amortization. In quarter capital expenditures were consistent with the prior quarter amount coming in at $51 million. Ending head count as of the June quarter was approximately 11,300 regular full-time employees. This headcount reflects added resources in our factory and field operations, supporting increased volume. As well as additions in research and development to support ongoing critical deliverables, like the new Sense.i Etch platform and the dry resist program that we announced at our Investor Day in March. So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2020 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3,100,000,000, plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin increasing to 46.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating margins of 29.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point and finally, earnings per share of $5.15 plus or minus $0.40 based on a share count of approximately 147 million shares. These ranges remain wider than normal, due to the continuing uncertainty from COVID-19. We are well positioned for the second half of calendar 2020 as we expect continued healthy WFE investments. We see continued strength from Memory and Foundry, for that matter, driven by demand in more strategic technology oriented investments. The customer support business group is also expected to provide continued momentum for the company. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Doug, I guess the first question. You're talking about now WFE being mid to high 50s this year. If I look at Q3 and I look at your guidance and your sort of probably going to gain some WFE share this year, it would sort of assume that we're running maybe in the low 60s in Q3. So, I guess if I assume your full-year forecast and I assume maybe you gain of 100 basis points of WFE share this year, something like that, it would sort of imply that December revenue is well sort of flattish and I'm not asking you to guide December, but I'm just kind of wondering whether you think that, that math holds together where you should gain like a little bit of WFE share this year? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Tim, you're absolutely right. We're only guiding one quarter at time but and I'm not going to give you a specific answer on December but I will qualitatively say, I think December will continue to be a strong for us. Your math -- I don't look at WFE on a quarterly basis, I'm sure you're doing the math right, but you're also right about the observation on share spend and where memory is trending and all of those things, we're setting up I think for a pretty good second half, Tim. Operator : Thank you for the question. The next question will come from CJ Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I guess a question on the memory side of things and where are we in the cycle. I know 30% above the recent trough, but still 40% below the prior peak and investors clearly been focused on this aspect. Would love to hear your view, particularly as it relates to any positive trends you highlighted into calendar ' 21? Tim Archer : Sure, I'll start C.J. and then let Doug add something if you want to do. Obviously, what we have, we've been saying for quite some time is that memory is a story of one kind of coming off what was a very strong 2018 and a couple of years of then digesting that, but at the same time, there are underlying growth drivers that I think you're seeing everywhere for both NAND and DRAM, that give us greater confidence in what we've stated is long-term bit demand growth in the high 30s for NAND and in the high teens for DRAM. If those are correct and like I said, I gave you a few of the examples of where the big consumers of NAND and DRAM from an application perspective on the horizon, we think that memory investment has to continue to grow for years to come. Yes, obviously at our Investor Day, we laid out a model of a more normalized memory spending level in the context of total $60 billion WFE and in that environment we grow the company quite significantly. Doug Bettinger : Yes. And C.J. maybe I'd just add, I mean more near term tactically relative to what's going on this year. I think NAND is a little bit ahead of DRAM relative to the pace of recovery. When I look at the market both are kind of managing inventory investment -- investing what I described as or tried to with a prudent cadence, that's gotten end up this year and DRAM maybe up a little bit, but not too much. I really do think DRAM will be more 2021 story. So think about that near term and then on top of that as it relates to Lam, I mean we're doing extremely well in Foundry as well. So, factor that in when you think about what's going on with our company. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And if I could follow up on the service side, you grew that business stellar 70% [Phonetic] year-on-year. Was there any catch up there on the deferred side and I guess, thinking through that, how should we think about the potential for sequential growth and into September, December? How do your tools coming off warranty and upgrades look at least based on your build plan today? Whatever you can share. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, C.J. In this part of the business, the deferred stuff we had at the end of March, really wasn't impacting things. The deferred, if you remember what we described at the end of March, had to do with back ordered shipment. That was really all about new equipment. So I don't think there's anything terribly unique going on in CSBG, Tim unless there's something. Tim Archer : No. I think it's -- again, it's just the efforts as we've said to continue to provide services to grow our revenue opportunity per chamber. And also just our business as you pointed out, as our company continues to grow faster, the installed base grows faster and generates more opportunity. C.J. Muse: Thank you. Tim Archer : I don't think there is anything unique. Doug Bettinger : Yes, thanks, C.J. Tina Correia : Operator, can we go back to Tim Arcuri for an additional question please. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I thought of as Tim only had one question. Operator : Yes ma'am, one moment. Your line is open Tim. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you. Thanks for that Doug. Doug Bettinger : Sorry, Tim. I'm sorry. Timothy Arcuri : Yes, sure. Sure, no worries. So, the second question, I guess, can you go through a little bit about the, how the whole military end use thing is transpired, it seems like China WFE is a little higher, the domestic stuff is maybe $1 billion to $1 billion higher than you thought it would be and it seems like now all these customers know that there is restrictions looming at some point. So they're going to keep on pulling stuff in. So can you just talk about how the export controls have transpired? Is commerce happy just as long as you do the due diligence with the customer on military end use? Can you just kind of talk about all that? Thank you. Tim Archer : Sure, I mean, I think Tim, in my comments I talked about our assessment. It was quite an extensive diligence process that we went through which consisted both of our own conversations in questioning of the customers and their certification as well as the use of third party research and also validation by outside counsel and we arrived at our conclusions, as I stated, no material, financial or business impact as a result of all of that work. Now, that is an ongoing activity for us, means that we are continually assessing and doing that kind of research and so that's something that we have committed to but at this point that is our conclusion, if by your question about and connection to domestic China WFE. I don't think that's a connection that we're making and basically we are saying that China has plans to invest and I indicated that a lot of the investment is coming from NAND as well as Foundry and at least in our view right now. We have not made that connection that somehow domestic China WFE is in any way really affected by these rules one way or the other. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Tim, maybe a comment from me, my sense is, it's not, there is nothing pulled in say no, we may be wouldn't know if it was or wasn't a little bit. But given we've concluded the rules are not impacting our ability to ship. I don't know why anybody would think there should be pulling things in right. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome. Okay, thank you much. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Great job on the business execution and strong results. One of the large logic manufacturers recently talked about the potential of moving to a more outsourced business model. Maybe just a continuation of the industry trend towards a fabulous business model. At a high level, it would appear to be a zero-sum game. But wanted to get your views on the potential ramifications of your business in a structural move in the industry towards a more fab like or fabulous business model. Tim Archer : Yes, okay. Let me try to take that, Harlan, to start. Obviously, we don't want to comment about the specific plans of any one customer, but to your point of the industry moving to outsource model, I mean, obviously that's a more than 20 year story and I think that anything that allows wafers ultimately to be produced with better technology at lower costs, however, that's done, in-house or outsourced, is what's good for the industry and that's good for Lam. I'm quite certain that as a result of the advances that have happened on the Foundry side, Lam's business has benefited tremendously in the last 20 years and that just comes back to a statement that I've made a number of times, which is the best thing for Lam is that technology nodes continue to migrate. We have greater SAM at every technology node migration across NAND, DRAM and Foundry logic and so every company has to decide for themselves, what's sort of the best answer to advancing technology at the best cost. That can be in-house, can be outsourced. What we care about is whether that technology advances and more wafers get produced and so I think, we obviously watch it and we look at the impact on our business. But ultimately Foundry hasn't been bad for the industry or for Lam. Harlan Sur : Absolutely. Doug Bettinger : Yes. And Harlan, just one or two comments from me. The way I think about it is what matters to Lam is the number of leading edge wafers in the entire industry that are put in place, whether it's in-source, outsource, largely doesn't matter too much. Either way it needs equipment, right? Independent of where it goes, we're selling largely the same things to the industry. Harlan Sur : Yes, that's great insights there. Good to see the recovery of the business and the improvement in the supply chain and logistical bottlenecks. Just wondering, Doug, if the team is still, even with this strong September quarter guide, playing catch up on the delinquent backlog as a result of the earlier bottlenecks and if so, how much of that has yet to be worked down? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Harlan. I think we've got nicely caught up. I don't think we're completely caught up as we sit here today, but we made very nice progress during the quarter. Harlan Sur : Great, thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Doug, just maybe a follow on to Harlan's question, it sounds like COVID was still a cost headwind in the June quarter. I'm wondering if you can help us quantify that and as you look out into September with the guide how much sort of COVID logistical expense is still in there and when do you think you might be able to take that out of the model? Doug Bettinger : Yes, John. The biggest individual item, when I look at it is freight and logistics. I mean freight lanes are more restricted than they were obviously pre-COVID. Things are more expensive. Really tough to mitigate that. I mean, to a certain extent, you take the price, you do your best negotiate it, but you're somewhat of a price-taker there. That doesn't mean we're not, as I tried to describe working to drive efficiency, effectiveness elsewhere in the operation. That's what Lam is extremely good at doing and we're doing that, but that is where the challenges are right now. I'm not going to quantify it, John. But it is impacting gross margin to a certain extent. I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything. Tim Archer : No. The only thing I'd add is; obviously, Doug pointed out some near term headwinds on the cost side. You know fully, we would expect those to eventually roll back as things normalize post COVID. But I mentioned this point of the acceleration of remote support technologies. And I think that's -- while we haven't fully quantified kind of what the benefit could be, clearly some of the benefits of less travel and more productivity of kind of worldwide engineers who can now connect into fabs and provide expertise via some new technologies, that actually will be likely a cost and kind of personnel benefit for us, so in -- down in the future. And so we're investing in that and I think it's a positive headwind just further -- positive tailwind just up further down the road. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then, Tim, you guys covered a lot of ground at the Analyst Day earlier this year, but you couldn't cover everything. I'm kind of curious if you can kind of spend a few minutes talking about your positioning in advanced packaging, because clearly, there's not a lot of volume in sort of chiplets today, but as you look at Intel moving to their second generation 10 nanometer part sometime in the second half of next year, it seems like the tiles last chiplet strategy is really poised to accelerate starting in the back half of next year and going forward. And I know you guys have some good leverage there, but I'm just trying to get a sense of quantifying and how big do you think that market opportunity is. Tim Archer : Sure. I don't know if I'm -- I don't know if we're prepared quite to quantify it for you on this call, but what I can tell you, is it kind of follows on from my earlier comment about customers and just the industry in general looks for the best way to achieve the performance that's required at the lowest cost. And sometimes that's by looking at total system performance and these advanced packaging 3D chiplets, these sorts of technologies, actually are one way to deliver system performance without having to necessarily utilize the most advanced node chips for every application. And our position has been very strong. We've been -- we were an early investor there. We have leading positions on both the etch and depth side in TSV applications and we think that we're extremely well positioned when that comes. And so, every time we hear about acceleration, we're actually quite encouraged. But it's something that our high aspect ratio etching processes and our ability, I think most people recognize our leadership for 20 plus years in copper electroplating fill. Those are critical technologies for these 3D packaged and heterogeneous integration applications. John Pitzer : Helpful. Thank you, guys. Tim Archer : Thanks, again. Yes, thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Tim, I had a question on memory. Clearly memory, WFE is the underspending right now and your revenue has a lot of potential upside. If I look at the last cyclical peak which was in March 2018, if you are able to get back to those kind of WFE levels for memory, how will Lam's revenue profile look like in memory, given that you gain some shares? Is there a way to quantify it, to see how much higher, you could be versus the last cyclical peak? And then I had a follow-up. Tim Archer : I think Doug's signaling, I can't quantify that. Of course, we have quantified it and that's why my comment was, we believe our opportunity. We knew there'd be this peak question but my comment was, regardless of the fact that our revenues are approaching the last time and therefore the peak question starts to come up, the setup is quite different and in fact, that's why we pointed out, our memory mix today is a much lower. WFE is not back there and so I guess probably you can do the -- do it just as easily as we can. But there is still significant upside as memory growth continues not only to return to prior levels, but also to continue to grow to meet all of these new application drivers that we've talked about. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Krish. Obviously, when we put a financial model out, not all that long ago in March, we comprehended some aspect of memory being at a higher investment level. CSPG growing. Our strength in foundry continuing to grow. So you have the data points. Tim Archer : It's kind of all in there. Doug Bettinger : It's all in there. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. No worries. And then I have a question on your ALD traction. I'm just curious like when you look at the ALD, like clearly that market is going to continue growing. You guys are like a number two player in that, I would probably say. How much of the -- how much of the growth in ALD is actually driven by technology versus the fact that productivity for ALD tools is still pretty low? Which is driving the bigger upside in ALD? Tim Archer : Well, all of these new adoptions that I keep talking about, these are, these are LAM's efforts to expand the application base for ALD and which means it's a technology-driven decision. But usually what has -- I mean, in the past, what has held back ALD from adoption in many of these cases was, it's great technology, but the productivity wasn't -- it wasn't affordable to put in at a certain nodes. So people pushed it out. What we've done is, we've married both an expanding film set, more applications with, as I said, architecturally enabled productivity and we're getting a lot of traction across a number of different applications. I talked about 3D NAND gap fill, talked about a multilayer application in Foundry/Logic that's a different material, talked about critical spacers and so it's just we've broadened I think the target market for ALD and we're seeing good traction. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Tim. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Krish. Yes. Tim Archer : Thanks, Krish. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Doug, you mentioned that for 2020 domestic China, you guys are expecting about $10 billion in spend. Curious, what's the rough split between memory versus logic and foundry? And on the memory side, I feel like both you and the broader industry is currently in a sweet spot where your customers are spending, but they're not really contributing to supply. At what point would you expect them to start to really move the needle on supply and as a result of capital intensity come down in local China? And then i have a follow-up. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, no problem, Toshiya. We haven't quantified what is in which segment in China but I forget if Tim said or if I said it in the script, it kind of blurs in my mind sometimes, we said its broad-based in China, in all segments. So it isn't just one, it's a broad set of customers that are investing. So, think of it that way, it's not one or the other. And you're right and I wouldn't characterize China's inefficient in the investment, it's just when customers are investing for the first time or are relatively new to investing in capacity, you got to buy it. Then you have to ramp it and it takes time for that to happen. It's not unique to any one geography or any one customer that is really what's going on and over time customers get more efficient as they ramp things. That's how I think about it, Tim. I don't know\u2026 Tim Archer : Yes, no, as you suggest in the earlier question, I think thinking about the model we've put out just back at Investor Day, I think by the time you get to the 2023-2024 timeframe, we've comprehended that those additions in China are effectively the same as additions elsewhere in the world. So we don't think there is some extra inefficient spending in that case that's driving numbers higher for Lam. So I think if you just look back at that model that's a relatively efficient spend across all segments in 2023-2024. Toshiya Hari : Got it, thank you for that. And then as a quick follow-up. Doug, in your prepared remarks, you talked about winning two service contracts in the quarter, I believe I wasn't sure if you meant to highlight it as a meaningful dynamic here but did those contracts at all drive incremental growth going forward, or does it change how we should be thinking about quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year volatility and your installed base business or profitability going forward? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : No, not really, Toshiya. I mean I just mentioned it because one, they were a little bit longer term and two, they were bigger than perhaps typical and to me is very much part of how we run this business. It's the customer has faith and confidence in your ability to deliver and provide value, it is consistent with what we expect that business to do and it has done in the past. I just mentioned it because it was notable when we looking at the results this quarter. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Toshiya. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Blayne Curtis : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and a great result. Just kind of curious. from a high level, the wafer front-end, you're keeping the same amount in your catching up to. I'm just kind of curious as you look at it, the way the year shaking out. I think there's a lot of doubts whether you hit that number, is it the same contribution and then any comments on the strength in the second half by geography would be helpful? Doug Bettinger : Blayne, are you asking about WFE? Was that your question? Just wanted understand. Blayne Curtis : I'm curious as you're still seeing the same WFE forecast for the year and kind of curious... Doug Bettinger : Yes. Blayne Curtis : Is it contribution as we thought starting the year and then any comments on geography, particularly into the back of the calendar year? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I think Tim specifically mentioned in his script there's puts and takes in here, right. It's ended up at the same level. I would suggest to you that more consumer-oriented stuff is a little bit weaker, smartphones, as an example, smartphone units aren't the same as we thought at the beginning of the year that is creating a little bit of a downtick but that's offset by other things going on in hyperscale cloud consumption of silicon, work-from-home type things and net-net, one is up a little bit once down a little bit. We're in the same place that we began the year. Blayne Curtis : And then, just -- I was just curious from a geographic perspective, if you had any color into the growth into September? Doug Bettinger : No, we never forecast the GOPs. I wouldn't expect it to be wildly different than what you've seen over the last couple of quarters or so from a directional standpoint. Blayne Curtis : Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Blayne. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious about WFE growth outside of China, because when I look at your first half ex-China sales are down in the last fiscal year. So when do we see -- why are we seeing these trends, I understand this is probably a very short frame, timeframe for looking at these trends, but I'm just curious, qualitatively, why are we not seeing the same kind of WFE growth outside of China, because I imagine everyone is exposed to the same growth drivers? Doug Bettinger : Vivek, I mean obviously the majority of WFE spending is outside of China. 2/3 of it is outside of China. Right. And so you're seeing the contribution of WFE across every geography, right. It's more about what's going on in the end markets. That's how you should be thinking about it right. Foundry is strong this year, NAND up from last year, DRAM maybe up a little bit, but to a large extent that's geographically independent. Vivek Arya : No. I guess my question is that when I look at last year WFE was I think 50- 51, this year you're guiding it up $5 billion to $7 billion, but a big part of that growth is coming from China. Right. The incremental growth is coming from China. So I'm just curious why we are not seeing WFE spending outside of China at that same pace or is that just something we will see next year perhaps? Doug Bettinger : Yes. No, you are -- I mean there three to four probably incremental in China and the rest of it is outside of China. Vivek? Vivek Arya : Okay. As a follow-up, CSBG, thanks for providing that info. So it grew I think about 7% or so last fiscal year. I'm curious what it -- how much it grew the prior fiscal year and what part of that, should we think of that as kind of recurring and this is such an important part of your business that I'm always very curious about how to correlate this to your growth in chambers. Is this correlated to your chamber growth from two years ago or three years ago? Just how should we take this 7% number, and I don't know how to forecast your CSBG business. I guess that's really what I'm trying to ask. Doug Bettinger : If you're thinking about forecasting, we gave you data points at the Investor Day, which was Pat Lord, who manages this business for us suggested that by 2023-24, it will have grown 40%. So there is your data point for how to forecast it. Chamber count is critically important but Pat and Tim talked about, it's not just chambers, it's dollar per chamber growing from, I think we, I forget what year we indexed it back to 2013, maybe... Tim Archer : 2013. Doug Bettinger : It was one point. Yes, it was 1.0 then it had gone to 1.5 and we had objectives to continue growing it to 1.7, which was what was baked in the model. So that's how you should think about it. Chamber count is important. We're also driving some of the innovative service offerings like Tim talked with remote diagnostic on equipment and things, to try to add more value for the customers and get paid for it. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my question. Just as a follow-up to the prior question, how should we model the customer support over the next few quarters? Should we just track the memory investment you highlighted as doing better than foundry or would it be more in line with the overall revenue trend line that you described earlier? Tim Archer : Yes. I think that again it's -- the beauty of the CSBG business is, it probably -- it doesn't change on the time scale that you're talking about here relative to any particular quarter's change in shipments. I don't think you're going to see that and we have an installed base in excess of 60,000 chambers. And we're driving revenue in our CSBG business off of tools that were shipped 20 plus years ago and there is upgrade cycles in their service contracts that Doug talked about, there's consumable parts. And so I don't think you're going to see that. But as I said, that's the beauty of this. This is the, let's say, it's a stabilizing function for the company's revenue, and that's why we're investing heavily in this and it delivers value for the customers in reuse of and extension of installed tools. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. I believe this is the first quarter that you're actually breaking this out and I was just trying to better understand whether the Customer Support Business Group would grow faster with memory or with foundry or with a bit of same for different end markets. Tim Archer : Yes, I can -- okay. Well, I think it's the second quarter that we've actually put out the data. But I think the couple of pieces of information to think about. One is, we've said that the business will grow every year and that's simply because again the installed base is growing every year and again we're investing to try to create more services, value-added services and products for that installed base. We haven't really made a comment about, does it grow every quarter. I mean, because it's -- again it's --you can be influenced by certain service contracts, certain upgrade decisions that customers make in any given quarter, but year-to-year, you can think about it growing every year. It maybe a little bit less about segments. I've talked in the past about critical applications and Lam's focus on critical applications and the importance of that. I mean, one, they are sticky, but two, they actually tend to drive more parts and service requirements because the customers have to keep those systems at absolute top performance because they're performing the most difficult applications in the customers' fab. And so you tend to see a little bit more pull-through on the CSBG business for the critical applications where Lam is extremely strong. And so maybe that's -- yes, maybe it's a little less by device type but more by the application requirements. And also critical applications tend to drive a more frequent upgrade cycle as the customers need to keep the installed base kind of performing for that latest technology node. Mehdi Hosseini : Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. JoeMoore: Great, thank you. I know you guys said you had --you were working your way through the supply challenges but I wonder if you could help us kind of with what the quarterly revenue progression might have looked like if you hadn't had those. You had said in March, to get about $300 million of revenue deferred by the supply challenges. Should we view June as kind of having caught up to that and then this surge in September is more shipping directed demand or just what would that have looked like if you hadn't had the supply challenges that you had? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Joe. I didn't quantify that. I'd say we've got nicely caught up. I also said we're not completely caught up at the end of the June quarter and that's as much as I think we're going to give you right now. We're driving efficiencies. We're getting much better. I think, Tim and I are pretty happy with how the supply chain is performing. Joe Moore : All right. Great, thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe Quatrochi : Yes, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results from me as well. I think you mentioned that your capacity from a manufacturing perspective is over $3 billion per quarter now with all the issues with the supply chain. Is there a scenario over the next few quarters where you see potentially demand outstripping what you can deliver? Tim Archer : Well, we have a global manufacturing factory network that we're highly confident in, I think it's unlikely that that's the scenario. I didn't want --I did not give you a maximum output for our factory network. I was only wanting to indicate that clearly we were supply constrained in the last quarter, was one of the reasons why we were unable to provide our normal guidance. Now with capability beyond $3 billion, we're confident in our September quarter and we're confident that over time, we'll continue to ramp that higher and higher. So it was -- we're not going to divulge our exact manufacturing capacity, but I'm quite certain we can continue to meet higher demand. Joe Quatrochi : That's helpful. And then just... Doug Bettinger : Go ahead, Joe. Joe Quatrochi : Just a quick one on capital return. Should we think about your comments of reiterating your long-term target model for 75% to 100% of free cash flow is kind of indicative that we should start to see maybe some more -- or maybe at a re-accelerations on the share repo in the current quarter and into the end of the year? Doug Bettinger : Yes, probably, Joe. I mean, we said last quarter, we were pausing in -- we actually came back into the market a little bit before the end of the quarter. So we're back, looking at things and I've always said it's opportunistic in terms of how we do what we do and we'll continue to be opportunistic. Joe Quatrochi : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Joe. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Okay. The next question will come from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Weston Twigg : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into the operating costs a little bit. Just understanding that people aren't really traveling right now, you're probably saving some money, you mentioned some tailwinds around remote servicing. But should we expect operating cost to ramp up meaningfully in 2021 assuming there is some sort of post-pandemic return to kind of a normal level of business and travel and marketing? And I kind of noticed that you added some head count as well. So I would assume that that would roll in and I don't know if that continues through next year. But just kind of wondering how next year works from an operating cost standpoint? Doug Bettinger : Weston, I'm not going to give you a forecast for next year yet. I think there'll be plus or minuses assuming we get back to normal, we get a vaccine, the therapeutic regimen, what have you. I think we're going to learn from how we're operating right now and be better over time. I mean that's what Lam is really very good at. Looking at an opportunity, getting better and systematically doing it that way. I think we will do that. And yes, if we get back to normal travel, come back a little bit. I don't think it would come back -- comes back to where it was, but again, we'll keep managing the P&L in the right way. Tim Archer : Yes, I think the only thing I'd add is at the same time, we've, obviously, I think we have a great track record of managing OpEx and you can kind of look at the results to support that. But we are investing in our 2023, 2024 plans. I mean, you've seen some of our announcements recently. The construction of a technology center in Korea, obviously there's expenses associated with that. It's a strategic investment to expand our R&D capabilities, put it closer to some of our largest customers. We are building a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia, which again is going to expand our global manufacturing network, provide additional business resilience, help take some cost out of manufacturing structure. So, there are some near-term investments that we're confident in our long-term plan. And so we are pushing those through even right now. And we are seeing some of that reflected in our expenses as well, so, maybe that's offsetting a little bit some of the savings that that Doug talked about. But I wanted to get into the product and R&D, we continue to push more into R&D because we think it's the long-term growth engine of the company and we are really confident in our product pipeline and new products coming out. Weston Twigg : Okay, that's very helpful context. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Wes. Okay, operator -- yes. Tina Correia : Thank you all for joining today, we appreciate it. And stay safe and healthy. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thank you, Tina. And welcome, everyone. Lam delivered very strong September quarter results. Revenues and gross margin came in above the midpoint of the guided range. Operating margin and diluted earnings per share exceeded the high end of the range. Our performance reflects solid execution across the company. The operating environment remains challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the tremendous dedication of Lam's employees and our partners worldwide is enabling us to perform at a high level.  Notably, the September quarter marked record revenue and diluted earnings per share for the company and was also the first quarter in which we have exceeded $1 billion in revenue from our customer support business group. At the midpoint of our December quarter guidance, we will be growing EPS more than 35% year-over-year in 2020. Investments we are making in manufacturing and supply chain resilience are enabling us to meet customers\u2019 critical needs in a period of strong demand and are preparing us for the continued growth we see ahead. Before I talk about market and product trends, I want to touch upon China-related trade regulations. As has been widely reported, U.S. regulations have impacted our ability to ship wafer fab equipment and parts to a large foundry customer in China. We're working with regulators on this issue and have applied for licenses to ship equipment and parts that are subject to restrictions. As a result of the current situation, our December quarter guidance reflects an impact to sales to this customer. From a market perspective, we see positive momentum in the underlying drivers of semiconductor growth and believe this translates into a healthy outlook for Lam's business. Work and learn from home trends continue to drive demand in key electronics categories, including PCs, storage, and networking. Third-party data suggests that growth in PC, notebook, and workstation shipments in the calendar third quarter surpassed a 10-year high to reach record levels. Moreover, some memory manufacturers have noted shipping record levels of consumer solid-state drive bits in their most recent quarter. We believe that many of the changes brought about by this year\u2019s shift to remote working and learning environments will be structural. The net result will be a pull forward of key long-term secular growth themes for the semiconductor industry, including accelerated build out of cloud data centers and expansion of high-speed communication networks. Against this backdrop, we see WFE spending growing across NAND, DRAM, and Foundry/Logic supported by demand fundamentals that should drive continued WFE strength into 2021. Overall, our expectation for WFE in calendar year 2020 remains unchanged from our prior outlook of the mid to high $50 billion range with an improved memory mix compared to 2019. Leading edge spending in Foundry/Logic remains robust, with rising capital intensity and the secular growth drivers discussed earlier, effectively resetting equipment spending expectations to a higher level in this segment for the foreseeable future.  We are also experiencing strong pull for trailing edge Foundry/Logic nodes, due to a pickup in the automotive, IoT, and image sensor markets. This helped us deliver in the most recent period, another quarter of record sales for our Reliant business. In NAND, we see spending increasingly focused on 9x layer and beyond devices where higher capital intensity for etch and deposition, combined with Lam's strong market share positions create even greater opportunity for the company than at prior nodes. Year-on-year total NAND installed wafer capacity is expected to remain flat, with NAND bit supplies growth still tracking below long-term demand as we exit calendar year 2020. In DRAM, customers continue to invest cautiously and supply growth remains below long-term demand. As a result, we see a positive setup for next year and believe DRAM spending will increase as we progress into 2021. We expect to provide our full 2021 WFE outlook in our January earnings call. Turning now to our business updates. We recorded solid progress in the September quarter towards our long-term growth objectives. A fundamental part of our strategy is to deliver broad innovation in equipment, process, and support capabilities to help our customers accelerate the transition of next generation 3D devices into high volume manufacturing. We are developing a pipeline of differentiated products and services to address what we believe is one of the most pressing challenges for our customers. The need to drive on ever more complex leading-edge devices, the node-to-node cost per bit and cost per transistor reductions that have been the key to our industry\u2019s success.  With this goal, we are investing significant focus this year in two areas : One, accelerating our vision for Equipment Intelligence solutions. And two, extending our technology leadership in critical high aspect ratio processing. First, Lam Equipment Intelligence is a suite of capabilities, including data-driven modeling, state-of-the-art sensing, adaptive feedback algorithms, augmented reality, remote support, and self-maintenance hardware, aimed at shortening process development times and delivering predictable manufacturing ramps at lower cost with fewer resources. Our groundbreaking Sense.i etch platform introduced earlier in 2020 is a great example of a tool designed to leverage our holistic approach to our Equipment Intelligence offerings. On Sense.i, these capabilities are used to enhance RF and temperature control, improve edge yield, automate routine maintenance activities, and reduce chamber matching times across large fleets of tools. In the September quarter, we continued to gain traction for this new product with initial shipments to two additional memory customers. We have aligned roadmap insertion plans with the top memory manufacturers and expect to ship multiple repeat systems in the next few months. While new platforms like Sense.i are designed for Equipment Intelligence from initial concept, we have also demonstrated this year that customers can realize significant value by deploying select elements of our Equipment Intelligence solution set as options or upgrades for their current generation systems. For example, our Corvus R automated self-maintenance feature available on our Kiyo conductor etch system has been proven to shorten maintenance cycles and improve process repeatability on critical and semi-critical applications. As a result, the installed base of Kiyo etch systems equipped with Corvus R technology is on pace to expand by more than 4 times in calendar year 2020. Lam Equipment Intelligence is also enabling new types of remote support that have proven vital to business resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Big data analytics approaches to enhance troubleshooting and simplified process optimization are seeing growing adoption. In 2020, our data enhanced service activities are on track to grow 3x over the prior year. Virtual reality technologies are allowing us to continue training engineers across the globe to further develop their skills on our latest systems without the need for international travel.  Similarly, the latest innovations in augmented reality headset devices are allowing us to connect the engineers at customer sites to real time experts support in our factory, often as much as halfway around the world. Our customer support business group is projecting 6x growth in remote support engagements this year. We believe building an ecosystem of smart tools and intelligent services will help drive sustainable cost reductions across the semiconductor manufacturing process and generate growth for our installed base business. Revenue from our productivity-focused offerings, including advanced services is expected to grow approximately 25% in this calendar year. In the area of process technology, the continued vertical scaling of 3D device and packaging architectures across all market segments creates a compelling long-term growth story for Lam. Over the past decade, we have built a winning track record in etch and deposition at the 3D inflection; most notably, in the transition to 3D NAND. In the September quarter, we further extended our lead in 3D NAND with favorable high aspect ratio conductor etch [decisions] for devices beyond 200 layers and new application wins in dielectric ALD gapfill and carbon hard mask deposition. Our high aspect ratio processing expertise also applies to emerging 3D packaging architectures. In Foundry/Logic it has been estimated that 3D heterogeneous integration solutions can enable cost reductions of approximately 20% for leading-edge nodes. In addition, 3D chip stacking is delivering performance advantages for advanced image sensors and high bandwidth memory. We expect etch and deposition intensity in advanced packaging and our corresponding revenue opportunity to continue to increase as more integration schemes leverage 3D scaling. In the most recent quarter, we received multiple follow on orders for our SABRE 3D electroplating and Syndion etch tools for this market. And since 2015, our installed base for both tools has doubled. Looking forward, I am more confident than ever that Lamb's capabilities and strategic investments are well aligned with the fundamental needs of our customers and our industry. The complexity and cost scaling challenges for future technology nodes require comprehensive innovation in products and services that drive efficiencies from the very beginning of the design process all the way through to the support and maintenance activities in a high volume manufacturing fab. This focus is fast becoming the thread that ties together our strategic growth objectives. And we are pleased that we are beginning to see the results of our efforts reflected in our strong financial performance. Thank you again for joining today's call, and now here's Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone has continued to remain safe and healthy. We're extremely pleased with our operational and financial execution in the September quarter. We delivered record performance in multiple areas, including total revenue, which came in at $3.18 billion. And as Tim mentioned, as part of that revenue, we achieved over a $1 billion of revenue in our customer support business group. These results are clear evidence of our ability to grow the company and meet the needs of our customers while further improving our business resiliency. Our September revenues increased 14% from the June quarter driven by customers\u2019 technology investments to meet long-term growth opportunities. These opportunities range across multiple vectors such as data centers, 5G networks, smartphones, gaming consoles, and personal computers. In the September quarter, we also had a record level of earnings per share coming in at $5.67, the results of our solid revenue and gross margin performance. Let me now move on to provide some color on our systems revenue. There were continued strong investments in the Foundry segment, and we had the highest system revenue dollars per foundry in our company's history. Our customers invested broadly with spending targeted at 14, 7 and 5 nanometers. Foundry represented 36% of our systems revenue for the September quarter. The Memory segment was also strong in the September quarter coming in at 58% of systems revenue. NAND represented 39% of our system quarter revenue with investments spanning 64, 96 and 128 layer devices. We saw increases in DRAM spending, which contributed 19% of our systems revenue, which was up for 16% in the June quarter. Customer investments focused primarily on node transitions to 1y and 1z. We continue to see memory bit supply growth in the near term below long-term demand growth, supporting our belief that the memory market remains a healthy place from an inventory management as well as investment standpoint. And finally, the Logic and Other segment was down quarter-to-quarter and contributed the remaining 6% of systems revenue in the September quarter compared to 10% in June. For regional revenue concentration, as we discussed last quarter, we see solid levels of investment in the China region, which came in at 37% of total revenues in the September quarter. The majority of that revenue again came from domestic Chinese customers in the quarter. We have a broad base of customers in the China region. And despite the trade regulations that have impacted us with certain customers, we see continued strength in this region for our business from both domestic and multinational customers. We achieved another record quarter of revenue for our customer support business group at just over $1 billion, as I previously mentioned. This was an 11% increase from the June quarter level and over 28% higher versus the same quarter in 2019. In addition to the strength of our advanced service offerings we\u2019re optimizing the capabilities of our installed base through technology and productivity upgrades. We also continue to see strong demand in the refurbished tool business driven by growth in various applications within the specialty technology markets. You should think about things like IoT, RF and power devices. We're on track to deliver the growth objective of over 40% cumulative revenue growth between 2019 and 2023 for CSBG that we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 47.5% at the high end of our guidance range. Customer and product mix are always factors impacting our gross margin. We also experienced favorable impacts in the quarter related to increased factory and field utilization. We made more progress on our production efficiencies as we operate with COVID-19 related safety protocols. We are experiencing higher costs in the global freight and logistics area and expect these elevated costs will continue until broader air freight availability becomes available. September quarter operating expenses were $523 million. Over two-thirds of our spending remains focused on R&D as we continue to make progress in our growth initiatives for market share, and technology disruptions to expand our serve available markets. Incentive compensation was higher as well during the quarter related to our higher profitability levels. We are maintaining travel and other expenses at lower levels as we continue to work remotely in many locations.  Our operating margin in the September quarter came in over the guidance range at 31.1% with operating income of $988 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.9%. We will have fluctuations in our tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, and you should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level. As we've noted before, we expect other income and expense will vary quarter-to-quarter based on several market related items, think about things like foreign exchange and the level of interest rates.  Other income and expense was approximately $51 million in expense, which was higher than in the June quarter. The increase was driven by lower interest income on our cash and investment balances, as well as the impact of a full quarter of interest expense associated with the $2 billion debt offering that we completed at the end of April. Let me now shift gears and move on to capital return. We continue to drive strong cash flow and remain committed to the targets we laid at our Investor Day earlier this year to have our capital return at 75% to 100% of free cash flow. We were active in our buyback activity during the September quarter and repurchased approximately $450 million of stock. In addition, we paid $167 million in dividends in the quarter. I would also like to highlight that we announced in August a dividend increase from $1.15 to $1.30 per share each quarter, which was paid in October. Diluted earnings per share came in at $5.67, above the guidance range we provided for the September quarter. Our diluted share count was essentially flat for the September quarter at 147 million shares as we expected. The share count includes the dilutive impact of approximately 900,000 shares from the 2041 convertible notes. The dilution schedule for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference.  Let me now move on to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased slightly in the September quarter to $6.9 billion from $7 billion in the June quarter. Cash flows from operations came in at $643 million, which is solid performance in an environment where we continue to deploy cash towards working capital to support increased business volumes. DSO decreased slightly in the September quarter to 66 days from 68 days in the June quarter. Inventories turns were also slightly down from the prior quarter coming in at 3.1 times. Inventory balances are somewhat higher, as we are growing inventory to support higher business levels, as well as to mitigate risk and potential supply chain disruptions. Non-cash expenses were approximately $56 million for equity compensation, $56 million for depreciation, and $17 million for amortization. Capital expenditures in the September quarter increased from June to a total of $63 million. We are slightly ramping up capital spending to support things like the Sense.i platform development, our new Malaysia factory and the technology lab that we announced in Korea. Ending headcount for the September quarter was approximately 11,700 regular full time employees. We added resources to support the higher levels of customer activity in the factory and in the field. Additionally, we're supporting new activities in research and development areas like Sense.i, enhanced ALD and dry resist. Looking ahead, I'd now like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2020 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $3.3 billion plus or minus $200 million; gross margin of 46% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin is a bit lower as we see a less favorable mix, as well as ongoing COVID-related expenses; operating margins of 29.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $5.60 plus or minus $0.40 based on a share count of approximately 146 million shares. Now, in an effort to address your question, I know everyone has concerning our business with a large Chinese foundry, I'll just give you a direct update relative to the guidance. As Tim mentioned, we are fully complying with all regulations and have applied for licenses to allow us to ship tools and parts to them. The status of the license approval is uncertain. The revenue and earnings guidance I just provided is lower than it otherwise would have been as a result of this uncertainty. With the results we've delivered and the guidance we've provided for the December quarter, the 2020 calendar year is expected to be the strongest ever in the 40 year history of Lam Research. We're well-positioned to advantage from the continued strength and investments across all segments of the semiconductor industry. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse : I guess first question on the NAND side. I think there's a notion that perhaps we might be nearing the peak on spending. So, we'd love to hear your thoughts on : A, how do you think about your revenue opportunity on just node migration versus new wafer starts? And then B, can you kind of walk through the revenue opportunities, which sounds like it\u2019s increasing as we migrate from the 9x layer node to 128 layers and above? Tim Archer : Sure. Let me start C.J. Yes, I think that, you probably called out the most important point right there at the end. What we have continuously said is that, because of the role that etch and deposition play in building devices, our opportunity is growing quite significantly at two of those node migrations. And so, from our revenue perspective, we clearly see that, that revenue continues to grow in 3D NAND into the future. From a spending perspective, obviously, anytime you continue to see higher and higher numbers, you can start to think about a peak. But again, if you looked at and thought about what I said about supply growth, we still see ourselves exiting this year with supply growth remaining below the long-term trend line. And also if you go back and reference the data point we've given a couple of times at the NAND Flash at the Flash Memory Summit, about five year spending requirements to meet what we see as long-term demand growth in the high 30% range. That is -- we're kind of nearing those spend levels right now after a couple of years previously of underspending that. And so, I think that we're still quite confident about how we enter 2021 from a NAND spending perspective. C.J. Muse: And as my follow-up, on the CSBG side, you saw great acceleration on a year-over-year basis I think, up 29%. So I was just curious, is that a function of higher utilization rates of customers? Is there kind of one-time upgrades in there or is that tools coming off warranty? And as part of that, how should we kind of think about the growth trajectory of that business for all of fiscal \u201821? Tim Archer : Sure. Well it\u2019s -- maybe the last part first, which is, as Doug pointed out, probably the best way to think about its future growth is still the same as what we said in March, which is a 40% growth between out to 2023, but we did see an acceleration. And I think what you're seeing is in some ways the power of that business, which is made up of several different components, you pointed out some of them, a sensitivity utilization which is primarily in the spares business. And then also as customers look to get more out of their existing installed base, I mean, a lot of my script talking about how customers are looking for ways to enable these transitions and enable high volume manufacturing ramps, but we are sensitive to how much it costs to do that. And so, customers continue to look for technology and productivity upgrades to make those installed bases as valuable to them as possible. So we have seen upgrades increase in terms of that. And then I also mentioned, spending on refurbishment and other systems as well. And so, it's a multifaceted business and I think that right now we're hitting all of the angles that are very important to our customers. Operator : And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. Yes, it's been two years of sort of weak flattish DRAM spending. But as the demand profile looks strong next year, and you have the early move to run alpha node, 2021 is looking like a growth year for DRAM spending. And on top of that, memory architecture has always been very 3D-like, and similar to NAND-like. Aspect ratios are increasing, tighter tolerances on material thicknesses and so on. So ahead of this strong DRAM year, how do you view your SAM and share expansion potential on some of these next generation 1-alpha DRAM architectures? Tim Archer : Yes, just to kind of reiterate comments we've made in the past. I mean, we -- as you pointed out, every time you move forward in technology, whether it's 3D NAND, we just spent time talking about or hearing DRAM. The features are getting taller. The aspect ratios are getting more difficult and that is requiring more etch and deposition technology, and it tends to expand our SAM. What we\u2019ve said is every technology node in DRAM, NAND, and in Foundry/Logic, our SAM grows if the technology moves forward. So, your question about DRAM is no different. We do anticipate and we said that we think we enter 2021 with a good setup for rising DRAM spending. As you pointed out, a couple of years of flattish DRAM spending where we've kind of been under growing long-term demand. And so, we combine increased spending with, we see as higher intensity due to these technology changes that require more etch and deposition equipment, we think it's a good setup for Lam going into 2021. Harlan Sur : And then, Doug, on -- obviously, very strong gross margin performance by the company. And that's even still with the higher logistics and transport and freight-related cost due to COVID-19. Can you just give us an update here, and maybe give us a sense on how big that impact is to your gross margins either in the just reported September quarter or in the December quarter guide? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Harlan, I haven't quantified it, but it's noticeable. I mean, let me put it that way. I mean freight logistics spending is quite expensive right now simply because there's just not enough airfreight flying across the Pacific Ocean where a lot of our stuff comes and goes. But I haven't quantified it. Harlan, the right way -- maybe just thinking back longer-term to the financial model, but the right way to think about it is still the numbers that are embedded in there. Right now, when I think about the revenue levels we're at, we're trending a little bit below what might be in that model and it's because of the COVID inefficiencies, in particular, freight and logistics. I'm not going to quantify it for you, though, but that's how you should be thinking about it. And we had a really positive mix in September. We don't have quite as positive mix in December. So that's the commentary around sequential gross margin. Operator : We'll go ahead and take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer : I guess, Tim, Doug, you talked about SMIC in the December quarter being a hit, but I was hoping you could quantify that. And as you do, kind of help us understand how China might trend as a percent of revenue in the December quarter. It's been well above trend. And I know you've talked about broad-based strength, but do you see that kind of well above trend representation in the December quarter as well? Doug Bettinger : Yes, John, I'm not going to quantify the large Chinese foundry impact to the guide. I think the numbers I've seen people suggest, percent of revenue, WFE, longer-term basis, the right way to kind of think about where that particular customer might have been and could continue to be if we are all in the industry able to get licenses. In any given quarter, it can be up or down as all customers are. So I'm not going to specifically quantify it in December, but I think you know roughly how big they are. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And I apologize for the follow-up, but you guys clearly understand the concern out there is, how much of the China strength is related to customers that are being worried about full bans going into China by the U.S. government. Tim, I'd like to get your kind of thoughts. In a worst-case scenario, if the U.S. were to ban equipment going into China, how much of the China CapEx in WFE today do you think would need to be reconstituted in other geographies to support demand? And how much of it do you think could be lost in just representative of kind of China building in anticipation of demand multiple years out as they go -- pursue their semiconductor -- domestic semiconductor strategy? Tim Archer : Well, I mean it's a very difficult question to answer from the standpoint that in many ways, what you just implied in the question was that some of that may be building in China in anticipation of demand they see several years out. We think that demand -- I mean, for all of the reasons that we talked about, whether it's -- I mean, it's just the digitization of the global economy, that's occurring everywhere. And so we think that demand remains. And so to your point of how much of it gets reconstituted, how much of it gets satisfied, I think China demand, global demand has to be satisfied by somebody. And so I think, ultimately, a lot of it gets reconstituted. And the only part that might not be is, what we have acknowledged, and I think most people recognize is as you're coming up the learning curve, there can be in the short-term some overspending as you're learning and you're building yield and you're gaining efficiencies.  But even in the long run, that -- we've seen that play out over every region. And what ends up happening is that turns in ultimately to business -- for our installed base business, where we go back years later, and we're making that installed base productive. And so this industry is so efficient but I don't think there's ever really anything that gets lost, quite honestly. And that's -- but I mean, there's a lot of -- there were probably a lot of pieces to your question that require assumptions. But I think that it would cause some disruption, as we said, in the short-term. But in the long term, demand drivers and the need to supply semiconductors and semiconductors equipment to meet them doesn't fundamentally change in our view. Doug Bettinger : Yes. And maybe, John, I'd just add a couple of things, the way I think about it. When I look at the revenue in China for us, it's split fairly evenly between the multinational customer base and the local Chinese customer base. So to help you frame it a little bit, that multinational stuff, obviously, was a decision to put in a country that could have gone anywhere quite honestly. And then as Tim alluded to, a lot of the Chinese customers are relatively new in their process ramps, so maybe they're a little bit inefficient or somewhat inefficient. But at the end of the day, they're building capacity to support long-term demand that somebody else will step into over a period of time. So anyway hopefully that's helpful. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : I had 2. I guess the first one, Doug, is on service. And I guess the question is, how much, if any, inventory stocking of spares, do you think is going on? I know you try to put controls around that. But it seems pretty clear how much service has taken off for the past 6 months that maybe that is actually happening. You've been pretty clear that you can't run the tool if you don't get the spares, so it wouldn't make any sense to pull the tool in. But we have heard that there is some communal stocking happening in China for parts and whatnot. So can you speak to how much of a factor that is? Do you actually see that happening? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim, it's hard to know, to be perfectly honest. One thing I looked at in anticipation of this question coming up is, from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, did any customer meaningfully increase their spares orders with us in China? And the answer to that was, no, not really. That doesn't mean that maybe they weren't planning to stock a little bit ahead. It would be pretty hard at times to know. But I don't see a big stocking going on in China for spares. That's maybe the way I'd summarize that. I don't know, Tim, if you think any differently about that. Tim Archer : No, I think that's fair. I mean, obviously, just as you see, even sometimes in our own numbers, is you're building for growth. I mean, there's no doubt, the inventories themselves, the number of parts that have to be stocked and maybe it\u2019s what we\u2019d call the safety stock level. I mean, those may rise. I mean when you're in the early days of a manufacturing fab, you\u2019re always concerned about like the time to get another part shipped in. But as you really start working towards efficient mass production, you do that. So I think we have seen -- and clearly, we have seen that shipments have increased, but whether they're increasing more than the growth plans of the -- of those customers, a little bit more hard to say. And I'd say just across the board, there's a little bit of a -- everybody is focused on business resilience. But as we talk about things that may be structural, I think for quite a long time, and people are going to be looking at what do I have to do to ensure my business can run. And so I don't think those -- you see those immediately like turned on and off. Timothy Arcuri : And then, Doug, I guess a follow-up just on the balance sheet. You did start to repo back up, $450 million is definitely a respectable number, but you still have $7 billion in cash. And I think in the past, you said maybe you did $4 billion but that's kind of the optimal cash. So you definitely have a lot of excess cash. So maybe can you update us there on your thoughts on what you're thinking with the excess cash? I think it seems a little harder that you'd be able to do M&A and semis to get some regions to improve that. So can you just talk to the excess cash level, Doug? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim, I specifically reiterated the 75% to 100% return to free cash flow as the company's planned objective. I don't know think of it, however, that's what we're planning to do. Now over the last couple of years, we've done more than that. We've done more than 100%. And your observation is right. We probably have a little more cash than we need sitting on the balance sheet right now. We'll be looking at that periodically over time. But I don't have anything new to tell you right now relative to any change in our plans or thinking. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : I have two of them. First one for Tim. On the NAND side, when your customers go from 96 to 128 layers, as you move organically, the etch times went up, and which is a big positive for Lam. But going beyond 128 layers, if customers start stacking layers, is it a slight negative? What I'm trying to figure out is, is stacking neutral or negative for dep and etch intensity? And then I have a follow-up. Tim Archer : I mean the simple answer is no, SAM still grows under every scheme to build more layers. It translates into different parts. Again, I've talked about this where you kind of picked your battle whether you're trying to build ever taller stacks in one shot or you're trying to build efficient stacking. But simple answer is etch and dep intensity rises in either case. Just perhaps split differently with different applications. Krish Sankar : And then a follow-up for Doug. Would you be willing to share how much of your service of CSBG revenues is from domestic China or overall China? Doug Bettinger : Not that I'm willing to share it, Krish, because off the top of my -- I'm not sure I know what the number is. The way to think about it over time is consistent with equipment shipment with a lag, right? And the way we've generally been talking about the business for us from a system standpoint in China is, it's been pretty evenly split between multinational customers and local China. And over time, the CSBG business kind of would get caught up to a similar footprint, if you will, maybe not immediately. But Krish, that's just off the cuff reaction to the question. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : I was hoping if you could give us some directional view on the China versus non-China and the Foundry/Logic versus memory mix for the December quarter guidance? Doug Bettinger : You're asking, Vivek, about December specifically? Vivek Arya : That's right. Just directionally how do you see those mix things trending in December? Doug Bettinger : Yes. I think China is going to remain strong in December is how I view it right now as we sit here today. And I think the broad-based set of customers in China that I tried to describe will continue to be what it looks like. Vivek Arya : And on the Foundry/Logic versus memory mix? Doug Bettinger : Well, the large China foundry customer likely isn't going to get much from us, if anything, unless we get a license in December. So that will probably trend down a little bit in December. Vivek Arya : Got it. And as my follow-up, I wanted to revisit this DRAM question. I understand DRAM sales are still below their peaks, but they are still back to the levels you had in the second half '18. How are you thinking about your DRAM growth over the next several quarters? What are the signs that you're looking for to say that now we are at a trough, and now we can get back to some normalized trend? Doug Bettinger : I mean, Vivek, what we look at is we run our own models of bit supply growth and do our best to try to understand inventory that's out there, what the customers are holding, what the customers\u2019 customers are holding. What's going on with pricing? What's going on profitability? And as we look at all of those things, our view is, right now, the investment levels that are occurring in DRAM are generating supply growth below long-term demand growth. And at some point, that will need to get itself caught up. And we think it's sometime in 2021. I think it sets up to be a pretty decent year for DRAM in 2021 is as much as I can tell you right now. I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything? Tim Archer : No. I think also just you referred back to like 2018, and I think that, again, for us, we look and there are -- across all semiconductor segments, I mean, significantly greater drivers and broadening of drivers we're seeing today. And we pointed out a couple of those on previous calls. But just even the difference in DRAM content in the high-end smartphones and the dramatic jump that takes from -- into the 5G phones. And then, of course, we talk about the buildout of data centers and everything else. It's -- there's a demand element to it. There's the supply element. And I think we just see it as a positive into 2021. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : I had 2 as well. First one, I guess, is very much a follow-up to the last question on DRAM and NAND supply growth exiting the year. Doug, you just talked about your internal model. You\u2019re suggesting that the supply growth exiting the year is below the long-term trend line as you see it. Is there any way you can give kind of quantitative color around that. For DRAM, are you looking at kind of 15% to 20%-ish supply growth exiting the year? In NAND, is it kind of around 30 or below 30%? And I guess related to that, you talked about your expectations for DRAM into 2021 being positive. Any directional guidance you can give on the NAND side? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Toshiya, those numbers you referenced probably are fairly consistent with what I think is the consensus view as well as our own models. So I don't have anything incremental to add there. Your second question, sorry, ask it again. Toshiya Hari : Yes, directional guidance on NAND into 2021, if any? Doug Bettinger : My view, I mean NAND is pretty decent right now. And I think it will be pretty decent next year. Again, based on our view of the industry inventory, investment plans, I think it will be a pretty decent year for '21 next year. We're not going to give you numbers on '21 yet. We'll do that in next quarter's earnings. But I think it sets up pretty well. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then a quick follow-up. In terms of market share, you guys talked about 4 to 8 percentage points of share growth like kind of your 2023 target at your Analyst Day. If I take the midpoint of your December quarter guidance and make assumptions around your CSBG business, I think your systems business is going to be up close to 25-ish percent in calendar '20, so you're clearly gaining share. What sort of the outlook into next year based on wins that you have already, both on the memory side and logic and foundry side, do you think you can sustain this level of share growth momentum? Or could that accelerate? Could that slow down a little bit? Any color would be great. Tim Archer : We're certainly going to try. And I think that in our business -- we've described this in many ways, every quarter, we come in and we talk about wins and new applications. And I know it kind of starts to sound like we're a broken record here. But the reality is it takes a couple of years for those wins to start to translate into the numbers that you're starting to see now. And so if you go back and you kind of look at the old transcripts, you'll see us talking about pretty significant momentum that started really in the 2019 time frame. And it's been building through 2020, and that's what you're going to start seeing I think play out. As those wins at those future nodes start to roll in through high-volume manufacturing. I'd make the same caution we're extremely happy with Sense.i momentum right now as it's winning sort of those slots and sockets in future nodes. But I know the timing for those to then become the main driver of revenue and market share growth won't be until those nodes that are in development now and moving into pilot become high-volume nodes. But that's -- so I would say that we look back 2 years to our progress, and that's kind of what we're starting to see, and we look at wins we're making now. And that's our pipeline to hit the 2023, 2024 objectives. And I think we -- as we said, we feel we're on track and almost couldn't feel better about the strength of the product portfolio and the pipeline right now. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : I wonder if we could get some additional color on the restrictions in China. When exactly did they kind of go into place. And just so I understand for modification if it happens again, what happens to product that's being installed on-site to product that's shipped on the way there that stuff fits in backlog? Are you still able to ship against that? Doug Bettinger : Maybe I'll make a couple of comments. And then Tim, you can add on. I mean the incremental I think that came out was really an application of a rule that was previously out there around military end use that basically said, if you\u2019re enabling that, one of our customers is, you need a license. And so what ended up happening is, I guess, guidance, if you will, from the Department of Commerce that you need the license to ship to at least 1 customer, the foundry customer in China. I mean, that's really the only thing that was new, Joe. And so we're applying for license is basically what's going on. I don't know how long it's going to take to find out whether those license will be granted or won't. We're kind of in sort of uncharted territory, and we're waiting to see how it plays out. So timing, I don't know that I can help you much with. Joe Moore : Okay. And then in terms of the backlog and anything that might be assembled on site. Doug Bettinger : Generally speaking, when these rules come out, you get a little bit of a lead time, so you can adjust whatever is like in the very near term going on. But it's hard to know, quite honestly. So at this point, we are complying with all regulations that are out there relative to this 1 customer, which means we're delaying the shipment plan for the December quarter, basically it\u2019s what's going on until we know more. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : I was just going to -- love a little more color on just the trailing edge strength. How much of a trigger that was. Obviously, we've heard about tightness and clearly seeing a rebound, but a lot of these end markets are kind of still down a bit. Kind of just your perspective, is the different mix, particularly in markets with higher content. And kind of just perspective, is this just a little bit of a catch-up? Or is it a more sustainable trend? Tim Archer : No. I think this -- I mean, at least from our view, I mean, I mentioned it was another record quarter for our business group that satisfies that demand. We've just seen tightness in this market and kind of a broadening of those activities quarter-by-quarter. So -- and if you go back and look, we've reported record quarters now for quite a number of [quarters]. So I think it's just tightness. It's difficult. In fact, we just had a very strangely, but a new product release, where we talked about we're leasing a product now for 200-millimeter photoresist strip. And so I think you can get a sense from that where we're going back and basically refreshing 200-millimeter products that the demand is out there, and it cannot be solved or served just by refurbishment of the existing base. It's -- the requirement is actually expanding beyond that. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Blayne, I mean, I know you know this market really well. I kind of think of the analogy IoT edge kind of devices that are out there, you know what's going on there. I mean, that's really what's going on with this part of our business as well. Back at our Investor Day in March, we suggested that we think WFE in this space quickly grow 2 times to 3 times faster than WFE broadly. And that's what's going on. Blayne Curtis : Got you. And then maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned that WFE would grow next year. You're not giving the specific guidance. You mentioned memory up, I didn't hear you say foundry. So I guess I'm just curious, obviously, you don't know what's going to go on with SMIC and licenses in China in general. But just kind of curious, with the strength of the trailing edge, is foundry going to be up next year as well, kind of the factors there? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Blayne, our normal practice at this point in the year is not to give specific numeric, here's what next year looks like. We'll do that a quarter from now. We're giving you a little bit of color that we think it's going to be a good year next year, but it's too soon for us to quantify. We just -- our practice is to wait until the December quarter earnings to give you that. And we will give it to you then. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Doug, you have talked about a $10 billion domestic China WFE number in the past, and is that still the right number within the mid-50s WFE for the market? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Our view is still mid-high 50s from a WFE standpoint, in China, roughly $10 billion, plus or minus a little bit. We're 3 quarters of the way through the year. So if the 1 customer that everybody is thinking about right now isn't able to spend in the fourth quarter, we're still in that range. Atif Malik : Okay. And as a follow-up, has the backlog normalized due to COVID-19 impact in the March quarter and now fully reflected in your Q4 revenue guide? Or you still have some carryover? Doug Bettinger : No, Atif, we're pretty much caught up at this point. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : My first question is going back to China, given the strength you've seen last quarter, are there any risk of customers pulling in purchases? I think you addressed the spare part side earlier. But the question is not just from the 1 foundry customer, but also maybe other customers on the memory side as well. Tim Archer : Well, I guess you addressed it, is there a risk? Do you mean backward-looking risk in the September, the risk that pulling occurred? I think Doug kind of answered that, which is we really haven't seen or felt anything that feels out of the ordinary relative to the growth plans for these customers. Going forward, I think, again, in many ways, you see us guiding to yet another record for the company. And I don't think that we'll be -- I don't think that any of that right now factors in what we would, again, think is abnormal pull-in activity. Sidney Ho : Okay. I think you guys were talking about spare parts earlier, but I guess the system -- new system itself\u2026 Doug Bettinger : So I mean, no, we're\u2026 Tim Archer : I think the question maybe was about spare parts, but it's really more of -- I think it's a broader statement. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I agree. Sidney Ho : Okay. Maybe my follow-up question is on Intel. I think last quarter, you guys pretty much said this, there's no impact. It doesn't matter who makes the chips. But on the memory side, now that Intel sold the business -- NAND business to Hynix, given that they have very different architecture, do you think there will be a net impact for you guys going forward? Doug Bettinger : Well, hard to know. That's a pretty recent announcement, and it would be a little bit of speculation. I mean, Sidney, long-term, the way I think about this is, at the end of the day, demand is what matters, right? Our customers are putting wafer capacity in place to supply demand. And things can get pulled in, pushed out a little bit on the margin. But at the end of the day, when I think about where I think the industry heads, supply and demand have to be in relative equilibrium, over the medium or longer term. And whether that means we have 5 customers in NAND or 3, it largely doesn't matter. They're going to invest to satisfy demand in my mind. Tim Archer : Yes. And the -- question was, is it all targeted towards that strength. I mean, we basically have talked, I think in the past. We're strong across all flavors of 3D NAND. Operator : We'll go ahead and take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe Quatrochi : On the NAND, I was curious, within your bit supply growth model or expectations, how do you think about the growth from no transitions or technology transitions in terms of, if bit demand is closer to 30% next year and versus kind of a long-term of high 30%, do you think the installed base needs to grow to support that? Doug Bettinger : In any given year, Joe, when we look at it, there's always a blend of both. It's always in the best interest of the customer to do the node conversions first because it's a very cost-effective way to do it. And then generally, that means you lose wafer capacity and it needs to get topped up a little bit. In any 1 year, the mix is different 1 year to the next but it's always a blend. Joe Quatrochi : Okay. That's helpful. And then just -- I thought your comments in the prepared remarks around support engagements being a remote. That was interesting, obviously, with COVID. And so I was curious, how do you see that trending over the next few years. And maybe what percentage of engagements are remote now? And maybe how do we think about the cost savings potential there? Tim Archer : Yes. It's -- well, I guess what I would say is we featured the Equipment Intelligence solutions. You imagine if we're launching Sense.i designed around Equipment Intelligence, we started that activity long before COVID was ever even something we could imagine. So we feel very fortunate now that we're driving that aggressively. And it really is designed to do things that remove the need for people to be physically located at the tool in order to troubleshoot and repair the tools. And so we have seen -- I mentioned a 6x increase in remote support engagements year-over-year. A lot of that is because our engagement with customers, there's kind of like not many other choices at this point to bring the kind of expertise you need to the tool. And I think that what -- just as we're seeing with work from home and other things, a lot of that will remain structural. It is -- it does save money for the customers by allowing us to repair the tools and get them back into production more quickly. And it saves money for Lam because we don't have to deploy as many people flying all over the world trying to service these tools. So I think a lot of that, I hope and I believe, will be structural and long lasting. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question please. Operator : Perfect. We'll go ahead and take our last question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Weston Twigg : Quick 2 questions. First, advanced packaging, you talked about it in the opening remarks. Can you help quantify what that is as a percent of systems revenue? Or sort of how relevant it is to the overall top line? Doug Bettinger : You know, Wes, right now, it's small, but with nice growth trajectory. And we're excited about what the future looks like. It's not huge right now. But when you listen to the industry and our customers talk about it over time, it's clearly part of their road map to drive Moore's Law forward. So we're excited about it. It's not huge now. We hope it will be over time. Tim Archer : I think, though, it also is -- Wes, maybe you've been around a long time. So you recognize the SABRE name point. And the point there is, in many cases, these are -- I mentioned this is about leveraging a lot of the expertise we've already built for other applications into new areas where we can gain high share. And it doesn't require in those cases for those markets to be quite so big to start to have an impact. So SABRE 3D, very, very strong position, very long track record. A lot of that R&D already kind of being done for larger markets; Syndion, same thing in terms of very high, very strong market position. And then, as Doug pointed out, what we're really trying to say, we have those positions, and we actually see the market coming to us as more of these integration schemes continue to go 3D. So we highlighted it just as it's one other example of 3D helping drive incremental growth for the company. Weston Twigg : I see. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then the other question I had was just the U.S., it was remarkably low in terms of revenue contribution last quarter. I was wondering if you could offer any commentary on that, if that's a trend that you see or it's just an abnormally low quarter? Doug Bettinger : There's not a lot of fabs in the U.S. taking equipment. I mean that's what's going on. I mean this is a [shift key] statement. And most of our customers' fabs are outside the United States, Wes, you know that. Weston Twigg : Yes. I guess, it had dropped a lot quarter-over-quarter as well. So it seems like the investment is declining. And I don't know if that's a sustainable trend and it could be, but that's the commentary I was looking for. Doug Bettinger : No. It's just -- you know how this works. Equipment can be lumpy to any one fab that come one quarter and then it needs to ramp. And it's lumpiness, but you know the fabs are in the U.S., and that's what's going on. It's just timing. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Tina Correia : No more closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. We appreciate it. Operator : Once again, this does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect your phone lines.",

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our Web site. And with that, I hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tina, and good afternoon everyone. 2020 was a remarkable year for Lam Research. Our global teams rose to meet the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and delivered the best year in our history. Total revenue of $11.9 billion and earnings per share of $20.45 were both record highs for the company, driven by served available market, market share, and customer support business growth. Through the year, we also launched new products and announced breakthrough technology solutions that we believe lay the foundation for our continued success. Before going into details, I want to express my sincere thanks to our teams for their incredible execution in an extraordinarily difficult environment and to our customers and suppliers for their partnership and support as we all adapted to the unforeseen events of 2020. We entered the New Year with hope that the world will soon emerge from the COVID-19 health crisis and move towards a global recovery. From our view, WFE spending in 2020 ended in the high $50 billion range. This is about what we estimated at our Investor Day in March just before the extent of COVID-19 impact was known. We saw spending growth across all segments of the market led by a recovery in NAND, continued expansion in Foundry/Logic, and a slight pick-up in DRAM. China's domestic spending for the year was in the $10 billion plus range. As we look to 2021, we see strong momentum across all parts of our business. Our early view is for substantial WFE growth to the high $60s billion to $70 billion range, supported by the ongoing migration to higher layer counts in NAND, a strong spending environment in DRAM, and an increased investment in Foundry/Logic as indicated by recent customer commentary. Currently, we are seeing spending biased somewhat towards the first half of 2021. While today's absolute levels of WFE are significantly higher than a few years ago, we believe the rapid digitization of the global economy combined with rising capital intensity due to greater process complexity supports robust multi-year WFE spending. In fact, if there's a common theme that underpins our outlook for the next several years, it is that sustainable growth throughout the semiconductor value chain will be driven by the proliferation of artificial intelligence, high performance computing, IoT, 5G, and the incredible societal advances and user experiences these technologies enable. We expect strong demand from a diverse set of end-use markets to positively impact semiconductor and semiconductor equipment growth in 2021 and beyond. Take, for example, the $200 billion global online gaming market. Nearly 3 billion people worldwide actively play video games across a variety of platforms generating over the last five years more than a 50% CAGR in data growth as users embrace realistic experiences enabled by more powerful processors, faster memory, and higher graphics resolution. If you just look at a sub-segment of the broader gaming market, namely gaming consoles, the number of these units shipped annually is much smaller than the number of smartphones sold. However, when you consider that a GPU for a gaming console is approximately four times the size of a smartphone application processor, this is an important driver of incremental WFE. From a memory and storage perspective, newer consoles utilize approximately twice the DRAM bits and employ SSD-based storage versus HDD in prior generations, and rising capital intensity trends on top of this semiconductor content growth and the impact on WFE increases further. We estimate that a 5% upside in the game console market has the potential to drive about $500 million of incremental WFE, and this is just one end use market example. If we similarly look at the impact of a 5G phone market, we see that 5% incremental demand in 5G units has the potential to drive close to a billion dollars in incremental WFE. It is demand drivers such as these that have strengthened our conviction around the sustainability of WFE spending over a multi-year period. It is against this positive backdrop that Lam remains focused on executing to our long-term objectives for SAM expansion, market share gains, and installed base business growth we described at our Investor Day, last March. In NAND, we continue to extend our strong leadership position. We estimate that our tools have now cumulatively processed approximately 37 million more wafers than our nearest competition through the three most critical 3D NAND applications. Since we first provided this metric at our Investor Day less than one year ago, we have widened the wafers processed experience gap by more than 40%. The accelerated learning that comes from our installed base of 3D NAND systems puts Lam in the best position to deliver the solutions needed to meet our customers\u2019 next generation manufacturing challenges. It also allows us to gain early insight into new opportunities being created by technology inflections. For example, in 2020 we announced our new Striker FE atomic layer deposition system, which employs a unique ICEFill capability for high aspect ratio dielectric gapfill. This tool addresses a new technology need for 3D NAND devices scaling to 128 layers or more, and production ramp of Striker FE is underway at multiple customers. 2020 also saw the launch of Sense.i, our next generation etch platform, and today we announced our new Vantex high aspect ratio dielectric etch module on Sense.i. Vantex features advanced RF technology and new uniformity enhancements to enable next generation device roadmaps. Vantex and Sense.i together collect more data per wafer than ever before enabling advanced equipment intelligence and to deliver new levels of productivity and process control. The timing of our Vantex launch intercepts DRAM and NAND roadmaps facing increasingly complex node-to-node scaling challenges. As a result, Vantex is already in qualification with both DRAM and NAND customers and repeat orders have been received to ramp this system into high-volume production in 2021. For Foundry/Logic, we continue to target new technology inflections to expand our opportunity and position. Our Kiyo GX conductor etch system has been engineered with an advanced RF pulsing capability to meet the unique requirements of extremely narrow, high aspect ratio features. It also provides extendibility to future devices featuring nano wire or nanosheet architectures. Leading etch Foundry/Logic customers are increasingly adopting Kiyo GX for their most critical front-end-of-line applications at 5 nanometer and beyond, where the need for atomic-level precision etch becomes more acute. Moreover, as devices scale parasitic RC degrades transistor performance. As a result, we are seeing increasing customer pole for Lam etch and deposition solutions designed to reduce RC effects, including atomic layer etch for self-aligned context, new functional films and optimized metal solutions, which reduced via end line resistance by simplifying middle of line and back end of line process flows. In DRAM, we are seeing incremental share in SAM growth also coming from growing complexity of node transitions. We assess that we have greater than 50% etch market share in DRAM, and due to the importance of high-quality hard masks and mask open etches with EUV, we expect additional patterning share gains in etch and deposition as EUV passes increase in future nodes. Adoption of EUV and Foundry/Logic and DRAM is also creating a significant SAM expansion opportunity for Lam's dry photoresist solution. Using this new technology, we believe we can accelerate our growth in both Foundry/Logic and DRAM disrupting the existing wet photoresist equipment market. Our solution is gaining significant traction with leading customers as they look to improve the cost metrics of the EUV patterning. Changes of this magnitude due take time to realize but with tools now being installed and wafers being run for top DRAM and boundary logic customers, we're pleased with our progress readying this innovative technology for production. And finally, 2020 was another outstanding year for our customer support business group. Our installed base has now reached nearly 66,000 chambers, and CSBG revenue growth exceeded chamber growth by a factor of more than 2x for the 2020 calendar year. We generated record revenues for all sub-segments within CSBG. Growth in our Reliant business is driven by automotive, 5G and consumer electronics. We expect these areas to continue to outpace overall market growth in coming years. Meanwhile, we delivered on the expectations we said on our last earnings call, for calendar year growth of 25% in productivity focused services, and 6x growth in remote support engagements. We are excited about the trajectory and broad strength of this business and especially its proven ability to deliver world class support of complex technologies in high volume manufacturing. To wrap up, Lam marked its 40th anniversary in 2020 with record financial performance, a strong slate of innovative new products and services and solid execution on our strategy to expand leadership across markets. As our March quarter guidance suggests, we are optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead for Lam and believe we are in an excellent position to win. Thanks again. And now here's Doug. Doug Bettinger : Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today on what I know is a very busy earnings time. I hope you and your families have been safe and healthy since we last spoke with you. I'm really quite pleased to be reporting these outstanding results. We came in at the high-end or exceeded the range for all guided metrics in the December quarter. Despite the challenges we face during 2020 related to the global pandemic, Lam delivered record financial performance in revenue, operating income dollars and earnings per share. Our December quarter revenue came in at $3.46 billion at the high end of our guidance range, and represented an increase of 9% from the September quarter. The strength in our performance was driven by investments in all device segments, as our customers ramped to meet the demands of a diverse set of end markets such as data centers, smartphones, PCs, gaming consoles, IoT and automotive. Overall, our revenue increase was not only driven by the wafer path equipment needs of the industry, but also by the continuous growth of our installed base. We continue to add value to our customers by delivering extra spare parts, equipment upgrades, refurbished tools and advanced service offerings. Looking at the details of our systems revenue, the memory segment was strong in the December quarter coming in at 68% of systems revenue. This strength was driven by the NAND segment which represented 51% of our systems revenue versus 39% in the prior core. December was a record revenue level of NAND quarterly revenue dollars for the company. We have clear leadership positions in the NAND segment, with customers investing in equipment for 64, 96 and 128 layer devices. DRAM investments contributed 17% of our system's revenue. DRAM spend was spread over the one y, one z and one alpha nodes. The revenue percentage was down slightly from the 19% in the September quarter. We expect continuing healthy investments in the combined memory market as we see proven inventory and profitability management. On the Foundry segment side spending remains robust. We concluded 2020 with a record level of revenue dollars in this segment. The majority of the investments in the December quarter were concentrated at the leading edge seven and five nanometer nodes. Foundry represented 26% of our systems revenue for the quarter versus 36% in the September quarter. Rounding out the system revenue picture Logic and other contributed the remaining 6% of systems revenue in December quarter, which was flat with the prior quarter level. From a regional revenue perspective, we continue to see solid levels of investment in the China region coming in at 35% of total revenues. Different than the last several quarters, the majority of the China's spending this quarter came from our global multinational customers investing in their China located fabs. As Tim noted, we achieved another record quarter revenue for our customer support business that are coming in at $1.1 billion, which is an increase of 12% from the September quarter, and over 35% higher than the same quarter in 2019. The growth we've seen in each of the sub-segments of this business is a testament to the value we're providing to our customers for technology and productivity enhancements. We remain very comfortable with our commitment to deliver greater than 40% cumulative CSBG revenue growth between 2019 and 2023, as we outlined at our Investor Day in March of last year. The December quarter gross margin was 46.6% generally in line with our expectations. As I've noted in the past, gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix. In the quarter, our factory utilization levels improved with the increased business volume. I would mention we do have continued headwinds to gross margin related to elevated costs for air freight that will impact us until freight planes get back to more normalized levels. Operating expenses for December came in at $563 million, which is an increase from the prior quarter largely as a result of increased incentive compensation expense that was tied to our higher profitability levels. During calendar year 2020, we spent over $1.3 billion in research and development, which represents approximately two-thirds of our operating expenses. The R&D focus is a fundamental part of offering differentiated products and capabilities like Sense.i and Vantex enhanced ALD and dry resist that deliver on our long-term growth objectives. They had over a billion dollars in operating income in the December quarter for the first time in company history, with operating margin at the high-end of the guidance range coming in at 30.3%. This was due to our strong revenue and gross margin. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%. As we've discussed in the past, we will have fluctuations in tax rate from quarter-to-quarter and you should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level for the 2021 calendar year. I would mention, we are monitoring potential tax changes that may arise from the new administration in the United States. Other income and expenses approximately $53 million in expense fairly flat with the prior quarter. I would like to remind you that beginning in the March 2020 quarter, the benefits and costs of our employee deferred compensation plan are no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. They are mismatched in the GAAP results. This mismatch was $24 million in the December quarter. You can see this in the GAAP reconciliation table of earnings release. The fluctuations were higher this quarter due to the volatility in the market. Let me turn to our capital return activity. For the December quarter, we paid $188 million in dividends and allocated $703 million towards share repurchase. During the quarter, our Board approved an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. For calendar year 2020, we repurchased 3.8 million shares, deploying $1.4 billion at an average repurchase price of approximately $360 per share. We also paid out dividends totaling approximately $686 million during the year. In total, our capital return activities represented close to 100% of our free cash flow. I'd also mention that since we increased the level of our capital returned back in 2017, we've paid out $2.1 billion in dividends, and deployed $9.3 billion towards buybacks. repurchasing 47.3 million shares at an average price of $198 per share. Diluted earnings per share came in at $6.03 a little above the guidance range and more importantly at an all-time high for the company. Our diluted share balance was down slightly from the September quarter coming in at 146 million shares pretty much as we forecasted. The share count includes the dilutive impact of approximately 800,000 shares from 2041 convertible notes. Let's now look at the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments including restricted cash decreased to $6.3 billion from $6.9 billion in the prior quarter, largely due to the capital return activities that I discussed previously. Day sales outstanding increased to 76 days in the December quarter from 66 days in September. The increase is largely due to revenue linearity and the timing of collections that fell in the March fiscal quarter. I just mentioned that we collected $136 million on the first day of the March 2021 quarter and over $570 million during the first week. The inventory turns were slightly up from the prior quarter level coming in at 3.2x. Cash flows from operations came in at $345 million, which is somewhat depressed as a result of the growth in accounts receivable and inventory. We've grown the inventory to support the higher expected March business volumes and to mitigate supply chain risks from any potential disruption from the COVID-19 environment. Non-cash expenses included approximately $52 million for equity compensation $59 million for depreciation and $17 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the December quarter increased from September to a total of $92 million. We're investing to support the expanding operations at our new Malaysia factory, a manufacturing facility in Ohio that's focused on critical spare parts and the recently announced Korea Technology Center. We expect to see somewhat higher levels of capital expenditures in 2021 as we support these critical initiatives. And then, headcount for the December quarter was approximately 12,200 regular full-time employees. Resources have been added to support the increased business volume in our factories to service our customers in the field and to further enhance our R&D capabilities. Now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2021 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.7 billion plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point; operating margins of 30.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $6.55 plus or minus $0.40 based on a share count of approximately 145 million shares. Tim's already given you our outlook for 2021 WFE. I just reiterate we do think it will be a somewhat first half separated spent although things could change as the year unfolds. You should take that into account as you build your models for the year. So in summary, we just concluded the best financial year in Lam Research's history. Additionally, we provided guidance for March that represents another record level of financial performance. The company is executing well in a challenging environment. We are delivering on our near-term objectives while laying the framework for continued long-term execution. This is a testament to Lam's leadership team and our dedicated employees. Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Congratulations on the great results. Tim, I just want to go back to your WFE target guide for this year of high 60s to 70. Now, if you harken back to the Analyst Day, almost a year ago, your three to four year target out was sort of a range of 60 to 70. And so, I'm curious, how should we think about how quickly we've gotten here? Do we worry about cyclical overheating? And in a similar vein, as you think about this year being perhaps a little bit more first half weighted, is that really a commentary on normal seasonality, you want to add capacity in the first half, the demand in the second half? Or as you look at the bottoms up, are you worried about any areas that are kind of perhaps cyclically heating up a little bit too much? Tim Archer : A lot of questions in there John. Maybe there was a comment in my script even that said, in many cases, the outlook, we gave at Investor Day, that was formulated before we really knew about COVID-19, before we saw all of these tremendous work-from-home drivers, a lot of things that just really have kind of changed, maybe the way semiconductors have and the role semiconductors have played kind of in the world in the last 12 months. And so, we gave our best view when we gave it, and at that time, we thought our range of 60 billion to 70 billion seemed pretty reasonable given what we thought about demand. Clearly, some segments of the market have been growing a lot faster as we just mentioned from those demand trends. When we look at it -- there is an urgency to get tooling to meet demand. And that's not just our customers, that's also us as we look, Doug talked about investment in our Ohio facility to build critical spare parts as factories are running at very high levels of utilization. So, we're investing, our customers are investing. I think the outlook is, it's difficult to say, we're telling you right now, it looks like it's first half, somewhat the first half weighted. But I also talked about long-term demand drivers that we think fundamentally continue to become growth drivers for this industry in the long-term. And you've just seen growth and I gave you a couple of examples, 5G, gaming consoles, everybody has read about the shortages in automotive image sensors. There's just such a role that semiconductors play today. I don't think there's any segment we would point to that we feel is overheating relative to the long-term trends we've talked about. Just one example, because I know we'll get the question at some point on NAND. We talked about the recovery in NAND. But if you look at the spending on NAND over the last three years and you average that out, it's actually very close to the average annual spending that we've outlined for a couple years at the Flash Memory Summit, which says that you need roughly $70 billion over a five-year period to hit the high 30s demand in bit growth rate. And so, we feel reasonably comfortable with demand profiles across all the segments right now, and there'll be changes quarter-to-quarter and such, but long-term we think they're in line with the demand we are seeing. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Krish Sankar : Just to follow up on the WFE commentary. Is there a way to quantify it how much of it is front half versus back half? And is there any upside to back half, where do you think it is going to come from memory, domestic China or anything? Then, I have a quick follow up. Tim Archer : Yes. Well, we haven't quantified it and I don't think we're going to do so right now. Doug is shaking his head, no, and not going to right now. But, I think that to your point and Doug kind of mentioned, it's like, this is our view now, you can always feel the demand and the urgency for the next couple of quarters much, much stronger than the quarters further out. So, I think to your question which is where might we see changes later in the year? I think you have to look at some of the demand drivers. And again, there's a broadening of demand across -- it's not just driven by leading edge. In fact, we were looking at the amount of foundry spending for instance that's coming from 28-nanometer and above. It's a very high level these days. You see that in strength that gets reported into our CSBG business, the Reliant business. I think you can continue to see strength there. It's how semiconductor is being incorporated into everything. The content in cars and such, it's just increasing at quite a rapid rate. And those tend to drive kind of that off-leading-edge business at a very rapid pace. Where that gets manufactured? I mean, there is a fair bit of investment in China, for instance, that is at those trailing-edge nodes. And I think that's why we have seen strength in China, and why we actually believe that China, especially at those trailing-edge nodes, continues to be an area of strength as they satisfy a lot of that domestic demand for those kinds of applications like 5G and cars and other things. So, I guess you could say there might be -- might be added strength in those broader demand drivers that could surprise us later in the year. Krish Sankar : Got it. That's super helpful Tim. Just a quick follow up in your WFE assumption for this year, what are you modeling for domestic China? You think it's 10 billion last year? I'm just kind of curious where you are shaping it out to this year? Thank you. Tim Archer : I don't think we're ready to give like an exact number. But what we've said is 10 billion plus this year, and we expect growth this year. I don't know if Doug wants to add anything. Doug Bettinger : Probably in the same range, Krish, plus minus a little bit is kind of how we're thinking about it. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : I guess, Doug, I wanted to ask the prior question maybe a little bit differently. You said WFE this year, it's probably, 58, I'm sorry, not this year, last year, probably about 58.5. So your share grew about 100 basis points up to like 13.6%. So if I assumed that the service business, maybe you could help tell me if this is right, but it seems like service is going to be maybe 12.25 or 12.50 in March. So if you use that same share numbers, you get like an 18.5, 18.3, 18.5 billion worth of WFE in Q1. So that's almost $74 billion annualized. So, I sort of look at the full year number regarding high 60s to 70. So that was sort of implied that the back half of the year has to be -- at least for the industry has to be down pretty substantially off of for the first half of the year is? Or at least talk about Q1's running. So I'm just kind of wondering if you can comment on that and sort of like double-click on [indiscernible] and I have a follow up. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Tim, I'm not going to unpeel the whole number. And I can't go through all the numbers, as I sit here that he just spit out, I'm sure you're doing the right math or close. As we look into the year, it does look like the first half related year, things move around, things change. I think probably NAND is first half related, I think Foundry/Logic probably a little bit also. And I think DRAM, probably through the year is fairly steady. But things move around, things change, we always have pretty good visibility at this point into the first half, and the second half is far enough away that it can move around. So that's why we kind of tried to put some ranges, you guys will do the math to kind of take it through an open company here. But that's generally what I'm seeing, and then how I'm thinking about it. Timothy Arcuri : Okay, cool. And then, I guess my second question is on NAND. So it looks like CapEx is going to run about EBITDA this year for the industry. I mean, you're going to -- the industry probably does 19 billion in NAND, I don't know if you'd agree with that, 19 billion WFE this year. So that's pretty substantially above the 14 billion run rate that you get when you divide your 70 billion by five. So I guess when you take those two factors, and you look at CapEx being about EBITDA, usually that's not all that sustainable. So I guess, what's do you tell your customers, does that concern you at all? I'm just sort of curious on that. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Tim, when you look at this, it'll go up, it'll go down, nothing goes up every quarter. It ebbs and it flows and if you go back to '19, it was pretty low. Go to '20, it went up a little bit, '21, flat to up a little bit? Maybe? Yeah, probably. And then, it'll course correct based on whatever demand looks like. I mean, when we step back to on the reason, Tim and I both talked about these long-term demand drivers is that the important thing to think about over the next several years for the industry, it won't go up to every quarter. It never does, you know that better than I do or as well as I do. In timing, a fab investment, when things come in, it'll go up, it'll go down. That is what always happens and is what will happen in 2021 most likely. Tim Archer : Yes. I think probably just to add Tim, I mean, the absolute spending in NAND any given year is somewhat out of our control. But I mean what we do control is, how we continue to expand share of every dollar WFE spent. And that's why I talked about, how we've leveraged the learning we're getting from being the company that runs the vast majority of the critical applications in NAND. So identify new opportunities and new applications and grow into those so that the next node, our share of WFE Fi goes higher. And I talked about Striker FE, the ALD tool for gapfill, brand new application for us compete in the space where we didn't compete before. And, as trend node transitions occur into the future, means that our share of WFE increases. It's also important to remember that our share of every dollar WFE spent on node transitions actually is the highest. And that's simply because of the role that action deposition play in those transitions. So if you end up in a year, let's say and I'm not characterizing any given year in this way, but at the end of the year, where you do have lots of wafer starts, people become concerned that that might be a bit of overheating with new capacity. But actually we look at it as adding to what we would consider to be kind of our 3D annuity, the 3D NAND annuity, which says installed base is larger, which means that the next transition, RAM will get an even greater share of the spending that is required to move that entire 3D NAND installed base forward to the next node. So, that said any given year, something happens, but in the long-term trend, we think Lam's opportunity continues to grow in 3D NAND. Operator : We will now hear from CJ Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: Question is on CSBG business. Is your commentary on the first half weighted year reflected for that business as well? And as part of that, if I hold the business just flat at Q4 level, that business would run about 16% in calendar '21. So how should we think about the growth rate this year? And I'm going to have a quick follow up. Doug Bettinger : Yes, CJ. My commentary on first half, second half was very much targeted at WFE, not necessarily installed base. Now the installed base won't necessarily grow every single quarter will grow every single year like we've been saying. We feel really good about where we're at, I mean, it's we're record after record. And Tim shared the chamber count with you. It's kind of like it's been over the last several years. So the tailwind there is, it's really very good. Tim Archer : Yes. And I guess, just to add at our Investor Day we talked about the goal, we had to expand that number. The number of products and services available for the installed base is way of increasing revenue per chamber. And I think you've seen our progress in that area in this past year, and we'd expect that to continue to increase going forward as we focus on equipment intelligence and remote services and a lot of database productivity enhancers. C.J. Muse: That's great. And as a quick follow up, on your last call, you talked about how -- given the preponderance of manufacturing in Fremont, you couldn't ship to one large logic player in China. Curious if you've been able to get a license and as part of that, are you including the spend there in your 2021 domestic China outlook? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : That's where we're at right now CJ. We're still in the application process for license haven't heard back. When we look at China, that's plus or minus how we described flat to up. There's a range around it. But at this point, we haven't heard back on the license. We have applied and we're waiting. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : And congratulations on the solid results and execution. For all of the leading growth, leading edge growth trends that you highlighted in your prepared remarks, Tim, there's no corresponding significant attach rate of analog and mixed signal semiconductors to these applications. Additionally, some of your customers are moving to 12-inch analog manufacturing. And then, we know that there's pretty significant tightness in boundary capacity for lagging edge 28 and 40 nanometers seam also, approximately, and obviously, I think you mentioned this in driving some of the strength in your business. Approximately what percent of your overall business is lagging edge technology nodes? And do you see this expanding as the year unfolds? Tim Archer : We don't break out exactly what percentage of our business is in that segment. But I did say we do see that area continuing to grow again. And it's -- that's like what we would almost consider to be the strongest secular growing part of our market, because it's being driven by almost every aspect of the economy in terms of the types of products that semiconductors going into, that are manufactured with those trailing edge nodes. And so, we've seen, I don't, maybe I think it's something like I could get along with eight or nine quarters, I think in a row that we've now had reported record revenues in that trailing edge space. So one, we feel like we know how to compete and address that market. And we think that it's going to be just one that just continues to grow, maybe not quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter, but records every quarter, but certainly year-to-year-to-year, it will continue to be an area of strength for us. Doug Bettinger : And Harlan, I'll just remind you what we said back at the Investor Day in March and still believe that this segment of WFE will outgrow the rest of the market by -- I don't know, two times, maybe three times, although the leading edge stuff has picked up since then. But it's still a very good growth area for us. Harlan Sur : Thanks for the insights there. And then, to kind of follow up on CJ's question in calendar year 20, as you mentioned, services grew 22% that's not only double your installed base, growth CAGR over the past few years. But it's double the trend line target of around 10% as it relates to your 2023/2024 financial model. And if you just look at the continued complexity on these next generation leading edge tools, the strong demand for lagging edge nodes, it appears that the service business is going to continue to grow faster than this 10% growth targets that you guys have put out there, upgrades, the VAN services, Reliant, refurbished flows. So would you broadly agree with that? Or are there some offsets that we should be thinking about that could dampen the year-over-year services trajectory, back to that kind of normalized kind of 10% to 12% level? Tim Archer : Yes, I don't think we're ready to up our long-term objective just yet. But I think you're pointing out some of the things that are doing quite well in that part of the business around advanced services. And we talked about a 6x increase in remote support engagements. I think if we look, one, we put out that model, Investor Day, as I mentioned, as COVID environment kind of evolved, some of the advanced services, the database services, the poll for the idea of like less people related maintenance, using data and remote capabilities, clearly caught a lot more traction in the second half of the year. We need to see how much of that sticks as we kind of come out of this environment. But we believe that, that those things are -- those capabilities are now kind of demonstrating their value and a lot of that will stay, those will be strong drivers. Another thing happened in 2020 is, there probably were some instances of spares being ordered a bit ahead of normal trend. And as you know, everybody, including Lam, seeing some of our inventory numbers, tried to hedge against disruptions due to COVID-19. So you might see some moderation if you're looking for offsets in that space. So, we feel as Doug said, very comfortable about hitting the objective we put out at the Investor Day, but we're not ready to set a new growth target for the business until we see a little bit more of the trend this year. Operator : We will move on to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya : For the first one, I'm curious, what do you think is the right way to gauge the utilization of your NAND shipments last year? Is there some engagement with those customers on the CSBG side that gives you insight into what that installed base utilization is because I imagine the NAND number, at least to us was somewhat of an upside surprise? And I just wanted to understand what's driving that? Tim Archer : Well, I guess if I understand the question about, you're kind of asking how much the tools that we've shipped are being utilized in our customer fabs and that's not something I can really comment on. Obviously, to our engagements with customers, we have good insight into fab but not something we can really talk about. If I misunderstood the question maybe... Vivek Arya : Or maybe if, Tim, what do you think is the supply demand balance for NAND right now among your customers? Tim Archer : Well, I think if you consider that we talked about further strengthen the NAND market in 2021, I would say that there is a sense that more equipment is needed to bring on additional capabilities in NAND at this point in time, for sure. Vivek Arya : And as a quick follow up, Doug I think you alluded to some cost headwinds from air freight. Some of your semiconductor peers, I think have managed to kind of pass on increasing costs in other areas, foundries and wafers and substrates and so forth. Do you think this is the kind of cost you could pass on? I'm trying to think, how do you go from your operating margins right now to the 32% to 34%, kind of range you had outlined at your analyst day at similar level of annualized sales? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Vivek. We're always trying to get the best pricing that we can get. It's hard at times, though that it kind of passed up like this through -- we're doing our best. And it is a bit of a headwind. So I guess we're not able to push it through at this point. I do think just part of things will mitigate at some point, as the world gets back to normal and freight lanes get back to normal. Things are just constrained right now, we fly things in and out of our factory, a lot, oftentimes, or at least we used to in the belly of our commercial aircraft carrier at times. And they're just not flying at the volume that they used to be. I do think that comes back at some point, once we get COVID under control in the world. Vivek Arya : Any way to quantify the headwind, Doug? Is it like 100 basis points to gross margin, 50 basis points? Doug Bettinger : Vivek, I haven't given a hard number, but I would tell you, it's noticeable, it's meaningful. It's a meaningful headwind, I wouldn't be talking about it and we're doing our best to manage it. And I do believe it will get better over time. But I haven't quantified it. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : You talked about the drivers of the higher WFE in calendar '21. He talked about migration to higher layer counts. In NAND as well as DRAM and Foundry, I guess, in the NAND side, does that mean you think NAND spending is higher for the year? Or are you not going to go that far? And then, for DRAM, it seems like the economics are improving. Do you think that's -- where people spending sort of independent of that just thinking they need to get a technology migration? Or have you seen sort of stronger spending because the market has been stabilizing and improving. Doug Bettinger : Joe, I will start and then I will let Tim add on as well. As we look into 2021, right now, pretty much we see every segment of our business up, right, it's up in Foundry/Logic, it's up in NAND, it's up in DRAM, to different degrees, and like I kind of alluded to earlier, things can change but that's our outlook right now. And again, we see these longer term demand drivers as a large part of what's going on. And Tim, if you want to add anything? Tim Archer : No. I think you pretty much get it. I mean, I think, you started with the question about NAND, I mean, again, it's again, this layer transition is a way for customers to reduce their costs. And that those transitions are complex from [indiscernible] perspective. So creating a lot of demand for our tools to help enable those transitions. Joe Moore : Yes. To the extent that a lot of NAND spending is on layer count migration, rather than adding incremental wafers. I mean, does that wouldn't Lam normally outgrow the WFE in that kind of environment, assuming there isn't like a lot of capacity being added in NAND? Doug Bettinger : In a conversion, as Tim alluded to earlier, when you're just doing layer count conversion, that's the sweet spot for us in terms of the percent of spend. So the answer is yes. With the caveat that everybody's installed base is a little bit different. There's always a handful of new wafers coming in, and you got to kind of peel the onion back to the next layer and look at what's going on in any one period. But I would agree with your comment that in a layer count conversion, that's a good spot for us. Operator : Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs has the next question. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. I have two as well. My first one is somewhat related to Joe's question, wanted to get your thoughts on your ability to outperform WFE in 2021. Tim, given sort of the application wins that you have in the bag, and given sort of the device type mix that you guys are assuming internally, would it be fair to assume kind of a similar magnitude of outperformance in your systems business in 2021 vis-\u00e0-vis 2020. Or do you think 2020 was a little bit unique given how strong NAND was in the year? Tim Archer : So that's a lot of information you're asking for. As we look, I mean, Doug just mentioned, I mean, clearly we see strength across all parts of the business. NAND expansion is clearly good for us. As I mentioned in my comment, you're more than 50% share in DRAM etch, we're expanding our deposition. So DRAM is good. Foundry/Logic is an area where, obviously, from an exposure perspective, Lam has -- it's been less in the past, but we've talked about our improvements there. And so I think even there, as the nodes move forward, some of these new products we're talking about, whether it's dry resists, that might not be a 21 story, maybe, but more of a 22 and beyond story. But you know, we're working hard to increase our SAM as a percent of WFE and so, I guess what I just say is in terms of outperformance, you get to go back to what we said at investor day, which is the way our past outperformance is to expand our SAM and coming from where we are in the high 30s. We said we're going to get to 40% SAM as a percent of WFE. That's increasing our opportunity. And then, we do think with new products like the Vantex and Sense.i, and other products that are kind of in the pipeline to come in later this year. Those will be market share drivers for us. And so, combination SAM expansion and market share gains will hopefully to continued outperformance in the market. Toshiya Hari : And then, Tim, as my follow up, you just mentioned Vantex, pretty fascinating technology. Wondering if you could kind of give us some color on areas or points of differentiation, vis-\u00e0-vis your nearest competitor in Asia. And if you can remind us what your market share aspirations are and dielectric etch over the next couple of years, that would be super helpful, just given how, relatively speaking, you've been stronger in conductor. So I think the opportunity set is bigger in dielectric. Thank you. Tim Archer : Well, just a couple things. I mean, one, the Vantex story is really like two parts. One is, it is the first module on the new Sense.i platform. So again, when you're thinking about Sense.i, you're thinking about a tremendous amounts of data collection and using that, not only to improve the productivity of the platform and the maintenance and such, but also process control. And as you look at now in that dielectric high aspect ratio etch, which is where Vantex is targeting, those etch's are becoming incredibly difficult both in NAND and DRAM where that product is really targeted. We've leveraged the learning from all of those wafers I talked about, we've been running relative to the competition in 3D NAND to really understand what it takes to build the world's class high aspect ratio etch and that's what we think we've delivered to the market. We do really well in dielectric etch, quite honestly, in both DRAM and NAND already, but we're not going to -- we haven't quantified, I believe our dielectric etch ambition, but clearly it's higher in years to come. And we think Vantex and Sense.i is the platform to do that. Operator : Now we will from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Wanted to go back to the last quarter you talked about, obviously, you wanted to guide WFE because guideposts and obviously DRAM was the strongest. Now fast forward and we've all seen big foundry CapEx numbers, but your NAND came in strong as well. Can you talk us through over the last three months, what kind of improved for you? I know you don't want to [indiscernible] for the year but just trying to get a better feel as to what you're expecting between those two segments. Doug Bettinger : I know Blayne, obviously, one large foundry customer upsized their CapEx. I think everybody understands what happened there. I don't think any of us saw the totality of that coming. So clearly, that was a bit of the upside. Maybe that would be the only thing I would specifically point to. Blayne Curtis : And then, just back on gross margin, obviously, you have the higher freight costs, you are guiding it down a bit, revenue up, can you just kind of walk us through the March guide. And then, there's opportunities for leverage, either gross margin or even on OpEx, for rest of the year. Doug Bettinger : I think everybody knows this isn't really a huge fixed cost business. So when revenue goes up, it matters but it's not what matters as much as in like our customers business, product mix matters, customer mix matters. Customer concentration moves gross margin around. That's happening probably a little bit in the March quarter. A little bit of a headwind, if I think about the longer term, getting to that financial model that we put out for '23. Two things I would point you to on the gross margin and operating income for that matter. One is this freight headwind that we're dealing with. Second, I referred to ramping the factory in Malaysia, that's going to be somewhat more efficient, a little bit bigger factory, a little bit more cost efficient factory. So there's some upside that we're going to see in gross margin there. And that's really from where we are today to where we're trying to get to or where we're going to get to, what gets you there. Operator : Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Tim, you guys have seen strong growth in 3D devices, particularly in NAND area and are announcing the new technology for high aspect ratio. My question is in the logic side, the logic devices are now moving in three dimensions. For example, nanosheet, the three nanometer Korean foundry this year. And how does that impact the definition etch opportunity? And should we be looking at that as a major inflection? Tim Archer : I would hope you would be. We've been talking about really at some point along the roadmaps, every device ultimately is inflecting to 3D simply because that's how you get continued scaling. And so, I talked about our Kiyo GX tool. One of the -- you start seeing new types of technologies come in the etch and also deposition space. I mentioned that tool with its atomic layer etch capabilities, those tools are well suited to the types of 3D devices that you're going to see in nanosheet, or nano wire architectures. There will also be other tools, which we haven't really talked about so publicly that they are in the hands of our customers around selective etch that will become much more prevalent within 3D logic foundry devices. And then a whole slew of new deposition films that also help, I mentioned some of the [RC] [ph] and such so, I think it's an area where we can continue to expand our SAM by catching kind of those 3D inflections in logic and foundry. Our R&D that Doug talked about is really targeted towards growing our opportunity in that space. Atif Malik : Okay. And we have heard about supply constraints in chips and printed circuit boards. Is the availability of chips impacting your capability to be able to present for your customers? DougBettinger: In any supply chain is complex as ours is with as many suppliers as we'd have. There's always something that you're working your way through. And certainly there's a handful of those things today, given volume is inflecting up, but we're managing through it pretty well. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Certainly, our final question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joe Quatrochi : On your expectations for domestic China being flat up? How are you thinking about the efficiency of spending this year as the customers continue to ramp up their technology curves? Doug Bettinger : In China, specifically, Joe, is that's your question? Joe Quatrochi : Yes. For your domestic China customers, I think in the past, you talked about there's some level of inefficient spend just given that they're still kind of learning. Doug Bettinger : Our domestic China customer base is very broad. It's much broader, I think, perhaps than all of you realize. And you've got people at all kinds of different points along ramping technology, some are been doing it for a really long time. Some are brand new to certain technologies. When a customer is new to a technology takes a little while to get to an efficient ramp point. So it's a broad set of customers that are at different points, I think is what I would describe. Again, depending on how long they've been doing, what they're doing. Joe Quatrochi : Okay, fair enough. And then, quickly on just the CSBG side, how are you thinking about the improvement of memory fab productivity last year contributing to the growth? And then, how do we think about that this year? Because I assume that the spare parts business would be more of a modest contributor to growth for that business this year. Doug Bettinger : Let me think about that question. I don't know, Tim, if you have anything you want to add. I mean, consumption of spares will ebb and flow across every one of our end markets with utilization and utilization size spare part consumption is somewhat higher? It's just the nature of how -- it's a consumable part, obviously. So it needs to go along with volume. I don't know if I'm answering your question but that's true and the memory fab is true in foundry and logic as well. As Tim suggests, maybe there was a little bit of by head in spares maybe a little bit, but I don't think that was huge. I don't know. Tim Archer : And I don't think that it was something that needs specific memory. But in general, a couple of comments we've made about spare parts, maybe just to come into, we have always focused on the critical applications, because critical application, you have to keep those chambers in very pristine condition in order to be able to deliver the [on-wave] result the customer needs. They tend to be bigger drivers of spare parts. And so, I think as each of these technology nodes gets more complex, spare parts and the capability of those spares continues to grow. That's good for our business. But the flip side of that, of course, is that's customers cost. And so, that's why we are continuously looking for things like the new Sense.i platform to help our customer reduce maintenance cost and running cost of the systems. I mentioned Sense.i and Vantex, the first adopters and the first one to ramp up that production are going to be in the memory space. And that's simply because it delivers technology, [indiscernible] productivity and that's really the key. How do you find that balance of getting the results on the wafer without consuming too many spare parts and without consuming too much of the tool equipment time? I think Lam has become very good at that. And I think that again, we point to the volume of learning we have in high volume production, cross and endearing cost sensitive applications. I think we may be the best at that. Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Correia for any additional closing remarks. Tina Correia : We just wanted to thank everyone for joining today and we will talk to you all again soon. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. Tina Correia : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will share our overview on the business environment, and we\u2019ll review our financial results for the March 2021 quarter and our outlook for the June 2021 quarter.

A replay of this call will made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Great. Thank you, Tina, and thank you to everyone joining the call today. Lam posted excellent results in the March quarter with record revenues from both systems and install businesses, as well as record cash flow from operations and record earnings per share. Our performance reflects solid execution by Lam employees and our partners worldwide despite ongoing COVID-19-related impacts. The investments we are making in manufacturing and supply chain resiliency are enabling us to support our customers' needs, amid a broad based strengthening in semiconductor demand. We are very optimistic on our positioning and see continued strong growth for Lam in the future. Let me first begin by updating our expectations for wafer fabrication equipment spending. Since our last earnings call, we have seen WFE spending plans increase for the calendar year. Our outlook for 2021 WFE is trending above $75 billion. And we now believe the WFE spending in the second-half of the calendar year will be higher than the first-half across all device segments. Several factors are at play in driving this robust WFE growth. First, secular tailwinds such as AI, 5G, and IoT continue to strengthen. And over the past year, COVID-19-related impacts like work and learn from home have accelerated adoption of these technologies. Second, the complexity of manufacturing advanced semiconductor devices continues to increase at a rapid rate, leading to a rise in equipment capillarity [ph] across all segments. Third, innovative consumer products are incorporating more semiconductor-enabled functionality, driving faster growth in semiconductor content per [Technical Difficulty]. On our last call, we talked about new gaming consoles as an incremental driver for semiconductor demand and WFE. A similar example as we see in wearables. These devices are utilizing an increasing number of sophisticated sensors, manufactured using mature technology nodes to deliver added functionalities such as body temperature measurement, heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen sensing. Wearables are integrating these sensors with advanced node semiconductors that deliver lower power and lower latency, in addition to the computation capability required to support new AI and machine learning enabled applications. This is having a marked effect on semiconductor content in these products. And today's wearables contain nearly double the amount of DRAM and four times the amount of NAND versus five years ago. Semiconductors are also capturing a greater share of the value within the electronics supply chain, and we see 2021 semiconductor revenues into the electronics revenues breaking out of the historic averages over last 15 years. And finally, the growing importance of semiconductors to global industries has led governments in the U.S., Europe and Asia, to call for actions to mitigate supply chain risk, which will likely include increased investment in regional semiconductor manufacturing capacity. When combined, these four factors of accelerated technology adoption, growing complexity, increasing semiconductor content and real capacity investment support a compelling case for a strong multi-year WFE spending environment, one in which Lam is executing extremely well. In 2020, we gained share across both etch and deposition, including significant gains in conductor etch. We expect to deliver overall share growth again in 2021. Our positive momentum demonstrates how we are successfully positioning Lam as the partner of choice for our customers at a time when technology complexity has increased heavily. 3D scaling of device and packaging architectures will be a primary focus of the industry for the remainder of this decade, and Lam approaches this challenge with unique experience. We were the leader in enabling the transition to 3D devices through our early engagement in etching. And as a result, we built enduring leadership positions in the most critical etch and deposition applications. And as the 3D NAND roadmap is evolving to multi-stack scaling for higher layer counts, our technical contribution continues to grow. To integrate multiple stacks to build taller devices, innovative solutions are required for stress management, etch selectivity and defect control. The increase in complexity of multi-stack scaling is creating new product opportunities for Lam. And this quarter, we recorded a key deposition win for a multi-stack enabling film at a leading memory customer. Through our leadership in the 3D NAND market, Lam has developed a portfolio of products and acquired the expertise in high-volume manufacturing to help customers highly complex 3D scaling challenges across other device segments. In foundry/logic, the adoption of 3D-like gate all around or nanosheet type structures introduces unique processing requirements. In the last earnings call, I highlighted the momentum of our latest conductor etch system, KIYO GX, which utilizes an innovative plasma pulsing capability to deliver superior, high aspect ratio etch results for nanosheet structures. In the quarter, we saw additional application wins with KIYO at multiple foundry/logic customers. We are also seeing share gains with our new suite of selective etch products designed for ultra-high selectivity removal processes, previously performed using distance. Related to the challenge of the back end of line scaling, we are taking new approaches to deposit lower K materials and deliver better interface control. New material duration schemes enabled us to win multiple 5-nanometer back end-of-line applications. And in the March quarter, we extended our wins to more advanced nodes as well. In addition to device scaling, we remain equally focused on our customers' objectives to improve cost and operating efficiency in their fabs. You\u2019ll recall, we announced our new Vantex dielectric etch process module on the Sense.i platform. Vantex on Sense.i delivers best-in-class etch technology and brings to market unique and innovative solutions to lower overall cost of ownership. The Sense.i platform architecture increases wafer output per square meter of fab space. New RF power designs consume less energy to support cost and ESG roadmaps, and advanced equipment intelligence and self-maintenance capabilities minimize required on-site human intervention. With semiconductor demand at unprecedented levels, these factors have become critical differentiators as customers look to cost effectively and sustain ramp capacity on advanced nodes. As a result, we continue to make solid progress on Sense.i adoption and leading customers. Our focus on helping customers solve productivity and manufacturing challenges is also reflected in the excellent performance of our installed base business where we are seeing outstanding [ph] growth. CSBG revenue eclipsed $1.3 billion in the March quarter, yet another record. We are executing very well in this business. And as we sit here today, we are tracking ahead of the growth model that we shared with you at last year's Investors Day. All product lines within CSBG had record revenues in the quarter. Our upgrades business is expected to roughly double over the two-year period ending in 2021. By enhancing productivity and extending installed base capability for multiple generations, our upgrades business plays an important part in our customers' cost reduction roadmaps. In Reliant, we see specialty technologies continuing to grow in areas like CIS, power and RF devices. In spares, we successfully closed with a key customer, the single largest annual contract in the company's history, which includes commitments for critical leading etch parts. And lastly, we are seeing great progress in services. Big data and equipment intelligence are playing an increasingly critical role in the operation of advanced semiconductor fabs. This quarter, we closed a multi-region data services license contract with a major memory manufacturer to provide enhanced tool data to enable their smart manufacturing roadmap. Additionally, our services team completed the first year of a comprehensive multiyear equipment intelligence services contract at another major memory producer. System performance under this contract exceeded objectives, leading to a significant return on investment for the customer. So, to conclude, we are in an environment where industry fundamentals continue to strengthen. The strategic relevance of semiconductors is reaching new heights and semiconductor capital equipment is well-positioned to benefit. Amid strong WFE spending, Lam is delivering great results and making foundational investments in new products and infrastructure to drive continued outperformance. Thanks again for joining today and now here's Doug. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thanks Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today during what I know is a busy earnings season. I hope you and your family is safe and healthy since we last spoke with you. Lam delivered outstanding results for the March quarter, with record quarterly revenue and strong profitability metrics. For the quarter, our revenue and gross margin came in above the midpoint of our guidance, and both operating income and earnings per share were above the guidance range. We've continued our excellence in execution, not only in delivering impressive financial results, but also in being our customers' most trusted partner. We delivered revenue for the March quarter of $3.85 billion at the high end of our guidance range, which was an increase of 11% from the -- quarter. Our solid revenue performance was mainly due to an increase in foundry-related systems as well as record performance in our customer support business group, or CSBG, where we had increases in all parts of that business. Our customers' fabs are running at high utilization levels, which drives the need for consumption of spare parts and services. First, let's focus on our systems revenue where we saw continued strength in the memory segment, which represented 62% of systems revenue in the March quarter. The NAND segment was 48% of our systems revenue compared with 51% in the prior quarter, with customers investing in higher 3D device layer -- and added capacity to address the overall broad demand for storage bids. The March quarter NAND systems revenue amount reached a record level, again, demonstrating Lam's leadership position in the NAND segment. Customers were primarily investing in equipment for 96 and 128-layer class devices. In DRAM, we had 14% of our March quarter systems revenue in this segment compared with 17% in the prior quarter. Year-end investments consisted of both conversion and capacity additions with concentration in the 1y, 1z, and 1-alpha nodes. We expect to continue to see healthy and prudent levels of investment in the overall memory segment in calendar year 2021. We had our highest quarterly revenue level in the March quarter for the foundry segment, and it came in at 31% of our systems revenue compared with 26% in the quarter. We're seeing leading-edge investments focused on 5-nanometer as well as spending related to mature technology nodes required to meet higher demand for specialty or consumer-oriented integrated circuits. And finally, logic and other contributed the remaining 7% of systems revenue in the March quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter level at 6%. Let me now shift to the regional profile of our revenue. The China region came in at 32% of our total revenues, down slightly from 35% in the December quarter. The majority of the China spending this quarter was from domestic Chinese customers. The Korea region was also strong for us in the March quarter, representing 31% of revenues, which is up 10 points from the prior quarter. And as Tim mentioned, we achieved another record quarter of revenue for our customer support business group, coming in at $1.3 billion, which is an increase of 13% from December and up over 50% versus the same quarter in 2020. The growth we've seen in each of the subsegments of this business is a testament to the value we're providing to our customers for technology and productivity enhancements, as well as the strength of this market supported by our Reliant product line. We're also supporting customers' requests for increasing spare parts purchases to support both higher equipment utilization and some level of inventory stocking. We expect continued strength in CSBG through the remainder of the year. Let me now shift to profitability. March gross margin was 46.3%, generally in line with our expectations. And I'll remind you, as I always do, gross margin fluctuates quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix. We do continue to incur higher freight and logistics costs because of the COVID environment, and we expect these costs will remain until we see a normalization of airfreight volumes. Operating expenses for the March quarter were $567 million, slightly higher than the prior quarter, reflecting our commitment to manage expense levels, while we invest to grow the company. We've prioritized our spending towards R&D, which represents over two-thirds of our operating expenses, enabling us to build on our deposition and etch leadership positions. Operating income exceeded $1.2 billion in the March quarter, with operating margin coming in over the guidance range at 31.6%. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 7.8%, which came in lower than we expected due to incremental deductions from equity compensation for annual investing that occurred during the quarter. As we've discussed in the past, we will have fluctuations in the tax rate from quarter-to-quarter, and you should continue to expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level for the 2022 calendar year. I would mention, we continue to monitor potential tax changes that could come from the new administration in the United States. Other income and expense was approximately $42 million in expense, which is lower than the prior quarter and lower than the typical run rate, primarily due to marketed items like foreign exchange and interest rates. And as a reminder, beginning in the March quarter of last year, the benefits and costs of our employee deferred compensation plan are no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. The mismatch was $8 million for the March 2021 quarter, and you can see the details of this in the GAAP reconciliation table of our earnings release. We paid $187 million in dividends and allocated over $900 million towards share repurchases, tracking nicely with our committed Lam capital return plans. Further buyback in the quarter went to a structured repurchase program, which was supplemented with open market repurchases. Diluted earnings per share came in at $7.49 above the guidance range. This was the results of the higher revenue gross margin, as well as formality [ph] that I mentioned in the tax rate. Our diluted share balance was down from the December quarter level, coming in at 145 million shares, as we expected. The share count includes the dilutive impact of approximately 500,000 shares from the 2041 convertible notes. In addition mention is that late in the March quarter, we issued a redemption notice for the 20 41 convertible notes. As of March quarter end, we had approximately $17 million remaining on these notes. This redemption would retire the last of the convertible notes in our capital. Let me shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, decreased slightly to $6 billion from $6.3 billion in the prior quarter. The decrease was attributed to the capital return activity, offset by the strong performance we had in the March quarter cash flows from operations, which came in at a record level of $0.2 billion. Days sales outstanding decreased to 66 days in the March quarter from 76 that we saw in December. This improvement was driven by strong cash generation with the higher level of business, and as I alluded to last quarter, the timing of collections across the December and March quarters. Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter, coming in at 3.2 times. Given the overall demand strength we're seeing as well as our focus to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions, inventory turns will likely remain at these current levels for the foreseeable future. Non-cash expenses included approximately $56 million for equity compensation, $61 million for depreciation and $18 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the March quarter were down slightly versus the December level, coming in at $90 million. As I noted in our last earnings call, we're investing to support the expanding operations at our new Malaysia factory, our manufacturing facility in Ohio that's focused on critical spare parts and the upcoming Korea technology center. We expect to see somewhat higher levels of capital expenditures in 2021 as we support these critical growth initiatives. The headcount level ending the March quarter was approximately 13,100 regular full-time employees. Resources have been added in our factories to meet the increased output levels in this robust business environment. Within this, we opportunistically bought out our Asian joint venture manufacturing facility that is focused on our Reliant product line. This added half of the growth in headcount that you saw in the quarter. Additionally, we've added field service and R&D personnel with a focus on delivering best-in-class technology services and solutions to our customers. Now looking ahead, I'd like to provide you our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2021 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4 billion, plus or minus $250 million, gross margin of 46.5%, plus or minus 1%, operating margin margins up 32%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $7.50, plus or minus $0.50 based on a share of approximately 144 million shares. So, in summary, I'm quite pleased with our operational execution, which is reflected in the strong financial performance of the company. We now see greater strength in WFE as we go through calendar 2021, with the second-half looking stronger than the first-half. We are guiding to continuing record financial performance for the company, and we are well on the path to achievement of our growth objectives that we spoke to you about at our -- Investor Day in March of last year. I've personally never been so excited for the things the semiconductor industry is enabling, and I'm proud of the results Lam has continued to deliver enabling this industry. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I assume that given the strong demand trends across leading edge and lagging edge, that the team has seen extended tools. Wondering if you can quantify, is the team already starting to book into the second-half of this year? And if I'm a customer that places an order today for one of your tools, when will this tool actually be producing wafers? Is it nine months from now, 12 months from now? Would appreciate any insights. Tim Archer : Yes. Harlan, thanks for the question. Obviously, for a lot of reasons, we're not going to divulge our lead times on this call. But we will say that, clearly, what we said is unprecedented demand, and combining that with COVID impacts capacity is tight, and it has extended our lead times. We would say our visibility into our future is quite good at this point, but we don't want to go into exactly how long it takes for a customer to order to get it and qualify it at this point for competitive reasons, ours and our customers. Harlan Sur : Yes. Appreciate that. If I think about the fundamental environment, right, if I look at your memory business and I look at your customers, so both NAND and DRAM pricing fundamentals continue to move higher, combination of strong demand, relatively disciplined supply spending. In fact, relatively disciplined supply spending since the last week in 2018. Most of your customers are anticipating that DRAM and NAND bit demand will exceed its supply growth here in 2021. I know you guys do a pretty good job on the analytics side around supply and demand. I'm just wondering how you see the supply/demand balance in memory, especially as we move through the back half of this year and factoring in the incrementally better WFE outlook that you outlined today. Tim Archer : Yes I'll go ahead and make a couple of comments and then let Doug chime in with some of the specifics on the supply. Clearly, we've said even entering this year, we felt it was going to be a very good year for memory for a couple of reasons. One, DRAM had gone through a couple of years of very conservative spending. And so there was some pent-up demand there for spending both on technology and some capacity. From a NAND perspective, we talked a lot about the increasing spend related to layer transitions that were going to be occurring this year. And so, we have seen that playing out. I think you combine that with, again, growing demand across many, many different end market segments and also the need to add capacity both in a greenfield perspective as well as conversions and that's led to an ongoing stronger outlook. We do model obviously bit supply and demand. I'll let Doug talk a little bit about what we're seeing there. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Harlan, thanks for the question. Yes. We came through 2019 where spending was held pretty closely in check and even through a good chunk of 2020 and maybe all the way through 2020 for DRAM. And when you look at the two years of investment there, exiting last year and you look at supply growth, it was below where longer-term demand growth was in both NAND and DRAM. And I think you saw that and are still seeing it in pricing. And as a result, our customers respond -- we see them responding carefully, prudently is the way I like to describe it, consistent with where they see demand growth. And the investments we're starting to see increase somewhat in both NAND and DRAM are a result of that. We continue to believe long-term NAND demand to be in the mid-high 30% in bit supply and not caught up of that yet, and that's why investment is up. Similarly, in DRAM, we think longer-term demand is in high teens, maybe approaching 20%. And as a result, the supply growth is being invested in to try to get caught up with that. That's really what we see going on. Harlan Sur : Thank you for the insights. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Harlan. Tim Archer : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Tim, I want to talk a little bit about kind of market. Tim, in your prepared comments, you talked about your expectation for this being another market share gaining year for you. And at the Analyst Day a year ago, I think to your 2023 model, you guys had sort of embedded sort of 4% to 8% points of share in etch and dep. I'm just kind of curious to what extent was that sort of time-sensitive versus volume-sensitive? And as WFE kind of gets ratcheted up here at a faster rate, do you expect share gain to happen more quickly? And while you're on the topic of share, the perception on Wall Street is that you guys are extremely well positioned in the NAND market, but I think perhaps people are underestimating your positioning in kind of logic/foundry. Kind of curious, if you can talk about the areas outside of NAND where you feel most comfortable about share growth this year and going forward. Tim Archer : Yes. Sure. John, I'll start this one. I think it's a great question. And I would actually say this, breaking it in this way of time versus volume [Technical Difficulty] where we already possess a very strong leadership position like 3D NAND, increased WFE volume helps with share gain immediately. But that \u2013 but it's not just a volume story, because time progresses and transitions occur to greater numbers of layers. We actually see both more equipment needing to be purchased to deposit and etch those thicker stacks, but also new applications that get created that, again, expand our SAM, and with time, even build on a really strong NAND position. So there's kind of an element to both volume and time in there. On foundry/logic, a little bit of the same, although, I think most people know that we've laid out a story of how some of the technical inflections really do create new opportunities for Lam to introduce new products, gain share and build a strong position in foundry/logic. I would say there, there definitely is a time element in that we need technology transitions to occur. You need to go from 7 to 5 and 5 to 3 and, ultimately, 3 to 2, because we're focused on catching the new applications that are being created by the most difficult technical challenges. And so in my prepared remarks, I talked about things like nanosheets, gate all around, the 3D-like inflections that are occurring. And those -- there's a time element. They have to -- they -- those nodes have to ramp, and they're not ramping just yet. We talked about EUV and our new dry resist process, again, a great opportunity for Lam to enter into a space that's - in foundry/logic that we just haven't been in up to this point, but we -- those are future node-looking opportunities for Lam over the next several years. And so, again, I think that's why what you hear from us is confidence that we benefit from the strong environment we're in now, but we're laying the foundation for an even stronger future as time evolves. John Pitzer : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, John. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about the customer service business a little bit. Can you give us some idea of how much of the strength in the quarter -- coming from the Reliant mature node tool set? I get the idea that there's more mature node capacity need right now. Do you feel like that is a long-term trend? Is that sustainable? And maybe if you could give us some -- any further color on the amount of the CSBG group that's actually coming from upgrades. And I guess the same question, are there -- is there more like a onetime element to that? Or do you think the run rate of what we're seeing right now is a sustainable driver for that business going forward? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Stacy, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll take this and let Tim add on afterwards. I think both Tim and I said in our script, all components of BG business delivered record performance last quarter. You're right about the Reliant product line, very much focused on maybe trailing etch 28-nanometer and above nodes, another record. I think we're printing double-digit number of quarters where we've delivered records there because of the things you're referencing or referring to. Upgrades were very strong, which is always a high ROI for the customers to get increased capability from the installed base. Spares were very strong. Think of that as being driven by utilization in the industry, broadly speaking. Utilizations are very high. I see our customers trying to build a little bit of inventory in spares similar to what we're doing with our own inventory because of concerns about different supply chain disruptions. So -- and then service. Service also correlates with utilization in the industry. So honestly, when you think about what's going on in the totality of CSBG, $1.3 billion, up 50% from a year ago is hitting on all four cylinders that I just mentioned. And each of them have their own unique tailwinds that are driving the business. Stacy Rasgon : Yes. I think, service wise\u2026 Tim Archer : Maybe just -- sorry, go ahead, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon : No, no. Please go ahead. Tim Archer : No, I was just going to add on. I think to your point about the sustainability of upgrades, I think the one key point is that we've said the installed base grows every year. And so really, that is our opportunity. So we -- naturally, by Lam shipping like in a year like this, so many new systems out into the field, our SAM expands for upgrades every single year. And so we really do think that through innovation and coming up with ideas for how the customers extend the capabilities of the tools and improve productivity, it's in our hands to continue to deliver greater revenue capture from every one of those tools that's out in that installed base and so I think that's quite sustainable. And then to your point of the lagging edge, clearly, there's a very strong demand at this point. And kind of to the first question about capacity constraints and lead times, that problem doesn't get solved probably in a very short order of time. And when I think about sustainability there, it goes to this point I made in my talk about it's about semiconductor content in everything, enabling new functionality, and many of those items are making great use of mature technologies. So, we've seen that business just grow quarter after quarter after quarter, expanding with the overall market. So, I think both have a strong sustainability component to their revenues. Stacy Rasgon : Do you think it would be possible to give us some rough split of how the customer service business breaks up right now between those four categories, upgrades, repairs, and services? Doug Bettinger : We haven't quantified it, and I'm not going to now. I think the color we have given is the spare parts piece of it is the largest component, but we haven't quantified it. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Thank you very much guys. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Actually, I had two. I guess the first one, Doug, obviously, CSBG is running like roughly 15% above your 2020, and you gave that a little bit over a year ago. So, I guess, the first question is sort of what did you under appreciate in that model a year ago? I know that WFE and your systems business has really just taken off, and maybe that's the answer that you're still growing double the installed base, and that's just taken off more than you thought. And then I had a second question as well. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I mean Tim alluded to chamber account. Clearly, it's been a very strong year and so chamber account is higher than I think I would have thought a year ago. Industry -- probably stronger than I would have expected a year ago as well. And upgrades is probably benefiting from that also, Tim. So there's probably an aspect of it in each of the segments. And yes, we are certainly ahead of the model that we gave you a year ago. I'm not ready to update the model. But clearly, we're ahead of where that model is. Timothy Arcuri : Yes. Okay. Thanks. And then also, I keep getting a lot of questions on NAND and your business, and you guys do a great job mapping the WFE back to bits. And my math says we're running close to $5 billion a quarter in NAND WFE right now, and it sounds like you think that goes up into the back half of the year. So, if that's right, and then I tie it back to your comments that you mapped kind of $15 billion a year to drive mid-30s bit growth, and then I think you said $350 million for each 100 basis points beyond that, that would sort of scale up to like 45% bit growth, maybe as high as 50% just on like a run rate basis. So, I keep getting pinged on that from people asking about that. So, can you sort of tie those numbers back? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : I don't know if I can do all the math that you just asked on the call, Tim. I mean investment ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows in each of the end markets flows in NAND. We did say we expect the second-half to be stronger investments in all aspects of the market, including NAND. Yes, it's up this year from where it was last year. It's getting caught up with kind of the under-investment that we saw in 2019. To a certain extent, you're still seeing very strong pricing. And as a result, people are investing, trying to get caught up with where demand is, honestly. And it'll ebb and flow. It won't go up every single quarter. We see a very strong investment this year, and I think it's going to continue in the long term to be very strong, right? But I can't do all the math that you just asked, sitting here on the call. I'd be happy to follow up with you offline, though. Tim Arcuri : Thanks, Doug. Cool. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a very strong results. I have two, one is the short term and one is the long-term question. The short-term question for Doug is, is there a way you can quantify how your second-half revenue is going to trend with the first-half? Or do you think CSBG revenues would outperform system revenues in calendar 2021? And then, I had a follow-up for Tim. Doug Bettinger : Krish, did you say second-half earnings? I didn't quite catch. Krish Sankar : Second-half revenues versus first-half revenues, and would CSBG be greater than system revenue growth this year? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Krish, we guide one quarter at a time, and then we give you color about what we see for the year. And I'll remind you what we tried to say. We see WFE in the second quarter, which is good for the trajectory of our business. So you can read into that what you think for our revenues, but WFE is stronger is going to be a good thing for us. We just guided June up to $4 billion. So that's as much as I'm going to give you on the revenue side. So, yes, it's been like a pretty strong year, and we see the second-half spending stronger than the first-half across all of WFE. And what I say -- yes, Krish, what I said on CSBG is, I expect it to be a strong year for CSBG, a continued strong -- give you a hard number on it, but all the tailwinds that I described look like they're continuing. Krish Sankar : Fair enough. Thanks. And then just a follow-up for Tim, a longer-term question. When you look at like some of the upcoming technologies like gate all around, it looks like selective removal etch would be important in addition to Epi. So I'm kind of curious, how is Lam positioned for gate all around. And is there a way you can quantify the dollar or revenue opportunity for Lam? Tim Archer : No, I don't think there's a way we can do that. But what we've said is that Lam SAM expands at every technology node. And clearly, gate all around is the map. What we tried to point out is, again, what's -- what is sort of the embodiment of our product and technology strategies to identify new applications, new requirements that emerge when device technology changes, when architectures change and ensure that Lam is positioned early for those with products and with our customers, so that when the change happens, we're in a great position to win those. We've given you a few examples, not all of the examples, but I think that, that's -- that's again, it's just to give you a sense that when these inflections occur, we're -- we have a track record of doing quite well. It's also why we keep pointing back. It's the same strategy we executed through the 3D NAND inflection. And ultimately, over time, it's built for us an incredible business. And so, I think, gate all-around is coming as an opportunity for us in that way. We pointed out EUV and the ultimate changes in the way patterning is done and what we see anyway for the opportunity for Driver Assist is another, while not gate-all-around focused, it's kind of at the same technology node where those changes occur. So we see promise in foundry/logic for our future. Krish Sankar : Okay. Thanks. Thanks all. Tim Archer : Thanks, Krish. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you talked about second-half WFE higher than first-half. Curious what magnitude of upside this could support versus simply just being sold out and pushing demand into the first-half of 2022. And as part of that, can you speak to the timing of ramping capacity in Malaysia and bringing more resources on for you guys? Tim Archer : Okay. C.J., let me get it go on this one. Clearly, what we've said is that capacity is tight. And so the very first question, I probably could have even added. If a customer would order a tool today, when they get it, I won't divulge, but I mean, clearly, it will not be adding to qualified capacity this year. I mean that, sort of, gives you some sense of where lead times and such are. But we do have a couple of events coming in the second-half of the year that are meaningful for us, and that is expansion of our Asian manufacturing facilities. Doug talked about the buyout of our JV in Taiwan as an opportunity for us to take a little bit more control for that entity and continue ramping. And Malaysia is a second-half 2021 story for us in terms of its ramp. And so we are confident in long-term capacity needs for the company, and we want to be able to support and return lead time is back towards more historical levels for the company. And as I said, they're extended now. Part of this capacity expansion is to return those more to normal as we get towards the end of the year. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, for domestic China revenues, was that primarily manned and as you able to obtain a license for SMIC yet? Doug Bettinger : C.J., demand in local China customer base, broad-based. Trailing etch foundry, a little bit of DRAM, a little bit in NAND. As to license for our large foundry customer in China, no update. We're still waiting to hear back from the government. C.J. Muse: Great. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks C.J. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results. Doug, I wanted to follow-up on China. I guess I've been a little bit surprised how long your China business has been over the past quarter or two despite some of the restrictions placed on SMIC. What's been the offset to the upside in your China business? You just talked about broad-based demand, but did anything stand out over the past quarter or two? And how are you thinking about calendar 2021 local China WFE on a year-over-year basis? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Tim Archer : Yes. Sure. I'll take a crack at it. I mean, it's broad-based. First thing, I'll remind you that when you see our regional revenue, it's a ship to fab location. So it's -- there's a balance between local China and global multinationals taking equipment at their -- in their fabs in China. I did say that the majority, more than half last quarter were the local Chinese customers. The quarter before, in the December quarter, it was the other way around. It was more MMC-oriented. So it's pretty broad. And it's -- then relative to the local China component of it, it's a broad set of customers. Some of you probably know, but I would tell you, there's a long tail of smaller customers that maybe you're just getting to know or maybe you don't know yet. So, it's a broad set of people investing. And thinking about WFE from local China this year, it's up from last year. It's growing across laying edge, logic nodes, and memory. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, on CSBG, Doug, you mentioned the long-term growth outlook there is now better to what you presented last year at your Analyst Day. Is that simply a function of the 2021 base being higher? Or has something changed structurally or fundamentally in CSBG? You talked about the chamber account obviously being higher and utilization rates being higher, but anything kind of structural that has changed over the past 12 months? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : No, I wouldn't point anything structural. It's -- we're shipping more chamber, so that\u2019s some bigger opportunity from I guess I think of an available market standpoint and its pieces of all four components in CSBG. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. May I follow-up on that last question? Doug, you made the comment that you can't see the services business. You'd be very surprised to see it not grow each year. And obviously, the chamber count growing is a nice kind of lead indicator. But when you talk about a lot of the drivers of higher utilization, people building inventory of spares, things like that, that are sort of a function of this very tight supply environment that we're in, do you see those things turning into headwinds next year? And I mean it still seems like you're likely to grow given the growth in chamber count. But the outperformance versus chamber count, can that continue beyond this kind of very strong near-term environment? Doug Bettinger : No, I don't have any different view of the business, Joe. I have a hard time seeing it not growing every year. It doesn't mean it's going to grow every single quarter, but we're shipping a lot of chambers this year, which is the momentum of the business going into next year and beyond. Not every component of it may grow every year, but we're feeling really good about where it's going. And like I said, the chamber count is an important metric to think about future business opportunity. Tim Archer : And Joe, if -- I don't know if you remember, but at our Investor Day, we showed an objective we had about revenue capture for chamber as well. And so I pointed out in my comments a couple of places we're making progress. It is about trying to develop some of these data and equipment intelligence, services offerings, also productivity upgrades. Clearly, customers are focused on trying to get as much output out of existing installed base as they can, and those types of services and upgrades help them do that. And in that way, as chamber count grows, we're also expanding SAM for those. So, that's another reason why we believe year-on-year, we can continue to grow that installed base business. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks Joe. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. First on the NAND side, I was hoping you could give us a sense for how much of the market right now is -- versus greenfield deployments? And how does that compare to what it was last year? And does this ratio impact the benefit you can derive from the market? Like does the spending intensity change, right, depending on whether there is more conversion versus greenfield? Tim Archer : Yes. Vivek, I'll take that one first and let Doug comment. But fundamentally, there is -- and I said this on our last call, our view for this year is a bit more greenfield investment this year than last year. There's also more conversion investment as well. So the overall market is up. But there is an important difference in terms of the capital intensity per bit in the greenfield, which is higher. Conversions are more efficient. But what's unique for Lam is those conversions, our share -- our capture of the WFE is much higher in the conversions. And so, while we really do sell the same things in both instances, in the conversion, it's mostly etch and deposition equipment that's required to continue to build those taller stacks. And so we do very well there. So this year, it's a blend of both. But I think that, again, it's one of the reasons why, as we look going forward, every tool that gets installed for a greenfield, ultimately, as customers transition to higher layer counts, those tools will ultimately need to be upgraded and move forward through that next layer count. And that means our opportunity for the installed base business just continues to grow, the more fabs ultimately that we built for NAND. Vivek Arya : All right. Very helpful, Tim. And for my second question, if I take a longer-term view of WFE, what we have seen is that, historically, it will grow for two, at most three, and then it'll kind of consolidate there for a few years. And then, it'll take another big step-up. When I look at the WFE outlook for this year, this will be the second year of very strong growth. How do you think about WFE intensity from these levels? And when do you think we should start to bake in any incremental benefits from the regionalization or increased domestic manufacturing headlines that we see in U.S. and Europe? Tim Archer : Yes. It's a great question, and we were -- there's no doubt when you have strong years, people start wondering when you'll get a year of the strong. We haven't talked about whether 2022 is up or -- but we have said, we feel we are in a strong multiyear environment. We think it's too early to really know how all these factors I talked about play out in any given year. But over the longer term, we see these new technologies and increasing content, we definitely know increasing complexity. You're hearing that from all of our customers. Increasing complexity is increasing equipment capital intensity. And then your regional comment, another bit of a wildcard, but definitely positive, given everything that is going on that you're seeing in chip shortages and all the discussions there. So I think those items, they will play out over a multiyear period. Recent -- we're kind of aligned with recent things we've read in the media that say, chip shortages don't get solved in 2021. Regional capacity investment ambitions don't get solved in just a couple of year period. These are multi-year trends that we think are tailwinds for semiconductor capital equipment. Vivek Arya : Thank you, Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just I want to ask specifically an analysis of DRAM market, it's been an undersupply. You haven't seen kind of any company, you really see a big uptick. Just the fact, that is what's going on there and if you see any uptick as you look in the back half of the second year. And then just for Doug, just when you laid out your long-term targets, obviously, a $75 billion WFE is higher than that. You're dealing with higher shipping costs. But just a perspective on, I don't know when you're going to be able to sell the shipping cost or perspective on getting that margin back from the 33% to 34% target that you laid out? Doug Bettinger : Yes. So you really -- you've got two questions here, Blayne, what's going on DRAM and then what's going on the target model. I'll take a cut at both and then let Tim comment on either one. Yes, we see -- DRAM investment, when I look at it, it's a pretty consolidated set of customers. And I just view them prudently managing capacity, prudently managing where they see pricing, prudently managing how they bring capacity online and paying attention to profitability is really what I see going on. And so that's why when we look at this year, the first-half, DRAM still is fairly muted in terms of level of investment, and you see it ticking up a little bit in the second-half as the industry tries to bring supply closer to where demand is. It's just in a pretty healthy place is how I see it. And yes, that's all -- that's what I get there. Relative to the long-term model, a couple of things to think about. First on the logistics costs. We're going to be dealing with elevated logistics costs until global airfreight gets back to a more normalized level. I don't know when that's going to happen. I think it's going to require some level of consumer travel again because a lot of stuff flies around in the belly of commercial aircraft. And so I'm optimistic it gets progressively better, but we're still seeing headwinds for the foreseeable future. Then relative to the financial model getting at slightly higher profitability, first, I feel great about where we just guided, right, 32% operating income at the midpoint; that would be the second highest level of profitability the company has generated in its 40-plus-year history. So I'm feeling good about what's going on there. There's a time component to the profitability as well, which has to do with some of the things that we talked about on the call today, ramping a factory in Asia -- in the Asia regions where cost structure is a little bit better, dealing with those freight logistics costs. I still feel really good about attaining that financial model. And I think actually, you're seeing demonstration of it this year from us already. I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything. Tim Archer : Yes. No, I think the only thing I would add is, clearly to echo Doug's comment, we're extremely happy with the 32% guide. And in the same vein, we're investing a lot for our future. I mean, Doug mentioned the Malaysia factory, which will help, new Korea technology center coming up, put us closer to our customers, accelerate solutions, bolster our opportunities per share gain across both memory and foundry/logic, new products that are coming out. I mean, I can't remember a time when Lam has had more new products coming out, really focused on key technology inflections across all device segments. And so we're very happy, we're delivering these financial results and making these investments that we think make us much stronger going forward. Blayne Curtis : Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Blayne. Tina Correia : Excuse me, Operator, we have time for one more question please. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our last question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Weston Twigg : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to ask a follow-up on C.J.'s question around your revenue capacity capability in the back half of the year. It sounds like it maxed out in terms of your system revenue heading into the June quarter, and it loosens up a little bit. But can you give us a feel for what that peak could be? Is it $2.8 billion? Is it $3 billion just from, sort of, boundary in terms of what you're limited by -- from a revenue perspective? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Weston, I'm going to quantify for you, but we're making investments across all of the factory network. We talked about taking ownership of a Taiwan factory. We talked about ramping a new factory in Malaysia. We're trying to squeeze incremental capacity out of what the other existing locations to try to get those lead-times back to a more normalized level that Tim was referencing. And so as we do those things, our capability will get bigger. I'm not going to quantify it for you, but we're working on all of that stuff. Weston Twigg : Okay. So, it just sounds like -- as long as we think about a gradual improvement over time, we should be -- and don't get too crazy, which should be in the ballpark. The other question I have is just in terms of revenue growth drivers. And wondering if you could just give us a feel for the rate of growth of your systems revenue that's driven by 10-nanometer and below in logic versus some of the older nodes where you're also seeing pretty good growth. Is the rate similar? Or are you saying you're still seeing quite a bit faster growth at the leading edge, which is what we would typically expect? Doug Bettinger : The majority of the spending in foundry and logic is at those leading edge nodes. Even though there's a broad-based set of investment occurring less because of the capital intensity at the leading edge node, that's usually what drives a lot of what's going on. Weston Twigg : Okay, that\u2019s what I would expect. Perfect. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Wes. Operator : Thank you. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Tina Correia : Thank you, operator and thank you all for joining our call today. We appreciate your time. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Our June quarter results reflect continued strong execution across our systems and services businesses. The quarter came in well above expectations with record revenues of $4.15 billion and earnings per share of $8.09. We also generated record cash from operations in the quarter of $1.4 billion. The June quarter marked the end of Lam's fiscal year, and despite a challenging operating environment, we delivered the highest revenue in the company's history. Compared to the prior fiscal year, revenues grew more than 45% to $14.6 billion. Earnings per share increased at an even faster pace to a record $27.25 in fiscal year 2021, more than 70% higher than in fiscal year 2020. The demand environment for semiconductor equipment remains strong. And we now see wafer fabrication equipment spending in calendar 2021 trending above $80 billion. While absolute WFE spending levels have risen to new highs, we remain confident in the health and sustainability of the industry at these levels. Wafer fab equipment spending as a percentage of semiconductor industry operating profit remains within historical ranges, and semiconductors continue to enable critical technology transformations such as AI, 5G, high performance computing and IoT. We believe, robust semiconductor demand, rising device manufacturing complexity, and strategic regional investments are powerful drivers for multi-year WFE spending. By device segments, we see strength across NAND, DRAM and Foundry/Logic in calendar 2021. Against the backdrop of broad demand, increasing device manufacturing complexity plays well to Lam's strength in critical applications, and continues to create new growth opportunities. Looking at the past five years, as manufacturing complexity increased in NAND with the transition to 3D, Lam gained over six points of share of WFE in this segment, and leads the next closest supplier by about eight points of customer spend. In the June quarter, we secured another win for a critical deposition application, and are now the tool of record for all NAND manufacturers for this process. Instrumental to our success has been the differentiation afforded by our quad station chamber design. Our multi station architecture refined over many years, allows us to use sequential processing to precisely tailor film properties to meet the needs of next generation devices without compromising the productivity required for high volume NAND, DRAM and Foundry/Logic manufacturing. Another example where we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from rising complexity is through our enablement of higher quality surface conditioning. Surface properties have been shown to greatly impact device performance. And existing surface preparation methods are in many cases insufficient to meet the stricter requirements for new materials, and tighter dimensional control at advanced nodes. For the Foundry/Logic segment, we recently introduced a range of novel, selective edge strip and surface treatment solutions that use our ultra-high selectivity, zero damage process capability to remove unwanted materials with minimal impact to other layers. We are gaining significant momentum with this new approach, with multiple Lam tools selected by a large customer in the June quarter, as tool of record for leading-edge applications. We plan to share more details on this innovation in the near future. Additional opportunities for Lam are being driven by the need for higher pattern fidelity, as Foundry/Logic pitch tolerance is tightened. For extremely small features, the relationship between change in resistance to change in dimension is exponential, therefore necessitating an extreme level of precision in device fabrication and advanced nodes. Even small variations in pattern roughness can degrade RC and transistor speed. In response, we have developed edge solutions such as our RF plasma pulsing capability to reduce line roughness by up to 30%. This technology has proven to be a key enabler for many critical edge applications. And when combined with our proprietary uniformity and RF power solutions, has helped Lam maintain our overall market-leading position in multi patterning edge. As the industry transitions to even more demanding EUV patterning, we are seeing success applying these technology solutions to win new EUV patterning steps. Solving complex scaling challenges including transitions to 3D structures in Foundry/Logic and DRAM will not be accomplished without deeper collaboration across the ecosystem. Our customers are increasingly highlighting the need for closer partnerships with the equipment industry, to meet their overall device performance and cost roadmaps. As a result, we continue to expand R&D investments closer to customers, with the aim of accelerating new application development, shortening cycles of learning and strengthening our understanding of the customer's most difficult problems. In addition to these regional R&D investments, I am pleased to announce that we recently shipped our first modules from our new Malaysia factory. This new facility adds resiliency to our global manufacturing network, creates capability closer to key customers and supply chain partners, and provides us with urgently needed capacity to support our continuing growth. I would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the Lam employees and partners that completed the Malaysia project on time, despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. In our customer support business, June quarter revenue growth again outpaced growth in chamber count. Our service upgrades and reliant businesses all delivered record quarters. Reliant has now shown growth for 10 consecutive quarters, driven by strong investments in power, CIS and non-leading edge foundry. We achieved in the quarter a key edge penetration, and one of the top 5G RF providers, exhibiting our technical leadership in this space. Also, the spares team executed a major contract and a key customer in Asia, which secures a stream of revenue from our installed base. While, quarter-on-quarter CSPG growth rates can vary based on customer investment patterns, we are very well-positioned to deliver strong calendar year growth with a portfolio of products and services focused on our customers' operational success. We are increasing the productivity of our customers tools and extending the life of their equipment, which contributes to lowering the overall environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing. On the topic of sustainability, I would like to share a few highlights for the company. In June, we released our annual environmental, social and governance report. I am very proud of our organization's efforts last year to support the needs of the communities in which we work and live, to keep our employees safe to the COVID-19 pandemic and to advance inclusion and diversity across our global workplace. This year's report introduced our goals of operating on 100% renewable energy by 2030, and achieving carbon net zero by 2050. We are driving innovations in product and process solutions in support of our sustainability objectives. For instance, our new Sense.i etch platform improves power efficiency, and requires less aluminum raw material for tool construction. Our new drivers this technology uses five to 10 times less chemistry, and two times less energy than the current process of record. Our parts cleaning, repair, refurbishment, and recoding services are enabling more reuse and lessening waste. These solutions drive sustainability and make Lam products more competitive in the marketplace. I encourage you to check out our report on our website to learn more. So to wrap up, we had an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. Most importantly, as we look to the future, we see rising device complexity and continuing transitions to 3D architectures driving growth of the Lam. Thank you all for listening today. Now here's Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today on what I know is a very busy earning season. As the world continues to face challenges with the pandemic, I hope you and your families have been safe and healthy since we last spoke with you. Lam continued to deliver outstanding performance with record quarterly revenue, operating income and earnings per share in the June 2021 quarter. Our revenue, gross margin and operating income came in at or above the midpoint of our guidance, and earnings per share were above our guidance range. We're extremely pleased with our operational execution. And we thank all of our customers, suppliers and employees for their dedication and support. Our revenue for the June quarter was $4.15 billion, represented an increase of 8% from the March quarter. We had record revenue in both our systems and our customer support business group. Now I'll turn to the details on systems revenue. The memory segment continues to be an area of strength for Lam and represented 59% of systems revenue in the June quarter. The NAND segment concentration was essentially flat with the prior quarter at 49% of our systems revenue, and again hit another record level in terms of revenue dollars. We saw customer investments in both capacity ads and conversions with spending primarily on 128 layer class devices. In the DRAM segment, we had 10% of our June quarter systems revenue versus 14% in the prior quarter. The DRAM investments were concentrated mainly in the 1z and 1-alpha nodes. And I would just mention, we do see DRAM spending strengthening into the second-half of this year. For the Foundry segment, we had our second consecutive quarter of record revenues, coming in at 35% of our June systems revenue, as compared with 31% in the March quarter. Foundry spending is occurring in both leading-edge and mature technologies to meet the end demand for various market drivers like AI, 5G in gaming, as well as specialty chips needed for things like IoT, image sensors and power devices. And finally, logic and other contributed the remaining 6% of systems revenue in the June quarter, which was essentially flat to the prior quarter percentage. Now, looking at the regional profile of our total revenue, the China region came in at 37% of our total revenues, up from 32% in the March quarter. The spending profile for the China region was generally balanced between the domestic and multinational customers with their fabs that are located in China. The Korea region also continued to be very strong in the June quarter, representing 30% of revenues. CSPG which is our installed base business came in at nearly $1.4 billion, which as I noted is another high point for this group. The revenue level is an increase of 6% from the March quarter and 49% higher than the same quarter in 2020. All of the sub segments of this business are delivering excellent performance. The reliant product line, that serves specialty market, upgrades where we're extending the life of our customers tools, as well as spares and service, that are supporting the high industry utilizations. All sub segments strongly contributed in the quarter. So let me shift to profitability, June quarter gross margin was 46.5%, right at the midpoint of the guided range. I'll remind you that our gross margins fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix. I would mention there continues to be elevated air freight and logistics costs due to the COVID environment impacting us in the current quarter, which are also reflected in the September quarter guidance. Operating expenses for June were $574 million, slightly higher than the prior quarter. You may note in our earnings release, that we did incur a charge during the quarter of approximately $6 million related to an asset impairment of the product line that we're shutting down. This charge was excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses. We've demonstrated our ability to scale a company profitably, as we've continued to decrease operating expenses as a percent of revenue. I'll also note that we've continued to prioritize R&D spending to ensure that we have the resources to continue to build on our technically differentiated leadership positions, and we've maintained an emphasis on R&D spending, and it continues to represent approximately two-thirds of our operating expenses. June quarter operating margin showed solid performance coming in over the midpoint of our guidance range at 32.6%, reflecting strong gross margin and operating expense management. This operating income percentage represents an all-time high watermark for Lam Research. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, generally in line with our expectations. As we\u2019ve noted in prior call, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level for the 2021 calendar year. And I would just mention, we're continuing to monitor potential tax changes that are under discussion in the current United States Administration. Other income and expense was approximately $23 million in expense, which is lower than the prior quarter as a result of a $30 million market gain in one of our venture capital investments. As we previously noted, OI&E is subject to market related volatility that could cause a difference from any typical run rate. And also just to remind you, beginning in the March quarter of 2020, the benefits and costs of our employee deferred compensation plan are no longer mismatched in our non-GAAP results. This mismatch was $17 million for the June 2021 quarter. And if you're interested you can see the details in the GAAP reconciliation tables in the earnings release. Now, let me shift to capital return, we paid $185 million in dividends and allocated $440 million towards share buyback. This is in line with our long-term capital return plans of 75% to 100% of our free cash flow. Earnings per share came in at $8.09, above the guidance range. The outperformance is due to the higher revenue and expense management, as well as the favorability, I noted in OI&E. The diluted share count balance was down slightly from the March quarter level coming in at 144 million shares. During the June quarter, we redeemed the remaining 2041 convertible notes, which I'm happy to tell you is the less convert that was in our capital structure. Let me shift to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash totaled $6 billion, which is flat with the prior quarter. We had record performance in the June quarter for cash flows from operations, which came in at $1.4 billion. During the quarter, our cash generation was deployed the pay down of $800 million of senior notes that were due in June, as well as cash outlays for the capital return activities that I mentioned. Day sales outstanding was flat to the March quarter at 66-days. Inventory turns were up slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 3.3 times. June quarter non-cash expenses included approximately $56 million for equity compensation, $60 million for depreciation and $18 million for amortization. We're investing in increasing our capacity and support of customers. And as a result, capital expenditures for the June quarter were up from the March level and came in at $105 million. We have investments occurring around the globe with our new Malaysia factory, which is formally opening this quarter, expansion in our U.S. critical spare parts facility in Ohio, and R&D investments in our new Korean lab facility. We expect to see somewhat elevated levels of capital expenditures in the remainder of calendar year 2021, as we support these growth initiatives. The headcount level ending June quarter was approximately 14,100 regular full time employees. Resources have been added in our factories and in the field, to meet the increased output levels and to support customers in their technology evaluations, as well as tool installation requirements. My final commentary to touch on for the June quarter is a follow-up in the ESG space, which obviously is strategically important for Lam Research. In June, we extended and upsized our revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion. We transitioned this facility to a sustainability linked revolver, which includes a pricing structure that is linked to certain performance metrics for energy savings, and employee safety. In addition to the ESG focus areas that Tim noted, this credit facility is further demonstration of our commitment to integrate ESG principles into all aspects of how we operate as a company. So now looking ahead, I'd like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2021 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.3 billion, plus or minus $250 million. Gross margin of 46%, plus or minus one percentage point. Operating margins of 32%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally earnings per share of $8.10, plus or minus $0.50, based on a share count of approximately 143 million shares. We continue to maintain a widened revenue range, as we work to mitigate ongoing output challenges in our global supply chain. These supply chain challenges are also driving a modest headwind in our guided gross margin. Customer demand continues to look strong in the second-half of 2021 as well as into next year. Lam is operating at record levels of financial performance, as a result of the tireless efforts of our operational organizations and supply chain partners. We continue to progress on our longer-term share gain objectives, with investments in new platforms like Sense.i and dry resist. We'd like to thank the company for rising to the challenge and delivering on these objectives. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Tim, notwithstanding your comments and your prepared commentary about still feeling comfortable with the industry is spending at healthy levels. We're also here it's all too seductive to kind of look at where your NAND quarterly revenue run rate is today, and go back and look at where that peaked in \u201918 to see that its higher. And I guess maybe you can help us out if you think about just the overall growth in complexity of NAND since \u201918, and I guess more importantly, your market share gains. How do we look at this number the June quarter and compare it to sort of a 1.287 you did in the March \u201818 quarter? Tim Archer : Yeah, it's obviously a question that we spend a lot of time thinking about. And I think you've hit on the most important point, which is what does it meant for Lam to see not only the transition to 3D, which I gave some elements of how it changed our position in terms of share of WFE over the last five years. That was my comment over six points of share gain of WFE. But more importantly, what are we doing going forward to ensure kind of durability in this business, meaning defending the positions we've worked hard to gain, but also benefiting from the complexity that's occurring because of layer scaling. And that's really our product focus. And so maybe to talk about complexity, number of layers increasing clearly is driving a strong demand for the tools that deposit those film stacks, etch the holes in those film stacks, and backfill them with the metallization. Those are the strongest positions Lam has within NAND. And we feel extremely good about there our defensibility of those positions. But even those are seeing changes. And so it's different materials, for instance, to reduce line resistance. We're seeing new opportunities for new tools. We talked about the vector DT dealing with stress issues as layer count increase. Those things didn't exist, just that application didn't exist just years ago. We're seeing the transition to ALV gapfill again, that application did not exist as an ALB film, and therefore not within Lam's wheelhouse at the last peak. And so, not only have we grown our existing positions, because the more layers, we've actually added more critical steps to the process. And I think it bodes well. At every peak, our goal is to expand our serve market in a way that if we come out stronger and bigger peak to peak. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And if I could follow-up, Doug, in your commentary, you talked about expectation for DRAM growth to accelerate from here. I think year-to-date, you guys are up about 13% versus the same period last year. You've had guys like ASML talk about DRAM CapEx being up as much as 60% for them. Now, clearly, they're benefiting from some easy assertion, but any numbers you can put around by how big of an acceleration do you expect in the back-half of the year? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, John, I'm not going to quantify it, because I never do when we're looking in the on segments, but it's going to grow nicely in the second-half. It's going to grow nicely because of our patterning positions. And, I feel really good about the trajectory when I look into the second-half for DRAM. It's going to be a good second-half. Let's leave it at that. John Pitzer : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on gross margins. Doug, can you give us a little more granularity on what's driving the headwind sequentially? And I guess, as part of that, would love to hear how we should be thinking about the ramp of Malaysia capacity and the impact of gross margins over time? Doug Bettinger : Thanks for the question, C.J., I expected this one pretty quickly in the call. Listen, when I look out over the next quarter there's challenges in the supply chain. And some of those challenges as we work to mitigate them requires incremental spending. When I look at what happened in June and what happened in September, maybe the incremental downtick in gross margin is primarily a result of that. So that's one thing to kind of put in the quiver there a little bit to think about, as we go forward. We'll work our way through that. It'll get better over time. It'll also get better over time, as you rightly asked about as we ramp Malaysia now, right now, when I look at Malaysia in the September quarter, it's not a benefit to gross margin, because we're too early in the ramp of that facility. You got the fixed cost sitting there and you got startup costs. So that actually is driving a little bit of a headwind right now too. And over time, that headwind will shift to a tailwind as we get the benefit of the Asia-based cost structure. So, I look forward. We've got trajectory and gross margin that will get better over time. And really, right now, we're just dealing with supply chain as we work to mitigate some of the challenges that we see out there. C.J. Muse: That's great. And as a follow-up question, I guess, perhaps, could you provide a little more granularity on Reliant? It certainly sounds like trailing edge demand is robust this year, but also should be robust for some time. So we'd love to hear your thoughts on how we should be thinking about the contributions there over time. Tim Archer : Sure. I don't think we're going to quantify Reliant itself, but what we can tell you is, as you pointed out, the specialty technologies, these trailing edge foundry extremely strong. In fact, you hear from many in the industry, that's where a lot of the chip shortage exists today, and so that is an area that\u2019s seeing tremendous growth. But in many ways, the growth in that area has also been limited by the ability of those companies to ramp and equipment to get out to them. And, I would fully expect that that's an area of trailing edge foundry that continues to ramp strongly really on into 2022 and maybe even beyond. Doug Bettinger : And C.J., I just remind you, if you remember back at our Investor Day in March of last year seems like so long ago, but we talked about a viewpoint that we still have today that the trailing edge or the Reliant exposed WFE grows two to three times faster than overall WFE. And that's still how we see things. C.J. Muse: Great. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, C.J. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Doug, I know you've seen the headlines in China, as to some delinquencies from some of your biggest customers and some of the debt that they've be faulted on. So I'm just wondering whether that's having any impact for you, whether there's anything that you're doing there, whether you're seeing anything that's getting pushed out, or any project timing that's changing? Doug Bettinger : I guess, I'd say two things, Tim. Obviously, in a situation like you're alluding to, first thing I do is get on phone and talk to my guys in China to make sure I understand what's going on. I'm comfortable with where we sit today. I will tell you that most of the business we do with customers in the China region are under letters of credit. So its money is good. We know its money is good. So that's one thing I'd also have you think about. In relative to the plans of our customers in China, I got to be careful about talking about a specific customer, Tim. But we haven't seen any change in anybody's plans as a result of anything. Timothy Arcuri : Cool. Thanks. And then I\u2019ll ask the same question as last quarter, this mass that you gave the $70 billion over five years to add 35% bit growth, which was like $15 billion a quarter, and then you gave the number of every $350 million as another 100 basis points. So if you sort of look at where NAND is running right now, you just sort of conclude, well, maybe you're adding more like mid 40s bit growth. But I know you've also said, hey, those numbers don't really hold anymore, because capital intensity has gone up as well. So I wonder if you've had time to put pen to paper on maybe brushing up those numbers, if we can try to correlate where we are back to bit growth? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Tim, I'm not really on the phone right now to update any of those longer-term numbers, that would be something we do on I don't know, an Investor Day kind of format, which we will do at some point in the future, I think. And you're right, the observation that over time, capital intensity grows in that device architecture and NAND. And when we gave those numbers that were kind of broad averages over long periods of time to try to be helpful, and it's not a static number. So I agree with you, we do need to update it, I'm not ready to do it on the call right now. But like Tim said, we're pretty comfortable with the strength and investment in NAND. It looks pretty rational to us. And it's going to be a good year for investment in NAND. And actually, I think next year is going to be a pretty good year too, Tim. Tim Archer : Yeah, if I can just add something, Tim, I mean, while I agree with the comment, and we made it that the rising capital intensity probably means those numbers need to be updated on the absolute basis. I want to point out, as the layer count increases and complexity increases, we're taking actual share as well, meaning we're converting applications that had previously been done with older legacy technologies. And we're moving those over to newer technologies like ALB. So we're actually winning new applications as well. So even within whatever that new number is, we're benefiting from an expansion of spending per bit added, but also from actual application wins. And we pointed one out that, it's been a pretty big deal for us, which is the conversion to ALD for dielectric gapfill. So I think, it's another point being Lam\u2019s strong positioning and close collaboration with customers in the space really does give us great insight into what those next application opportunities are for our company. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Krish Sankar : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, I have two of them. Firstly, for Tim or Doug, just a follow-up on the NAND. I think you articulated it pretty well compared to the prior peak, clearly the layer count has gone up, capital intensity has gone up, and also the market share has up. I'm just kind of curious when you look to like, the 2018 peak versus today, if I just dig one level below, can you just say the mix of dielectric and conductor etch trend versus today. Because it seems to me that dielectric etch process times have gone up, that's also a big factor in it. So I'm just kind of curious, is that right? And if so, is there a meaningful difference in the split between dielectric and conductor etch for Lam, in NAND today versus in 2018? And then I have a follow-up? Tim Archer : Sure. Well, a number of things have changed demand. As you mentioned, the dielectric etch is fundamentally tied to \u2013 and its process time is fundamentally tied to layer count. So clearly, it's scaling pretty dramatically as layer counts grown. The other element you find process time is relative to consumables, and therefore growth in our installed base business as well, which also scales nicely with layer count growth. So there are a number of changes, but the sure dielectric etch plays a very critical role in reading that layer count expansion. Krish Sankar : Got it. [indiscernible] on the Sense.i etch platform, the smart platform that you have, I'm just kind of curious as you roll out the platform, is there, do you think that installed base advantage, since customers have to look at Sense.i why don't they look at another platform like a SEM-T [ph] or whatever it might be? So, would Sense.i actually be a slight negative for you, given the fact that your installed base advantage [indiscernible]? Tim Archer : Well, I mean, there's two elements to what makes a great tool. One is the platform, one is the process module technology. And so I think that when we're enhancing the platform capability, adding all of this equipment intelligence, we're certainly not giving up the incumbency power that's been developed. I mentioned, even today, proprietary RF systems, proprietary uniformity solutions, the new Vantex module that's on the Sense.i platform kind of marries up all of that equipment intelligence and use of data to make our market leading etch chamber even that much better. And so clearly, we thought a lot about the power of incumbency that if you stagnate, you also leave an opportunity for your competitors to catch up. And that's not our plan. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Tim. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Krish. Operator : Thank you. Our next comment comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Thanks for taking my questions. My first question, I wanted to ask about leverage, and I know operating leverage, and I understand what's going on with gross margins next quarter and everything. But as I look at the Analyst Day model, like the midpoint, I think was something like mid-33 and EPS on a $16 billion revenue number. You\u2019re run rating revenue right now over $17 billion, which is the high end of that guide and your run rate EPS sort of below the midpoint of the Analyst Day guide. So I guess how do we think, I think EPS is like 10% below or even more. So how do we think about I guess the progression of operating leverage from here as we go forward? Like, even if revenues don't grow, should we think about -- what timeframe do we think about EPS kind of like reaching those kinds of model levels that you talked about not that long ago? Doug Bettinger : Stacy, I would tell you that there's a revenue level component to the leverage, there's also a time element to it. The time element is dictated by some things like ramping a new factory in Malaysia that's got a better cost structure. It's also driven by mapping a new etch platform like Sense.i, that we think will have a better profitability profile than the one before it, because it delivers incremental benefit to it. So when I look at the leverage that we had in that model, I still feel quite good about it. When I think through and look at the time aspects of how we deliver the benefit, it is still the right way to think about it. The financial model we put out in March of last year is right when you think about the profitability opportunity for Lam. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up again, I want to hit on the NAND point again. Last quarter you were explicit about saying that you thought NAND would grow I guess half over half in the second-half. And you seem to be suggesting that pretty strongly for DRAM now, but you didn't. You weren\u2019t explicit about NAND. But you also I think I did hear you say that you thought NAND would be in general strong this year would be strong next year. So do you still think NAND grows in the second-half of the calendar year, and I guess you sounded like you expect NAND in calendar \u201822 to be up from calendar 2021? Is that what you're trying to say? Doug Bettinger : I'm not trying to really say anything about \u201822 with the exception that it looks like it continues to be strong. It is a qualitative statement I made. It's too soon for us to put numbers around \u201922, Stacy. And when we look at WFE, so a quarter ago, we were talking about trending above 75. Tim now said, we see it trending above 80. I think overall, it's a second-half weighted WFE profile. DRAM looks solid in the second-half. Foundry/Logic looks pretty good in the second-half too. I think NAND, probably as I sit here today is more balanced half on half. And a quarter ago, we said look like it was a little bit second-half, I can still see that potentially happening. But there's some customer investment timings that might occur more in the first-half of next year. Right now, it looks kind of balanced half on half as we sit here today. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. I guess that's still a couple quarters ago, you were saying those will be down. So you're kind of like dialing it in as we go forward. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. I mean, as the year unfolds, obviously, we get better visibility to what's happening. And we're not halfway through the year. And if you include the guide for September, we're three quarters of the way through the year. So we just have better visibility on what's going on relative to timing, as well as the supply challenges the industry is having. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you so much. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the team ramping its new Penang systems manufacturing facility and unlocking a little bit more revenue capacity here in the second-half. My understanding is that the team is targeting $3 billion of potential annual systems revenue capacity by the middle of next year out of Penang, so a pretty meaningful part of your future revenue profile.  And I think the goal is also to source more raw materials, machining and other support services locally over the next few years in Malaysia, so all of this should provide the team with some pretty strong gross margin tailwinds. Was most of this tailwind encompassed in the 2023, 2024 target financial model? Or, is this a source of margin upside above your target if you grow revenues into this new facility over the next few years? Doug Bettinger : Harlan, what I would say is we always knew we were ramping a factory in Malaysia. So when we put that model out a year and a half ago, it was comprehended. We knew how big the factory was going to be. We knew Lam would be ramping and so forth. So it was all in in terms of the profitability. And I kind of referenced that with Stacy's question. So, there isn't upside, but it is how we've continued to deliver leverage that we see. I don't know, Tim, if you'd add anything or want to add anything? Tim Archer : No. And I think it's just that the current demand environment we're in today, that the ramp rate for Malaysia is a flat out. And while we haven't given any numbers for 2022, so I'm not sure where you got those. But clearly, we're ramping it. It will be a big facility for us and it will eventually take on a large position within our global manufacturing network. Harlan Sur : Yeah, thanks for the insights on that. And then on some of the uncertainties on supply chain and therefore, slightly wider revenue range on the guidance. Your systems have very advanced capabilities, like compute, storage systems, complex sensor networks, our power circuitry graphics, user interface capabilities. Is the team being impacted by the chip shortages with some of your advanced platforms that have a lot of these processor memory RF type content? Tim Archer : Harlan, when we start here, probably a quarter or two ago, we were thinking capacity constraints. We were really thinking about physical space and labor. And quite honestly, I think we've done a really nice job, expanded in our Livermore, California facility, our Oregon facility, Korea, as I just said, shipping from Malaysia. So that physical capacity, we're really starting to sort of free up. We've hired a tremendous number of people also across the globe. And now we're being hit with that next level, we have very complex supply chain. And you are right, chip shortages, shortages of other components as well. And because it can affect many different players within our supply chain, it's a little bit more unpredictable. And that's leading to some of the increased guidance that Doug spoke to. Again, I think that Lam is very proud of our ability to execute. And, I think these are issues that just everyday we're working through, and with time, we would expect that these just like for the rest of the industry will begin to be resolved. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you, Harlan. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. The first one, I'm curious what is your estimate of China as a percentage of WFE this year versus last? Is it in line with what you thought at the start of the year? And have you heard of any potential restrictions on shipping to any Chinese customers from a U.S. regulatory perspective? Doug Bettinger : Vivek, I\u2019ll take and then Tim can feel free to add on. I think from a percent of WFE, probably fairly consistent. I mean, WFE overall this year is up nicely, China's up nicely, too. And we have talked about license requirements for one of our foundry customers in China. No new update for you there, Tim, unless you want to share something. But it doesn't impact anything else that we see going on in China. Tim Archer : Yeah, we're actively engaged. As Doug said, we haven't seen significant movement on the licensing front. We will say we've seen the approval of a few licenses for spares and upgrades for mature technology nodes. So I guess if we were any update that we would say, some small progress, but we're here we're actively engaged with the licensing agencies within the government, want to ensure we're fully compliant with everything they have in place today, but also to be advocating for moving forward with additional approvals on the shipments that are pending. Vivek Arya : And for my follow-up, you sound sort of optimistic about the growth opportunity for spending next year. I'm wondering of your markets, is there one market do you think that will have kind of a greater rise in capital intensity going into next year? Is it Foundry/Logic? Is it DRAM? Is it NAND? And conceptually, how does that impact your share gain potential as you look at next year? I realize you're not giving a specific WFE number. But let's say if you're in a growth environment, is there one market where you think given all the technology changes, that there is going to be a greater than average rise in capital intensity? Thank you. Tim Archer : Sure. I guess, you can interpret from all the comments I've made about multi-year impact to WFE spending. We see strong regional investments, many places government supported, rising device complexity, and then actually, we think the demand environment still remains good overall for semis. So those are \u2013 we\u2019re not giving 2022 right now, we don't see great clouds on the horizon. We see a lot of positives. When I think about different areas of opportunity for Lam, to your point about where my capital intensity be rising the fastest or maybe just spending, really think about Lam. And therefore, where's etch and depth really going to play a bigger role? Where does Lam have the opportunity? I see that across the board. We spent a lot of time on this call talking about NAND complexity. But, you're seeing 3D transitions, Foundry/Logic space gate all around, advanced packaging, very etch and depth intensive. Next year, if you're looking, I'm not saying it's flat WFE, but if you were looking at flat WFE, Lam\u2019s opportunity would be growing in those spaces because of etch and depth capital intensity increases. And where we really are spending our time and effort this year, it is two places. Doug talked a lot about operational improvements, making sure we come out with infrastructure that's better off from that perspective. And what I tried to highlight was where we are investing in products so that as these transitions occur to 3D in Foundry/Logic and DRAM over the next several years, then Lam is going to be in the same position to benefit from those as what I highlighted happening for us in 3D NAND, and I think it's places I just talked about, selective etch, and things like dry resist, it's the position we have in high aspect ratio, etch and depth relative to 3D packaging. I would just say it's a very opportunity rich environment for a company like Lam right now. Vivek Arya : Thanks very much. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my questions, I had two as well. I guess this one's probably for Doug. I think historically, you guys have spoken to your thoughts on DRAM and NAND supply growth exiting the year. I was hoping you can update us higher thinking about that exiting 2021 based on what you've shipped in the first-half and what your expectations are for the second-half, supply growth exiting the year relative to demand growth for both DRAM and NAND? Doug Bettinger : DRAM, I think this year, supply growth is still going to be below where demand growth is. I think, pretty well chronicle from the industry the demand for DRAM bits is probably 20, low 20s. I think supply is probably high teens approaching 20 in DRAM. I think on the NAND side, probably more imbalance. I think supply demand mid high 30s. It feels fairly balanced for the year in NAND. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And as a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about your opportunity in leading edge logic. I think in the past year, you've talked about your application wins. I guess, initially at 14, and how that's expanded at 10. And your expectation as we sort of eventually transitioned to seven. I guess, despite some of those comments, we haven't really seen that show up in numbers. And I realize you disclosed logic and others, so there's another component in that line. But, what are you missing? I think, I realized you don't want to talk about a specific customer. But that customer is ramping CapEx, yet we're not seeing the uplift in your numbers. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : I think, I'd say two things. You've got this sort of right, 14 to 10. We've talked about a nice growth in application footprint. 5x is what we've described in terms of number of applications. And then that growing again, from 10 to seven, that's absolutely what we see happening. And I got to be careful talking about any one customer. I think, when you look at logic and other you're absolutely right, there is the other component in there and things like image sensor, and other logic devices, but also you have to think about the timeframe in which anyone customer is investing in technology, is it in a concentrated two or three quarters, or is it over a longer period of time. And if it's over a longer period of time, you won't see it in any one quarter. And so, I would encourage you to think about both of those things when you look at the logic and other stuff. And then I\u2019d also suggest, I think logic and others is going to look pretty good in the second half also. Tim Archer : Yeah. And I think the only thing I would add is, maybe we need to transition that story before a lot about progress we were going to make in action and the output. Now, we step up with a logic or logic and foundry basically similar devices, similar trends. As we move to gate all around our nano sheet structures, many of the products I talked about dealing with selective etch and the processes that are required to create those complex structures. The challenge is that foundry and logic customers at the leading edge see with RC and its impact, and therefore the need for evolving the metallization structure. We talked about dry resist and the potential to impact the cost performance of EUV at future nodes, not only current node, but also high NA. These are ways in which Lam is ensuring that we have the right product portfolio. So whether it's advanced foundry or advanced logic, whichever custom you might be talking about the -- we have very strong products to offer to help with those transitions. And so, I think over the years, our opportunity to engage those customers has just gotten stronger and broader. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you, Toshiya. Operator : We'll take a next question from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. You got a couple quarters now the installed base business growing 50% year-on-year. And, we don't have a long time series of that. But I mean, is that -- I assume that's kind of a historically unusual growth rate. And, anything in that, that sort of makes you think, I think you mentioned last quarter people accumulating spares or inventory a little bit. Now obviously that's a growth a really good growth business and you've been vocal about that. But, is there any cyclicality when you start talking about these types of growth rates that we should be aware of? Tim Archer : Yeah, I'll take that. I included in my prepared remarks one liner that said it was supposed to be hinting, please don't count on this kind of growth every single quarter quarter-on-quarter. There are components. And this kind of went back to the question about trailing edge foundry and how do we see that going forward. We don't see that abating. But that is an area where we're seeing tremendous demand right now, and eventually that may not kind of keep pace quite with the growth in the installed base. But the elements, you think about what's in there, spares continues to grow with installed base. And as we've seen this tremendous growth in installed base, that becomes a recurring revenue stream going forward, that really is just based on customers continuing to utilize what they've already bought. So we feel very good about that. So if there's one part that you might see a little bit of investment timing, in fact, it would be specialty technologies and trailing edge or non-leading edge foundry. But our near-term outlook for that remains quite strong. Joe Moore : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Congrats on the nice quarter. Doug, maybe for you in terms of the component and supply constraints that you're facing. I know, there's a lot of moving parts. But what are you trying to do to kind of \u2018mitigate it\u2019? And I guess what I'm looking for is a little more detail. Are you working with additional suppliers? Are you working with your main component suppliers of getting those parts at a certain period of time? What are some of those, I guess, initiatives and efforts you're doing to try, I guess mitigate that situation? Doug Bettinger : I think I\u2019m actually going to give it to Tim. Tim Archer : Yeah, I'm actually pretty close to this one. And what I would say is that there, maybe it's everything. When you have your major customers really clamoring for on time shipments, we're leaving no stone unturned. So, in some cases, it's working with different suppliers. But again, we have complex supply chains. And, in many cases, we're looking at where those suppliers have additional facilities in other parts of the world. So for impacted, say, by issues throughout the COVID pandemic, in one part of the world, we transition to that same supplier in different factories, and the parts of the world. That's usually the most expeditious means of getting additional supply. But at times, we are finding additional suppliers. We're also, I talked about refurbishment and recoding, and reuse. That's another area where we're working with customers to actually qualify refurbishment processes that allow us to shorten the time, so rather than having to procure brand new parts, for instance, we do a refurbishment and that part can go back in the machine. From the fewer parts you use within the installed base, more you have available for build forward out of your factories. And so, I would just say between us and the customers very close collaboration and collaboration of our supply chain partners are getting very creative about how to try to mitigate these risks. And it's many, many, many different things. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Patrick. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our last question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Joe Quatrochi : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to try to understand the kind of updated WFE guidance and your commentary around NAND being maybe a little bit more balanced half on half. I guess, can you help me understand just what, I guess increased to maybe offset some of that, including going to over $80 billion for WFE? Was it just more Foundry/Logic? Or, is that your comments around DRAM being stronger? Just any comments there will be helpful. Doug Bettinger : I think the practicality of it, Joe, is we're just further through the year. We're halfway through the year, we got pretty good visibility into the September quarter, because we just guided it. And so it's that right. It's an understanding of customers\u2019 plans. It's an understanding of what we think the industry is going to be able to supply. We still see a second-half weighted WFE spending profile. We kicked it up somewhat as a result of this better visibility is what I would describe. Joe Quatrochi : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick question on the services business, another quarter of a major spares contract win. I was wondering if you could quantify how much of your spares revenue is based on long-term contracts. Tim Archer : No. Obviously we look at that a quite a bit. But I would say that a large portion of it, whether it's under long-term contracts, or it's in -- I talked about our complex supply chain. I mean, in many ways for spare parts, it's very similar, which means regardless of the length of contract, we tend to be the primary supplier for the vast majority of those spares. And so, I would say the majority of our parts are under contract, but then the length of contract we're not really ready to talk about at this point. Joe Quatrochi : Fair enough. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thank you, Joe. Tim Archer : Great. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Okay, operator, I think that was our last caller. Tina, do you want to close this off? Tina Correia : Yeah. Just want to tell everyone we appreciate your support, and thank you for joining our call today. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tina and welcome, everyone. Lam delivered a solid September quarter with revenues in line and earnings per share above the midpoint of our guided ranges. These results represent our sixth consecutive quarter of revenue and earnings per share growth for the Company. Over this time period, we have scaled our operations to support rapidly growing demand for our products and services. And as we look forward, we see continued strengthening across both leading-edge device segments and specialty technology markets. In response, we have expanded our manufacturing capacity at existing facilities in the United States, Korea, and Taiwan. In the September quarter, we celebrated the grand opening of our new Malaysia facility, which when fully ramped, will be the largest factory in our global network. And just last month, we announced a new factory in Oregon, primarily designed to meet increased demand for Lam tools and Foundry/Logic and advanced packaging applications. With these investments, we are building a solid foundation for delivering on our long-term growth objectives. In the near-term, however, we are not immune to the widely-reported supply chain constraints and elevated costs that continue to create new challenges for Lam and others across our industry. Our employees and supply chain partners are working tirelessly to meet the needs of our customers, and I would like to sincerely thank them for their efforts. From a wafer fab equipment spending perspective, we now see calendar 2021 ending in the mid $80 billion range. Overall, WFE is higher in the second half versus the first half of the year, with both DRAM and Foundry/Logic up in the second half, while NAND is more balanced. Demand remains strong, and while it's a bit early to give a specific forecast for calendar year 2022, indications are that it will be another year of WFE growth. We believe sustained strength in WFE spending is due to several factors, we have previously highlighted. First, drivers of semiconductor demand continue to broaden and sectors such as automotive, healthcare, and security are increasingly dependent on semiconductor content to deliver the performance requirements of end-users. As a result, we are seeing a strong uptick in trailing edge technology nodes served by our Reliant business. Our Reliant business has now posted 11 consecutive quarters of record revenues. And in calendar year 2021, we expect Reliant to outgrow WFE investment in this segment. Furthermore, high utilization rates across our installed base are driving strength in all sub segments of our DSPG business. And in the September quarter, CSBG revenues increased year-over-year by more than 30%. At the leading-edge, semiconductor content growth, large die, and rising capital intensity are fueling increased wafer starts and strong WFE spending. In Foundry/Logic for instance, the next-generation processor chip for a top smartphone maker is more than 20% larger than its prior iteration. In DRAM, higher capital intensity is being driven by the increasing need to correct single bit errors through the addition of an extra on-chip bit. In 3D NAND, increasing device layer counts and the resulting higher degree of manufacturing difficulty is requiring the addition of new deposition and etch processes to address stress management, defect control, and multi-stack integration challenges. As a result, we see the WFE investment required to achieve the same bit growth percentage over the next 5 years to be notably higher than the 5-year period just completed. However, as the leading equipment supplier to the 3D NAND market, we are investing in new and differentiated capabilities to ensure scaling remains cost effective. As one example, Lam has developed a new high-productivity cryo etch solution, which increases etch rates in high-aspect ratio features required for NAND devices with greater than 200 layers. We have installed this new capability at every major 3D NAND manufacturer for qualification with additional systems now shipping to support planned ramps to high-volume production next year. While initially developed to meet the demanding requirements of high-aspect ratio of etch in 3D NAND, we believe the technology may also have benefits for Foundry/LogicFoundry/Logic and DRAM at the leading edge, where we are presently engaged with customers on critical applications. Looking in more detail at the Foundry/Logic segment, we see spending at record levels. Lam's Foundry/Logic revenues are likewise set to grow significantly in 2021 and we expect this expansion to continue in 2022 as well. Foundry/Logic performance in the sub five nanometer era is being driven by both device architecture innovation and traditional area scaling. We're prioritizing technology development in three areas where we see the fastest growth and the greatest need, namely deposition and etch processes to support the efficient adoption of EUV patterning, new etch capabilities to enable the formation of critical transistor features, and new materials and deposition techniques to assist in RC management. In patterning, we're using the learning we have acquired over many years of multi-patterning etch leadership to win new applications as the industry adoption of EUV progresses. EUV requires use of special photoresist materials which, given the material composition, can amplify existing challenges with pattern roughness, and defectivity. Unaddressed, these will lead to performance in yield loss, especially at smaller device dimensions. Lam has developed critical etch and deposition technologies to help solve these EUV implementation issues. In etch, we introduced earlier this year a new pulse plasma etch capability that has demonstrated an order of magnitude reduction in EUV-related pattern defectivity. This innovative etch solution is currently shipping to leading Foundry/Logic customers. In deposition, hard masks and transfer films require enhanced mechanical properties in order to maintain fidelity of extremely small features and minimize line roughness. Utilizing a combination of proprietary hardware design and RF powered technology, we are depositing high-quality films that have replaced incumbent technologies such as PVD and spin-on materials at multiple Foundry/Logic customers. Related to the formation of critical transistor features, including gates, pins and source streams, we saw significant etch wins in September quarter. These wins continue to confirm the benefit of our unique plasma pulsing capabilities in conductor etch for gate all around and FinFet applications. For advanced device architectures, we also see ultra-high selectivity isotropic etch increasingly required. Lam's growing Selective Etch portfolio deliver superior results through a combination of process technologies and reactor innovations that include new chemistries and plasma sources. This has helped us win a greater number of applications in recent quarters. And finally, RC management continues to be a limiter on performance scaling, and we're seeing demand for our atomic layer deposition technologies as a result. Our Striker ALD system deposits thin locate films that can withstand harsh integration steps in encountered later in the process flow. These films have demonstrated the ability to reduce capacitance by 20% to 30%, and Stryker is now the tool of record at leading Foundry/Logic customers. This technology is also extendable to gate all around devices where there is an additional requirement of conformal coverage in recess cavities, which can then be selectively etched back. In Advanced Packaging, momentum remains strong with orders received in the September quarter from multiple Foundry/Logic customers for through-silicon via etch and deposition systems. Our experienced in high aspect ratio etching has allowed us to deliver a production-proven process with fast etch rates and smooth profiles, helping to minimize the cost of integrating TSVs in the overall flow. Similarly, for copper metallization, our SABRE 3D solution enables void-free fill by employing an innovative, advanced pre -treatment, and our high throughput electroplating process reduces cost of ownership. So to wrap up, we delivered a solid September quarter in an environment of ongoing supply chain challenges. We're seeing robust semiconductor demand across all segments, broadening of semiconductor applications across industries, and rising capital intensity. We are excited about the healthy outlook for WFE spending and believe our innovative product portfolio is poised to capture new opportunities as semiconductor technology continues to advance. Thanks again for joining. Now, here's Doug to cover the quarter in more detail. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on our call today. Lam's delivered another quarter of strong results with revenue, operating income dollars, and earnings per share coming in at record levels in the September quarter. All financial metrics came in at or above the midpoint of our guidance, demonstrating our continued focus on operational execution. We\u2019ve achieved this performance while also navigating significant supply chain challenges. We're pleased with Lam's ability to scale the Company in this demanding environment. September quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of 4% from the June quarter, and more than 35% growth from a year ago. Looking at the breakout of the systems revenue. The Memory segment represented 64% of systems revenue in the September quarter, which was up from the prior quarter level at 59%. Memory growth was driven by investments in DRAM, primarily in the 1z and 1-alpha nodes. DRAM systems revenue nearly doubled in dollar terms, and grew from 10% in the June quarter to 19% in the September quarter. NAND segment concentration came in at 45% of our systems revenue versus 49% in the June quarter, and was flattish in dollar terms. Our NAND customers are investing in both capacity additions and conversions with equipment investments focused towards 128 layers through 192 layer devices. The Foundry segment spending represented 25% of our systems revenue compared with 35% in the June quarter. We're seeing investments in equipment for both leading-edge and mature device nodes from multiple sources of end-use demand, such as AI, IOT, cloud, and 5G. Logic and analog device companies are driving capacity additions at the foundries. There was notable growth in the Logic and Other segment, which hit a record level of systems revenue for Lam in the September quarter. Logic and Other contributed 11% of systems revenue in the September quarter, which is up from 6% in the June quarter, and it was driven by leading-edge immature nodes ramping from microprocessors, image sensors, power management, and 5G demand. Let me turn now to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 37% of total revenues, which was flat with the prior quarter percentage level. The revenue from China domestic customers and multinational customers with fabs located in China was again fairly balanced in the September quarter. Korea and Taiwan regional spending represented 21% and 15% of revenues, respectively, in the September quarter. I do expect that the December quarter revenue will have a lower China concentration. The Customer Support Business Group revenue was nearly $1.4 billion, 34% higher than the September quarter in calendar 2020, and flat with the prior quarter level. As Tim noted, the Reliant product line that services specialty market delivered record results, and we also had solid results in the spares service and upgrade side with the focus on maximizing the productivity and value of being installed base tools, while supporting the high Fab utilization levels in the industry. I continue to have confidence that CSBG will grow revenue consistently on an annual basis. Let me now shift to margin performance. Our September quarter gross margin was 46% right at the midpoint of our guided range. I'd just remind you that our gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels along with customer and product mix. The supply chain constraints discussed earlier, have resulted in elevated costs broadly, with freight and logistics costs continue to be one of the biggest headwinds. Additionally, we currently have margin dilution from our new factory in Malaysia, which is not yet operating at full capacity. We included these costs in our December quarter guidance as we expect they will remain for the near future. Operating expenses for September were $586 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter. We've continued to manage our expenses as we scale the Company with a strong focus on operational efficiencies, while prioritizing R&D spending to deliver a differentiated product portfolio that supports our customers' technology roadmaps. September operating margin exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range at 32.4% or approximately $1.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 12.2%, generally in line with our expectations. And as we've noted in previous quarter calls, a tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. And you should expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teen\u2019s level for the 2021 calendar year. We continue to monitor potential tax changes under consideration in the United States, but we've not reflected the impact of any potential changes in our financial models at this point. Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $36 million in expense. This amount is higher than the prior quarter due to an unrealized gain we had in June for one of our private equity investments, partially offset by lower interest expense in the September quarter as a result of the payoff of our 2021 nodes last quarter. And just to note, OI&E is subject to market-related volatility that could cause a difference from our typical run rate. We were active in our buybacks during the September quarter, allocating over $1.2 billion towards share repurchases. We deployed this cash in a combination of open market repurchases, as well as an accelerated share repurchase program. This ASR will continue to execute in the December quarter. In addition, we paid $185 million in dividends in the quarter. I'd also like to highlight that in August, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend, growing it from $1.30 to $1.50 per share, which was paid in October. We're tracking very well to our capital return plans, with returns of over 100% of our free cash flow year-to-date in calendar year 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the September quarter was $8.36 above the midpoint of the guidance range. The diluted share count balance was down slightly from the June quarter level coming in at 143 million shares, generally in line with our expectations. Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $4.9 billion, which is down from the prior quarter. The decreation -- decrease in cash is attributed to the capital return activities that I described earlier. Additionally, the timing of shipments and resulting impact on accounts receivable, as well as an increase in our inventory balance consumed with cash in the quarter. A Day sale outstanding was up to 72 days from 66 days in the June quarter. Inventory turns were down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 3.2 times, which was planned as we've increased inventory levels to meet the increase in investments from our customers, as well as to help mitigate the challenges that we see in our supply chain. Non-cash expenses for the September quarter included approximately $58 million for equity compensation, $61 million for depreciation, and $19 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the September quarter were up versus the June level coming in at $136 million. The increase in our expenditures is associated with capacity expansion in the network, in particular, at our critical spare parts facility in Ohio, as well as spending for our Korea Technology Center that will be formally opening in 2022. We expect to see elevated levels of capital expenditures in the remainder of calendar 2021 and into 2022 as we support the growth that we see in the business. We ended the September quarter with approximately 15,400 regular full-time employees, which is an increase of approximately 1300 people to meet the increased output levels and to support customers with their technology and production requirements. Let's now take a look at our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2021 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.4 billion, plus or minus $250 million. We continue to maintain a widened revenue range given the supply chain uncertainties that we mentioned. Gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point. Operating margins up 32% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $8.45 plus or minus $0.50 based on a share count of approximately 142 million shares. And just an additional note, our guidance does not include an estimated gain related to one of our private equity investments that recently raised capital in a public offering. The gain as of today is in the $50 million range and is subject to market volatility. The amount recognized in our financials, as of the end of December '21 quarter, may fluctuate. And I will obviously give you an update at our next earnings release. So that in closing, we're experiencing ongoing output challenges in our global supply chain that are continuing to negatively impact both our revenue and gross margin. For improving known items while new items continue to emerge that we need to further work through, many times remained stretched and we continue to have unmet demand. Despite these constraints for operating at record levels in terms of revenue and earnings, while delivering the technology solutions or customers require. Industry demand remains strong as we look forward to growth in 2022. I remain very excited about the multitude of opportunities for the Company. And I'd obviously like to thank the dedicated Lam Research employees for their tireless support in this environment. Operator that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Doug, I'm hoping that you're not sick, you sound a little bit sick. Hopefully you're feeling okay. So I guess the first thing I wanted to say was that, can you quantify, Doug -- can you quantify what the gross margin headwind is right now. You talked about Malaysia and freight, is that 50 bps, 75 basis points? I'm just kind of wondering if you can quantify that for us. Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Tim thanks. And thanks for the concern about my health. I'm doing quite well, frankly. I don't know, maybe just a little scratchy throat. I haven't quantified it, Tim, and I'm not going to now. Except what I've said in the past and I'll continue to say is, it's a notable headwind from where -- once we get through this environment, from where we will be, I'm not going to quantify, but just know this, it's notable. Timothy Arcuri : It is. Okay, okay. And then, I guess, also you talked about China domestic being down sequentially for December. I assume some of that is Memory-related and I guess the question is, is that all sort of out of the system as you go into the first half of '22 or is -- are there still some headwinds in China related to some particular projects that may persist into the first half of '22? Doug Bettinger : No, Tim. I don't see anything you really relative to China or timing of anything. Maybe I'm not quite getting at your question or maybe I don't understand the nature of the question, you want to try to redirect me a little bit? Timothy Arcuri : Yeah. There's a pretty big project in China that has had -- I mean, it's been well-publicized. They've been having funding problems. They can't meet their commitments. So I'm just wondering if maybe that was part of the NAND softness in the back half of the year that you cited last call and I'm wondering sort of is that -- sort of I mean has that all played out now such that there's not like that's got still a headwind into the first half of next year? Doug Bettinger : Yeah. I don't really see any change from a quarter ago of any major customer plans, and I won't refer to any one customer or another but no real change, Tim. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome. Okay, Doug. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : And next we'll go to Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution, guys. You know, the market is concerned that we're heading into a multi-quarter downturn in Memory, kind of similar to the 2018/2019 Memory downturn, which is a pretty severe 6-quarter downturn, but the one thing I clearly remember was that ahead of that downturn, your memory customers proactively cut their CapEx very, very rapidly. Now, if I look at it this time around, there's some near-term pricing weakness in memory. But the overall memory demand environment remains pretty strong, and I think most memory companies seem optimistic right under the baton outlook for next year. So I guess the question is, has the Lam team seen any signs similar to the 2018 downturn of customers either getting concerned or canceling or slight pushing out of shipments due to a concern on our projected memory downturn next year? Tim Archer : Yeah. Harlan, let me take that first. I think the simple answer is no. When the vast majority of our conversations with customers today is still about delivering equipment that they feel they badly need to meet their near-term requirements. And as Doug mentioned in his prepared remarks, I would say lead times have stretched out to the point where our visibility into demand in '22 is better than usual. So I don't think that the hypes of initial indicators that you're talking about are things we're seeing right now. We feel much more constrained by supply chain challenges and ability to meet shipments and an over shipping situation. Harlan Sur : Yeah. Thank you for the insights there. And then the one area that we continue to see demand which you alluded to is, obviously, strong demand for procuring specialty processes, analog microcontroller, RF. These guys are all dealing with supply issues. I know back at the Analyst Day, the team said that specialty market is going about 2 to 3 times faster than WFE. So is your Reliant business going faster than that 2 to 3x rate? And where is the team driving stronger than market growth, is it etch, is it deposition, or is it more based on platform performance like to put uptime or other productivity metrics? Thank you. Tim Archer : Yes, it's a great question. So as I said in my script, the Reliant business is growing faster than the WFE investment in that segment, so it would imply we're picking up share there. That's -- I would say reasonably well balanced across our product portfolio. And you're right, in that market, a lot of that is about Lam's leadership in bringing both technology and productivity to our customers. So you're aware there are new decisions being made about toolsets or new fabs being established for those types of specialty products. We have a lot to offer relative to the -- hitting the cost targets that those customers are looking for. Harlan Sur : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Harlan. Harlan Sur : Yup. Operator : And next we'll go to John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Pitzer : Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Tim, I get that it's a little bit too early to get too granular on next year's WFE. And I know in your prepared comments, you said it's going to be another growth year. I'm wondering if you can give us some parameters of how you're viewing first half of next year versus the second half of this year. Tim Archer : I think we're not going to give first half and second half of 2022, but we -- what we would say is we're exiting this year with significant unmet demand. We talked about a constrained environment, which means we enter 2022 with a lot of tailwinds relative to business, but I tried to, in my remarks, lay out some of the trends that we think over a slightly longer-term, maybe through 2022, on into 2023, are driving, not only demand. But really on the supply side, rising capital intensity, larger [Indiscernible], different architectures, new processes that need to be inserted into process flows to deal with increased manufacturing complexity. And those will be drivers for WFE structurally for a very long time. So I think there are a lot of things that will be positives for WFE in 2022, from an equipment perspective. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then, Tim, as a follow-up, pretty big milestone in the Logic business. I think this quarter's revenue was about a 1/3 higher than prior peak. It's the first time you've been run rating over $1 billion ever. And I know you've kind of talked about some of the things, you prepared comments that are driving that, but to what extent do you believe that this is sustainable? To what extent is a TAM growth in Logic versus kind of your market share, and SAM growth starting to kick in? And any sort of view on sustainability from these levels? Tim Archer : Let's say it's probably a combination of both us expanding into some new applications that I talked about related to emerging device architectures. Did all around new processes like selective etch technologies that are expanding our market opportunity, but also share gains. So I mean it's -- we've seen the increase in spending in the Foundry/Logic area, and for a number of years, we've been focused on developing products that bring real value to customers in that space. And what we always said was, we have to be a little patient because changes in the Foundry/Logic won't come a little more slowly than in the Memory world and I would say you're starting to see the fruits of those qualification efforts starting to play out in our actual business results. John Pitzer : Perfect. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, John. Operator : And next we'll go to C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. C.J. Muse: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess first question, I'm hoping to go back to supply constraints. And Doug, can you perhaps speak on the revenue side where are you seeing the impact? Is it primarily due to perhaps a slower ramping in Malaysia? Are you seeing it across all products or limited to a few? And then I'm curious as part of that, is it impacting CSBG both for Reliant and upgrades or less so there? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, C.J., thanks for the question. Frankly, when I look at what we're doing with our own internal manufacturing capability, but that's not what the biggest constraint is. It's getting back into the supply chain. I think we've done quite a nice job actually accelerating the ramp of the factory in Malaysia. Tim referred to all the places that we're opening new capacity. We're adding capability pretty much everywhere internally in the network. But as we get further and further down the road and demand continues to be quite strong. We're beginning to see constraints in the supply chain. So we have to work our way back up through some of those things. And that's the biggest thing we're dealing with right now, C.J. Tim, I don't know if you want to add anything? Tim Archer : No, I guess I'd just reiterate. We build incredibly complex machines. They do amazing things on the wafer. They require a lot of parts from a lot of different suppliers to do that, including tremendous amount of semiconductors themselves. And so when we've heard so much about chip shortages, we're clear that hit some of our machines and it only takes a few of those critical chips to delay us being able to ship what otherwise is a very complex system. So we, as Doug said, just have to work down through the supply chain through lots of suppliers to find out where those pinch points are. And it's a daily activity but so far we're working through there and being able to deliver growth and also meet the most urgent needs of our customers. That's really our key focus. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up, I get the sense whenever I have conversations with you both that you feel like investors under-appreciate your Foundry/Logic exposure. And so, within your slide deck and then prepared comments, you talked quite a bit about new [Indiscernible] design wins. And so, I'm curious, I think over the last three years, your SAM or as a percentage of Foundry/Logic's running around 8%, 9%, when do you think we see an inflection based on these design wins and what should we be looking for to gauge that? Thank you. Tim Archer : Yeah, it's a great question and I'm glad you noted. I spent a lot more time on these prepared remarks talking about Foundry/Logic. I think our Memory story in leadership there is pretty well understood. And we want to make sure that people understand the progress we're making in Foundry/Logic and also the new opportunities that are being created for us. And so many of those are for more advanced technologies. It's where device architecture changes or things like a new RC management requirement. RC requirement drives need for new films or new deposition techniques. And so I would just say, at each technology node, we're seeing an inflection, we're seeing more of our equipment have a chance to get inserted, get qualified and become part of the process of record. So I don't think you're going to see like a single point in time or single node greasy big jump up, or you're going to see the steady progression as we made progress on both SAM expansion and share gains. C.J. Muse: Helpful. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, C.J. Operator : The next will go to Krish Sankar from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Krish Sankar : Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, I think I just want to clarify, Tim or Doug, it seems like the supply chain constraints are impacting your revenue even though demand is strong and it's impacting your margins. So should we assume this $4.4 billion revenue, 46% gross margin, is where you're going to be saturated until the supply constraints ease? Or do you think it's going to be more gradual recovery. And then I had a follow-up. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Let me start and then I'll let Tim add on. Krish, I think some of the cost headwinds, we're seeing in during be around for a while, especially what I intimated. We're doing our best to work through it in an efficient and effective manner. But frankly, we're spending money to try to continue to increase our output capability. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we're making progress on lots of different things, but we didn't see other things popping up in -- like I said, we're working our way back through the supply chain and Tim referred the fact that actually semiconductors are constraining us a little bit. We're doing our best to work through it. We're mitigating problems. We're incrementally increasing capability as we go. And I think it's going to get better bit by bit is what I would describe, Krish. I don't know, Tim, you want to -- Tim Archer : Yeah. I think that's a pretty good explanation. It will continue to improve as we knocked down each of the problems that come up and assuming that there aren't bigger surprises, we would see ourselves gradually improving from this point forward. Just as we had supply constraints in the September quarter and managed through those and we will have more in the December quarter. It's constrained but we're managing to knock enough off that. We're showing some incremental growth, and I think that's what you could probably expect to continue to see. Krish Sankar : Got it. Very helpful. And then a follow-up for you, Tim. You spoke about the cryo etch product, which kind of makes a ton of sense given the extremely long etch times today in 3D NAND. And you also said, this also improves etch rate. But isn't it a negative for you since customers would need sure of your etch tools, or is this needed to protect and grow your market share? Tim Archer : Well, I think that's like all things when you're providing the technology that's needed to not only enabled current nodes but future technology nodes, we have an obligation to drive both technology and productivity and make sure the scaling is cost-effective and the roadmap continues. And so, this is our effort to not only differentiate our technology further for many companies that may try to develop similar technologies, but also to help our customers with those transitions and accelerate in the state of the art of NAND. Doug Bettinger : Hey Krish, I will just remind you something. Tim said in the scripted remarks, that as we look at the NAND investment required generating the bit growth over the next 5 years as compared to the previous 5 years, it's increasing. That includes cryo rolling out and increasing etch rates as a result of that. Tim Archer : Yes. Krish Sankar : Got it. I think that's a very fair explanation. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Krish. Operator : And our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about NAND. Tim, in your opening remarks, you had mentioned that the five-year spending in NAND needs to be higher than the last five years; I think is what you said. In terms of any quantification of how much that isn't -- just any qualification of why layer count is that much more capital intensive. You're increasing layers in the last five years or increasing layers in the next five years, what is it that drives up the capital intensity? Thanks. Tim Archer : Sure. We did say that the WFE required to achieve the same percentage of bit growth would be higher the next five years, and it's a number of things. One is, as the layer count continues to increase, certain processes scale, as we've said, non-linearly. So it takes longer to etch a stack that's twice as high, takes more than 2x longer. And that's why we need to introduce new technologies like cryo etching and other processes to keep that escalation of process times to a reasonable level. Same thing can happen with deposition as you're trying to control uniformities and defects as stacks become much higher and taller. And so in addition to that, I mentioned several steps that get added. So as you start to stack higher, the wafer stress and bowl becomes a much bigger challenge. And so now you have to add extra steps, like Lam's stress management deposition tool. Those additional steps add to the WFE required to add bit of NAND. And so that is -- it's a combination of both new steps to deal with complexity, as well as new processes required to deal with kind of non-linear scaling process times. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Joe. Operator : And next we'll go to Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to take a look at the Foundry business. So it was down like 25% sequentially and it looks like it was down year-over-year, what seems to be a very, very strong foundry spending environment. So why was that? Can you tell us a little bit what's going on in that end market? Why was it down? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Stacy, nothing goes up every single quarter. There's ebbs and flows. It's a second half weighted Foundry/Logic's spending profile. It's going to be a good quarter in December. But when you got to concentrate instead of a couple of really big customers, it's lumpy at times, so I think that's the only thing I'd tell you about it. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. I guess to follow up on that in terms of what might be implied for the trajectory into Q4. So you said Foundry/Logic up second half versus first half, DRAM up second half versus first half, NAND more balanced. I guess -- Doug Bettinger : Right. Stacy Rasgon : -- given where NAND is, and given where DRAM is, I'd like -- in order to have that foundry still to be up in the second half, I need to be have dram down considerably in December quarter in order to get foundry up. Is that what you have in mind? Or when you say Foundry/Logic growing in the second half, do you mean just as a combination growing? Doug Bettinger : It's a combination with you, right? You said Foundry/Logic and DRAM up in the second half and many more balanced. Stacy Rasgon : I guess what I'm asking is, you see Foundry and Logic bulk up in the second half or just the combination. Because I can't really get Foundry up in the second half unless they've got DRAM down a bunch in the end of December quarter, just mathematically. Like thinking about this, [Indiscernible] or what? Doug Bettinger : Stacy, we're combining Foundry and Logic together when I described it. Stacy Rasgon : Okay, guys. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Operator : And next we'll go to Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open. Blayne Curtis : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for your question. I have 2 as well. Just curious to a couple of prior questions on the Logic segment. On the friendly, you talked about really trailing edge kind of driving that big spike. But I think to a prior question, you kind of mentioned some of the feature wins you have at the leading edge. So just maybe going to kind of revisit that. And when you talk about -- I think you said that it could maybe stay at this level to John's question. Is that just the trailing edge or are you seeing that leading edge starting to come in even in the December quarter? Tim Archer : Yeah. Maybe -- we didn't want to mislead here. I mean, we talked about the Reliant business and trailing-edge as a notable area of strength for Lam, and a sign of this broadening of demand across many, many different use cases, including industries like our own, where we're consuming a tremendous amount of that type of chip. But we do have significant business at what we've told the current leading-edge. And what I was trying to point out where is how our SAM expands with new processes and how our win rate is increasing, we believe, as new inflections come into play. So that's all built into our numbers today. But we do think that from our share of WFE going forward as these technology inflections at Foundry/Logic take place, we would see that driving higher over the next several years. Blayne Curtis : Thanks. And then maybe a question for Doug on gross margin. It sounded like there's still some variability in the outlook. Some question about whether new factors like Malaysia to get better. And just kind of curious of your foundry customers are raising pricing, their customers are raising pricing, everybody's raising pricing. Is there a lever that you can also pull as an industry on pricing? I was just curious of your thoughts. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Blayne. We're doing our best to get paid fairly for what we're delivering to customers and get paid for the value we are delivering. So that's an ongoing activity at the Company. And a lot of our pricing arrangements are on an annual basis, renegotiated. And clearly, we're focused on trying to get the gross margin to improve over time. So that'll be a part of it. Blayne Curtis : Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Blayne. Operator : And next we'll go to Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. My first question is on 2022. I realize it's early. You guys talked about your expectations for the market to be up. How are you thinking about the 4 device types? If you had to rank order the four, how would you go about doing that? And more importantly, how should we think about Lam's ability to outperform the market in '22? I guess the big concern is, you know, Memory is, you know, flat to flattish maybe, and Logic and Foundry continue to be the big drivers. All else equal, that would be a bit of a headwind for you guys just given your customer mix. But at the same time, you've talked about all these design wins and your market share growth in Foundry/Logic. So other than that, how should we think about your performance for the WFE? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Toshiya. It's too soon for us to give you a specificity in 2022. When we look into the year though of 2022, I'm very confident on the growth here. I believe every segment of the business is actually going to be pretty strong next year, but I'm not really ready to parse it one versus another quite yet. Obviously, we'll do that for you next quarter. And I feel really good about where we're positioned, right. Tim talked a lot about the trajectory of our business in Foundry and Logic. We've always been strong in memory and I believe we're going to continue to do extremely well there. So too soon for me to parse it there. And by the way, I think CSBG is going to have a good year next year, right? When I put it all together, I think we're very well-positioned and going to continue to be. And stay tuned. We'll give you a little more specificity on the December quarter call. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then a quick follow-up on your last point, Doug, on CSBG. You talked about the Reliant business having a record quarter, which I guess implies that your spare parts business and other parts of your business could've been down a little bit. And I appreciate your point about there being some lumpiness, if you will, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but if you can speak to what you're seeing in the non-Reliant business in CSBG near-term, that would be helpful. And then I guess you sort of addressed this in your prior answer, but how confident are you that calendar '22 can be another up year after what's been a very strong year in CSBG? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Hi Toshiya, you're right. There's lumpiness to different aspects of it. Tim specifically said 11 consecutive quarters of record revenue for Reliant. Obviously, there's ebb and flow and other stuff as inventory builds a little bit. Upgrades can be a little bit lumpy at times depending on what's going on in the installed-base. But I will tell you, when I think about CSBG going into next year, it's been a very strong year in terms of our chamber shipment this year. That's the opportunity to continue to have CSBG grow into next year, and that's why I have pretty high confidence that this business will grow every single year. It may not grow every single quarter, right? We were flat this quarter, but we're shipping a lot of chambers this year and I feel pretty good about what that's going to mean for CSBG next year. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned the supply situation could improve over the next several quarters. I'm curious. What do you think changes to help that? Is that actions you are taking, is that actions your suppliers are taking? I'm just curious, what's kind of behind your confidence that supply situation can actually improve from here? Tim Archer : Yeah. I think it would be perhaps actions we're taking with our suppliers. I mean, it's about helping to prioritize our critical supply chain partners towards some things that are most important to meeting output quarter-by-quarter. The actions we've taken ourselves, we've kind of detailed those out. If we look back 6 months ago or more, we were talking about physical capacity, needing to open factories, expand factories, and we've really taken care of a lot of our own actions. But in a very complex supply chain, we've got to do the same work with all of our partners and they've been great through that, but there's still more work to be done and we just anticipate that over the next several quarters we'll make -- we'll continue to make progress. Vivek Arya : All right. Thanks, Tim. And for my follow-up, you sound more confident about next year, both on the tools and the CSBG site. Is that based on the backlog of orders? Is that based more on structural drivers? And where I'm coming from is that customers are seeing the current state of the industry and supply shortages. What gives you the confidence there, not over-ordering given this environment that these orders are for real? So if you look at your confidence about next year, how would you contrast those signals to what you usually have at this point in prior years? Tim Archer : Yeah, that's a very good question. Something we watch closely, we want to make sure that demand is as real as possible. I mentioned our lead times, our conversations with customers, our understanding of projects, I would say is better at this point because our customers planning for very big projects, mega fabs. They're experiencing difficulties in getting equipment. And so, we're having a much deeper conversations with them about how we can ensure that that equipment be available when they need it. And so, I would say, compared to normal, we have a little bit longer visibility than we typically have had. Doug Bettinger : And Vivek, obviously, we know every fab in the world, how big it is, how much equipment it can take. And we think through that as we're talking to customers about when they want equipment in those clean room spaces. So that goes into part of the thinking as well. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is open. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much, and congrats on a really nice quarter given the environment. Doug, maybe just a follow-up question on the Customer Support Business Group. You guys have done a really, really good job growing the Reliant business. Obviously, the team of that marketplace is growing and you\u2019re capitalizing from that. Are you getting any quote share wins because customers, especially on that front, are looking for more productivity near our new materials engineering that's going on in some of those, I guess, trailing etch processed. Are you actually gaining share also and getting placements in -- with the Reliant business for some of those more mature nodes? Doug Bettinger : That's a good question, Patrick. Yeah, we are. We go to market there through the Reliant product line, as you know, which refurbished equipment is, and increasingly we're selling new equipment. And when I look at some of the new customers or customers that are taking equipment, it's -- our footprint is doing quite well, frankly, in the specialty space and we have some very specific things that were very, very strong at. So yeah, I think we're doing well. I don't know Tim if -- Tim Archer : I guess what I would just add is, you know, as people are trying to work through supply constraints and increase their output out as a fab, most valuable part of our CSBG business to them is the productivity upgrades segment. Those are upgrades that can be applied to existing equipment. Many times, not even really changing the process. It might be software optimization to optimize the wafer handling through the machine and thereby gain some small improvement in throughput. We definitely see as utilizations really hit max levels, people looking for productivity upgrades they can implement to squeeze more out of installed base, so that part of our business always does quite well, but I would say in this environment doing quite well. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : And next we'll go to Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. My first question is going back to supply constraint. I got to give this a strike. If you look at your revenue year-to-date, how much more revenue do you think you could have shipped if there were no constraints? If you are not answering quantitatively, are there some metrics that you can point to help -- you can point at to help us think about that dynamic before revenue orders? I know you don't disclose orders anymore. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. No, Sidney. We're not going to quantify right now, but we are constrained, our lead times are stretched. It's a decent amount of unmet demand. I mean, there's a reason that I said unmet demand, lead time, and so forth. We're working our way through it. But I'm not going to quantify. Sidney Ho : Okay. Maybe I'll switch over to ask about the Memory side. What are your thoughts about the bit supply growth run rate exiting this year for DRAM and NAND. It seems like some of the CapEx spending in the early part of this year should turn into output by the end of this year. And kind of relate d to that, I assume most of the Memory CapEx will be for technology transition, but how should we think about what portion of the WFE is more driven by wafer additions and hence are more variable in nature? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Sidney. What I like about NAND and DRAM this year, it's a combination of both wafer ads and you always get node conversions in both NAND and DRAM. And that's very much what we see going on, more wafer adds this year than last year. Obviously, that's just natural where demand is in the industry. And when I think about supply growth, both, when I look at the investments that are occurring this year, I think NAND is pretty balanced in terms of supply, demand, growth for the year. I think DRAM is still a little bit constrained, frankly. So that's generally what I see, what we see at Lam. Sidney Ho : Okay. Great. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Sidney. Operator : And next we'll go to Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe Quatrochi : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to your comment around WFE investment required to achieve the same bit growth in NAND. I was just -- how do you compare that growth in that required investment that DRAM is one growing faster than the other? Doug Bettinger : Not sure I got the question. Try it one more time. Joe Quatrochi : Yes. So I mean, you talked about the increase in investment for -- to drive the same amount of bit growth in NAND. I assume that that's a similar trend that we're seeing in DRAM. But I was curious of is NAND growing faster than DRAM, that level of investment to drive a bid growth, or is DRAM investment growing faster? Doug Bettinger : You are absolutely right that they are both growing in order to get the same amount of bid growth. I'm not ready to compare one to the other necessarily, but they're both growing. It's getting more and more challenging capital intensity. Is going up to get the same level of big growth in both NAND and DRAM. Joe Quatrochi : Okay. Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, 3D DRAM seems to be this growing topic of interest. I was just curious, what are Lam\u2019s thoughts in terms of the timing of that? And then just the opportunity for you guys looking out to that technology? Tim Archer : Well, it's still pretty far out from a production perspective. But clearly, what we've always said is that anything that transitions devices in the third dimension requires a lot of etch and deposition equipment to build and create those complex 3-dimensional structures. So, clearly, a great opportunity for Lam as that inflection takes place. But I can say is, of course, we're engaged at this point in the early days of developing what those architectures and materials will look like. And as we get closer to defining those processed [Indiscernible] I'm sure there will be more discussion about that part of our business. Joe Quatrochi : Helpful. Thank you. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is open. Quinn Bolton : Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Doug, I just wanted to come back to that unmet demand. I know you're not going to quantify it, but if you just look back over the past couple of quarters, has that continued to grow even as you've been able to increase capacity and revenue? Doug Bettinger : I'm not going to tell you how its moved sequentially. It was there last quarter, it's there this quarter. We're working to mitigate it, work our way through it, but I'm not going to compare it one quarter to the next. Quinn Bolton : Get it. And the second question, just follow-up on Malaysia. Do you have any sense, or could you give us any sense when you think that stops being a drag? Is that still a couple of quarters out, or is that something you'd rather not specify? Doug Bettinger : It will get better as we ramp the factory. And I think by the time we get to the second half of '22, it will begin to be a benefit to gross margin as opposed to a headwind. We just need to get a ramp, those fixed costs there, and we're working on that. Quinn Bolton : Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Thanks, Quinn. Okay. Operator, I think that's it for us. Do you want to close this out? Tina Correia : Yeah. We just want to tell everyone we appreciate your support and thank you for joining our call today. Operator : And that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thank you, Tina and Happy New Year to all that are joining us today. Calendar 2021 was another year in which companies and our communities had to respond to significant challenges on many fronts. Lam\u2019s operations and results were impacted by the effects of COVID-19, labor shortages, freight and logistics cost escalation and supply chain constraints. But I am proud and thankful for how Lam employees responded at every turn with commitment and agility to support our customers and business. As the digital transformation of both the global economy and our everyday activities accelerated throughout the year, demand for wafer fabrication equipment continued to strengthen. Lam delivered record revenues and record earnings per share in calendar year 2021. Embedded in these results is record revenue in every area of our business, including NAND, DRAM and foundry logic and within every sub-segment of our customer support business. Even in a year with relatively higher foundry logic spend versus memory, we gained market share in both etch and deposition. As we closed out 2021 and enter the new year, demand for Lam products has never been higher. Yet as we have discussed in prior quarters, the global supply chain remains severely stressed at these unprecedented output levels. In the December quarter, unexpected shipment delays primarily for components from a critical supplier surfaced in the last two weeks of the quarter leaving us with insufficient time for full recovery despite the diligent efforts of our supplier and our global operations team. The resulting shipment delays caused revenues to come in below the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue for the tools that were impacted in December will be recognized in the March quarter. Looking into the first weeks of 2022, we see that supply challenges have broadened with the COVID Omicron surge adding further disruption to freight and logistics operations as well as exacerbating skilled labor shortages. We also continued to encounter significant scarcity of certain components and parts, including semiconductors. As a result, our March quarter revenue levels will be limited by the output constraints of our global supply chain. And this is reflected in our guidance. We are aggressively working on the issues with our suppliers and believe we will see progressive improvement as we move through the next few quarters. Overall, for calendar year 2022, we expect to deliver strong across-the-board revenue growth. On the demand front, we are seeing continued momentum in wafer fabrication equipment spending. We believe that spending in calendar year 2021 ended consistent with the mid-$80 billion estimate we provided on our last call. Strength was broad-based with NAND, DRAM and foundry logic all growing double-digits. As we look to calendar year 2022, there are multiple themes underpinning our view for continued WFE growth, including powerful end market demand trends, rising device complexity, strong semiconductor industry operating profitability and regional government support and incentives. In end markets, the technology landscape continues to build not only on the prevalent drivers of AI, IoT, the cloud and 5G, but also now along another vector as advances in virtual and augmented reality lay the groundwork for the metaverse over the coming decade. Immersive gaming experiences will be a primary driver of metaverse development and adoption. And I have spoken on prior calls about how advanced processors and memory devices for gaming are favorable for WFE demand due to both leading edge performance requirements and semiconductor content growth. Across the semiconductor industry, we see more than 20 new fabs being built and customers have already announced significant CapEx increases for the year. Consequently, we expect 2022 WFE spending to be in the $100 billion range with strong growth across all segments. We believe that our performance in 2021 has strengthened our ability to win in the robust demand environment we see ahead. We launched innovative new etch and deposition products, gained market share at key technology inflections, and rapidly grew our installed base. On this last point, our customer support business group continues to exceed expectations. Our chamber count grew approximately 13% in calendar year 2021 to approximately 75,000 units. Our revenue per chamber, which we highlighted at our 2020 Investor Day as a key growth objective, increased nearly 24% year-on-year in 2021, or nearly twice the growth in chamber count. We expect calendar year 2022 to be another strong growth year for our CSBG business. Our large and growing installed base also adds immense value through our product innovation process. The high volume of wafers running on our installed base everyday enable us to detect newly emerging challenges more quickly and accelerate our cycles of learning, both of which are critical in an era of increasing device and manufacturing complexity. On the product front, 2021 was a year of significant milestones for Lam. To highlight just a few, our Vantex dielectric etch system became the fastest ramping new etch product in Lam history. Built on our groundbreaking new Sense.i platform, Vantex helps customers reduce costs by enabling higher etch rates and improving fab footprint efficiency, while new process capabilities extend our technology leadership in high aspect ratio edge. We expect continued growth in Vantex shipments in 2022, with overall revenues from this product roughly doubling year-over-year. Our VECTOR DT product for backside deposition, achieved process tool of record status at all customers for 3D NAND devices with more than 200 layers further demonstrating our leadership in 3D scaling enablement. We achieved several important leading-edge wins with our selective etch, strip and surface treatment solutions, including applications for gate-all-around and foundry logic customer and our first selective etch win in DRAM. As device complexity increases across logic and memory devices, the need for angstrom-level precision is driving greater adoption of Lam\u2019s selective edge solutions compared to conventional wet etch methods. This should enable selective etch revenues to double this year as customers adopt our innovative suite of products for current leading edge applications as well as for future device architectures.  And finally, we increased our deposition market share with wins in critical bit line and spacer applications for RC reduction and are now qualified at all leading nodes for this application. To conclude, our product momentum and outperformance in our installed base business have put Lam in a great position to capitalize on the tremendous demand we see for wafer fabrication equipment. Our top priority is to alleviate the near-term supply constraints that have impacted our output capacity, our delivery predictability and our financial results. With progress expected on this front over the next several months, we believe calendar year 2022 will be another outstanding period of growth for Lam. Thank you. And now, he is Doug to cover the financial results and our outlook. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. Calendar year 2021 was a record year for Lam Research in many respects. We closed the year with revenue at $16.5 billion, which includes record levels of revenue for both our systems as well as our CSBG businesses. We also delivered an all-time high for earnings per share coming in at $32.46. I think it\u2019s important to point out that we had 59% growth in earnings per share over calendar year 2020, which outpaced the growth in revenue, which was at 39%. We ended the year however on a bit of a down point. As Tim spoke about, our revenue came in at the lower end of the guidance range due to supply chain issues that impacted us in the last two weeks of the December quarter. These delays primarily from one supplier for critical parts meant we were unable to recognize revenue for tools that we actually ship to customers, totaling more than $200 million. You will notice this reflected in the increased level of deferred revenue on the balance sheet at the end of the December quarter of $1.46 billion. The vast majority of these parts have now shipped and the full value of the tools, will revenue in the March quarter. While we continue to increase the output capacity of our own factories, we are seeing a broadening out of headwinds from the global supply chain, which is impacting the somewhat soft March quarter revenue and gross margin guidance. These headwinds are partially Omicron and labor-related, partially supplier scaling-related and partially due to freight and logistics constraints. Our expectations are that the broader supply chain issues in the industry will persist for a while and will exit the March quarter with incremental supplier shipment delays potentially causing another growth of as much as $500 million in deferred revenue. I would just highlight that we often ship equipment to our customers on a modular basis, which accelerates deliveries and allows customers the ability to begin installation while waiting for the fully configured tool. As we get our suppliers caught up with our needs and these missing components ship, these tools will revenue in future quarters. This is obviously a fluid situation right now. Let me now turn towards the details of our December quarter results. Revenue for the quarter came in at $4.23 billion, a slight decrease from the September quarter, but an increase of 22% from the same quarter a year ago. From a segment perspective, Memory represented 58% of systems revenues in the December quarter, down from the prior quarter level, which was 64%. The strength in Memory during the quarter was driven by investments in the DRAM segment, which increased both in terms of dollars as well as percent concentration at 23% of systems revenue versus 19% in the September quarter and 10% in the June quarter. The DRAM investments were primarily focused on the 1z and 1-alpha nodes. The NAND segment was 35% of our systems revenue versus 45% in the prior quarter. We are seeing both capacity additions as well as conversions across our NAND customers, with investments in 128 through 192-layer devices. We expect we will continue to see a blend of additions and conversions as we go through calendar year 2022. Broad demand across both leading edge and mature device nodes drove continued strength in the foundry segment, with the December quarter representing 31% of our systems revenue versus 25% in the September quarter. Multiple customers are investing in the segment to meet end demand drivers such as AI, IoT, cloud and 5G, which is leading to significant unit growth and more silicon content in most technology devices. We had another record quarter of system revenue dollars in the Logic and Other segment, which contributed 11% of systems revenue in the December quarter, which was consistent with the concentration in the prior quarter. Our customers are investing to meet the demand requirements in the market for microprocessors, image sensors and heterogeneous silicon packaging technologies. Now, let\u2019s switch to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 26% of total revenues. And while being the top region for December, it was down from the 30% plus levels we have seen for the last few quarters. This was an expected outcome and is related to the timing of customer investments. China domestic customers were the majority of the China regional revenue in the December quarter. The Korea and Taiwan regions also had solid investment activity, representing 25% and 18% of revenues respectively in the December quarter. The revenue for our installed base business, CSBG, was nearly $1.5 billion, which was 29% higher than the December quarter in calendar 2020 and approximately 8% higher sequentially. The continued strength of CSBG reflects a growing installed base of tools, customers operating at high utilization levels as well as our ability to monetize the growing installed base by offering more value-added advanced service solutions. Each sub-segment of CSBG hit a new record in the quarter, but I want to specifically callout our Reliant product line for achieving its 12th consecutive record quarter, delivering value to a growing specialty market across numerous customers. While the CSBG business can have quarterly fluctuations, we continue to see sustained and stable growth on an annual basis. Now, moving on to gross margin, the December quarter was 46.8%, above the midpoint of the guided range. The increase in gross margins came from a favorable customer and product mix due to shipment timing as well as high field resource productivity due to greater customer installation activity. As we have discussed in the past, gross margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix. And I would just mention, we have got incremental negative cost impacts from the supply chain constraints that we discussed earlier that are negatively impacting the March gross margin guidance. Operating expenses for December were $627 million, an increase from the prior quarter amount of $586 million. The December quarter had higher variable compensation as we closed the calendar year as well as additional research and development investments. We have added headcount in R&D to support our growing product portfolio and we are focused on supporting our customers\u2019 ongoing technology roadmaps. December operating margin came in at 32% or approximately $1.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.9%, generally in line with our expectations. Looking into calendar year \u201822, we expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low-teens level. We continue to monitor potential tax changes under consideration in the United States. Given the uncertainty there, we have not yet reflected the impact of any changes in our financial modeling. And as we have discussed in prior calls, our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $19 million in income. This amount is better than the prior quarter and resulted in income in the December quarter due to a gain in one of our venture investments that recently raised capital in a public offering. As we have noted in last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we did not include the estimated gain of approximately $50 million in our December quarter guidance and the amount in the results that you are seeing was reasonably close to that forecast. This gain added 26% \u2013 or excuse me $0.26 tax adjusted to earnings per share. And I just have you note that overall OI&E is subject to market-related volatility that could cause a difference from our typical run-rate. We continue to buyback shares with our focus on capital return. And in the December quarter, we repurchased approximately $430 million worth of stock. In addition, we paid $211 million in dividends during the quarter. For the calendar year, we allocated a total of $3.8 billion towards capital return, which was approximately 94% of free cash flow. During 2021, we reduced share count by more than 4 million shares at an average repurchase price of $593 per share. Diluted earnings per share for the December quarter was $8.53. And the diluted share comp balance was slightly lower than the September quarter level coming in at 142 million shares, which was in line with our expectations. Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $5.6 billion, up from the prior quarter level of $4.9 billion. We generated strong cash from operations in the December quarter of $1.4 billion, which was somewhat offset by the capital return activities that I just spoke about. Day sales outstanding was essentially flat coming in at 73 days compared to 72 days in the September quarter. Inventory turns were down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 2.9x, which was pretty much as planned as we\u2019ve grown inventory to increase the business volume. Non-cash expenses for the December quarter included approximately $63 million for equity compensation, $62 million for depreciation and $20 million in amortization. Capital expenditures in the December quarter were flat with September coming in at $138 million. Capital expenditures are mainly focused on expansion activities such as our silicon parts facility in Ohio and the Korea Technology Center that will be opening in the first half of 2022. We have 16,300 regular full-time employees at the December quarter \u2013 at the end of the December quarter, which is an increase of approximately 900 people from the prior quarter. Our headcount growth was mainly in the factory and field organizations to support the growing output levels that we\u2019re seeing. Now let\u2019s look at our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2022 quarter. We\u2019re expecting revenue of $4.25 billion, plus or minus $300 million. As we\u2019ve discussed earlier, the guidance reflects our expectation for a higher level of shipment delays in the March quarter, due to broadening out of supply chain constraints we\u2019re seeing. Customer demand is decently stronger than what we can currently supply. Backlog has grown for five consecutive quarters as we exited the December quarter. We\u2019re expecting gross margin of 45%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Our guidance reflects a higher level of spending that we\u2019re incurring for managing the execution of the supply chain as well as extra costs to secure critical semiconductor component parts. As we sit here today, I believe our gross margin will improve as we progress through the year. We\u2019re forecasting operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $7.45 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 141 million shares. We\u2019re widening our ranges out a bit due to the supply chain uncertainties that we\u2019ve discussed. As we start calendar year 2022, we\u2019re in the strongest investment year in the history of the semiconductor industry. It\u2019s important to note that the demand is clearly there. We are dealing with broadening out of supply chain constraints, which we know we\u2019re going to fix over time. We\u2019re laser-focused on addressing these supply challenges, and we\u2019re confident that we will deliver improvements as we go through the year. We\u2019re in solid market share positions. We\u2019ve gained further traction across all market segments in 2021. And we\u2019ve got a robust and growing installed base business. Operator, that concludes Tim and my prepared remarks. We\u2019d like to now open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So can you guys just help us understand on the supply chain constraints? Is this more subsystems and part shortages or is it chip shortages? And I assume that you\u2019re placing orders for both subsystems, parts and ships to the entirety of this year just given the extended lead times. So looking at what your suppliers have committed to shipping to you this year, if all of this plays out, combined with the incremental systems capacity expansion from Malaysia, can the team meet its forward backlog and forecasted customer requirements this year or do you think that there is some likelihood that you exit this calendar year with your shipments below your customers\u2019 demand requirements? Tim Archer : So Harlan, I\u2019ll start that and let Doug add if he wants to. As we mentioned, the December issue was primarily critical parts that you call them \u2013 I\u2019ve called them probably subsystems, pretty large critical components that goes into our tool. But the underlying reasons for why certain suppliers are having challenges, shipping goes across the board. We talked about broadening challenges. In some cases, it\u2019s shortages of labor that have been driven and exacerbated by COVID-driven absenteeism. In some cases, it\u2019s chip availability. In some cases, it has been freight and logistics. But I would say that we are working closely with these suppliers, and we have committed schedules. We\u2019ve said our lead times are quite extended versus normal. We have better visibility today into demand and customer schedules, I think, than we ever have. And therefore, to your point, we have placed those orders with suppliers. And I would say in both Lam\u2019s case and our suppliers case, it\u2019s about executing to that much higher demand plan. Now what we\u2019ve given you as an outlook for WFE that we do believe we can execute to. And as we said, we believe we will make progressive improvement in supply chain capacity in coming quarters. And that as we do that, you\u2019ll see Lam output, the output of our supply chain increase and we will be meeting the customer demand at that point. What I would also point out is that from the standpoint of our own capacity. This was a key area of focus in 2021, and we talked a lot about it. We significantly expanded our existing factories in the U.S., in Korea, in Taiwan. We ramped and started shipping from our new Malaysia facility, which ultimately will become our largest manufacturing site. We increased our own employment both in full-time and temporary workforce. And I would say, right now, our focus is ensuring that every aspect of our supplier base has grown their capacity to match ours. And that is something that we\u2019re working on every day, and I do believe we will \u2013 as Doug said, we \u2013 this is a fixable problem, but it is our primary priority at this point. Doug Bettinger : And maybe the only thing I would add just so it\u2019s crystal clear to everybody listening, the December slight miss below midpoint, really one supplier that emerged very late in the month of December. And we just didn\u2019t have time to respond to it. So that\u2019s one statement. Second, what Tim just told you is there is a broadening out that we see beyond one supplier that we\u2019re working to mitigate. And we\u2019re doing lots of different things with lots of different suppliers to work our way through this, Harlan, but we know we\u2019re going to fix this. This is something that you can manage your way through, and we will manage our way through it. Demand is very strong. Tim Archer : And maybe just a final comment to note, obviously, on everybody\u2019s mind is that we were fighting challenges all through 2020. I mean, it\u2019s not as though supply chain has just become an issue. But I would say that some of the things that have changed when we talk about the slight worsening that we\u2019re seeing right now is also that in many cases, whether it\u2019s Lam\u2019s inventory or suppliers\u2019 inventory they have been drawn down by these very high output levels to the point where our vulnerability to a miss that might only be just a few days, but at the output rate of our factories. Those few days can actually translate into some pretty big revenue numbers, and that corresponding few days could be the same for our suppliers. So I think that what\u2019s different right now is that we just have a little bit less room to respond to the challenges. But I tell you, all through 2021, we are fighting these and in almost all cases, we were successful in mitigating them without them becoming misses in our financial results. But I think that \u2013 and that\u2019s what gives us confidence that we will solve these as we go through \u201822 as well. Harlan Sur : And I appreciate the insights. Then can you just \u2013 given the strong WFE backdrop and the potential strong growth backdrop for Lam. Can you guys just give us an update on the Malaysia manufacturing ramp? I believe that the target was to get to about $3 billion of annualized revenue output from Malaysia by the middle of this year. Is the team still on track for that? And I\u2019ve also heard that the team is trying to build out domestic supplier support around this facility, which is potentially a big benefit for you guys, right, especially during periods like this where having to procure materials from other geographies can probably be quite challenging. So maybe you can also update us here on the strategy for building out the domestic support capability in Penang? Tim Archer : Yes. Well, what I would say is that the ramp of the Malaysia factory is on track. And we\u2019re quite happy with the progress we\u2019re making there. Again, it\u2019s ramping per schedule. Demand is somewhat outstripping the ramp rate. But coming back to your point about why we embarked on Malaysia and also expansions, as I mentioned, in Korea, Taiwan, the U.S. and even in our factory in Europe. And that is we get the opportunity to tap into different talent pools. So I talked about labor shortages, not all COVID-related. These are just driven by serving demand in lots of parts of the industry. So by having factories in different locations, we tap into different talent pools. And also, as you mentioned, we have the opportunity to qualify different supplier sets or even in some cases where we have global critical suppliers, they built factories in those same locations next door to us very close to our site. And they also tap into that different talent pool. And so there is many ways in which this expansion of our global footprint, we think in the long-term, actually makes us less sensitive to disruption in any one particular region, whether it\u2019s in freight and logistics or it\u2019s in workforce or it\u2019s in the supply chain. So it\u2019s all part of our strategy. We\u2019re executing on it and we just need to get to that endpoint a little bit faster. Thanks, Harlan. Harlan Sur : Thank you very much. Yes, thank you. Operator : And so we will go to our next question from Krish Sankar of Cowen & Company. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. Doug and Tim, you mentioned the WFE to be $100 billion this year. But if I look at the current WFE run rate, it seems like it\u2019s like more in the low to mid-$90 billion. So to get to $100 billion, the second half run rate has to be more like $105 billion to $110 billion. And I understand the demand is strong, and it\u2019s all about supply constraints today. So if my math is right, does it mean that the WFE and the revenues have to step up in the second half? Is that kind of the implication of $100 billion WFE from where we are today? And is it fair to assume that Lam revenues had to head up \u2013 step up in the back half of this year? And then I have a follow-up. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Krish, I do think WFE is back half weighted this year. Maybe as much to do with where true demand is, but also a little bit because I believe the industry in the first half of the year is going to be somewhat supply constrained. So I think it\u2019s going to be a second half weighted spending here, Krish. Krish Sankar : Got it. And then Doug, just to like quickly just follow-up on that, is that the implication that your revenue should also step up in the back half? Doug Bettinger : Likely, yes. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Alright. Fair enough. And then my follow-up question is just quickly on China, you mentioned about domestic was pretty strong in December. It looks like the domestic China business is going to be strong this year, too. Can you just help us understand what is driving it? There was some recent news about Tsinghua, the parent company of YMTC having some issues. So some investors worry that\u2019s going to cap YMTC\u2019s CapEx or WFE this year? So I am kind of curious, what do you think is going to drive China WFE? Is this still the long tail of smaller trailing edge customers or do you expect the big guys like SMIC and YMTC to also be a big part of domestic China WFE this year? Thank you. Tim Archer : Yes. I think that from a China WFE perspective, we think it remains very broad demand across many different players, in fact, even some new fabs and new players that are entering the market there. And while some of it, of course, are big players, a lot of it is our fabs that are addressing what we all know is a very tight trailing-edge technology landscape. And so I think that is a pretty big driver for WFE, and Lam participates well in that market. And Doug mentioned our Reliant business that continues to show record after record in terms of business, and a lot of that stems from investments in places like China at the off leading-edge nodes. Doug Bettinger : Yes, the investment performance \u2013 I was just going to say, it\u2019s a very broad set of customers was all I was going to add, Krish. A lot of whom you\u2019ve probably not even heard of, frankly. So there is a long tail of people spending dollars in China. Krish Sankar : Got it. Just I mean, Tim and Doug, just want to clarify, you\u2019re not too worried about all the China news on Tsinghua at this point? Doug Bettinger : I\u2019m not overly concerned. No. There is ample liquidity in China for the aspirations that they have to make the investments they are planning to make. Krish Sankar : Thank you very much, guys. I really appreciate the info. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : You are welcome, Krish. Operator : And we will go next to C.J. Muse of Evercore. C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question, a derivative to the supply chain issues that you\u2019re seeing and in higher freight costs. Curious your ability to pass along of your higher input cost to customers. I understand there is a long tail in contracts, but would love to get a sense of how you\u2019re seeing that play out here in 2022. Tim Archer : Yes. C.J., I\u2019ll take a shot at it. I mean, first of all, I mean, we\u2019re not going to go to the detail on conversations we may be having with customers on that point. But I guess I\u2019d point to a couple of things. One, it\u2019s hard to see perhaps what we are doing, given the overwhelming cost challenges, Doug talked about, relative to the near-term projections. But longer term, Lam equipment is absolutely vital to ramping global semiconductor capacity. That\u2019s important for every one of our customers and industry more broadly. And we\u2019re also \u2013 our equipment is also vital to achieving the technologies road map for the industry. So there is tremendous value in what we do for our customers in the industry, and we always fight to get paid fairly for that value delivered. Right now, I would say that we\u2019re focused squarely on solving these supply chain issues, having conversations with customers and suppliers about how we do that in the most efficient way. And I think as you see us work through that, you\u2019ll see our financial results including gross margin continue to improve into the future. C.J. Muse: Great. Very helpful. And I guess, as my follow-up, as you look at your installed base business, you talked about 24% chamber revenue growth per chamber, which is pretty impressive. Curious how we should think about growth beyond 2021? I think historically, you kind of talked about a 6% to 10% kind of anticipated revenue per chamber CAGR. Has that changed? And should we be thinking a higher number going forward? Tim Archer : Well, yes, I mean, if you project out these current growth rates, you get to a pretty big customer support business group in the future. But we \u2013 as I mentioned, exceeding expectations, the business is doing extremely well. I would say that we anticipate some mitigation in that growth rate. I think at our Analyst Day, we kind of put out a model to say, look, our objective every year is to go in saying that we will outgrow \u2013 the revenue will outgrow the growth of the installed base, which means fundamentally, you\u2019re moving forward the revenue capture per chamber. Right now, we\u2019ve flowed those numbers away. But some of it may be a little bit short-term. I mean, clearly, everyone is increasing held inventory that probably goes to our spare parts business as well. Over time, and I don\u2019t know when that would be because I think people are going to be a little bit cautious for quite some time about supply issues as we\u2019re talking about. Eventually, they will draw those inventories back to probably more efficient numbers, and that would cause some mitigation in the spare parts business part of CSBG. We\u2019ve also talked about the Reliant business and tremendous growth in upgrades and sales of tools for trailing edge. I don\u2019t know that, that will mitigate so much, but it\u2019s been on a red hot pace the last year or two. And so I would expect some mitigation there. So maybe the best way to think about it is, again, our goal is always to outgrow the growth of the installed base, capturing more revenue per chamber. And so you can model it Lam with expected Taber growth rate plus some \u2013 it\u2019s probably best way to think about it. Operator : And so we will move to our next question from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. It\u2019s actually Dana Chen on for Timothy Arcuri. I was wondering if you could touch based on \u2013 you previously talked about like the GM, gross margin headwinds from Malaysia. Can you just help us quantify how should we think about the impact from there in the next few quarters? And is the timing for the new Malaysia manufacturing to shift from like headwind to tailwind maybe in the second half of this year? I just wanted to understand the gross margin impact over there? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Malaysia will be a tail in the gross margin. Certainly, as we get into the second half of the year and in my scripted remarks, I basically said, as I look through the rest of calendar year \u201822, I expect gross margin will improve from the levels that we are at today. Part of that will be Malaysia. Part of it will be the mitigation of the supply chain and part of it will be new products coming out and the positive mix factor of that. So, I will give you a few things to think about there. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And maybe just touch base on the domestic China WFE, can you just talk about where you think 2021 that came in? And how do you think about that like into 2022 from domestic China? Doug Bettinger : Yes. The way we have been talking about it is that it was a growth year in \u201821. We didn\u2019t quantify how much, but it was very much in line with the expectations. We described 2020 is roughly $10 billion indigenous Chinese WFE grew last year. It\u2019s going to grow again this year is what I would tell you. Unidentified Analyst : Alright. Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will go next to Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on your segment mix with regard to your WFE forecast for the year. Just given where you guys do tend to focus, do you think that, that segment is a potential disadvantage with regard to your ability to grow in line with how you view the WFE market itself growing in 2022? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Stacy, it\u2019s a good question. I do think when I look at growth in \u201822 that you are going to see that the highest level of growth in foundry/logic. That\u2019s just what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s pretty well understood. And you are right in your observation, I think, inherent in your question is, historically, we been somewhat less represented there, I guess in terms of share of spend as compared to memory.  Having said that, though we have made a nice step up there in the last couple of years, we continue to \u2013 2021 was a good share position year for us in foundry and logic. So, that\u2019s going to benefit us. And also, when I look at \u201822 WFE, I think you are going to see nice growth in memory, and I will let Tim add on to. Tim Archer : Yes, Stacy, I guess I just wanted to mention, I mean we have maybe gotten that question a lot of times about how we are doing in foundry and logic and what our plans. I think we have done a nice job of, and it will play out over the next several years. We focused on a lot of our product portfolio and product development on products that put us out in front of that technology roadmap. And just to name a couple of the products. I mean you look at what we have done in atomic layer deposition, selective etch, the low RC materials, dry EUV resist and heterogeneous 3D packaging. All of those are quite tied to ramps in foundry/logic spending. Now the good news is, many of those also play over into our strength in memory like ALD does and selective etch will. But again, we have been very cautious about trying to position the portfolio such that our exposure to foundry/logic ultimately is a positive for the company, and I think we are making progress and we will continue to fulfill. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. So, does that suggest you see the share gains that you saw in \u201821 in foundry and logic continuing into \u201822? Doug Bettinger : Yes. I think the momentum is going to continue in \u201822, Stacy. Yes. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Helpful. Thank you, guys. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : And we will go to our next question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. John Pitzer : Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question like many I am juggling multiple calls. So, I apologize if it\u2019s a little bit repetitive. But just relative to kind of the first question and your ability to meet demand, Doug, and maybe this is a little bit longer term, but you have got a situation where the semi industry took 50 years to get to $0.5 trillion of revenue, and there is many models out there that suggest in the next 8 years, we will get another $500 billion and be $1 trillion in revenue. What do you have to do incremental over a multiyear period to invest to make sure you have \u2013 should the support kind of that kind of demand for supply? And is that already in the backlog for what you guys are doing in Malaysia? And is it already sort of contemplated in some of the OpEx sort of targets you gave us at Analyst Day? Tim Archer : Yes. Let me take a shot at it, and Doug can add. But as I kind of went \u2013 and you might not have heard this if you are jumping between calls. But our manufacturing strategy, we have been playing out for the last several years, I think, is really what gives us confidence that we can meet this demand going forward. And that is Malaysia, as you pointed out, but also expansions across our Korea manufacturing facility. This past year, we bought out our joint venture for manufacturing in Taiwan. We expanded all of our U.S. manufacturing sites in a pretty big way. And we also grew our output from our Europe facility. And so, I think that when you ask the question, what is it that prepares us for the industry to add another $500 billion in Lam to meet that output, it\u2019s the ability to tap into this global supply chain, which gives us access to larger talent pools, larger supplier bases for many of our parts. Some are very critical, but many of them are sourceable locally to those factories. And I think that\u2019s going to help us increase not only our own capacity, which I think we are making good progress on, but also the capacity of our global supplier base. And that\u2019s something that I would say we are pretty far down that path, but clearly, as evidenced by the current limitations, we still have more room to go, and we will be making progress in the next coming quarters. John Pitzer : And then, Tim, as my follow-on, giving us visibility 90 days out, given all the logistical issues are hard enough, thinking about the entire year as you did with your WFE comment even harder. But I am kind of curious, clearly, logic/foundry grows faster than memory this year, but we are sort of in this odd position where it kind of looks like from a cyclical perspective, the memory companies tend to be \u2013seem to be spending at a much more constrained level than maybe their logic/foundry partners for the first time ever. If you look at CapEx to rev ratios and growth of CapEx off the bottom, is that how you see it? I guess, importantly, if it is, what implications might that have for memory spending as we go from \u201822 into \u201823? Tim Archer : Okay. Well, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 constrained is always more in the eye of the builder for the customer perhaps. But I think you are right that we are seeing a fairly balanced in fact, maybe more balanced spending profile within the memory space, at least is our current view. Maybe back to your original point though about visibility, our visibility at this point is much \u2013 we feel further out in terms of demand side. Our challenge is not understanding demand 6 months, 9 months, 12 months out, maybe even longer. It really is about growing supply capability of our supply base and also our own capacity to meet that growing demand. But I think the implications are that we exit this year still perhaps with robust demand going into 2023. It\u2019s too early to \u2013 we are not going to give a guide at this point for 2023, but I would say is whether it\u2019s in memory or it\u2019s in logic/foundry, a lot of big investments planned, fabs under construction, many of those don\u2019t take the equipment even until starting in \u201823 or maybe even beyond. And so, I think we are going to see robust WFE for the industry for years to come at this point. John Pitzer : Thanks,Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, John. Operator : And we will go to our next question from Mark Lipacis of Jefferies. Mark Lipacis : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question and I apologize, I am kind of new on the Lam call, so I apologize if this is elementary. But if we have the semiconductor shortages globally that are causing different vertical markets to lose tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues. And you guys make the equipment that actually can solve that problem. Why aren\u2019t Lam and your peers, the absolute number one priority customers for the semiconductors that can make the equipment that solve these challenges? It\u2019s surreal to hear you guys talk about component shortages are preventing you from shipping product that can solve everybody\u2019s problems. That\u2019s the first question. I have a follow-up. Tim Archer : Okay. I am not sure it\u2019s such an elementary question, it\u2019s quite a complex one. But I \u2013 boy, I guess, I would say that we try to make that point quite clear. And I think there has been a lot of discussion between companies like ours and the manufacturers just as there are many, many industries talking to those same suppliers about the urgent needs that they have. And so I don\u2019t think we want to make this \u2013 we certainly did not say it\u2019s all about chips, and that\u2019s what\u2019s limiting our supply. It\u2019s one element of some of the component shortages and subsystem shortages, but it has been several other things as well. But I do believe that as we increase both our supplier capacity and our own capacity and output goes up, then that is key to alleviating the problem. And so maybe it becomes a virtuous cycle where more our output goes up, the easier the constraints get and therefore, our outlook goes up even faster. It\u2019s certainly our objective to drive that and we are in close conversation with the semiconductor chip manufacturers who happen to be our customers as well about how they can help. And I would say that in most cases, those customers are stepping in and doing everything they possibly can to help because they want the equipment that we are shipping to them. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Mark, I think the only thing I would add is, is typically, we wouldn\u2019t be in the business of buying semiconductors, right. And that\u2019s our suppliers or sometimes even the suppliers of our suppliers that would be procuring those chips. And because we know that group of our customers, their suppliers really, really well, that\u2019s why we are stepping in. Maybe that helps. And we clearly have access to those guys. So, we can make this better quicker, I think is why we are pointing this out right now. Mark Lipacis : Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. I appreciate that you have \u2013 it sounds like you have very good visibility this year. What is \u2013 what kind of conversations do you have with your customers about 2023, appreciating that they may not be giving you hard orders that far out or maybe they do. But I mean, do you have those kind of planning discussions with your customers about what 2023 might look like? Can you give us any sense of how those conversations go? That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Tim Archer : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I mean obviously, we have sufficient conversations for very long lead time decisions that we have to make. So, as I talk about our expansion of manufacturing facilities and hiring rates. One of the components, it\u2019s not a \u2013 that has a relatively long lead time is the hiring of engineers that go on site to support those new customer facilities and projects. And so I would say we are already having discussions with customers about 2023 in earnest. But it\u2019s a little too early to get as precise as many of you probably like in terms of what does the number for 2023 WFE looks like, and we are not going to have that conversation today. But I would say customers are giving a lot of just they want us to be ready. We are having those same conversations with our suppliers because we need them to be ready. And so you can just believe that we are having those conversations quite frequently and quite some temp with customers today. Mark Lipacis : Thanks. Tim Archer : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And we will go to our next question from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. Certainly understand the gross margin pressures based on the costs that you guys are taking on to sort of deal with all these issues. But your customers are kind of dealing with some of the same stuff and are raising prices and passing that on to their customers. If this ends up being a persistent situation where you have high freight costs and component costs and things like that, do you see gross margins kind of getting back to the level they were a couple of quarters ago? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Joe, I do. I specifically \u2013 and you might have been jumping between calls as well. In my prepared remarks, I specifically said I believe gross margin will improve for us as the year progresses. Meaning the March quarter, I believe is a low point for the gross margin in the year. A lot because of these freight logistics and other things in the supply chain that we just need to go fix it, and that\u2019s what we are doing. Joe Moore : Okay. That makes sense. I mean I guess, just \u2013 you are fixing it because those costs are going away, or are you able to actually charge your customers expedites and things like that to deal with all of it? Tim Archer : I think our objective is probably to do a little bit of both. As you mentioned, some of the issues may become persistent and built into the cost structure of the history, in which case those ultimately have to be accounted for in the pricing for the industry. And yes, obviously, we are very sensitive to the fact that customers in certain parts of our market are cost sensitive, and therefore, we will try to eliminate as many of the costs first. So, we are not taking the easy way out of just trying to pass the costs on trying to first eliminate them and then those that are persistent will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Joe. Operator : And we will go on to our next question from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. But maybe for Doug, with the supply chain issues that are going on right now, I know it\u2019s difficult to give a granular answer. But how do you look at the allocations between what\u2019s needed for new shipments and new tools versus your installed base business, which also has a lot of those type of components as well. And obviously, a lot of the customers are at high utilization. What\u2019s the balance there that you are trying to do at least in the near-term to keep your customers as happy as possible on both ends? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I am going to actually give this one to Tim, Patrick. Tim Archer : Well, I think that\u2019s because what I am going to tell you is that the most valuable tool for the customer is the one that\u2019s in this fab in running. And so \u2013 of course, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 we prioritize today keeping the installed base operating and outputting. And to one of the earlier questions, if we don\u2019t do that, then problem just gets worse because chips aren\u2019t being produced. So, we are having to make that call at certain points, but what I can tell you is that priority is the installed base and keeping tools in manufacturing and output in a way for us and have chips for the industry. Doug Bettinger : But Patrick, I can either or we are mitigating both at the same time, and it\u2019s not exactly the same supply group that is creating a spare part and new equipment. So, it\u2019s maybe as much an overlap as you might say. Tim Archer : Not yet. Not every constraint right now exists on a part that would be a spare. Certain subsystems and our tools are not field replaceable spares units. So, there is some overlap but not entirely, as Doug said. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Patrick. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : And we will go to that last question from Atif Malik of Citi. Atif Malik : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Tim, you mentioned the gate all around selective edge revenues to double this year. I am curious about the size of this opportunity this year? Doug Bettinger : Yes. To be more specific, what I actually said was \u2013 yes. What I actually said was that the selective etch revenue would double. The selective ventures actually used in more applications than just get all around, and I don\u2019t think we are going to quantify the exact size of the business yet. Atif Malik : Got it. And then is it possible for you to kind of quantify your exposure of sales to advanced packaging, heterogenic computing just in the ballpark? Tim Archer : Yes. We \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we have actually quantified it. But what I would say is that we provide a number of the very critical steps there. Obviously, some of the processes that we have talked about in the past are electroplating. Our etching processes are both critical to some of the high aspect ratio of processes like through-silicon via or other parts of the process to go into 3D packaging. So, it\u2019s a priority market for us, and we have been doing quite well for a number of years in that space. Atif Malik : Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks Atif. Operator : And I will now turn the call back to Tina Correia for any additional or closing comments. Tina Correia : Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining our call today. We appreciate your support. Operator : And so this concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Please, go ahead. Tina Correia : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, we will share our overview on the business environment, and we'll review our financial results for the March 2022 quarter and our outlook for the June 2022 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Today's presentation and Q&A include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the accompanying slides in the presentation. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 PM Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I'll hand the call over Tim. Tim Archer : Thank you, Tina. Lam reported revenues of $4.06 billion and earnings per share of $7.40 in a severely supply-constrained environment. While we were able to deliver results within our guided ranges, I am disappointed that we are not performing better in a very strong demand environment for our equipment and services. Continued component shortages, along with new challenges that emerged, including COVID-related lockdowns, along with exacerbated an already stressed supply chain situation. As a result of the larger range of issues, our original expectation for the timing of output recovery proved to be optimistic. In response, we have intensified the focus across Lam. We are committing the financial resources and workforce required to both meet our customers' priority tool needs in the short term, as well as increase the long-term resiliency of our global supply network. Our recovery efforts span from embedding Lam experts at key suppliers to collaborate on shortages, to increasing field resources to accelerate installation of tools once shipped. Customers are partnering with us to qualify additional component suppliers, and we have assigned more engineering resources to work on design and sourcing for alternative parts to improve supply chain flexibility. Despite the issues we still face, I am thankful for the tremendous efforts from Lam employees, our suppliers and our customers through this challenging period. While the near-term pace of supply chain recovery is difficult to assess, we are confident that our actions will result in progressive improvement in our performance on a go-forward basis. Our deferred revenue balance exiting the March quarter was over $2 billion, as we shipped systems to customers to accelerate tool installation, but could not recognize this revenue within the quarter due to the lack of certain critical components. Doug will elaborate more on the deferred revenues in his prepared remarks. On the demand side, the environment remains very strong. While continued supply-related delays could potentially limit how much wafer fabrication equipment investment can be executed in 2022, our current WFE view is still in the $100 billion range. We see unconstrained demand exceeding $100 billion in 2022 and any unmet demand should flow into next year. Our confidence is rooted in the fact that the powerful secular drivers of WFE spending are unchanged. Greater semiconductor content, rising device complexity and larger die sizes all contribute to a healthy setup for sustainably strong WFE levels. An example of this can be seen in the smartphone segment, where unit growth may be flattening year-over-year due to inflationary-driven softness in consumer markets, but the average NAND and DRAM content is increasing around 20% year-over-year, driving demand for WFE. In servers, we see overall growth in both units and content with server DRAM content per CPU growing in the 20% range from the prior year. On top of this, the drivers of Lam-specific growth are also unchanged. Etch and deposition are critical technologies required to transition semiconductor manufacturing to higher performance and more scalable 3D device architectures in memory, foundry/logic and advanced packaging. Lam's leadership position in key enabling technologies for 3D devices, evidenced by our installed base in leading-edge fabs worldwide, is a solid foundation for long-term outperformance.  And with our continuing investment in an exceptional pipeline of new products and services, we are increasingly well positioned to win at the 3D inflections. On the technology front, we are winning new applications across etch and deposition and across all device segments. We are strengthening our overall market position by delivering differentiated solutions that enable higher aspect ratio structures, enhanced device performance and increased manufacturing productivity. Over the past two calendar years, Lam's total revenue growth has exceeded that of our large peers. This is in part due to our gains in the foundry/logic market, where we were historically under-indexed. And it is also a result of our success in expanding our CSBG installed base opportunities. Through innovations like Lam's Equipment Intelligence solutions, we are helping address our customers' capacity constraints by utilizing vast quantities of tool data to improve system performance and enable faster tool installations.  In the March quarter, we expanded on our selective etch wins at a large foundry/logic customer. At the same time, we have added new wins in our conductor etch business. In one example, we are set to double our conductor etch share at a key foundry/logic customer as they transition to their next node. At another leading foundry/logic customer, we have successfully replaced a competitor's tool at a critical step by helping the customer accelerate their move to the newer node. Key to our traction in these wins is our ability to enhance our product offerings with Equipment Intelligence solutions to deliver the best etch uniformity and improve yield, thereby addressing customers' cost and performance requirements as they execute their scaling roadmaps.  In deposition, we continue to see significant momentum for both our ALD metals and dielectric solutions for leading-edge foundry/logic nodes. In DRAM, where the highest performance devices are adopting more advanced CMOS technology like high-K metal gate transistors, we have leveraged our foundry/logic success to win new applications in the DRAM 1b [ph] node. As customers ramp capacity on these nodes, our etch share in this segment is set to expand.  In deposition, our critical spacer applications enable lower-capacitance thinner films to support further device size and power scaling. In the March quarter, we secured two wins for critical spacers at a large DRAM customer for their leading node. In the NAND segment, we also won a highly contested decision at a key customer where we demonstrated a superior ALD solution for a critical transition to a next-generation low-resistance enabling film for their Worldline applications. Shifting to our CSBG business, results were down modestly in the March quarter, predominantly due to the global supply constraints that impacted our reliance and upgrades businesses. While CSBG is subject to quarterly fluctuations, we believe our expanding installed base over a longer period offers a stable platform for revenue growth. During the March quarter, we secured fairs contracts at two of the world's largest IDMs with the cumulative contract amount exceeding $1 billion. We see calendar year 2022 to be another strong growth year for our CSBG business. So, to wrap-up, we believe we are making progress on the extraordinary industry supply challenges, but overcoming the breadth of issues that have emerged is taking longer than we initially expected. We are focused on meeting the critical needs of our customers and have committed both the financial resources and workforce required to recover as quickly as possible. With continued strength in the equipment demand environment and progressive improvement in our supply chain, we do expect Lam to post another solid year of revenue and EPS growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. In the March 2022 quarter, we delivered results within the guidance ranges for all our financial metrics. However, we missed the midpoint for all numbers. As Tim discussed, we experienced broadening supply chain issues that negatively impacted our revenue as well as our profitability. Delays in securing critical parts needed for shipments of our tools hindered our ability to meet our revenue objective and led to increased spending as we focused on initiatives to mitigate these constraints. Deferred revenue grew by over $600 million. The magnitude of the increase reflects the heightened degree of part shortages that we're experiencing, which impacts our ability to recognize revenue on tools that we've actually shipped. Our inventory balance also increased as we're procuring the parts that we can in building to meet the growing unmet demand that we see. On the margin side, we have headwinds from adding resources to address the supply chain challenges as well as to be prepared for the higher volumes we see in the second half. Additionally, we have ongoing supply-related inflationary pressures. We were able to partially offset the gross margin headwinds through operating expense management during the quarter. As a result, March operating income and earnings per share came in closer to the midpoint of our guidance. We see ongoing cost and supply constraint challenges continuing to impact our guidance for the June quarter. Let me now turn to the details of our revenue for the March quarter. Revenue came in at $4.06 billion, a decrease from the December quarter. The memory segment was sequentially stronger in the March quarter with concentration of 66% of systems revenues. This was up from the prior quarter level of 58%. The strength in memory during the quarter was led by the DRAM segment where we had a record level of revenue for the company and a percent concentration at 27% of systems revenues. This compares with 23% that we saw in the December quarter. The DRAM investments were primarily for 1z and 1-alpha node additions as well as conversions. The NAND segment was 39% of our systems revenue, higher than the 35% in the prior quarter. Our NAND customers are investing in tools for 128-layer to 192-layer devices. In foundry, March quarter revenue comprised 21% of our systems revenue versus 31% that we saw in December. The decrease quarter-to-quarter is related to the timing of customer investments. There continues to be solid investments in this segment to address end demand drivers such as AI, IoT, cloud, high-performance computing and 5G. I would expect to see increases in this segment as we progress through the year related to both leading as well as mature node device investments. We see continued progress in the Logic/Other segment, which contributed 13% of systems revenue in the March quarter and is a record in terms of revenue dollars. We're seeing good traction here, notably in etch, as we expect continued growth in this segment during calendar year 2022 as our customers invest to meet the demand requirements in the market for microprocessors, image sensors and advanced packaging solutions. I'll now turn to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 31% of total revenue. The split of the China revenues was fairly balanced between the domestic and multinational customers that have fab locations in China. There was also a strong concentration of investments by our customers in the Korea and Taiwan regions, which comprised 24% and 16% of our total revenues, respectively, in the March quarter. The Customer Support Business Group revenue was approximately $1.4 billion, which was down 5% from the prior quarter. CSBG was 8% higher than the March quarter of calendar 2021. Our reliance and upgrade product line revenues were negatively impacted in the March quarter by the ongoing supply chain constraints. Nonetheless, there continues to be healthy demand in the specialty market across numerous customers as well as investments by our customers for upgrades across their installed fleet of tools. Our spares business remains strong, given the high utilization levels in the industry, and we're also seeing solid customer pull for services for the same reason. As we've noted in the past, CSBG's can fluctuate on a quarterly basis but our expectations continue to be that this business will grow annually. Let me now shift to our gross margin performance. The March quarter came in at 44.7%. We are experiencing a multitude of cost pressures with increases in freight and logistics rates, raw materials costs driven by commodities such as nickel and aluminum, as well as increased integrated circuit costs. Our June quarter guidance reflects our expectations for a sustained level of cost headwinds, as we manage through and adapt to this inflationary environment. Operating expenses for March were $621 million, down from the prior quarter level of $627 million. We managed our overall spending levels during the quarter, while continuing our focus on supporting our emerging customers' technology road maps. We are also deploying incremental R&D resources towards qualifying new supply sources to help improve our supply chain challenges. Incentive compensation expenses that, as you know, are tied to the company's profitability, were also lower in the quarter. The March quarter operating margin was 29.4%. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 10%. And as I've shared with you in the past, the tax rate will have some fluctuations from quarter to quarter. Looking into calendar year 2022, we expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low teens level. And I just mentioned that we continue to monitor potential tax changes in the United States that are under discussion. But given the uncertainty there, we've not yet reflected the impact of any changes in our modeling. Other income and expense came in for the quarter at approximately $44 million in expense. And I'll just remind you, in the December quarter, we had income for this line item due to a gain in one of our venture investments that had raised capital in a public offering. We also had favorable results from our venture investments since the time we set guidance that contributed positively in the March quarter by approximately $0.11 in earnings per share. OI&E is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility in this P&L line item. We're forecasting a more negative OI&E impact in June's guidance based on what we currently see in the equity markets. We were active in our buybacks during the March quarter, allocating over $1.2 billion towards share repurchases. The cash was deployed in a combination of open market repurchases, as well as an accelerated share repurchase program. The ASR will continue to execute during the June quarter. We paid $211 million in dividends during the March quarter as well. March quarter diluted earnings per share was $7.40. Diluted share count was 140 million shares, which was lower than the December quarter and less than our March quarter expectation due to the increased share repurchase activity. Let me shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, ended at $4.6 billion, which was down from the prior quarter level of $5.6 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by the capital return activities that I just spoke about. Additionally, operating cash was at a somewhat lower level this quarter due in parts to the investments we're making in inventory to help mitigate some of the supply challenges. Inventory turns were down from the prior quarter level, coming in at 2.6 times. Also, due to the timing of customer shipments occurring later in the quarter, our days sales outstanding came in at 83 days, which was an increase from 73 days that we saw in the December quarter. Non-cash expenses for the March quarter included approximately $69 million in equity compensation, $64 million in depreciation and $20 million for amortization. Capital expenditures in the March quarter were approximately $145 million, which was fairly flat with the December level. Capital expenditures were mainly focused for growth activities such as our silicon spare parts facility in Ohio, the Malaysia factory expansion and the new Korea Technology Center. We had approximately 16,900 regular full-time employees as of the end of the March quarter, which is an increase of approximately 600 people from the prior quarter. We had headcount growth primarily in the factory and field organizations to address supply chain constraints, while supporting customer deliveries and installations.  Let me now shift and look at our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2022 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million. While customer demand continues to be strong, we see ongoing supply chain constraints. Gross margin of 44.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. Our guidance reflects expectations of an inflationary cost environment and the continuing need to very tactically manage the execution in the supply chain. Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $7.25, plus or minus $0.75 based on the share count of approximately 139 million shares.  So then let me wrap things up. Our execution in the March quarter came in a little short of our expectations. While we work through incremental challenges with our supply chain that is continuing to limit our output, demand remains robust. Exiting the March quarter, we had our sixth consecutive quarter of growing backlog. Visibility to end demand is high. We have a solid foundation in our share position, with strong traction to-date and new opportunities going forward in all market segments.  Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We tend to think about the supply chain challenges as slowing the growth of new capacity or new technology migrations. But as the supply chain challenges have continued to broaden out, is it now to a point where it's starting to potentially impact your customers' installed manufacturing operations to your CSBG business, either capping shipments of spares, targets? I know CSBG was down about 5% sequentially in a period where your customers continued to run pretty much full out of manufacturing utilizations. And I know that you said CSBG was mostly impacted by reliant and upgrades. So, is it fair to assume that the services segment, that part of it which supports your customers' installed manufacturing operations, is not being impacted by supply chain challenges? Tim Archer : Yes, Harlan, that's a -- it's a good question, and I guess I'd just remind everybody that the CSBG business is made up of four different product lines, as we just mentioned, spares, services, upgrades and then the reliant, which is the more mature node systems. And each of those is kind of impacted differently. If you look at what is the top priority for customers and the top priority for Lam is to keep all of the installed base, which now numbers something over 75,000 systems running every single day inside of those fabs. And so we're not going to compromise normal customers on spare parts, for instance. And so as we think about priorities here, you put the -- in terms of the spares and installed base runs services. I talked a little bit about Equipment Intelligence. We're looking for ways where you can work around some of the constraints. I mean, Equipment Intelligence, using data to determine when do I really have to replace parts? How do I -- how frequently do I really have to do preventative maintenance to keep the performance of the tool where I need it to be? And so I would say services actually, there's probably a little bit of an uptick in demand for us to do more services on the tool. But what does get impacted, Reliant Systems, those are tools. They are affected by the same constraints as our leading-edge systems. They need all of those components. They have communications, they need chips, they need other things. So, those are impacted just the same way as leading edge. And then upgrades, similarly, most of the upgrades we're doing are actually components that would also go into new systems. So, we work with customers to see which is the right priority call. Is it to put the new system on the particular quarter, you can see that we're talking about some impact to the upgrades business. So, hopefully, that helps explain how kind of those different segments get affected. But as I said, over the longer period, the installed base will continue to grow. It grows every single quarter, and we expect the CSBG business to expand in line with that. Doug Bettinger : And Harlan, maybe the only other thing I would add is spares, I think, is in a better situation because our customers hold some inventory. We hold inventory. There's always been a historic level of inventory. And so I think that's part of the reason why we don't believe we're impacting the installed base. Probably has got a little bit of inventory sitting there. Harlan Sur : Great. No, thanks for the insights. That's very helpful. And Doug, I know the situation is still pretty fluid, but given yours and your suppliers' purchase commitments on components, you're boosting support and logistical resources and then you've got the ramp of Malaysia, which I'm assuming has continued to go as planned, and then you also have your forecasted shipments for the second half. You put all of that together, like how should we think about gross margins through the second half of this year? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Harlan, as I sit here today, I do believe that gross margin will improve as we progress through the year. I'll remind you that I said that same thing last quarter and then we ticked down a little bit and missed our number a little bit in March, so I'll acknowledge we don't always get it right. But as we sit here today, I expect it will improve as we progress through the year and as we improve the supply chain output capability, Harlan. Harlan Sur : All right. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Harlan. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My first one, Doug, is just implied in your June quarter guide, do you expect deferred revenue to go up, flat or down? And then I guess as you think about maintaining the $100 billion WFE for the full calendar year, does that sort of imply that the $1 billion buildup you've seen in deferred revenue in December and March comes down by $1 billion in the back half of the year? Just help me understand how that dynamic works. Doug Bettinger : Yes, John, I mean, if I was guessing right now, I think deferred probably grows a little bit again in June, and then I hope begin to work our way through some of it as the supply chain gets caught up. I mean, there's $2 billion sitting there at the end of the quarter that we just need to ship parts to things we've already shipped. The base tool, too, in revenue will benefit from that. John Pitzer : That's helpful. And then my follow-up for Tim. Tim, I'm struck a little bit by, in the PowerPoint, you talked about maintaining the $100 billion for this year but you talk about unconstrained WFE being above that. I guess, what's the risk that oftentimes constraints create its own demand and customers, because they can't get what they want, they're just placing significantly larger orders into your backlog than they would be otherwise? And I guess, is there a significant financial consequence if a customer comes back and reschedules delivery and timing later on? Tim Archer : Yeah. So it's a good question. And I think first of all, I mean, we usually get a question around whether that order is placed with multiple suppliers, which is not very common in the equipment space. So to your point, perhaps instead is the demand being overstated to try to drive a sense of urgency. I think that's kind of what you were pointing out. We have very close and frequent discussions with customers. And I think what we're pointing out is that even if there is a little bit of that, which I don't actually believe there is, but if there were, unconstrained demand is well over what can be supplied this year. And therefore, we felt comfortable saying that, we're driving for that execution to the $100 billion WFE level. From a financial implications perspective, either to Lam or the customers, it depends on how close you are when the rescheduling occurs. If we're talking about tools that are and a forecast that's now through the remainder of this year, and some of these forecasts are now pushing into second half of 2023. There is really no financial implication to Lam other than we're driving to ensure that our capacity and our supply chain would have capability to ramp up to those levels. And so that's \u2013 it probably depends on very much the timing of the change and that would affect kind of the implications. John Pitzer : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Tim Archer : Yep. Thank you, John. Operator : We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'm trying to get an idea of what the second half calendar year ramp might look like. If you assume your share just holds steady with WFE at $95 billion to $100 billion, it's implying a tool ramp of like 25% to 40% half-on-half. And so I guess, what are you capable of doing, given the resources you have? And should we be thinking about a pickup in Q3 and then a larger one in Q4 and how should we think about the progression of gross margins as the recovery unfolds? Tim Archer : Well, I'll take the ramp question. I mean, clearly, we \u2013 as I mentioned, kind of feel like we're underperforming in the first half of this year to the capacity of Lam's facilities. We invested in expanding every factory we have around the world in 2021, and we talked about the fact that we can ramp those factories further. We're constrained by supply. We are qualifying additional suppliers. We're working and investing with our suppliers to ramp up their own capacity. And maybe we need to distinguish a little bit too, and I'll let Doug confirm, but it's \u2013 as we look at the deferred revenue piece versus the work that's actually being done. As Doug mentioned, we're actually shipping at a much higher rate than we're recognizing revenue in the first half of this year. So as we look to execute that $100 billion WFE for the entire year, the second half doesn't have to ramp up quite as much from a Lam factory perspective. We need to keep shipping, show progressive improving in output and also clear the critical components that are needed to recognize revenue for that deferred balance. Doug Bettinger : Yes, exactly right. Nothing to add on that. And C.J., on the gross margin thing, I tried to answer it when Harlan asked. As I sit here today, I think it gets better in the second half. As we increase our output capability, our supply chain increases its output capability. We work to mitigate some of these constraints and absorb somewhat more of the fixed cost. I think it gets better. And then, I'll remind you that I told you the same thing last quarter and I was a little bit wrong in March, but that's what I see right now, C.J. C.J. Muse: Great. And I guess as my follow-up question, for CSBG, you talked about expectations for another strong growth year. Can we infer from that, that you expect a minimum of double-digit growth? Doug Bettinger : Yes, I'm not going to quantify it for you. All the same dynamics are in place, right? Chamber counts grew nicely last year. It\u2019s going to grow nicely again this year, given the strength in WFE. Utilization in the industry is very high. Investment across all aspects of that business are doing well. We're just a little bit behind on the supply chain stuff. C.J. Muse: Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, C.J. Operator : We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Doug, I had two. The first is a follow-up from this prior question. So if I just flow through the excess deferred revenue, which you have about $1.5 billion worth of just excess deferred revenue, because you're always going to have some deferred. So if you assume that you get that all during the back half of the year, which maybe you don't, but you should get most of it, I would think, then that would assume that systems revenue would grow at least 30% in like the back half of the year, half-on-half. So I know that you don't want to provide guidance for the year, but I'm just wondering if you can maybe hold our hand a little bit on, sort of, what the back half of the year revenue would be. Is it reasonable to say that, yes, systems revenue will grow at least 30%, something like that? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Tim, you know I'm not going to give you a number. We always do this dance with the numbers, but how you're thinking about it is consistent with what I see. Yes, that deferred revenue is up above that amount that you described. There is a run rate of it that's always there, probably in the range that you're suggesting. We need to get the supply chain caught up with it, right? We need to work our way through making it better, get caught up with the stuff that's sitting there, improve what we're shipping, so that there's less of it, and that's very much what we're investing dollars and resources to do. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks. And then I guess, Doug, just a question on gross margin. That's the lowest since 2015 and it's on triple the revenue versus then. And I'm wondering if maybe you can do two things : one, break down the headwinds. I know there's a lot of different things going on, but if you could break down the headwinds. And then also, I guess, the question is, is it possible for you to pass some of these costs, because you're going to have to now invest in your supply chain and whatnot? Can you pass some of this on to your customers or are you just going to have to eat that? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Tim, your observation's right. The way I think about this is, our long-term profitability objectives from a margin standpoint are unchanged to what we had in that model two-plus years ago at this point, right? So don't change your thinking on that. Some of these upticks in inflation are permanent, and for that, we must get paid, right? We must get paid for the value we're creating and what it takes to create that value. We've done some of that and we need to continue working at that. Some of these cost increases are transitory in nature. And for that, we've got to work our way through beating the cost back a little bit. We have to be able to do both. So when you go in and talk to your customers, you explain, hey, we're doing our part and we need a little help on this other part. So, it's very much how we're thinking about it. You're right, margins are below where we want it to be. Part of it is absorbing fixed cost and part of it is freight and logistics are expensive, integrated circuits are expensive right now. We'll get paid where we need to get paid, and we'll work the cost down where we need to work the cost down. I don't know, Tim, anything you want to add? Tim Archer : No, I think that pretty much captures it. I do believe we can get paid for value. We also look at ways in which we can develop, in this era and period of rising costs, we can kind of find true win-wins with the customers. And so, we are focused on solutions that drive productivity. Those are areas where you can try to take cost out, you can make the tool more productive for the customer and get paid a higher value for that as well.  And again, back to mentioning Equipment Intelligence Solutions, these are things where again, you're truly removing some of the cost of operating the system by using data. And that allows us to get paid for those services and also perhaps charge fair value for whether it's the spares or the service work that's being done. And the customer also gets productivity and it feels like they came out on the good end of that as well. Timothy Arcuri : Awesome. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Tim. Operator : We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess I had two as well. The first one, I realize it's a supply-constrained year, Doug, but curious if you've seen any fluctuations in customer pull across different device types, if you can speak to DRAM, NAND, leading edge, logic, foundry lagging edge. To the extent you've picked up any changes to the upside or the downside, I'd be curious to hear? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Toshiya, really no changes. Demand continues to be very strong across every segment of our business, memory, foundry, logic. We haven't really seen any change in that at all. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the Logic IDM business. Really nice to see you guys make new highs here. I think you spoke to microprocessors and image sensors and I think advanced packaging in your prepared comments. I think a lot of us are focused and looking forward to continued traction in the MPU business. And I realize you don't want to talk about specific customers. But if you can kind of remind us where you are kind of in the progression there from a market share perspective, particularly in etch. To the extent you can comment, that would be super helpful? Thank you. Tim Archer : So Toshi, as you said, we don't want to talk about any one specific customer, but I gave you several proof points within foundry/logic. I mean, it's an area we know that we've been underexposed because of our product portfolio and perhaps market share. We've been working hard to introduce new products to expand our opportunity, but also to win more with the products we have. And I think that's exactly what you're seeing in, every time a transition -- a node transition occurs, our served market is getting bigger and we're gaining market share. And that's not just true for certain customers. It's true, we think, for all the customers in terms of -- especially the opportunities and our portfolio is serving.  Yes, I talked about -- on the last call, the work we've been doing in selective etching, the new portfolio of products there, targeting gate all around for instance, and I talked about that expanding this quarter as well. Those are the things that we're doing to try to make sure that our foundry/logic future is better than the past. Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks Toshiya. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about what the supply constraints are. Is it the same constraints that you saw in December or is it new stuff? And how much of it is semiconductors versus non-semiconductor products? Tim Archer : Yes, I can take a shot at it. I mean, it's pretty broad-based. I mean, clearly, we've talked about the fact that ICs themselves are a big component of the shortages and maybe one of the very long lead-time parts of that -- of the shortages. Our systems are incredibly complex and they use a lot of semiconductors inside of subsystems that go into our tools. So, that is a big part of it. But we also talked about the broadening. Some of the broadening was in other types of fabricated parts, subsystems that go into our tools, that require materials and skilled labor that found itself in short just working with each of those suppliers to either shore up their capacity or working with those suppliers and customers to qualify alternative parts, components and where necessary, alternative suppliers. And so that's what gives us confidence that as time moves on and those qualifications take place and customers can accept those new suppliers and those new components, that the flexibility and resiliency of our supply chain improves throughout the rest of the year. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, the comment that you made a few minutes ago that deferred revenue would be up kind of slightly in June, I guess I'm a little surprised by that, given that you -- your revenues are up $150 million. And this quarter, you had $600 million of kind of unfulfilled demand. So, I would have thought that the overall demand in June is at least flat. And so with revenues up $150 million, that the deferred would again be up quite a bit, is there something I'm missing there? Doug Bettinger : Like I said, I'm not going to get into guiding a whole bunch of numbers on the balance sheet because it's hard enough to get the numbers that we just missed a little bit, right? I do think it will be up somewhat, Joe. That's what I said. I didn't put a number to it. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Joe. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, I'm curious if the lockdowns in China are playing a role in the constraints that you're seeing. And I think, Tim, you mentioned that some of the constraints are due to long lead time ICs. What is your line of sight into that? Any improvement on that side? Because I guess my real question is, should we be assuming a gradual improvement as we get into calendar Q3, or is this more of a weighted -- kind of, backup weighted large catch-up improvement? So, just any views on whether China's lockdowns are playing a role, and what these long lead-times on the IC side tell you about when you can start to see any recovery on the supply side? Tim Archer : Yes. Well, we've talked about progressive improvement, so we do believe that things get better in the supply chain as a whole. We break it down -- your question about the COVID lockdowns in China, anything that was a new issue, anything that disrupts freight and logistics in and out of an important location where we do have suppliers, obviously, you lose time, either due to delays in getting parts in or out of those locations. So, that did have some impact in the quarter. But more broadly, I think each component, each constraint within the supply chain will likely recover at a slightly different pace, though I mentioned that predicting the exact pace for every component will be difficult. But from a \u2013 when I talked about the long lead time ICs, really, what I was meaning was that I think that the few shortages in ICs, it's a multi, multi-quarter situation before we really feel that anything you order has normal lead times as it used to in the past. Other elements of the supply chain that were more related to either lockdowns or maybe labor shortages or some shortage in materials, I think those recover more quickly and that's built into our outlook for the year where we see this progressive improvement through the rest of the year. Vivek Arya : All right. And for my follow-up, maybe Doug, one on gross margins, kind of two parts to it. I'm very curious, others in the semiconductor industry have been able to raise prices and pass along almost every kind of cost inflation, right? You look at the gross margins for all the semiconductor companies, they are doing better than before. So what has prevented the equipment makers to pass along these higher costs if demand is so strong and so high? Like do you have flexibility to raise prices in the future, right, to recover these costs? And are there certain aspects of costs that are more structural in nature that could prevent Lam from recovering the three or four points, I think, the delta in gross margins that you should be operating at, at these revenue levels? Doug Bettinger : Yeah. No, Vivek. Nothing, like, restricts us from adjusting pricing or doing that. I mean, there's a cadence with which you talk to customers about things, how your output's improving, my inflation is doing X, Y and Z, we need to work through this together. But nothing restricts us from doing that. And we have done some, right? It's not as if we haven't done some of that. We have. New things have emerged. I mean, freight rates continue to be a challenge. That should get better. I mean, frankly, it's back to what I said earlier. The costs that are more permanent in nature, we're going to get paid for. The stuff that is transitory, we got to kind of work our way through managing the cost. We have a responsibility to do both and we are doing both. I wouldn't want you, in the long term, to think of our profitability objectives any different than we've communicated them before, right? We're 300 basis points where we want to be, 250 to 300, and we're going to go work our way back to that level. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, look, I understand it's a very fluid environment and things are getting worse, and I get what happened in the quarter. But I guess looking forward, given the overall environment is tougher, are you taking that higher level of potential caution in line when you're actually giving your guidance? Maybe a better way to ask is, do you feel better about your June guidance now at this point versus how you felt about your \u2013 when you gave your March quarter guidance in December? Like do you have more confidence in that June quarter outlook versus how you felt about the prior guidance, just given the deterioration in the broader environment? And how are you taking that into account? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Stacy, I'll try first and then Tim can then add. We never communicated some numbers we intend to miss, let me describe that. To the best of our ability, we comprehend risk, opportunity. I look at ranges. I look at things that could happen. Frankly, what happened in March is things got worse than we expected in the supply chain. Some things we didn't anticipate. Just they got somewhat worse, right? And do I feel like the number I just gave you, the $4.2 billion is a good number? I do, based on everything I see and the linearity of shipments and what we're doing with the supply chain and all the task force we have working through things with suppliers. As I sit here today, I\u2019m -- I have confidence in that number or we wouldn\u2019t have given it to you. So things can change though and that's what happened to us last quarter. We're working real hard to ensure that, that doesn't happen in June, and I don't expect it to. I don't know, Tim, anything you want to add on? Tim Archer : No, I think I would just reiterate, I mean, the amount of focus and attention and effort and investment to ensure that we're recovering the supply chain and recovering our output and supporting our customers has never been higher. And so, I think, that as Doug said, we have confidence that we have a good line of sight to the numbers that we -- and the tools and the parts and everything that's needed to make that up, and that's what we plan to go execute. Stacy Rasgon : All right. Thank you, guys. For my follow-up, understanding you're obviously shipping below apparent demand and demand is obviously strong, do you have any way to quantify the gap between the apparent demand that is out there and your ability to supply that data? I mean, like is it -- is demand 20% above where you're able to ship right now? Is it more? Is it -- any kind of quantification or color you can give on somewhat above and beyond just where the deferred revenue is sitting? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Stacy, that's why we give you an annual WFE outlook, because that actually is a proxy in some ways for what demand on the entire industry looks like to the best of our ability. That's why we try to communicate it and that's the $100 billion, still somewhat supply-limited, though, as Tim said. We think demand is actually so much stronger than that. But the WFE is what we're -- when we give you that annual number, that's what we're trying to help you think or see what we're seeing, I guess, is what I would say. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Stacy. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please, go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is for Tim or Doug. It seems like Lam has been more impacted by the supply constraints versus your large-cap peers. And is this because you're a dep etch company? So due to the vacuum nature, more complex components the dep etch products have, you're more impacted? And if so, whenever the supply eases, do you think there's a pent-up demand for dep etch equipment relative to like process control or CMP or Epi, since it seems like your customers are buying whatever tools they can get their hands on? So I'm kind of curious, would love to hear your thoughts on that. And then I had a follow-up. Tim Archer : Okay. So it's a good question. I mean, obviously, I can't speak in great detail to other people's supply chains, but ours is quite complex. And it's just as you said, we -- if you think about etch and deposition equipment, it has a lot of requirements for very complicated gas delivery systems, vacuum systems, power generation and delivery systems. And those things not only require, as we talked about, a lot of ICs and control capabilities, but also just a tremendous amount of subsystem fabrication, high-purity gas line fabrication, a lot of complexity there. And so, I don't know if we are or are not uniquely impacted in that way. But clearly, we are focused on shoring up each of those areas where we see impact. And as I mentioned, the main point is where we can find qualification of additional suppliers who can meet our requirements for the parts and quality that's needed, then we're qualifying those and that increases our capacity. Over the long run, what it also does is, it gives us flexibility.  As I look forward, this investment we're making today to increase the resilience of our supply chain will pay off in the long term because we'll have more suppliers. We'll have suppliers in the regions closer to where our factories are. And I think in the future, that's going to give us some ability to respond to demand in a much more cost-effective way as well. And so, to the long-term gross margin, as I think about that, the investments we're making today are actually good from that perspective. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. Thanks, Tim. And then a follow-up for you Tim is, clearly it seems like everyone is in the same boat. Constrain that supply demand is much better than supply. But do you think there are like any market share shifts happening currently due to supply constrained misses, or do your customers take a much longer time to make the shared decisions compared to the last nine months or so, supply-constrained environment we've been living with? Tim Archer : Well, I think obviously, it's hard to speak to what the customers would do, but it is very difficult to -- most of these decisions on pooling, the process qualification work is all done far in advance of the production needs. And so, I think part of the reason why everybody is feeling so stressed in this environment, from customers to equipment suppliers, maybe even to our own suppliers, is all of those parts, choices and tooling choices are made very far in advance, and to requalify is incredibly difficult.  And that's even why our output recovery timing is longer -- is taking longer than we might have anticipated. It takes a while to qualify an alternative supplier. I think the same thing would be true for customers and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. So, a long way of saying, I don't believe you're seeing market share shifts in this near term due to these capacity constraints. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks a lot, Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Krish. Operator : We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I had two. Just one, maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way, but you called out reliant and spares as being the big source of the miss. I guess, versus the midpoint, you missed by 200 in March and June. I think CBG is down like 80 and products down. So maybe just -- maybe I'm not understanding why reliant is the biggest issue? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Blayne, maybe you misunderstood us. We didn't intend to communicate that. I didn't specifically say we missed because of one thing or another. Frankly, we missed because of supply chain constraints for equipment across the board that's in new equipment. It's also in the Reliant product line in CSBG as well as upgrades in CSBG. So it's across all of that is what we tried to, maybe not very well, but that's what we tried to communicate. Blayne Curtis : Got you. And then just a broader question. I think everybody's asked everything they can on the supply constraints. I'm just kind of curious, I don't expect you to be the only one, you haven\u2019t than this quarter already and you went first. I'm assuming this is going to be a massive supply chain problem for your customers.  And I'm just curious if you've seen any indications that they've pushed their capacity addition plans out to the right as well. I don't know everybody is going to try to figure out like the last question asked, in terms of how each company lines up? And I'm just kind of curious how things are handled. Do you think they'll just take whatever equipment they can and try to piece it together, or do you -- will you see capacity additions kind of push commensurate with the equipment they can't get? Tim Archer : I guess the simplest way for us to answer it is that, we've seen no change in demand or no change in the pressure we receive from customers to deliver to their original schedule. And so that's why when we look at the investments we're making to try to accelerate recovery of our output to meet their demands, that's because their demand has not changed at all. To your point of, will they take different tools at different times, I think that there's a lot of things that we're working on with customers to try to meet their capacity constraints if we can't get them the tooling on the exact date they want. We talked about accelerated installs. I talked about increasing like services to get a little bit more output from tools they might have already installed into that fab. I think there's just a lot of partnership and creativity going into how to work through these constraints over the next -- that have existed for a couple of quarters and likely will continue to exist as we move through the next couple. Blayne Curtis : Thanks Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks Blayne. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mark Lipacis : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have just one. Do you guys have a view about what industry capacity in wafers is going to grow this year or next year based on the wafer fab equipment expectations you have? Obviously, there's a debate out there about how much capacity could come online, given the magnitude today of wafer fab equipment versus five or seven years ago. So, I was wondering if you had a view on that. If you don't have a view for the industry, I'm wondering if you have a view for maybe a set or a subset of your largest customers, if you have some kind of sense about what wafer capacity is growing this year and next year. Doug Bettinger : Mark, I'll talk maybe a little bit about this year. These aren't numbers we normally give out. But I would tell you, when I look across the totality where investments are occurring, I see wafer capacity growing everywhere, almost everywhere; in memory, in foundry, in logic and probably across nearly every process node in foundry as well, right? I mean, things are tight. The ICs we're trying to get are across every different process node and everybody is investing to try to get caught up with demand. So, while we don't share those numbers, I think everything is ticking up somewhat or trying to anyway, based on the investment plans they have. Mark Lipacis : Got you. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, thanks Mark. Operator, we'll do one more question and then I think we're about out of time. Operator : Okay. We'll take our last question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Doug, in January, I believe you guys were talking about growth in wafer fab equipment next year. With all the scenarios going on with global GDP contraction and macro corrections and even recession next year, curious what your thoughts are about WFE next year? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Atif, you know we don't do more than one year at a time. I mean, clearly, you've got a softening in the economy for a variety of different reasons. And I do observe when we look across all of the semi industry, the more consumer-oriented kind of consumption in semis is probably softening a little bit. Smartphone units aren't as strong perhaps as we thought. PC is probably the same thing. High-performance computing is still very strong. So, it's kind of what I see happening. When Tim and the sales guys talk to our customers though, everybody is full steam ahead with their investment plans in terms of equipment. So that's what I see. I'm not going to quite tell you at 2023 yet. But the fact that we're under shipping what customers want this year, that stuff's I know is going to roll into next year. So sit tight. We'll talk about 2023 as we get a little further through the year. Atif Malik : I understand. As a follow-up, I get the component and the subsystem supply constraints. Are you seeing impact to your shipments from material shortages like neon and coolant using etch and deposition tools are the \u2013 is availability of those materials impacting your shipments or your customers have enough buffer on those materials? Tim Archer : So far, it's \u2013 I would say that, we haven't identified those yet as significant constraints. But we're obviously watching every new issue that comes up and assessing its impact. But so far, we wouldn't identify those as key issues right now. Atif Malik : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Thank you, Atif. Operator, that's about it for time for us. Appreciate everybody joining us on the call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Tina Correia. Please go ahead. Tina Correia : Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will share our overview on the business environment and we will review our financial results for the June 2022 quarter and our outlook for the September 2022 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 p.m. Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the accompanying slides in the presentation. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 p.m. Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tina. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Lam\u2019s June quarter results were much stronger than we originally anticipated. Revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share achieved new quarterly records and we are well ahead of our guidance for the quarter. Industry-wide shortages continue to impact output and the efficiency of our operations. However, specific actions we have taken in our supply chain in recent quarters are allowing us to execute more effectively in the supply-constrained environment. I want to thank our global Lam teams, including our supply chain operations and engineering groups as well as our suppliers and customers for demonstrating incredible dedication, agility and partnership in the face of significant challenges. In the June quarter, we continued to see good momentum with our product and installed base initiatives with foundry logic systems and CSPG revenues both reaching new highs. Our performance this quarter adds to my confidence that Lam will emerge from this period of industry disruption, stronger, more resilient and even better positioned in our markets. As suggested by our guidance today, we expect to see incremental improvement in supply chain conditions in the September quarter, but our view is that industry-wide output will continue to be constrained through the rest of this year. Consequently, we are lowering our outlook for calendar year 2022 wafer fab equipment spending to be in the low to mid-$90 billion range. Overall, semiconductor demand remains robust, but with some macro-driven pockets of weakness, particularly in consumer-focused markets. We see strong foundry logic spending outgrowing both NAND and DRAM investments. In the longer term, we expect industry growth to be driven by the increasingly vital role semiconductors play in the global economy. This, along with expanding semiconductor content in end devices, rising device complexity and larger die sizes will help sustain strong WFE levels. Most importantly, for Lam, technology inflections will continue to drive greater etch and deposition intensity. Across our company, we have been prioritizing investments to benefit from these trends and prepare for the growth ahead. Over the last 2 years, Lam has devoted significant attention to the disruptions that have impacted semiconductor ecosystem, but at the same time, we have used this period to accelerate a strategic transformation of our operations and product focus. We have significantly expanded Lam\u2019s capabilities and resources closer to our customers and ecosystem partners, both in the U.S. and globally to deepen collaboration, accelerate the introduction of new products and drive greater operational flexibility. Compared to pre-pandemic times, Lam now has a more globally diverse manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, designed to leverage unique regional capabilities while servicing worldwide demand. A notable example is Lam\u2019s new Malaysia facility, which takes our manufacturing, supply chain and logistics operations to the next level in terms of scale, automation and efficiency. Over the last 2 years, we have also increased our technology infrastructure investments across the U.S., Asia and Europe, which has included a new development center in Korea and a soon to open engineering lab in India. Our vision is to be the premier technology collaboration partner in the ecosystem, leveraging Lam innovation to bring customers, suppliers, peer companies and consortia, together to create disruptive solutions for the industry\u2019s grand challenges. Productivity and extendability of EUV patterning has been one such area of focus. And in the June quarter, we announced that SK Hynix has selected Lam\u2019s innovative dry resist fabrication technology as a development tool of record for two key steps in the patterning process for advanced DRAM chips. We also announced the expansion of partnerships within the EUV ecosystem. In collaboration with Entegris and Gelest, we look to provide our customers with reliable access to precursor chemicals for Lam\u2019s dry photoresist technology. Together, we will also be working to accelerate the development of dry resist solutions for high numerical aperture EUV patterning. With customers, we are using data-driven equipment intelligence solutions to deepen our engagements. An enormous amount of equipment and process data is being generated from our installed base. And together with customers, we are using key learnings to drive fab productivity. Lam\u2019s Sense.i platform was launched in early 2020 with the goal of combining Lam\u2019s innovative equipment intelligence solutions with our market-leading edge technology. The Vantex dielectric etch system built on the Sense.i platform has seen tremendous momentum since launch and has become the fastest ramping etch tool in Lam history. We expect the installed base for this product to approximately triple this year alone. Furthermore, we are seeing increased demand for Lam solutions in new advanced packaging architectures. Our Kiyo plasma etch products with Hydro have a proven record of delivering the productivity and uniformity requirements needed for cost effective front-end device scaling. Leveraging this expertise in high-volume manufacturing, we have now achieved multiple new etch tool of record positions for advanced packaging at a leading foundry logic customer. As customers further develop these architectures in support of greater system performance, we see a growing opportunity for Lam\u2019s etch and deposition solutions. And the final element in our transformation over the past several years relates to our emerging leadership in sustainability. In late June, we released our 2021 ESG report where we outlined how we integrate ESG throughout our operations. We are proud that we were one of the first in the semiconductor industry to set a net zero emissions goal. I encourage you to review the report to see the great progress we are making across several important areas, including environmental sustainability and our commitment to diversity and inclusion in our workforce. So in summary, I am very pleased with the solid results posted by the company for the June quarter. Our results are an indication of our strong business foundation built on a large and growing installed base, a differentiated product portfolio and a commitment to ecosystem-wide collaboration and success. We are in a great spot to benefit as secular drivers push the semiconductor industry to new heights over time. Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. I am pleased to share our June quarter results with you today. We had our second consecutive fiscal year of record levels of revenue and diluted earnings per share. Revenues increased year-over-year for the fiscal year by over 17% and diluted earnings per share rose by more than 21%. We delivered solid performance in the June 2022 quarter. Our results across all financial metrics came in at the high end or above our guidance ranges due to our improved execution and the continued strong demand for our equipment. June quarter revenue was a record at $4.64 billion, which was an increase of more than 14% over the prior quarter and over the high-end of the guidance range. While we are making progress on addressing the supply chain challenges we\u2019ve previously talked about, it will take more time for them to be fully resolved. Despite the supply chain improvements and higher factory output levels, we still exited the June quarter with $2.2 billion in deferred revenue, which was an increase of $129 million sequentially. From a segment perspective, memory represented 54% of systems revenue in the June quarter, which was down from the prior quarter level of 66%. The NAND segment came in at 40% percent of our systems revenue, which was roughly consistent with the prior quarter. Our NAND customers are investing in tools for 17x layer and beyond devices. On the DRAM side, revenues were 14% of systems revenue, which is a decline from the prior quarter level of 27%. DRAM investments are focused on the 1z and 1-alpha node addition and conversions. In the Foundry segment, June quarter revenues increased quarter-over-quarter and represented 26% of our systems revenue compared with 21% in the March quarter. The increase is related to the timing of customer investments with broad-based spending across both leading as well as specialty node devices. The Logic and Other segment had record performance in the June quarter coming in at 20% of systems revenue higher than the March quarter amount of 13%. Our performance here not only reflects the demand in the market for microprocessors, analog components, image sensors, and advanced packaging solutions, but it also demonstrates the progress we are making in the leading-edge foundry logic inflections that Tim talked about earlier. Let me now turn to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 31% of total revenue, which was flat with the March quarter percentage. China domestic customers were the majority of the China regional revenue in the June quarter. There was also a strong concentration of investments by our customers in the Korea and Taiwan regions, which comprised 24% and 19% of our total revenues respectively in the June quarter. The Customer Support Business Group revenue was also a record at approximately $1.6 billion which was up 16% from the prior quarter level and 18% higher than the June quarter in calendar 2021. There was strength across all parts of CSBG, but notably in spares with our customers\u2019 fabs running at high utilization levels as well as in our Reliant business, with customers investing in specialty market areas such as RF and power devices. While quarter-on-quarter growth rates in CSBG can vary based on customer investment patterns, I believe CSBG is well positioned to again deliver annual growth in 2022. Let me now pivot to our gross margin performance. The June quarter came in at 45.2% above the midpoint of the guided range. Our fixed cost absorption improved somewhat with the higher output levels. However, we continue to have cost challenges in the areas of freight and logistics, semiconductors as well as in other critical components. We will continue to drive progress on improving our operational efficiencies. However, we expect inflationary pressures to be a persistent headwind in the second half of the year. Our September quarter guidance embeds our views on these factors. Operating expenses for June were $635 million, up slightly from March quarter. The increase was mainly in R&D across all of our business units as we are investing in development of technologies to support our customer\u2019s long-term roadmaps as well as to mitigate some of the supply chain challenges we are having. The June quarter operating margin was 31.5% coming in over the guidance range as a result of the stronger than expected revenue performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11%, generally in line with our expectations. We estimate the tax rate for calendar year \u201822 to be in the low-teens level. This estimate doesn\u2019t reflect any impact of any potential U.S. tax policy changes. And this is obviously something we continue to monitor closely and we will update you as appropriate. And just to remind you, as we have discussed in the past, you should expect the tax rate to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $87 million in expense consistent with what we noted on our call last quarter as well as what was included in the June quarter guidance. We had an increase in expense this quarter related to market declines in one our venture investments that recently went public. The OI&E P&L line item is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility due to items such as foreign exchange as well as impacts in the equity markets. We continue to execute on our capital return objectives during the June allocating $868 million towards share repurchases. We paid $208 million in dividends. Our share repurchase activity was a combination of open market repurchases as well as an accelerated share repurchase program. This ASR will continue to execute during the September quarter. I\u2019d also like to highlight that since calendar year 2012, when we brought Lam and Novellus together, we have returned approximately 115% or more than $20 billion of our free cash flow to equity holders. Our stated plan is to return 75% to 100% of free cash flow through a combination of buyback and dividends. June quarter diluted earnings per share, was $8.83. Diluted share count was 138 million shares, which was lower than the March quarter and lower than our June quarter expectation due to the increase in share repurchase activity. Let me turn to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $3.9 billion, which was down from $4.6 billion at the end of the March quarter. The decrease in the cash position was attributed to our capital return activity as well as our usage of cash for growth in working capital as well as continuing capital investments. We increased the level of inventory we are carrying to support our growing business volumes. Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter level coming in at 2.6x. Days sales outstanding come in at 85 days, which was essentially flat with the March quarter. It again was a somewhat back-end weighted shipment quarter. Non-cash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $70 million for equity compensation, $69 million in depreciation and $19 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the June quarter came in at $126 million, down by roughly $20 million from the March quarter level. Capital expenditures are supporting the company growth in manufacturing in multiple geographies, including the United States and Malaysia as well as research and development infrastructure investment in California, Oregon as well as our new technology center in Korea. We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,700 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 800 people from the prior quarter. We had headcount growth, primarily in the factory and field organizations to address the higher output levels, to manage supply chain constraints as well as to support increasing customer delivery and installation. Looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2022 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $4.9 billion plus or minus $300 million; gross margin of 45%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This gross margin outlook reflects ongoing inflationary challenges that we are seeing in the supply chain. Operating margins of 31.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $9.50 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 137 million shares. So then in summary, Lam demonstrated an improved operational execution in the June quarter and delivered record financial performance both quarterly as well as on a fiscal year basis. While the semiconductor industry is not immune from softening macro factors that we see, Lam\u2019s technology leadership, along with our robust installed base is a solid foundation for continued long-term growth for the company. And with that, operator, I will conclude my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call and take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and great job on the strong operational execution. As you mentioned in your prepared remarks, we have seen weakness materialize in the consumer-focused segments of the market, so PCs, smartphones, gaming. For your memory customers, that accounts for about 55% of their total revenue. So they are being disciplined here in the second half and into next year. They are focused on supply side discipline, a lower profile of CapEx spending. And then on the flipside, Foundry and Logic and IDM customers are seeing, I think a bit more diversified set of drivers, where demand is still relatively healthy. So given that your lead times are stretching into next year, if your customer base is becoming more cautious on the macro demand environment, I assume that they are modulating their orders down for shipments next year. Have you started to see this in your profile of your recent orders? And then maybe more near to mid-term, have you guys seen any major changes in cancellations or push-outs on scheduled deliveries for this year? Tim Archer : Okay. I will take that question, Harlan. It\u2019s \u2013 I think, as you said, we clearly are seeing some weaknesses in certain parts of the market, and we have customers in the memory space and others have been publicly sounding the tone on being a little bit more cautious about their CapEx and spending going forward. I believe that we\u2019ve also been saying, though, for several quarters now that we believe the memory customers have generally been quite disciplined in their spending and how they look at the market. I think it\u2019s one of the things that has made that particular segment of the industry quite healthy in recent years, and that is that they respond fairly quickly to changes that they see in pricing and in demand. So that\u2019s something I think we\u2019ve become accustomed to dealing with. Frankly, what I\u2019d say though on the demand side is that we really haven\u2019t seen any significant change in the demand signals from our customers. And some of that could be, as you pointed out, that lead times remain stretched and I think people want to take some time to look at how this market is evolving from different drivers. But we certainly acknowledge that \u201823, there is a fair bit of uncertainty and there are different scenarios that could play out. But I think that Lam is well prepared to execute through whichever those scenarios actually transpire. Doug Bettinger : Yes. The only thing I might add, Harlan, is we know how to run the company whatever the environment is. We\u2019ve been doing it for a really long time. We know what the playbook needs to be. When it\u2019s up, down or sideways, we will respond accordingly. And then when I think about the things Tim talked about, our positions are in stronger. We feel really good about the business we\u2019re winning, the growing installed base, the company is executing really well. That\u2019s the stuff we feel great about. At the end of the day, the market will be what the market will be, and we will manage the company in the right way depending on whatever that looks like. Harlan Sur : Yes. Great insights. Thanks for that. And then supply chain-wise, I mean, the team did a great job of unlocking more component availability and subsystems availability given the strong upside in June. So given more availability, do you anticipate deferred revenues coming down in the September quarter as a part of your strong revenue guidance? And where are you seeing the biggest supply improvement? Is it component availability? Is it subsystems availability, freight and logistics or maybe all of the above? Tim Archer : Yes, I\u2019ll take the first part and let Doug speak specifically maybe the deferred revenue. I think that we talked in the last couple of calls about having somewhere in the order of about 40 task forces deployed out to our critical customers. So we said the constraints were pretty broad-based. I mean clearly, things like IC component shortages have gotten a lot of attention. But instead it was broader than that. We\u2019ve seen improvements across a number of those constrained commodities. But we still have constraints. And that\u2019s \u2013 you see it in how we\u2019re still spending, managing our supply chain in the numbers Doug talked about and also in the fact that deferred revenue actually continue to grow a little bit in the June quarter. So we\u2019re nowhere near to where I would say that the supply chain overall is executing like it had in the past. But we\u2019ve seen kind of broad improvements as a result, we think of specific actions Lam has taken. And I\u2019ll let Doug talk about the September deferred revenue. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Harlan, it\u2019s hard enough to forecast a revenue number, let alone the deferred. But if I was going to give you some color around it, I kind of think it\u2019s flattish, plus or minus a little bit. And again, it will depend on how well we progress with the supply chain, honestly. Harlan Sur : Great. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thank you, Harlan. Operator : We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. So I had a question just on overall WFE. So Tim and Doug, you beat on June, you\u2019re guiding better in September, and you\u2019re getting a little bit, a bit of improvement in terms of some of these constraints, yet the full year WFE is coming down a bit. So can you sort of square that a little bit. Is some of that maybe some demand driven that\u2019s bringing the year down or is even that mid-90s still a supply-constrained number? Tim Archer : Yes, Tim, it\u2019s \u2013 in our view, it\u2019s primarily an adjustment we\u2019ve made based on supply constraints and challenges. Since we gave our last guidance, which we had put at $100 billion of WFE, not only have we seen kind of how we\u2019re performing, but we\u2019ve also heard from others in the industry. And so we have to \u2013 in trying to give a WFE number look to how the entire industry is executing and not just how Lam is performing. And so we felt it prudent to lower that WFE outlook based on what look to be still a lot of industry-wide constraints. And so from a demand perspective, as I just said in the last answer, I really haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change that\u2019s really embedded in that lowering of WFE. There is always some tools and projects that move around. But right now, as you see with our deferred revenue and the fact that we\u2019re not meeting all demand, if anybody slides out a little bit, somebody else is sliding right into that slot. So we\u2019re fully utilized at this point at the numbers we just gave. Timothy Arcuri : Got it. Got it. Awesome. Thank you. And then, Doug, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask about gross margin, someone\u2019s going to ask about it. So I guess it\u2019ll be me. So can you just\u2026 Doug Bettinger : Go ahead, Tim. Timothy Arcuri : Sorry, Doug. Can you just \u2013 can you walk us through sort of maybe quantify the headwinds? And would we be at 48%, 48.5% if sort of absent some of these headwinds, can you sort of like normalize all that for us? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim, the way I\u2019ve been describing it actually for a while now is the long-term profitability model of the company is unchanged. My expectation of where we\u2019re going to perform isn\u2019t any different than it was pre-pandemic, pre-inflation coming through. The inflationary stuff that\u2019s permanent. We got to work on getting fairly paid for and the stuff that\u2019s temporary, maybe we get paid for a little bit, but then we got to go on the cost back. And so what was embedded in a financial model that we gave, I guess, over 2.5 years ago or something was kind of 200 basis points above where we are guiding right now, and that\u2019s still the way you should think about the long-term profitability of where we\u2019re going to drive the business. Tim Archer : And Tim, the only thing I would add on that point is there is a \u2013 there are a lot of questions obviously coming about is the industry slowing or there are some pockets that are going to ease up think if that\u2019s the case, some of the things that are headwinds to us in gross margin right now. I mean, a lot of the expedites and premiums that we\u2019re paying on things like ICs, you would expect those to begin to moderate if some of the outlooks are that some of this demand either gets caught up or maybe or slows down a bit going forward. So I think there is room for gross margin improvement, as Doug said, over the longer run. Timothy Arcuri : Definitely, yes. It\u2019s a natural hedge. Thank you very much. Tim Archer : Yes, thanks, Tim. Operator : We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. A follow-up question on gross margins. Your favorite subject, Doug, would love to isolate just on your factory ramp in Malaysia. Can you speak to how that\u2019s going, whether that\u2019s a headwind or beginning to be a tailwind for you? And how we should think about that escalating into a real tailwind for you guys? Is that a first half \u201823, second half, \u201823 or later type of story? Doug Bettinger : Maybe I\u2019ll let Tim talk about how the ramp is going and I\u2019ll describe the numbers a little bit, C.J. Tim Archer : Okay. Yes, sure. So C.J. is actually just out there not too long ago. I\u2019d say from an execution perspective and a lot of the improvement we\u2019re looking at, I\u2019d say the Malaysia ramp is going extremely well. We\u2019re still in a ramping phase there, still in the mode of building out and developing the supply chain. Some of that, especially the supply chain development might be a little bit behind where we would have wanted to be at the volumes. And that\u2019s simply because supply chain globally is struggling to ramp. And whether that\u2019s raw materials or component shortages or labor. But I think it\u2019s coming up very nicely. And I think what Doug gives you the answer about how it contributes, I mean, what we have to remember is that Malaysia is ramping at the same time as we\u2019re ramping all of our global facilities. And so perhaps in the short run, you\u2019re seeing an easily isolatable impact of Malaysia because we\u2019re ramping all other global factories at the same time. But from a ramp perspective, I couldn\u2019t be happier that right now with the scale of output and the efficiency I see starting to come out of that facility. Doug Bettinger : Yes. And then C.J., just how to think about the numbers. I think maybe a year ago, I was talking about it being somewhat of a headwind to gross margin. It really isn\u2019t any longer. We\u2019re kind of at the point where it\u2019s neutral-ish. And as Tim just told you, we\u2019re ramping everywhere as eventually that will be the biggest factor in the network. And as it gets to be a bigger percentage of the total, it will become a benefit to gross margin, not just from cost of labor, but the fact that our freight lanes will be shorter and the supply chain will move along with us. So I\u2019ll keep you updated as we progress. Tim Archer : Yes. I think actually just \u2013 I want to emphasize that one point Doug just made because in my prepared remarks, I made this comment about part of our strategic transformation over the last couple of years was to put capabilities closer to where they ultimately need to be. And that\u2019s \u2013 in the case of development, closer to customers. And in the case of the factories closer to supply chains and also customers. And in a period when we\u2019re seeing high freight and logistics costs, I mean, I think that ultimately having a large factory close to our customers in Asia is going to be a big benefit for us. So that was a very conscious decision. And I think it\u2019s going to pay off as \u2013 we don\u2019t know when freight and logistics costs normalize, but that\u2019s a hedge against those remaining high for a while. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. As my follow-up, I guess I was hoping you could speak a bit to Reliant. And to clarify, do you include Reliant when you break out the percentage of exposure logic, foundry memory? And then, I guess, bigger picture there, the trends you\u2019re seeing, particularly as it relates to 200-millimeter 40-nanometer and above and domestic China. Can you kind of walk through the trends you\u2019re seeing there? Thanks so much. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I\u2019ll take the beginning, and then I\u2019ll let Tim take the second part. Yes. C.J., when I talk about the percent of systems revenue in my scripted remarks, that includes Reliant as well as the more leading-edge equipment that we\u2019re selling. So it\u2019s all conclusive in terms of system revenue. Tim Archer : Yes. I think just in terms of markets \u2013 end markets and the demand, I mean, I think we can speak as a user of many of those chips where we still see severe constraints and also very high premiums for those chips in the marketplace. I think customers are investing to try to alleviate what today is clearly a mismatch in terms of supply and demand. And that\u2019s across all different types of applications. I mean when I look at the list of ICs that that we\u2019re looking for just as one user, it\u2019s a broad list from a very broad number of manufacturers. So it\u2019s hard for me to pin it down, but I feel like today, we\u2019re still in a pretty broadly expanding and growing market. C.J. Muse: Thanks so much. Tim Archer : Thanks, C.J. Yes. You bet. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about any potential for export controls. There is been some press focus really on some incremental controls on exports to China for advanced logic and things like that. Do you guys get any kind of sense for what\u2019s coming on the pike there and how that might affect you? Tim Archer : Yes, Joe. So to tell you, we were recently notified that there was like \u2013 there was to be a broadening of the restrictions of technology shipments to China for fabs that are operating below 14-nanometer. And so that\u2019s the change I think that people have been thinking might be coming. And our \u2013 we\u2019re prepared to fully comply. We\u2019re working with the U.S. government and any impact on Lam\u2019s business it\u2019s contemplated in the September guidance that we just gave. Doug Bettinger : September guidance as well as the full year WFE outlook, Joe. Joe Moore : Great. And that \u2013 is a 14-nanometer logic that doesn\u2019t include DRAM? Tim Archer : Yes, to the best of our understanding, it\u2019s foundry focused, yes. Joe Moore : Okay. Thank you very much. Tim Archer : Yes. Thanks, Joe. Operator : We will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the drivers within the customer service business, particularly around strength in spare parts and 200-millimeter tools? I\u2019m just trying to get some feeling for those pieces, especially just given the broader environment and some of the other news that we\u2019ve heard around the macro and potential customer order cuts and things like that? Tim Archer : Okay. I\u2019ll take the first shot at that. The \u2013 maybe as best to step back and just remind everybody, the CSBG business is comprised of four components, spares, services, upgrades and Reliant. One of the nice things about this business and what said we really like about it is those often kind of move in somewhat of a non-correlated way. I mean, spares clearly just moves with our installed base. And as I look forward, lot of people wondering what does 2023 look like, we\u2019re not going to give guidance, but one thing we always feel pretty comfortable about is we have a very strong equipment shipment year this year. There will be a lot more tools requiring spares and consumables next year. And so that part of the business, it grows. And in fact, what we\u2019ve said is, as devices become more complex, and our applications become more critical, the fact that the need for spares and the importance of spares just continues to grow. So spares is just a robust and growing. The services business has been also strong. I talked about the shift in strategic transformation we\u2019re making towards more equipment intelligence type services. And as customers kind of look forward, if customers start focusing on productivity and costs and really trying to squeeze the output from their fabs without having to spend additional CapEx, they turn to things like productivity services, results-based contracts, use of data off of the tools. So I think services has been doing well. And I think can continue to do well even in an environment where maybe you see a little bit of impact of macro or spending pulled back. Same for upgrades. Upgrades business actually, I\u2019ve often said over the years that upgrades tend not to do so well when customers are busy adding lots of capacity because they are actually adding capacity, new tools really focused on that. if they pull back a little bit, the way they save CapEx and still manage their technology road maps as they turn to upgrades and tech conversions. And so the upgrades business gets a little bit stronger. And so that business, we think, can continue to do well and maybe even improve in next year\u2019s environment. And then Reliant, as we just said, a lot of catch-up to do I think there have been significant underinvestment for quite some time in that area as evidenced by the fact that many of us can\u2019t get the chips that we actually need to meet demand. And so there is some catch-up still there. Eventually, maybe that gets caught up we don\u2019t really have a view on when that fully happens. It\u2019s a very diverse set of end markets and application drivers. So it\u2019s hard to predict. But clearly, at some point, it probably moderates in terms of growth, and it\u2019s back more towards the steady grower tied kind of to the overall application expansion in the economy that we\u2019ve seen for in past years. Stacy Rasgon : I guess maybe I should have asked more explicitly what drove the sequential strength in services? So which one of these pieces was the biggest? Doug Bettinger : It was both spares as well as Reliant, that\u2019s why I called that out in my script, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Got it. Thank you. For my follow-up, I\u2019m going to ask \u2013 this is going to come across a little snarky, but I think I\u2019m going to ask it anyways. I get the inflationary pressures on gross margins. But all of your customers seem at this point to be inflation proof in terms of their input costs going up and their ability to pass the long out. Why aren\u2019t you? Tim Archer : So Stacy, I think \u2013 and I\u2019ve been saying this, I think, for a quarter or two. I don\u2019t want you to believe that we\u2019re not raising prices, because we are. I think maybe to our detriment, inflation has been bigger, stronger, more pronounced than we expected that it would be, honestly. And there is some latency to kind of renegotiating prices and whatnot, and that\u2019s very much what\u2019s going on. And it wasn\u2019t a star comment. I get the comment all the time. It\u2019s an appropriate comment. We\u2019re working on getting fairly compensated for what we need to and we will. Stacy Rasgon : So how much of a driver do you think of I\u2019m looking at like a year or two as that latency goes away? I mean, is it 100 bps? Is it more like how much can we be or is that what helps you kind of get back to the model range? Tim Archer : Yes. It\u2019s what helps us get back to the model range. What I said earlier is the long-term profitability expectation for the company is unchanged, even though we\u2019re working our way through this inflationary environment, it\u2019s probably 200 basis points from where we are to where we need to be. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Okay, thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Tim Archer : Yes. Stacy, thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. The first one for Doug. Clearly, the last several quarters have been really strong. You\u2019ve grown your headcount a lot. Hypothetically speaking, if next year was down in terms of revenue, say, 5% or 10%, how should we think about the earnings model and operating leverage? And then I had a follow-up for Tim. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Krish, I guess the best thing I would point you to is just look at the history of the company\u2019s performance over the last decade, right? We know how to run the company in an up environment, in a down environment, we have a highly variable cost model here. We employ temporary resources, we outsource things. The best thing I would point to is just look at the last downturn and the same management team running the company, we will do the same things. It\u2019s a well-worn playbook that we know how to dust off and use when we need to. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Fair enough, Doug. And then a question for Jim, maybe this is the first time. I\u2019m noticing you\u2019ll talk about advanced packaging on the earnings deck. I\u2019m kind of curious on your advanced packaging strategy. Some of your peers have partnered with back in companies that were looking into panels. How should we think your advanced packaging portfolio should evolve? Are you looking at organic development, M&A or partnership with a back-end company? Tim Archer : Well, I think that we\u2019re looking at \u2013 look, advanced packaging is an important area for Lam to participate in and we have for quite some time. So I actually don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve talked about it because I have to believe we have talked about it in the past. But we\u2019ve talked about it primarily from the standpoint that etch and deposition play an incredibly important role in these new architectures. And we have a strong position, especially in applications like \u2013 well, both the etch as well as the copper electroplating. As form factors change, we look at that as still our market, and therefore, we will evaluate and pursue whatever the best means is to win in those emerging segments, whether that\u2019s organic or inorganic. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks, Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Krish. Operator : We will take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. It\u2019s really nice to see your action in logic and other show up in your numbers in the quarter. To level set, I was hoping you could sort of quantify where you are from a market share standpoint across those markets today vis-\u00e0-vis the corporate average in etch and dep? And where do you see that going in a couple of years, given the current application win funnel? Doug Bettinger : Yes. If you look at logic specifically, it\u2019s probably our lowest exposure across the markets that we described. However, I will remind you, Toshiya that we have been talking about a specific share gain customer that we continue to progress very nicely with, which is part of the strength you saw in the results from June. Tim Archer : Yes. And Toshiya, I guess I would just add, I mean there is a couple of things to think about with respect to the foundry logic space. And one is our exposure is lower from a SAM perspective and has been. But actually, some of the technology inflections that are currently underway are actually allowing us to participate with some of our more advanced equipment to displace some of the older technologies that have typically been used in foundry logic. And so you are seeing a lot of traction for our selective etch. We didn\u2019t list all of the wins this quarter. We continue to see new selections for our selective etch tools. That\u2019s only going to be used at very advanced logic and it\u2019s kind of new markets, new opportunity for us, and we are doing well there. ALD of both dielectrics and metallization used to deal with like the RC inflection, the back-end interconnect inflection. That\u2019s creating opportunities for us. And so I think that we are seeing a little bit of like share gain at certain customers, as Doug mentioned, but also an expansion of our opportunity, and that\u2019s driving a lot of our new product roadmap. We have an objective to improve our position in foundry logic for more advanced notes. Toshiya Hari : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up probably one for you, Tim, just on dry resist, it\u2019s great to see you guys have traction there as well. Obviously, SK hynix is public. I am pretty sure you are working with other customers on this as well. But help us quantify how significant this business or this product could be in a couple of years? And as you partially sort of displace traditional track or coated developers. What percentage of the market do you think you can capture in a couple of years? Thank you. Tim Archer : Okay. Well, I think I don\u2019t want to get out with sort of the new disclosures here, but I think we are \u2013 we have quantified it in the past is roughly about a $1.5 billion opportunity over a 5-year period. And you are just starting to see us \u2013 we talked about development tool of record wins. So, obviously, we are not yet putting this into a production fab and developing revenue, so we would be at the very first stage of that. But that should give you some kind of sense maybe in the next 5 years of kind of revenue impact you are talking about. But this is still a much longer play for us. And I talked about this idea of accelerating the development of the driver is for the high NA EUV. And so if you think EUV is going to be around for the next 10 years, 20 years as the primary patterning capability for advanced logic, then our opportunity just continues to grow throughout that period. So, it starts off in the next 5 years, about $1.5 billion and then just continues to grow with layer count and application. And we think that as you get to high NA EUV, I think it\u2019s we have a good just to capture a lot of the market. Toshiya Hari : And Tim, sorry, when you say 5 years, I know you guys initially talked about the, say, your 2022 Analyst Day, is it 5 years from then or 5 years from today? Tim Archer : Well, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I guess I will just start the clock now because, as I said, we have only reported a development tool of record positions today, obviously, which we haven\u2019t yet started to generate revenue from. So, it\u2019s \u2013 yes, I think you could call it 5 years from today, it\u2019s a safer bet than 5 years from our Analyst Day. Toshiya Hari : Sounds good. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks Toshiya. Operator : We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question for both of you. It looks like Senate has passed the CHIPS Act. Tim, you along with Intel and Micron CEOs, you spoke to Congress in March about the importance of passing this legislation. So, assuming it goes through Congress and the present signs off. Can you talk about what this bill means for the U.S. equipment makers? And Doug, if you can talk about what \u2013 how will it impact Lam in terms of tax breaks or in terms of market share growth in logic foundry areas? Thank you. Tim Archer : Okay. Well, obviously, it\u2019s a significant benefit for the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry overall. I think most directly, what I would say is that Lam\u2019s benefit from this will come in two ways. One is as our customers invest in capabilities in the U.S. and capacity, and obviously, we are hopeful that we will garner a large share of the equipment that\u2019s purchased for those fabs. And so that\u2019s one way in which money is from that flow through ultimately into business for Lam. Specifically, when I was in front of the Senate, one of the things that I talked about is, I think long-term, if you think about long-term improvement for U.S. companies and U.S. semiconductor manufacturing has to do with some of the R&D money that\u2019s in that, I believe, in the CHIPS Act, which is going to fund longer term capabilities that help semiconductor device makers, but also equipment makers develop those next-generation technologies that keep us incredibly competitive on the global stage and allow us to create those technologies without having to necessarily fund and take on all of that risk ourselves as individual companies, which is always hard to do for technologies that might be 7 years, 8 years, 10 years into the future. So, that\u2019s the other way I would say that companies, both device makers and equipment makers can benefit. We need to see all the details, but that\u2019s my financial take. Doug Bettinger : Are there Atif any follow-up? Atif Malik : No, I am good, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay. Alright. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks. I had two questions. First one, is this $4.9 billion that you are guiding to for September? Is this kind of the new quarterly baseline? So, all else being equal, should we expect December sales and gross margins to potentially be flat or up? I appreciate you are not giving December outlook, but is there anything that could make you deviate from this new trend line that you have June stronger and then September even stronger than that? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Vivek, you are right. I am not going to guide the December quarter for you. Listen, I think we are pretty pleased with the progress from a supply chain standpoint we made in the June quarter. It continues to be reflected in the September quarter, barring something new coming up. I think our execution will continue. And that largely has been what has limited the revenue generation of the company. And you see \u2013 you heard me mention the $2.2 billion in deferred revenue. So, that\u2019s there for us to follow-up on. But I am not going to give you a number for December quite yet. Vivek Arya : Understood. And then the second one is just a clarification. What is your sub-14 nanometer exposure to China? I didn\u2019t think there was any or not that much. And do the restrictions apply to just China domestic, or do you think they could apply to the multinationals with fabs in China? Doug Bettinger : At this point, we would assume that it applies to all sub-14 nanometer activity in China. And we are not going to quantify what we might have or had in our plans for sub-14. Vivek Arya : But Tim, just to clarify, September, you said is de-risked, i.e., there is zero sub-14 nanometer China business for you in your September outlook? Doug Bettinger : Vivek, the guidance fully reflects everything that we just described. Vivek Arya : Okay. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Mark Lipacis : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a clarification and a question. The clarification, Tim, I think it was an earlier question about whether you were seeing push-outs or cancellations. It sounded like you said that you are not seeing any impact on your demand, but I just want to make sure I understood your response to that question? And then my question is, can you help us understand the mechanics of your manufacturing operations or how you deal with the slots that you have before you allocate to your different customers as the orders have come in. If somebody \u2013 what kind of latitude do your customers have as they come in and say, well, I don\u2019t know if I want the tool now, I prefer it in three months, do you guys split up slots in the queue, or do you just send people back to the end of the line. If you could just kind of review the mechanics around how you treat the orders as they come in and what happens to customers who ask for the push-outs? That would be helpful. Thank you very much. Tim Archer : Sure. I can try to address both of them. So, yes, just to be clear, my comment was at this point, we have seen no push-outs and changes in demand, no push-outs, no cancellations that are all meaningful. However, I mean I want to acknowledge, I mean it\u2019s with long lead times and stretching through \u201823 and a cautious tone being struck by some of our customers quite publicly. I am not saying that we might not ultimately see those changes come. So, just saying that we have seen none doesn\u2019t mean that, that might not happen. And so at this point at \u2013 the commitments that we have today are being met, and that was what I was trying to signal. I think with those long lead times, it moves into your second question, which is, so what if a customer does come and say they would like to push a project by a few months or even longer or we treat it the same way we are doing right now when customers come and have asked us to pull in the slots. We work with all of our customers to see where people really are in their projects and their demand. And we have not ultimate flexibility within our manufacturing, but I talked about the fact that we are \u2013 we have invested in the last 2 years to try to create greater operational flexibility. And part of it is so that we can respond in that way. I mean we are \u2013 we treat our customers very much like partners and need to push for a couple of months because maybe it\u2019s either demand or likely sometimes if the facilities aren\u2019t quite ready or there is a change in their plans. We have got to work with them and make those adjustments, if it\u2019s possible. Mark Lipacis : Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks Mark. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead. Patrick Ho : Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Doug, maybe for you in terms of the supply chain, obviously, you have seen some improvements in the past quarter that will carry incidents next quarter. Are some of the issues now just related to the quantity of shipments because it\u2019s still going to be a more second half weighted year for you guys. So, even with some of the incremental improvements on the supply chain, it\u2019s now just trying to I guess, continue to keep pace with the high demand levels that you are seeing near-term? And that\u2019s why the deferred revenues are staying at the same levels at least as you are forecasting to the September quarter? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Patrick. That\u2019s clearly part of it, right. We have got unmet demand. We have got partial shipments that shows up as deferred revenue. Each supplier has a unique situation that we are working through with them to the extent that they are not meeting what we need from them. But yes, we increased \u2013 improved the output last quarter, and we see that continuing as we go into September. Patrick Ho : Great. And as a quick follow-up, maybe for Tim. Obviously, you have been working with a leading MPU customer for some time now, and we are starting to see the share gains and the higher quantity of volume as they start ramping new products. But you have been working with them for some time. As you work with them and given their more accelerated roadmaps in terms of technology nodes, can you maybe not quantify, but qualitatively say that you have seen some incremental new market opportunities, and that\u2019s what gives you confidence with that customer on a going-forward basis? Tim Archer : I guess I brought it to all customers. I mean to speak to the one, but I think what we have always said is that Lam\u2019s greatest opportunities get created as those technology changes, those technology transitions occur. And I spoke to a couple of you, just as an example, you think about somebody implementing gate all around in, say, their next technology node or future technology. It does create new opportunities for us, and we have designed equipment kind of ahead of where the roadmaps are. And so the faster those technology changes come, the sooner we get the opportunity to insert those new applications into their production lines in a bigger way. And so we have talked about some of those selective etch, some of our new ALD tools. Of course, it\u2019s some of our etch systems that are designed for \u2013 to really support the fine pitch patterning associated with EUV. So, EUV like at each technology node, we use more and more layers of EUV that grows for us. And so every customer, the faster they transition technology, the greater stems Lam\u2019s sort of market is growing and the greater our share opportunity is increasing. Patrick Ho : Great. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Patrick. Operator : We will take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on the demand outlook. I mean I hear you said you haven\u2019t seen much. I mean I am just looking at the areas that you mentioned being strong. And I think we have seen a lot of those same areas see weakness image sensors and MCUs, APs, I mean, Qualcomm that they are caught up on supply. So, I know that\u2019s not your forecast. You get them from the customers. But I am just kind of curious, you have been through this before. When you look downstream, you definitely see weakness. I am just kind of curious if you \u2013 what you have actually seen yet, obviously, memory same story, you are hearing about the CapEx cuts, just trying to fit all this into the picture versus I know you are still catching up. So, I don\u2019t know what the right starting point is, but clearly, you are seeing downstream weakness. Tim Archer : Yes. Blayne, obviously, as we acknowledge, we are clearly hearing customers strike a more cautious tone. We see what\u2019s going on around \u2013 within the macro. And so we haven\u2019t given the 2023 outlook, to be clear. And I think what we are saying is that if as demand \u2013 if demand changes and as demand changes, Lam is set up to operate effectively within whatever that environment is. And clearly, we have different scenarios. But the key is, as we look forward, things like our larger installed base business will be helpful for us, regardless of what the environment looks like. The improvements we have made, say, in our foundry exposure with new share gains and SAM expansion, that will be a positive regardless of what the end demand looks like. Higher etch and dep intensity due to the technology inflections, it\u2019s true regardless of what the end demand is. And the fact that we have a more diverse and more efficient and more effective global manufacturing infrastructure. That will also be helpful regardless of what the demand is. So, I think what we are trying to highlight is we are not going to be the best at forecasting probably no better than anybody else and really know exactly what 2023 is going to be looking like. So, we do believe we have a pretty good view of how Lam can execute very well within whatever that environment is. Blayne Curtis : Thanks for that. And then you might have answered this before, but just on the deferred revenue balance. I was just curious, you are seeing people start to catch up. I know you mentioned that it could be flat in September, but just trying to understand the challenges, are you still having certain subsystems that you can\u2019t get, or is it more like you are just getting high orders in the door and the balance keeps going up? Just trying to understand why that hasn\u2019t started to work its way down? Tim Archer : Well, it\u2019s just \u2013 one, it\u2019s a higher volume of output we are trying to achieve. And quite frankly, it\u2019s just all components. And I would say, everything is sort of improving. But in general, there is quite still a number of quantities that aren\u2019t able to meet down that new higher level that we want for the output. And so it just continues to increase. So, I couldn\u2019t point to one specific thing, but I would say that in general, I am happy with the improvements we are seeing across a broad array of our suppliers. And so I said I thank them for their efforts because I do see that incremental improvement and expect further improvement as we move to September. Blayne Curtis : Thanks so much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Blayne. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please? Operator : Okay. We will take our final question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe Quatrochi : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Another question on the Reliant business, it\u2019s pretty well known that the third-party reseller market for tools has been pretty limited on supply. How do we think about that market competing against the Reliant business? And then how should we think about that if that supply of tools, used tools maybe increasing if demand does start to slow from the end market semiconductors perspective? Doug Bettinger : Joe, I guess the first thing I would point out to you was, yes, historically that\u2019s been a segment of a market service by a lot of used equipment today. There isn\u2019t any used equipment or very little. And as a result of that, we are selling older modeled new equipment into the Reliant product line, right? Demand is \u2013 there isn\u2019t anything coming to be refurbished today. So, I don\u2019t know, Tim do you want\u2026 Tim Archer : Yes. No. I think that\u2019s clearly the case. Most of that, if not all of that equipment at this point is being fully utilized. Joe Quatrochi : But I guess do you see that changing if demand were to slow from an end semiconductor perspective? Do you see the amount of tools coming in to be refurbished somewhat changing, or do you think customers maybe continue to kind of hold that capacity? Tim Archer : I don\u2019t see that changing in a very significant way. I mean these assets once they are into these fabs, I mean we tend to see our tools used for 20 years to 30 years producing tips of some different technology nodes. So, I think as far as it\u2019s been to get equipment, anything many of these customers will definitely keep hold of those systems. Joe Quatrochi : Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Thanks Joe. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to you presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Tina Correia : Thank you, operator. We appreciate everyone joining our call today, and thank you all for your support. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Tina Correia. Please go ahead, ma'am. Tina Correia : Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Lam Research quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Tim Archer, President and Chief Executive Officer and Doug Bettinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will share our overview on the business environment and we will review our financial results for the September 2022 quarter and our outlook for the December 2022 quarter. The press release detailing our financial results was distributed a little after 1 :00 PM Pacific Time this afternoon. The release can also be found on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today\u2019s call. Today\u2019s presentation and Q&A include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosed in our SEC public filings. Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information. Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in the accompanying slides in the presentation. This call is scheduled to last until 3 :00 PM Pacific Time. A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thank you, Tina, and thank you to everyone joining the call today. Our September quarter results reflect continued strong execution by Lam, with revenues topping $5 billion for the first time in the company's history. Gross margins came in at the higher end of guidance and operating margin and earnings per share both exceeded the guidance range. As you can see from our press release today, we also expect solid performance in the December quarter despite the challenging environment. Recently, the United States government announced new export regulations for US semiconductor technology sold in China, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services. We have taken the necessary steps to ensure full compliance with the rules and have ceased shipments and support as required. Our financial guidance issued today for the December quarter includes the impact of these changes. For calendar year 2023, we estimate the total revenue impact from these restrictions to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Turning to the broader demand picture, we see wafer fabrication equipment spending in calendar year 2022 in the low $90 billion range. This outlook includes the impact of new China-related restrictions and lower demand, partially offset by improving supply chain conditions. As some of our customers have indicated recently, there has been a rapid deterioration in demand fundamentals, particularly within the memory segments. Customers are adjusting investment plans into next year to bring channel inventories down to more normalized levels. As a result, we see memory bit shipments tracking below end demand for the next few quarters. In our normal cadence, we would provide our first view of 2023 WFE on our January earnings call. However, given the current environment, today, we are providing our preliminary estimate for calendar year 2023. Inclusive of the China restrictions, we expect next year's WFE to be down more than 20% with memory investments accounting for a large portion of that decline. We will provide more detailed color on our outlook in our next earnings call. But for now, we believe that customer actions to reduce memory bit supply growth it will create a favorable setup for memory mix to increase as a percent of overall WFE beyond 2023. As cyclical adjustments play out, the structural factors supporting a long-term WFE growth remain unchanged. These include expanding semiconductor content in end devices, rising device complexity and larger die sizes. These factors create tremendous opportunity for Lam, as they require greater etch and deposition intensity to enable higher performance and more scalable device architectures, including the transition to 3D structures. To ensure we are best positioned to win long-term, we are focused on three key strategies : First, continue to demonstrate our commitment to customer success by ensuring that the rapidly growing installed base of Lam tools at our customers is operating at maximum efficiency. Second, be a trusted R&D partner for our customers by sustaining our investment in the technology development that is most critical to their long-term device scaling road maps. And third, accelerate innovation and deepen our customer and supply chain partnerships by fully leveraging Lam's recently expanded global R&D and manufacturing infrastructure. Our installed base is now approaching 80,000 chambers in the field. This is over 30% higher than in the 2019 memory-related pullback in WFE. Lam's growing installed base continues to drive strong performance in our CSBG business, which hit another record in the September quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in revenue. While we won't hit new records every quarter, our installed base has become ever more important to our business model, particularly in WFE spending downturns. During such times, customers can continue to advance their technology, while optimizing capital efficiency through upgrades to their existing tools. We are also engaging with customers to find other efficiencies, including yield enhancement. An example of the opportunity this creates can be seen in our Coronus product line. Lam's Coronus double-etched process is employed by customers to help prevent process-related defects, which can impair cost per bit scaling. As a result, we have seen a steady increase in the number of double-etched passes used at each successive NAND technology node. Another opportunity to help drive efficiency can be found in enormous volume of equipment and process data being generated from our large and growing installed base. Together with customers, we are using key learnings to deliver services and upgrades that positively impact our customers' operations. For example, we recently deployed Equipment Intelligence Services to support new equipment installation at a large memory manufacturer. Using these capabilities, we were able to shorten the time to release tools to production by more than 20%. While the near-term demand dynamics warrant an increased focus on operational efficiencies, the strong pull for technology advancement from our customers and the growth opportunity it creates for Lam continues. We made solid progress in the September quarter with key technology wins across multiple customers. For example, our ability to deposit critical films to lower device capacities and improved lithography overlay performance led to wins for these layers at a leading DRAM customer. For both applications, we leverage learning from our 3D NAND leadership position as well as ecosystem partnerships to bring innovative and cost-effective solutions to our DRAM customers. In foundry logic, we secured multiple new ALD application wins at a key customer by delivering purpose modifications and film characteristics required for building and integrating gate all-around structures. Whether it is our focus on operational efficiency or our collaboration on advanced technology, we believe our long-term success will be rooted in an R&D and manufacturing infrastructure close to our customers, close to our ecosystem partners and with access to world-class talent. Consequently, over the past two years, we have made strategic investments to expand our global footprint, including the addition of a manufacturing facility in Malaysia, an R&D lab in Korea, and just last month, the opening of Lam's India Center for Engineering in Bengaluru. This center is a valuable addition to our global Lam network, specializing in the design and testing of hardware and software used across our product lines. So, overall, I am pleased with how we are continuing to strengthen our foundation in technology, manufacturing, and service. This foundation puts us in a very good position to both navigate the current cyclical dynamics and emerge stronger as we look to capture the exciting opportunities we see over time in the semiconductor industry. Thank you again for joining today. And I'll now turn the call over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Excellent. Thanks Tim. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Lam delivered solid results in the September quarter with record levels of performance across multiple metrics, including revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. The September financials reflect our focus on operational excellence and our ability to deliver and meet the needs of our customers in a dynamic industry environment. Revenue in the September quarter crossed the $5 billion mark for the first time in our history, coming in at approximately $5.1 billion. We continue to ramp output levels, delivering nearly 10% revenue growth over the prior quarter. Supply chain issues have begun to ease somewhat. They have not gone away completely, however. We continue to deal with certain inflationary pressures as well as output constraints. Deferred revenue was $2.8 billion and grew in the September quarter by approximately $550 million. This growth was primarily due to customer cash and advanced deposits followed by the timing of shipments on outstanding orders. With macro conditions weakening and wafer fab equipment spending declining, I expect deferred revenue and backlog levels will come down as we exit the December quarter. I'll provide more information regarding our December guidance and focus for calendar year 2023 later in my scripted remarks. Let me now turn to the segment details for the September quarter. Memory represented 52% of systems revenue, which was slightly down from the prior quarter level of 54%. Included in Memory, the NAND segment represented 39% of systems revenue compared to 40% in the prior quarter. We see capacity adds and conversions occurring by NAND customers mainly for 192-layer class devices. The DRAM segment concentration was consistent with the prior quarter coming in at 13% of system revenues, compared to 14% in the June quarter. The DRAM investments were primarily for 1z and 1-alpha node conversions. Foundry investments were respectable in the September quarter, comprising 34% of our system revenues reaching a record level from a dollar standpoint. The increase in the quarter from the June quarter concentration of 26% as a result of the continued strength in investments for both the leading and mature node devices across a myriad of customers. These investments are supporting areas such as AI, IoT, cloud, automotive and 5G. The Logic and Other segment contributed 14% of systems revenue in the September quarter compared with 20% in the prior quarter. I'll remind you that we had record results in this segment in the June quarter, and we continue to have positive momentum in the Logic segment. Our customer base here is investing in microprocessors, image sensors as well as advanced packaging solutions. I'll now turn to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 30% of the total, relatively flat with the prior quarter level of 31%. The China September revenue was more concentrated towards the domestic Chinese customer base and as Tim discussed, we now have additional restrictions for certain domestic Chinese customers and expect the revenue in this region will be significantly lower as we go into next year. The Taiwan region increased to a concentration of 22% in September versus 19% in the June quarter. Korea decreased to 17% of our total revenue from 24% in the prior quarter. I expect these two regions to continue to be strong for us based on the plans of our customers in those regions. The Customer Support Business Group results were strong in the September quarter. Revenue here reached a record of nearly $1.9 billion, which was up 16% from the June quarter and 37% higher than the September quarter in calendar 2021. All parts of the CSBG business delivered good performance in the quarter. Notably, the Reliant and spares product line revenues were at record levels. Reliant was the biggest contributor to the sequential growth in September. As we have noted in the past, CSBG revenues will fluctuate on a quarterly basis, while the macro set up creates the likelihood of a decline in trailing edge demand, the strength of our installed base and value added services provide a platform to offset potentially softer specialty WFE spending. We do believe, nonetheless, that the specialty segment will weather next year relatively better than WFE in total. Moving to gross margin, the September quarter came in at 46% at the high-end of our guided range and it increased from June's gross margin of 45.2%. We benefited from higher output levels as well as favorable customer and product mix. We do continue to have cost pressures and freight logistics, as well as in certain raw material areas like semiconductors. I see headwinds coming in our December quarter related to customer mix, which I'll talk to when I address our guidance. Operating expenses for the September quarter were $647 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $635 million. The increase in spending was in R&D, which comprised nearly 68% of our spending, which was a high water concentration level for the company. We're focused on supporting our customers' manufacturing plans for both the short and long-term and investing with those objectives in mind. We're committed to managing spending next year as we see a decline in calendar year 2023 wafer fab equipment spending, which will obviously negatively impact our revenue levels. The September operating margin was 33.3% and was over the guidance range due to the higher levels of revenue and improved gross margin. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.8%, slightly higher than expected due to geographic mix of income, coupled with the impact of the required US R&D capitalization rules. Our estimate for the December 2022 quarter and for 2023 is for the tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens level. Please note, this estimate does not reflect the impact of any potential US and global tax policy changes being considered. The minimum tax provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act are not effective for us until the second half of calendar year 2023, which is our 2024 fiscal year. We do not expect any meaningful impact to our tax rate related to this policy change, however. And also, as a reminder, as we've discussed in the past, you should expect the tax rate to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $30 million in expense. This was an expected decrease compared with the $87 million of expense in the June quarter. I'll just remind you that we incurred a loss related to market declines in one of venture investments last quarter, we have now liquidated that position. Other expense in the September quarter was a little bit better than we expected, mainly because of higher interest rates and an increasing cash balance and slightly favorable foreign exchange impacts. The OI&E P&L line item is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility due to items such as foreign exchange, as well as impacts from the equity markets. From a capital return perspective, we allocated approximately $105 million to share repurchases during the September quarter. The cash was deployed in open market repurchases. The ASR from the June quarter also continued to execute in the September quarter. We paid $206 million in dividends during the quarter. And just to remind you, we continue to target returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow as our long-term capital return plan. September quarter diluted earnings per share came in at $10.42, which was above our guided range because of the strong revenue and improved profitability performance that I spoke about. Diluted share count was 137 million shares, which was lower than the June quarter and was in line with September quarter expectations. Let me now pivot to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash totaled $4.6 billion, which was up from the prior quarter level of $3.9 billion. We generated solid cash from operations in the September quarter of $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by the share repurchases and dividend payments. Inventory turns were consistent with the prior quarter level, coming in at 2.5 times. Days sales outstanding was 82 days, which was a slight decrease from the 85 days in the June quarter. Non-cash expenses for the September quarter included approximately $71 million for equity comp, $64 million for depreciation, and $12 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $140 million, a little bit higher than June, which was $126 million. Capital expenditures are supporting growth in manufacturing facilities in the United States and Malaysia. Additionally, we're investing in research and development infrastructure in California and Oregon as well as our new technology centers in Korea and India. We ended the September quarter with approximately 18,700 regular full-time employees, which is an increase of approximately 1,000 people from the prior quarter. We had headcount growth primarily in the factory and field organizations, and some in R&D to address higher output levels to manage the supply chain constraints, and to support customer deliveries and installations. We've decided to slow down hiring to only critical positions as we assess the business trajectory going into 2023. Overall, we're executing well in the short term. While we plan to prudently manage the business for a down WFE year in calendar year 2023. I'll remind you that we know how to manage this business during a down cycle. Our operating model has been constructed and tested for many years in different business environments. With that backdrop, I'll provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2022 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $5.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. This includes our current estimate of the impact of new regulations on our ability to supply products and services to certain customers in China. This revenue guidance would have been decently higher if not for these new regulations. Gross margin of 44.5%, plus or minus one percentage point, this is down from the September quarter, primarily due to customer mix. We have lost more profitable business from the China region. Operating margins of 31.5%, plus or minus one percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $10 even plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 136 million shares. So let me just wrap it up. Throughout 2022, we've demonstrated the ability to deliver record financial performance and profitable growth. It's been a year of volatile supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and regulatory changes. We're confident we're prepared for the challenges we see in the industry in calendar 2023, and we've built a solid foundation for continued success evidenced in our technology leadership and robust installed base. Operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question on the queue from Timothy Arcuri. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Jason Park : Hi. Thanks a lot. This is Jason on for Tim from UBS. I just have a couple of questions. So my first question is on your December guidance. You just guided to deferred revenue to come down. So I was just curious whether you can quantify for us how much of excess deferred revenue you're realizing and contemplating into your December guide. Then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I'm not sure I completely heard you. I think you asked what we think deferred revenue in December is going to do. And all I'm going to tell you is I expect it to go down. I'm not going to quantify it for you. Jason Park : Got it. Thanks a lot. Yes, so my second question is on the gross margin for December quarter. Could you please quantify how much of a headwind you're still facing in December for things like elevated freight costs in Malaysia facility there? When can we expect the gross margin to normalize eventually? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. No, I'm not going to quantify that for you either. It's still a headwind, otherwise, I wouldn't have put it in the scripted remarks. As we go into next year, and I think supply gets caught up with demand in terms of some of the supply challenges we're having. I expect some of the inflationary headwinds there to mitigate. I expect the same thing in freight and whatnot. So I'm not going to put a number on it, but I do expect that, that will get better as we go into next year. Jason Park : Thanks a lot. Operator : We will take the next question from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Harlan Sur : Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Given your commentary on a $2 billion, $2.5 billion impact next year from the export controls in China, it looks like near-term you are offsetting some of that with your significant deferred revenue and order backlog with some of your non-China customers. But, I guess, my question is, could you quantify of the $2 billion, $2.5 billion impact, what percentage is systems and what percentage is services? And then, I have a follow-up question. Tim Archer : Yes. Doug Bettinger : You go ahead. Tim Archer : Yes, Harlan. I guess, we wanted to give some sizing for that in 2023, since we knew there would be questions that, we're not going to break out the difference right now. That's inclusive of both systems and spares and service for those customers in China that are impacted by the restrictions. I think that we talked a little bit about improving supply chain conditions. And so, where possible, we talked about December, including some impact of, of course, China restrictions, offset partially by supply chain easing, offset as well by some decreases in other customers due to the demand elements that we talked about. So we're not prepared to break each of those items out, but we're doing best we can to essentially meet customer demand requirements where we can as early as we can. Doug Bettinger : I appreciate that. And then my follow-up, the team only just started recently breaking out services or your CSBG business, obviously, it's becoming a more ratable base, a multiyear service contract focused business, a lot richer in terms of value-added services and solutions. I think you guys put in your presentation like chamber shipments are up significantly over the past three years. So in thinking about a weaker WFE environment next year, like if you look back over the last three or four WFE downturns, has the Lam -- has Lam services business remained stable or grown through most of those downturns and would you expect a similar profile in a weaker WFE environment next year? Tim Archer : Well, Harlan, in my comments, I specifically said it's a very important part of our business model, especially during WFE downturns. It's also been a very deliberate strategy of Lam. I think if you attended the last couple of investor conferences, we've talked about an intention to increase revenue capture per chamber. And so I mentioned that just in the time from the last WFE downturn in 2019 from now we've managed to grow the installed base in chamber count by more than 30%. At the same time, we've also increased the breadth of our portfolio and the services that both in terms of the types of equipment intelligence services, the spares, the upgrades that has also meaningfully improved our opportunity for each of those chambers that's in the installed base. So each element of the spares of CSBG, whether it's spares, upgrade services, Reliant probably moves a little bit different through each of the kind of WFE up cycles or down cycles. But generally, spares, as we've said, holds up pretty well as most customers continue to run all of the tools that they've got installed. Upgrades sometimes can actually do a little bit better as customers have a little bit more time in a downturn to make the improvements that they want to make so that they come out of those downturns stronger with their installed base. And then services especially with our expanding offerings around equipment intelligence sources I talked about efficiency, productivity those are all things that they're important to customers at all times. But the really important customers as they're thinking about squeezing everything they can out of the installed base they have and being able to then maybe delay additional capital purchases or expenditures for just a bit longer. So I would say that we see CSBG as a very important part of stabilizing the company's performance through cycles. Doug Bettinger : Harlan, the only thing I would point out incrementally. Yes, the only incremental thing I'd point out incremental to what Tim said is, I've been talking about how strong Reliant has been the last several quarters. And in fact, last quarter, it was the biggest sequential grower in CSBG. And as we look into 2023, we're not going to parse all the different components of WFE, but I know there's some people out there that think specialty segment of WFE will soften next year, and that would impact Reliant along with that offset by the things that Tim talked about. Harlan Sur : No, great insights. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : We will take the next question from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question relates to deferred revenues. So when you gave us your early view for 2023 WFE, how are you kind of reflecting deferred revenues for you as well as the rest of the industry in that more than down 20%? And as part of that, should we be thinking about your deferred revenues getting close to zero exiting calendar 2023? Tim Archer : Yes. Let me take a shot at that first, and let Dough to add in. Obviously, we contemplated that, always we're talking about what we think the industry is able to do from a ship perspective. And ultimately from a revenue perspective. But -- so that number next year or kind of think about it as a little bit of a like for life this year. But I believe that we will see ultimately the year play out in a way that deferred revenues do come down as supply chain continues to ease. And there is a normal level, though, I'll let them speak to that. What that normal level of deferred is that we'd expect? So it won't come to zero, but we will see a meaningful portion of that deferred revenue that really represents the systems that we've been unable to satisfy this year as that plays out this year as we have. Ramped our capacity, supply chain capacity caught up and therefore we get caught up on deliveries and revenue recognition. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I mean, C.J., you know that, deferred revenue is never a zero number because we always have these cash in advanced payments, volume purchase agreement credits, a whole bunch of different things, spares and service credits that are there. If you look for the supply chain challenges we had, a normalized level of deferred revenue would be somewhere between 500 and a $1 billion. It bounces around, it's lumpy sometimes, but that is kind of the normalized level that I think about. And it's elevated right now because of the backorder stuff and the incomplete tools that we're shipping. It will come down in December and then it will come down more as we go through 2023, is our outlook right now. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And as my follow up, you've grown your headcount by 30 plus percent over the last five quarters. And I just curious, as you contemplate the coming kind of correction, how are you thinking about headcount? How are you thinking about OpEx and operating leverage? Tim Archer : Well, I think that obviously, as Doug mentioned in his comments, it's not our first downturn. And the reality is we really had no choice but to expand the company as we tried to meet what was really unprecedented, the gamble for last couple of years and no choice in doing that. And as you see, not only did we add headcount, we also expanded our facilities. Obviously, as you move through cycles, we then look at the resources that are required to meet the business level in the year and going forward and beyond. But I made a couple of comments. One, we think it's incredibly important that we sustain technology development through any cycle. Our customers expect for us to be continuing to advance the products and technology they're going to need on the other side of the demand cycle. And two, I talked about some very strategic investments that we've made to expand our global footprint, to put us closer to where some of our key customers are, to create capabilities closer to ecosystem partners and our supply chain. And we think those investments are incredibly important to the long-term business model of the company. And so, we'll be sure that however, we're thinking about the resources in the company that we sustain those types of investments as well because it's not only how you act to the downturn, it's how prepared you are for the next upturn and what performance you can deliver in that cycle as well. So those things are all under consideration now. And it's also why we gave you some look ahead to 2023 to give you a sense of how we're thinking about how this business can run through the near term. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, C.J. Operator : Next question from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your time is open. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : For my first question, you've -- obviously, you've got backlog and deferred carrying you through December. -- you've got calendar 2023, you're guiding WE down, if I do the math, like somewhere in the ballpark of $70 billion. How do I think about the transition from where we're running right now to that environment? But can you give us any color, even qualitatively just on like for March quarter, does March quarter sort of -- are you sort of at that run rate of where you expect WFE to be next quarter? Like what does that transition look like? Tim Archer : Yes, Stacy, I mean we gave you color beyond what we would normally do at this point in the year, and I'm not going to do any more than we've already provided. That's the best we're going to be able to do for you right now. Stacy Rasgon : All right. Yes, I'll take that. For my follow-up. If I look at the WFE guidance for next year, again, down 20% or more from the low 90s, puts at about $70 billion. You said it includes the China sanctions, would it have been higher without those China sanctions? Are you assuming that some of that China capacity gets redeployed to other players? Like is that -- what do those puts and takes look like? Doug Bettinger : No, we that -- that makes an assumption that the vast majority of that China WFE just comes out of -- and I don't -- if your question is, could somebody else spend what those customers were going to spend to put the same equipment or capacity in place. Our view right now, I mean, is that, that probably wouldn't take place in 2023. Stacy Rasgon : Yes. I guess what I'm asking is if it wasn't for the transactions, would you be looking for WPF like $80 billion or $75 million instead of the $70 million where it seems to be coming out? Doug Bettinger : Yes. It would have been a little bit higher, Stacy Yes. Yes, it would have been a little bit higher. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Okay. Thank you guys. Doug Bettinger : Yes, thank you. Operator : We will take the next question from Krish Sankar. Your line is open, please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. So, the first one, thanks for the color on CSBG. I'm just kind of curious, you shipped a lot of tools this year. Most of them are under one-year warranty. So they won't necessarily contribute CSBG revenues. WC down 2% or higher and the customer utilization rates come down, is there a way to think about what utilization rate below which actually CSBG revenues don't grow? Doug Bettinger : Well, I think it's a tough question because as I -- that's why I pointed out, there's really four components of CSBG and not all of them are completely utilization-driven. But just to your comment about the number of tools we've shipped. I mean, over the last two years, as we mentioned -- since 2019, up 30%, a significant expansion in chamber count. So, therefore, our opportunity has grown. There are some components of CSPG and the spare space and on consumables that actually start kind of on customer usage. And so that 1-year delay doesn't quite exist for every part of CSBG spending. But I don't think we've done the calculation of where you would have to come down -- utilization would have to come down in order for certain elements not to grow. I think we anticipate that, again, customers are going to be motivated to run the tools to a great extent for the tools that they already have installed. And again, you'll see probably heightened interest in upgrades versus new capacity additions, which is also beneficial for not only our CSBG business, but Lam's capture rate per dollar of investment spend. So, again, just CSBG being an important part of our business. Tim Archer : Pointing out Doug also commented some elements like Reliant are subject to kind of overall macro environment, and we just have to watch that as we go through next year. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Tim, that's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, it seems like the first time your foundry revenues crossed $1 billion in a quarter. And you mentioned about some ALD wins for gate all around, et cetera. So I'm curious how much of the foundry strength is share gains versus just underlying cyclical strength from the foundry purchasing? Doug Bettinger : Over to both, Krish, frankly. Obviously, I think you understand, like I'm sure everybody on the call does, foundry investment is pretty strong this year. So that's a part of it. But there's incremental positions that we won. Tim every earnings call talks about some of those. So -- and you talked about a couple of just now. Tim Archer : Yes, Krish, I'm usually trying to focus on how we're doing versus what are -- some of the longer-term inflections that we've highlighted. When you think about foundry logic where we've been focused, it's ALD, which clearly, we've made significant progress. It's areas like the EUV patterning module, which includes hard masks and the ability to etch very fine pitch features with incredibly uniformity across the wafer and wafer-to-wafer, tool-to-tool, chamber-to-chamber. And that's -- so I've been -- usually, I'm talking about a little bit further ahead, but that gives you some sense of the momentum of the company that's independent of the cycle. It's really -- those are positions we're winning and when the customers buy, those become big opportunities for the company. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Krish. Operator : Next question is from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. In terms of the business that's impacted by the export controls, you said $2 billion to $2.5 billion for next year. Can you talk about what that is kind of like on a run rate basis? Or just -- I'm trying to get a sense of, is that 2 to 2.5, was that projecting some growth relative to where the numbers have been? I'm just trying to understand how much the negative impact is versus the trailing numbers? Doug Bettinger : Yes, that's a good question. I mean, obviously, we're giving a 2023 a little earlier that we probably have a great look at 2023, but in that number, $2 billion to $2.5 billion, we did anticipate some growth in 2023 over 2022. So we won't say how much, but it's incorporated some growth from the run rate we see today. Joe Moore : Okay. Thank you. And then within the service spares in particular, part of that business, I assume you'll be impacted in your ability to ship spares going forward as well. Should we think about those customers being similar in size to their overall capital spending? Or have they been sort of purchasing spares ahead of this? And could they be outsized exposure within your services business because of that? Tim Archer : Yes. No, Joe, there's not an enormous amount of it. There's been a little bit of inventory. I think the entire customer base built up with some of the supply chain constraints this year, including the local Chinese customers, but it's not like a crazy amount. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you very much. Tim Archer : Thanks. Joe, thanks. Operator : Next question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thank you so much. I was hoping, Doug, you could help us think about your systems revenue into 2023 vis-\u00e0-vis how you're thinking about WFE? Obviously, you're over-indexed to memory where you guys expect the bulk of the decline to come in 2023. You've been really successful in China and chunk of that is coming out on the positive side, you seem to have really strong momentum in both logic and foundry. So, net-net, is it fair to assume, you guys can kind of perform in line with WFE? Or do you think '23 is going to be a relatively challenging year, just given your mix? Tim Archer : Yes. I think in many way especially, you answered your own question. We're a little bit over-indexed in memory. We're very strong in terms of share there, and that's going to be down more overall WFE next year, but that's also offset by the strength of our CSPG business, which I believe to be the highest quality installed bases in the industry. So that's going to benefit us. If you really want to kind of see what it might look like -- go back and look at '19, where you had a similar profile, where memory was quite soft and foundry logic was pretty good. And we weathered that period pretty well. Toshiya Hari : That's helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, a question on gross margin. So you're guiding December down 150 basis points, and Doug, you spoke to customer mix. One of your competitors, they've talked about inventory write-downs and costs associated with repurposing tools. Curious if anything like that is negatively impacting your December quarter guide? And I guess, more importantly, how should we think about margin beyond with volume declining? Could gross margins decline further from here? Or do you think there are enough offsets in pricing and hopefully, freight and semiconductor pricing that could help you on the upside? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, let me unpack it a little bit. I don't really think we're going to have a meaningful inventory exposure. So no, there isn't anything from that. We believe we're going to be able to meaningfully rework any inventory we had that might have been targeted for those specific customers we can no longer ship to. And I don't think, as I sit here today, that's a material number. So the softness, sequential softness in December gross margin is because we lost some very profitable customers in the China region, and that's going to persist, obviously. So that was kind of the first question. Unpacking next year, I mean, the way I think about it, first, I think, as everybody on the call does, this isn't really a fixed cost business. It's highly variable. And so as volumes vary, a lot of cost of goods sold varies. You've seen that from us over the years. So that hasn't changed. The model here hasn't changed. As we go into next year, the benefit, I think we'll see in gross margin is. I believe we'll see the mitigation on some of these inflation pressures. I think supply gets back caught up with demand in terms of our supply base in areas like semiconductor. I believe freight gets better next year to what magnitude. I'm not positive, but I think that gets better. And then we ramp supply chain in Malaysia, so we're flying things shorter distances and whatnot. And so, we're going to see the benefit of that offset then by we've just lost some very profitable customers. And yes, volume will be down. There is a little bit of fixed cost in the factory and field that we're going to have to deal with. So, I'm not going to quantify it for you, but those are the puts and takes. Tim Archer : The only thing I would add is there's been a lot of our actions. Again, I spoke to some of the repositioning. I mean effectively, your question is about next year, but we're really thinking about, again, long-term trajectory for profitability in the company, which both Doug and I have said over time, we want to drive it meaningfully higher. And so, Doug mentioned and I mentioned the investment in Malaysia. We talked about the engineering activities in India, talk about the technology lab in Korea. All of these things are designed to make us faster and more efficient in our operations over the long-term. And so how much of that shows up next year and kind of how the effect is going to see how next year plays out. We're going to be focused on it. As I said, we go back to look in 2019, we do pretty well in these periods. But really, what we're trying to message is that the investments we've made over the last couple of years, taking advantage of this very strong growth period in the company really sets us up for the remainder of this decade to really drive the strategy of the company towards, again, speed of mission and efficiency and delivery of our products and services. Toshiya Hari : Thanks, guys. Tim Archer : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Vivek Arya, Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I'm curious, Tim, when do you see your ex-China memory customers getting to some level of supply demand equilibrium? Is it sometime in Q1, Q2, Q3, just what's your sense of how much inventory do they have? And how much time would it take for them to clear it out, so that your orders can resume? Tim Archer : Yes. Well, now we're starting to talk a lot more about 2023. And so again, we incorporated our view there into the 2023 guidance. I think we'd like to wait until we get little bit closer to the year to be able to speak to that. It's -- the customers are taking action. And I think that you're hearing from customers about some pretty aggressive action to try to bring those inventories and the supply demand better into balance. I don't really want to speak for them, but I think that, as I commented, I think as we exit 2023, we're going to be set up in a pretty good place for memory spending as a percent of total WFE to actually rise from that point. How it plays out through 2023, we\u2019ll let you know our view is to get a little bit closer. Doug Bettinger : And Vivek, maybe just an observation for me. I mean, these cycles have similar timeframes associated with them, almost just walk back in history and look at it. With the caveat, though, I think as we came through all the supply chain challenges this time, maybe a little more inventory gotten built up, when I look at things in the industry, so it might be a little bit longer than typical, but these things are pretty consistent on a historical basis. So you just go look at history, you'll have to answer your question. Vivek Arya : Right. And from my follow-up, I'm just trying to reconcile the more optimistic comments about growth made by your lithography peer this morning, who is expecting to grow next year with your comments that WFE could decline over 20%, so if the litho part of the wallet is going to grow, does it mean that the part that applies to you declines a lot more than 20%? I'm just trying to reconcile such a big difference in how two important players are thinking about next year? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Hard for me to tell you what another company is saying, especially because it was just this morning, and I haven't really been able -- Tim and I haven't really been able to look at what they said. But I think you understand, you don't just buy one tool just for the fun of it. If you can't buy all the process tools to complete the manufacturing line, it makes no sense, right? And so if you\u2019re buying a litho tool, eventually, you need edge step and everything else to complete the wafer. So I can't help you reconcile what they said because I haven't actually been able to go study it, but I think you understand what I just commented on. Vivek Arya : Understood. Thank you, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Next question from Blayne Curtis, Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask you all the restrictions. I mean, I guess just optically looking at it, it seems like you're taking out the domestic memory vendors. And I know there's very little leading-edge logic. I'm just curious, at least some debate as to whether the multinationals, whether you could still ship to their Chinese facilities. I know there were some licenses, maybe for services, but just kind of curious if you could just quantify your understanding of the restrictions and what you're taking out, and whether it includes multinationals and if you can still ship to facilities that may make leading-edge foundry processes even if the equipment is not being used for? Tim Archer : Bunch of questions there. First of all, maybe the simplest is we've taken out, obviously, the shipments that were destined for applications or customers that are restricted, which primarily means right now domestic Chinese customers that are manufacturing restricted technologies, which in NAND and DRAM have certain specifications and in foundry logic and others. The multinationals, as you noted, were given an authorization to receive shipments and service and so our business there effectively remains unchanged as a result of that. And so we are continuing to include that in our outlook for 2023. To your point about a facility, it's our understanding that a facility that would have mixed use would likely fall under the restricted category. And so, therefore, if a customer were to want to manufacture and take shipments and receive support for unrestricted technology, you would have to be in a facility that was clearly not also doing restricted activities. And I think that that's something that's being worked through by our customers. We've contemplated all of those, as well as what we believe will happen in China and to that $2.5 billion estimate. And so that's our view right now of the restrictions on how they affect customers and our business. Blayne Curtis : Thanks. And then just on December, I was little confused. The impact you laid out is 500 plus million per quarter that you can't ship to, your sales are flat. So I'm just curious, are you making it up with other customers? I'm just curious how fungible is equipment that you thought you were going to be shipping to Chinese memory, whether it needs to -- can be repurposed in the quarter, and you're doing that, and that's why you're not seeing the impact or whether you're expecting to ship to some higher level. And we just didn't know that, and that's why the sales are flat? Tim Archer : Well, I think that, as Doug said, the December guide would have been decently higher if the China restrictions had not been put in place. So I think that answers the question. There was a comment about -- that we made about -- perhaps we made up a little bit because of easing supply chain conditions, but that would have happened independent. So in any case, December would have been higher had the Chinese restrictions not been put in place. Blayne Curtis : Okay. Thanks. Tim Archer : Yes. Thanks, Blayne. Operator : Next question from Joe Quatrochi, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Joe Quatrochi : Yes, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back on the expectation that deferred revenue declines in the December quarter. Is there any part of that that's related to the export restrictions where customers that are now restricted had tools that were incomplete, that are now, I don't know, more or less stranded? Tim Archer : No, Joe, there's not. We cannot ship anything to those restricted customers. Joe Quatrochi : But tools, I guess, that were previously shipped that are just incomplete like they were shipped last quarter or two quarters ago? Tim Archer : If that situation existed and I'm not saying it did or didn't. We can't ship anything to them. Joe Quatrochi : Got it. Okay. And then just trying to think about bit shipments in the cycle, relative to prior cycles, how do you think about your customers' willingness to hold more inventory on their own balance sheets this cycle relative to prior cycles? Does that change the way you think about maybe like the -- the snapback in terms of like bit supply growth? Tim Archer : Yes. It's a good question. It's definitely one that's better relative to their tolerance of holding that inventory. I think everybody's view of inventory probably changed a little bit as a result of shortages and the ability to respond to what -- over the last two years, we've seen a relatively sharp changes in demand. But I really can't answer for them about their willingness to hold more inventory. I think we're going back and as Doug said, looking at kind of historical behavior and these kinds of downturns, what we're experienced with, and that's how we kind of like project out what we think will likely happen. Joe Quatrochi : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Tim Archer : Yes. Thanks, Joe. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please? Operator : Understood. We have the last one from Quinn Bolton, Needham & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Quinn Bolton : Thanks for squeezing me in. Tim, there's some confusion is the interpretation of the market it seems like on the license requirements for US citizens in China. I wonder, if you could just clarify -- does the support license requirements affect just the same set of customers as the equipment license? Or is there a broader impact on US citizens operating in China? Tim Archer : On US citizens operating in China, I'm not -- yes, I mean, there is a restriction on US citizens as defined by the government -- providing support for the development of restricted technologies. Quinn Bolton : Right. But is that just sort of the same set of customers that require export licenses on the equipment side. So, the advanced NAND, the DRAM and 16-nanometer and below? Or is there a broader set of customers you cannot support under the export control? Tim Archer : No, I believe it is the same step that spelled out. Fundamentally, customers that are either on a restricted list or producing restricted technologies for those that are affecting. Quinn Bolton : Got it. Thanks for the clarification. And just quickly, you said you're going to manage OpEx next year, kind of wondering if you might be able to provide any sort of qualitative color. Is that sort of -- you expect it to look similar to what happened back in 2018, 2019 in a downturn? Or would you look to be more aggressive and try to manage OpEx more in line with the decline you see in WFE in calendar 2023? Tim Archer : We'll give you that guidance in the January earnings call. I think what we're just trying to signal is that, we're well aware of what we believe is coming next year. And therefore, we'll take the appropriate actions -- as we see fit, as I mentioned, to manage the company through the downturn. But also be ready for what we believe is a robust future for the company and the industry. Quinn Bolton : Great. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Quinn. Tina Correia : Okay. Operator, that will conclude our call. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today. Have a good day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s event. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Tim Archer : Thank you, Tina and Happy New Year to all that are joining us today. Lam ended 2022 on a strong note. We posted record revenues and earnings per share for both the December quarter and the calendar year. Systems revenue growth in our Foundry Logic segment exceeded foundry logic wafer fabrication equipment growth, demonstrating our continued progress launching new tools and winning applications in that space. In our installed base business, our CSBG revenues expanded faster than the growth in installed base units. We also generated more than $3.5 billion in cash from operations and returned over 100% of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Overall, Lam executed well in 2022. We delivered solid results in an environment of acute supply chain constraints and strong inflationary pressures. Still, there are elements of our performance where we recognize the opportunity for additional focus, and with the pressures of the COVID pandemic and the global chip shortage of abating, our attention this year is on the actions needed to hit our long-term growth and profitability objectives we laid out in March 2020. Beginning early in the COVID pandemic, Lam and others throughout the supply chain quickly ramped investments in infrastructure and resources to meet unprecedented demand driven by remote work trends and the accelerated digitization of the global economy. As seen in our results today, these investments have enabled Lam to achieve revenues of greater than $5 billion per quarter, approximately 70% higher than what we saw in the last up-cycle. As we look forward into 2023, however, we see a substantially weaker demand environment and the corresponding need to make prudent changes to our near-term operations and priorities. Customers across all segments are exercising caution, especially those in the memory markets. Inventory levels in both NAND and DRAM remain very high, and customers are not only reducing new capacity additions, but also lowering fab utilization levels to bring excess inventory into balance as quickly as possible. In addition, the U.S. government\u2019s new restrictions on sales of equipment, parts and services for specific technologies and customers in China are further impacting equipment demand in a declining market. In 2022, WFE spending ended the year in the mid-$90 billion range, slightly higher than our prior view due to easing supply chain constraints. As we indicated in our last earnings call, we expect calendar year 2023 WFE to be in the mid-$70 billion range. Given the decreased business levels expected this year, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 1,300 employees by the end of the March quarter, about 7% of our global employee base. While the reductions are broad-based across the company, we have taken special care to preserve, and in some cases, increase our investments in the critical R&D efforts which I believe are key to Lam\u2019s long-term growth and competitiveness. Despite reductions in overall company spending, we expect R&D as a percentage of operating expenses in 2023 to increase compared to 2022. We will also be taking specific actions to transform our business processes and enterprise systems to ensure that with stronger WFE spending returns, the company is well-positioned to scale quickly and efficiently across our global infrastructure. These actions will contribute 100 basis points of improvement to our gross margin from March quarter levels as we exit calendar year 2023 and we expect the operating margin benefit to be slightly higher than that. Over the past few years, we have been executing on a set of strategies that we believe strengthen our ability to capitalize on the robust secular demand trends we see ahead in our business. In just the past 2 years, we have opened a state-of-the-art engineering center in India, brought online a new technology development center in Korea, and ramped our new manufacturing operation in Malaysia. These strategic investments place critical Lam capabilities closer to customers and ecosystem partners, a benefit for stronger collaborations, greater scalability and increased resilience, all of which would be of greater importance as we see more than 50 new fabs being built over the next few years globally. They also provide wider access to talent critical to supporting Lam\u2019s growth longer term. We have also been drawing on learnings from our rapidly growing installed base to support our customers\u2019 manufacturing roadmaps. Our installed base of approximately 84,000 chambers is more than 30% larger than in the prior down cycle. A solid installed base business not only provides a platform for stable revenue growth long-term, but also delivers data and learnings that are key to an efficient product innovation process. At this scale, there is a tremendous opportunity to extract value for our customers and for Lam. The data we generate from our installed base helps drive fab productivity improvements and the capabilities of our equipment intelligence products are helping us migrate from standard service offerings, like engineer onsite labor, to more comprehensive results based contracts and predictive smart solutions. The number of chambers [Technical Difficulty] in 2022 with another strong growth year expected in 2023. We have been strategically focused on technology inflections, notably in foundry logic devices, with the goal of broadening Lam\u2019s positioning in a market segment where we have been under-indexed. In 2022, we continued to make progress. We have doubled our conductor Etch share node to node at a leading Foundry Logic customer through the success of our Kiyo product, which uses equipment intelligence to deliver best-in-class uniformity and improved yield. In the selective Etch business, our recently released Argos, Prevos and Selis tools, are gaining increasing traction. Our Argos product is in roughly 20 applications and a leading foundry logic customer, and in adjacent selective applications at another customer, our Prevos and Selis tools, our production tool of record for gate-all-around applications. Continued scaling of foundry logic devices from existing nodes is expected to increase etch and deposition intensity around 25% to 30%, thus creating tremendous opportunity for us to gain share through new innovations for future devices. Lastly, we have continued to make both organic and inorganic investments to expand our market. Lam\u2019s innovative dry-resist fabrication technology has on development tool of record positions at multiple customers for key steps in the patterning process and we are actively engaged with customers across both the Memory and Foundry Logic segments. We expect to announce more on this in 2023. In Advanced Packaging, our recent acquisition of SEMSYSCO, we have expanded our capabilities within the leading-edge logic and chiplet segments. We are rapidly integrating SEMSYSCO technology with Lam\u2019s market-leading capabilities in cleaning and wet processing and we have already achieved a key win in this area. Customers view advanced packaging solutions in both wafer and substrate formats as critical to enabling future high-performance computing and AI applications and Lam is well positioned to benefit from this trend. So to wrap up, 2022 presented many challenges. With our team\u2019s focus and strong execution, we were able to meet our customers\u2019 needs, deliver record revenues and expand our product and technology portfolio. This coming year represents a reset in the market and in our business, but it\u2019s also an opportunity for us to make the changes needed to accelerate our strategic priorities. I am confident that by taking the difficult actions we have announced today, we are putting Lam in a stronger position to capitalize when industry spending growth returns. With that, I will pass it on to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. We had a record financial year in calendar 2022. And revenue came in at $19 billion and we delivered an all-time high for earnings per share of $37.31, which was a 15% growth in earnings per share over calendar year \u201821. Overall, I am pleased with the operational performance we achieved this past year delivered while navigating a challenging business environment with global supply chain constraints, significant inflationary headwinds and fluid regulatory restrictions. Lam also achieved record levels of performance in the December quarter across multiple metrics, including revenue, operating income dollars and earnings per share. Revenue for the December quarter was $5.28 billion, an increase of just over 4% from the prior quarter. We delivered higher levels of system sales in deposition and etch offset somewhat by a decrease in CSBG revenue. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $2 billion, a decline of $770 million from the September quarter. Supply chain constraints have improved and we were able to fill shipments of many critical parts that\u2019s required for revenue recognition. Our expectations are that the deferred revenue balance will continue to decrease in the March quarter as we fully complete shipments related to outstanding backordered systems. The deferred revenue balance decrease I just spoke about was partially offset by some increases in deferred due to customer cash and advanced deposits, which I also noted last quarter. As we sit here today, I expect to have some level of these type of deposits in the deferred balance throughout calendar 2023, keeping deferred revenue at somewhat higher levels than we have historically seen. I anticipate that the deferred revenue from backorders will be at a normalized level as we exit the March quarter. Let\u2019s turn to the revenue segment details for the December quarter. Memory represented 50% of systems revenue, which is slightly down from the prior quarter level of 52%. Included in memory, the NAND segment represented 39% of our systems revenue, flat with the September quarter. The spending was primarily focused on 192-layer and above class devices. The DRAM segment concentration decreased sequentially from the prior quarter, coming in at 11% of systems revenue compared to 13% in the September quarter. The DRAM investments were mainly targeted towards 1z and 1-alpha nodes. I expect that we will see both NAND and DRAM revenue decline meaningfully in the March quarter. For calendar 2023, I expect NAND spending to decline more than DRAM. We continue to see strength in the Foundry segment with the December quarter concentration comprising 31% of our systems revenues. While this percentage is a little bit lower than September quarter level of 34%, the dollar amount was flat with a mix of investments in both leading and mature node devices. The Logic and Other segment revenue came in at a high watermark for the company, contributed 19% of systems revenue in the December quarter compared with 14% in the prior quarter. Investments were focused on microprocessor, image sensor and advanced packaging technologies. Lam had strong momentum in Logic and Other throughout calendar 2022. I expect we will continue to perform well in this segment. I\u2019d mention that this was a record revenue level for us in microprocessor related revenue. We have been talking about momentum here for a while and it\u2019s clearly showing up. With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region was 24% of the total, down from the prior quarter level of 30%. This reduction was due to the U.S. government sales restrictions for certain domestic customers which were put in place in early October of 2022. Rounding up the top region of revenue locations, Korea comprised 20% of total revenue, up from 17% in the prior quarter and Taiwan decreased to a concentration of 19% compared to 22% in the September quarter. The Customer Support Business Group results in the quarter were approximately $1.7 billion, which was down 9% from the September quarter, though it was 16% higher than the December quarter of calendar 2021. As I have noted in the past, CSBG revenues will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. And in the December quarter, we experienced declines in the CSBG product lines with reductions in utilizations and system spending. Going into calendar 2023, we have the impact of China regulatory work restrictions in addition to memory spending at well below historic levels and elevated customer device inventory. These factors are resulting in customers having underutilized factories and taking actions to manage their supply levels in 2023, negatively impacting our spares and services business. While we continue to believe the mature node segment will perform better than overall WFE spending, we are in an unprecedented business environment and expect the CSBG business could be down somewhat in calendar year 2023. Let me now pivot to our gross margin performance. The September quarter came in at 45.1% over the midpoint of the guided range, but down from September quarter\u2019s gross margin of about 46%. The decrease from the September quarter was tied to customer and product mix. With the decline in business volumes in March 2023 quarter, we expect lower factory and field utilizations to unfavorably impact our gross margin on a sequential basis. Operating expenses were $686 million in the December quarter, up 6% from the prior quarter amount of $647 million. The higher spending was mainly in R&D projects, which comprised nearly 67% of our total spending. Supporting our customers\u2019 roadmap continues to be a top priority for us while we focus on managing other areas of discretionary spending within the company. December quarter operating margin was 32.1% over the midpoint of guidance due to the higher level of revenue and gross margin. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 11.9%, in line with expectations. Looking into calendar 2023, we believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid-teens with some fluctuations quarter-by-quarter. This rate estimate does not include any impacts from potential U.S. or global tax policy changes. Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $38 million of expense, approximately $9 million higher from the prior quarter, mainly due to negative foreign exchange fluctuations which was somewhat offset by higher interest income because of increasing returns on our cash and investments. OI&E will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility quarter-by-quarter. On the capital return side in the December quarter, we allocated approximately $483 million to open market share repurchases. Additionally, we paid $236 million in dividends in the quarter. For the 2022 calendar year, we returned 119% of our free cash flow, totaling $3.5 billion which was somewhat higher than our long-term capital return plans of 75% to 100%. December quarter diluted earnings per share, was $10.71, which was at the high-end of our guidance range. Diluted share count was 136 million shares, which was lower than the September quarter and in line with our December quarter expectations. During 2022, we lowered share count by nearly 6 million shares through our share buyback program. Now moving to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, were up to $4.8 billion versus the prior quarter level of $4.6 billion. Operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the December quarter was offset by cash allocated to share repurchases, dividend payments and capital expenditures. Inventory turns were 2.4x. Days sales outstanding were 70 days, a decrease from maybe 2 days in the September quarter due to strong collections and improved linearity within the quarter. I would point out that we expect 2023 to be a strong cash-generating year as working capital comes down with lower business levels. Our non-cash expenses for the December quarter included approximately $73 million for equity compensation, $73 million in depreciation and $12 million in amortization. Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $163 million, a slight increase over the September quarter spending of approximately $140 million. The expenditures were in R&D and manufacturing, including our Korea Technology Center and our Malaysia factory. We ended the quarter with approximately 19,200 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 500 people from the prior quarter. Our growth was in the factory and field to support the manufacturing as well as installation of tools at our customers\u2019 fabs. Also included in this headcount growth were 150 employees from the SEMSYSCO acquisition that was completed in the December quarter. As you heard from Tim and saw in our earnings release, we will be reducing our regular full-time headcount by approximately 1,300 employees. We expect these reductions to be largely reflected in our June quarter ending headcount. In addition to the full-time reductions, we expect to be lowering our temporary workforce by approximately 700 people in the March quarter. We\u2019ve already adjusted our temporary workforce down by 700 people in the December quarter. Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2023 quarter. We\u2019re expecting revenue of $3.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million. I\u2019ll also just mention that we currently think revenue will be somewhat first half weighted this year as we consume the reduction in deferred revenue in the March quarter. Gross margin of 44%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. The decrease in this is the result of lower business volumes. Operating margin of 27.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $6.50 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 135 million shares. We will be taking a charge of approximately $80 million in the March quarter from headcount reduction. Including this impact, and the other near-term actions that Tim spoke about, we are anticipating a total of $150 million to $250 million in charges to be incurred over the next 12 months. In addition to headcount, we anticipate potential charges from facilities restructuring, business realignment and transformation and product rationalization. On top of the cost savings activities, we are driving a greater focus from our senior leadership team through inclusion of additional profitability metrics in our annual incentive compensation structure. Currently, we\u2019re at low volumes given the business environment. These initiatives will structurally improve our profitability. As Tim already laid out, we expect gross margin to be higher by roughly 1 percentage point and to expand operating margins by a little more than that as we exit the calendar year and complete these activities. Over many years in cycles, Lam has established a proven track record of successfully managing this business. With the actions we plan to execute throughout the year, we expect to strengthen our operations and technology leadership and further enhance our profitability profile with the company\u2019s returning growth. When business improves, and we know it will, Lam will be a stronger, better positioned, more efficient company. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Given the 20% pullback in WFE spend this year, significant memory spending pulled back within that, does the team still believe that the memory mix and spending expansion in memory will accelerate exiting this year? What\u2019s your view? And then what\u2019s your view on the supply-demand environment in memory and normalization of excess inventories in the industry? Tim Archer : Yes. Harlan, I\u2019ll start on that one. I think that the memory market and our market in general is difficult to predict from a timing perspective. So when you try to put a ending the year kind of time on it, it\u2019s hard. But as Doug laid out, there is a couple of points. I mean, one, we\u2019ve seen extraordinary measures within the memory market in terms of reductions, not only in spending but also cuts and fab utilization, and in some cases, even delays of technology investments. I think these are somewhat unprecedented in terms of trying to bring this market into balance. We also see memory as a percent of the total WFE mix that\u2019s at levels that we haven\u2019t seen in 25 years. And so I guess what we walk away with is a lot of confidence that memory spending will accelerate, but we\u2019re not at this point ready to put an exact time frame on that. A lot of the actions that we talked about that we\u2019re taking in the company are to ensure that in the next up cycle, will actually be far more nimble to respond to changes in demand than we were when we were impacted by the ramp that came around the COVID pandemic. So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re spending a lot of our time thinking about, less on timing but more about how is the company going to be prepared to respond to that ramp in memory spending, when it inevitably comes, and how do we ensure we can do that in the most efficient and profitable way possible. Harlan Sur : Perfect. And then on the impact from China regulatory and export controls, YMTC was formally put on the entities list in mid-December. Did this move change your prior view of a $2 billion, $2.5 billion impact to revenues this calendar year due to the China restrictions? Tim Archer : No. When we put out the $2 billion, $2.5 billion fundamentally comprehended an inability to ship to the customers that at that point were operating at the technologies that were restricted by China, so it didn\u2019t change it. I would say today, our view is still in that $2 billion to $2.5 billion range impact. Doug Bettinger : No change at all, Harlan. Harlan Sur : Perfect. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I guess I wanted to ask about the deferred. And if you draw it down to sort of normal levels in March, it implies shipments that are kind of well below the revenue level. I guess with CSBG running at close to $1.7 billion, it doesn\u2019t seem like the June quarter could fall that much. But can you just kind of give us a little bit more clarity on what it means that you\u2019re drawing down that much deferred in March? Doug Bettinger : It just means there is no more left at the end of the March quarter, Joe. I don\u2019t really have any more than that to tell you. And yes, shipments are lower than that revenue number as we get the deferred kind of back to, what I would describe as, normalized level from a back-order standpoint. Joe Moore : Okay. And I think you\u2019ve described normal in the past as being around $700 million, and you said it would be a little higher than that? Is that the right math? Doug Bettinger : Yes, that\u2019s right, Joe. What I see happening right now is we\u2019ve got, I call them customer cash and advanced deposits, which we haven\u2019t yet shipped the tools. And I think as we go through \u201823, it\u2019s going to stay at a slightly higher level from that category than it\u2019s been in the past. So I think it\u2019s a little bit higher, somewhat higher than that number that you just mentioned. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you very much. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Joe. Operator : We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS Securities. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Hi, thanks. Doug, I had two questions. First of all, is sort of on Joe\u2019s question that you just asked. And it sort of is the profile, not in your revenue, but more in your system shipments through the rest of the year. You said slightly first half loaded from a revenue perspective, but I would assume that your system shipments are going to be \u2013 like March is probably the bottom and it sort of like flattens off from there. Is that fair? Doug Bettinger : Yes, that\u2019s fair, Tim. I think maybe I\u2019ll answer a slightly different question. When I think about WFE in the mid-70s that Tim described, I think it\u2019s fairly balanced through the year. Revenue somewhat first half weighted because we\u2019re drawing down that deferred revenue balance. So I just wanted to point that out, which is why I scripted it that way. Timothy Arcuri : Perfect, Doug. Thanks. And then just on that point, you guys are usually 13%, 14% of WFE and your system shipments in March would imply that WFE is sort of 16% to 17% in March. So that\u2019s more like mid-60s versus the mid-70s number for the year. So is the answer that litho was making up the difference because, obviously, all of us heard ASML today and systems are up 20% plus this year. So is the story this year really that you\u2019re going to get to mid-70s predominantly because you\u2019re adding an extra xxx billion is of litho year-over-year. Is that the math? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim, I think that\u2019s part of it. When I look at WFE down more than 20% this year, memory is down a good deal more than that. Foundry Logic, a lot less. Litho is a heavier percent of the Foundry Logic spend. And I want to specifically point out the biggest decrease from a segment standpoint is in NAND, which, as you guys all know on this call, is our strongest segment and that is etch and deposition at Lam. So that\u2019s kind of important to understand, I think, and why I specifically pointed to that as I went through the commentary. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Tim. Operator : We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide perhaps a little more granularity on the restructuring. You talked 100 bps gross margin and a little bit more than that. Is there any way to kind of give a sense of how we should see that play out throughout calendar \u201823? And what kind of leverage should we see specifically on the OpEx side? Doug Bettinger : Yes. There is some in OpEx, Tim. Obviously, we\u2019re taking reductions in every spending category. So you\u2019ll see everywhere. That\u2019s why Tim and I said operating margin would be more than the improvement in gross margin. C.J. Muse: Is there any way to quantify what that might look like? Doug Bettinger : That\u2019s all we\u2019re going to give you right now, C.J. I mean the other thing you can back into, obviously, is the implied spending guide in the March quarter comprehends some of this headcount activity that we\u2019re describing. So that\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re seeing some of it in the March quarter, I think, if you go \u2013 decompose the guidance. C.J. Muse: Okay. Great. I guess a follow-up question. As you think about the moving parts for CSBG, obviously, you\u2019ve got a year-over-year China headwind, you talked about Reliant. I guess, how do you see the rest of that core business? Does that core business grow? And is there a way to maybe perhaps rank order what\u2019s doing well and then what\u2019s doing worse? Tim Archer : Yes, C.J., let me take that. Just to remind people, four segments in CSBG spare, service, upgrades and Reliant. And so I think kind of in terms of your impact really, if you think China impacted both spares and service, it made it impossible for us to provide spares and service to customers that previously had a pretty sizable chunk of tools in their installed base. So impact on both of those product lines from China. Those same two product lines impacted by memory customers cuts in utilization. So you\u2019ve seen and heard from our customers talking about the number of tools they have taken offline in their DRAM and main fabs. Obviously, if you\u2019re not running the tools, you don\u2019t need spares and you don\u2019t need service, so again, those same two product lines impacted by those changes. The Reliant business, obviously, just in that trailing edge Foundry Logic, I would say, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that business that we see continued strength there, maybe not enough obviously to offset the other the other two impacts, and that\u2019s why I do said. We\u2019re in a little bit of extraordinary times and that we would have previously thought that, that business couldn\u2019t go down, but the combination of both China plus utilization hit those two product lines harder. Now we know that as customers begin to spend again, the first thing to do is to bring the tools that they already have in their installed base back online. And so we would expect that the spares and service business that was impacted by utilization cuts to recover quickly and we could immediately service that as soon as the business starts to improve. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, C.J. Operator : We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, either for Tim or Doug and thanks for the color on calendar \u201823 WFE and I understand it\u2019s too early to talk about \u201824. But if you look at some of your memory customers, they have publicly spoken about taking the utilization rates down. So could there be a scenario where next year, they could improve the utilization rates, improve wafer and bit output without necessarily adding WFE? Or do you think on a quarterly basis, WFE bottom sometime this year, and next year, hopefully, is a better year? And I have a follow-up. Tim Archer : Yes. Okay. I\u2019ll start and let Doug add I think that, obviously, there have been utilization cuts. I mean I think right now, if you look \u2013 at least by our estimate and listening to what our customers say, we\u2019re at very low levels of supply growth this year as a result of the lack of additions and utilization cuts, so I don\u2019t think you could quite get to the scenario you\u2019re talking about where you just bring utilization \u2013 unutilized tools back online. There is a second factor though, which is, remember, I mean, customers make investments also to move their technology forward. And that\u2019s a pretty substantial portion of why WFE gets spent, not often just about capacity addition. And so I think that customers are going to only go so long before you have to invest in the technology to move to that next node and gain the efficiencies that you do there. So I think that, of course, we will work with our customers to bring tools back online and get utilization work on productivity, but I think there\u2019ll be \u2013 I think spending will return at some point. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then a quick follow-up for Doug. I just \u2013 thanks for the color on the back-half revenue as first half. How do you think about gross margin, given the fact that the top line is decelerating you\u2019re also ramping up Malaysia, China seems to be a mixed bag. So I\u2019m just kind of wondering how to think about gross margins or how to think about where they could potentially draw. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Chris, I hope we\u2019re kind of bouncing along the bottom right now. I can\u2019t guarantee that, but specifically, what we try to describe both Tim and I, is that with these actions we\u2019re taking, we believe there is upward momentum to gross margin as we exit the year. We\u2019re trying to get kind of capacity right staffing of the capacity rights so that as we exit the year, we think there is a point of gross margin upside, plus or minus where we\u2019re at. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Thanks a lot, Doug. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Krish. Operator : We will take our next question from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I just wanted to touch on the deferred again. I just want to make sure I have it right. So you\u2019re running $2 billion now. It sounds like you think normalized deferred might be $1 billion. So you got $1 billion that\u2019s potentially coming out in March? Is that the right way to sort of think about the underlying demand, like where it is just like $1 billion like short of where we are or short of where the guide is and then going forward\u2026 Doug Bettinger : Stacy, I think deferred is going to be higher than that $1 billion because of these cash in advance payments I was referencing. It\u2019s not going to go that well, I don\u2019t think. And I think it\u2019s going to stay. I think I\u2019ve previously let everybody to believe deferred revenue would be in that high multiple hundred-million-dollar range. I think it\u2019s decently above $1 billion now because of this other category of stuff I see. Stacy Rasgon : It\u2019s like $1.5 billion? Or can you give us a little more color on that? Doug Bettinger : Yes. It\u2019s like $1.5 billion. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. My follow-up, I just \u2013 I do want to ask a little more philosophical question on the workforce reductions. And maybe as it relates to WFE, I mean, like we probably did, I don\u2019t know, $40 billion in Memory WFE in \u201822 and it\u2019s going to be down a lot in \u201823. Like, even if it grows in \u201824, how long does it take to get back to that sort of \u201822 level, like if ever? And do the cost cuts that you\u2019re doing, are they in some sense, a function of how you might view like that long-term sort of steady state WFE for memory versus where we\u2019re coming off in \u201822? Tim Archer : Yes, Stacy, maybe it combines a little bit maybe the last question we had as well, which is, we\u2019re making these cuts and taking this action to make the company efficient and profitable at this level of business. And so therefore, we\u2019re not really looking and saying we need a big increase or rapid increase in business to justify what we keep afterwards. But I did mention the focus that we have on ensuring that as we make cuts and as we reposition, especially the global operations infrastructure, we think about how quickly we can ramp up because we know when memory comes back, it often comes back much faster than people expect. And so I can\u2019t tell you when it gets back to these numbers. But what I want to make sure is that when it does return to stronger spending in the memory side, we\u2019re able to ramp that up and do it efficiently. So we don\u2019t have a lot of the profitability headwinds that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last really 12 to 18 months. And so that\u2019s the way I think about it and get the company to the right size now for this level of business. But with the idea that we have, the infrastructure and the business systems available to us and the supply chain infrastructure to ramp more quickly, more efficiently should the market overshoot where our estimate is. Stacy Rasgon : But why don\u2019t you need to cut more than because the cuts only take you back to where headcount was like six months ago, right? Doug Bettinger : Stacy, I am comfortable at the profitability levels of the business at these revenue levels. We are getting things structured in the right way so that the P&L looks acceptable. Tim Archer : I think Stacy, not all those heads were added in the volume side of the business as well. And so I talked about \u2013 and I think you will see when you look at the P&L, where we are trying to preserve what is strategic spending on the R&D side and the products that we think are important for the future growth of the company and competitiveness of our business. We are still committed, as I have said at the beginning, through our model of gaining market share in both the Memory and the foundry logic side of the business and some of the spending is there as well. So, these are the cuts we think that are appropriate for how we think the business seems to be run through this cycle. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Tim Archer : Thanks Stacy. Operator : We will go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Great. Thank you so much. I had one clarification and then a follow-up question. On the clarification, last quarter, I think you guys sized the potential impact from China export restrictions to your business in calendar \u201823 at $2 billion to $2.5 billion, I believe three quarters on the systems side, a quarter in services. Are those numbers still your expectation for calendar \u201823? Any change there? Tim Archer : Yes, no change. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then my question probably for Doug in terms of gross margin, last year, you talked about freight and component costs being a headwind and you also talked about pricing as a potential lever to offset some of the headwinds. How should we think about those dynamics as we progress through \u201823, any progress? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Toshiya, I guess what I describe is in some of the inflationary buckets I have been talking about for over long and talking about it, some of it\u2019s getting somewhat better. And some of it, I think will get better, but we are not seeing it yet. So, that\u2019s in what we have been talking about. And then relative to pricing activity, we continue to work on that. There are some things that\u2019s already showing up in the P&L in the March quarter, but we continue to have ongoing conversations with customers about the right level of pricing, and that will continue as we go forward. Toshiya Hari : And when you talk about the 100 basis point improvement exiting the full year, is that an all-in number, embedding all those factors? Doug Bettinger : Yes. To the best of our recept as we sit here right now, yes, that\u2019s all in of the pluses, the minuses, from business going down and the adjustments we are making in terms of the footprint of the company. Toshiya Hari : Got it. Thank you so much. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks Toshiya. Operator : We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. I am trying to gauge what is kind of your trough quarter of this year conceptually, right? I understand that you don\u2019t give exact forecast. But if I go through this deferred revenue math, so let\u2019s say another $500 million comes out suggest that your March shipped revenue conceptually is about $3.3 billion. Does that reflect all the China and Memory CapEx cuts so that is sort of pure trough revenue quarter, or do you think there is more to come? So, the trough revenue quarter might be later this year, closer to $3 billion or some other number. I am just trying to conceptually gauge what is the trough quarter for this year, so we can get a sense for what trough earnings power could be. Doug Bettinger : Toshiya, I guess sorry \u2013 Vivek, the best I can do is just say what I have already said. Revenue is somewhat first half weighted, largely because we are pulling the deferred down in March. In March, it\u2019s pulled down to where it\u2019s going to be. And so you got to kind of think about that plus the fact that I told you, we think WFE is fairly balanced first half, second half. And I think if you think that through, you will get it pretty close to where it should be. Vivek Arya : Got it. And then second question that I have is, China sales were 24%, I believe of total in December. But could you give us a sense for how much of that was China domestic? And then what do you expect China to be as a percentage of your sales in March and if you have a number roughly for calendar \u201823? Doug Bettinger : Yes. In December, trying to remember the number. More than half of it certainly was domestic China. I forget the exact number, Vivek, to be honest with you, but more of it was domestic China. As we go through, China is going to be impacted to the $2 billion to $2.5 billion from the customers we can\u2019t ship to. I think \u2013 when I think about China WFE, that means China WFE is going to be down somewhat in \u201823. Vivek Arya : Okay. So, this $2 billion to $2.5 billion, is that kind of run rate reflected in your March outlook? That\u2019s what I wanted to just get a sense for. Doug Bettinger : Yes. The things that we have kind of lost from that $2 billion to $2.5 billion, there is nothing in the March quarter. So, that\u2019s part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion. There isn\u2019t any more reduction from March as we go forward. I am not sure I am making it clear to understand it, but Vivek, there is always timing of different customers spending money. It\u2019s not that China is going to be up in China will be up and down as we go through the quarter, I expect. But the impact from the regulations is already fully in effect in the March quarter is what I am trying to describe. Vivek Arya : Got it. So, basically, Doug, just to kind of nail it down. If I take the March ex deferred $3.3 billion, right, and kind of assume quarterly run rate is at level, that\u2019s sort of how the shape of calendar \u201823 revenue should be, right? Doug Bettinger : Listen, we only guide revenue one quarter at a time. I will guide June when we get to the next quarter earnings numbers. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Doug, is the equipment demand now below the supply that you can receive from your suppliers? Tim Archer : Is it below \u2013 sorry, is the question about supply chain constraints? Atif Malik : Right. I mean are they fully removed now and the demand has fallen below the supply line? Tim Archer : Yes. Well, as we said, we saw a significant improvement in the supply chain constraints in the December quarter, which is partly why we were able to deliver higher than the anticipated revenue. So, I would say that supply chain constraints are easing. There is always \u2013 and remain in some parts of the supply chain that are still not fully recovered. But I would say that if you went back and compare where we are today versus 12 months ago, dramatically improved. I think that we will continue to work on that through probably the remainder of this year on those remaining issues. Atif Malik : Got it. And Tim, in your prepared remarks, you talked about conductor etch market share doubling node-to-node at one logic maker and gate all around, presumably is a big technology inflection that should help you guys. Can you talk about the timing of the production ramp for gate all around? Is it second half, next year story, or is it more like a 2025-year event? Tim Archer : Yes. I think that \u2013 I mean you see customers starting to talk about and announce kind of limited production. Yes, obviously, there is a qualification cycle, probably better for them to talk about their own timing. But it\u2019s not a material issue for our 2023 numbers, let\u2019s just say. So, it\u2019s a 2024-and-beyond event. But those are the types of things that, again, if we think about where we want to take this business. Part of this is about increasing our exposure into that market where there is tremendous need, and I talked about the increasing intensity for etch and deposition in that space and foundry logic. And most of those big technology inflections where our tools are most suitable, things like selective etch, things like high-aspect ratio critical etch. The use of those tools are just increasing in these new 3D architectures. The increased use of advanced packaging in foundry logic and AI applications, those are, again, areas where Lam can bring our etch technology to bear. So, timing again, hard to predict, but we are making great progress to development tool of record and early production tool of record stages. And I think that as we see those markets ramp, that\u2019s good for Lam. Atif Malik : Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks Atif. Operator : We will go next to Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Zaman Khan [ph] for Sidney. And just on CSBG, I apologies if I might have missed this, but can you guides us on how you see each of the buckets that play into CSBG? How these will contribute to the segment\u2019s overall performance in 2023? And I have a quick follow-up. Tim Archer : Sure. Yes. I kind of hit on that a little earlier, but it was basically the four segments spare, service, upgrades and Reliant. And again, in a normal year, we would actually always see spares in particular, expanding with the growing installed base. I talked about the fact that our installed base is substantially larger than it was during the last down cycle. We just grow the installed base, spares grow along with that. And the impact this year to that business was somewhat unique, in that, the China restrictions did pull spares business immediately out of our revenue plan given that we cannot sell spares to certain customers and technologies in China. So, that\u2019s a unique reset to that business. And then the second thing that impacts spares is when customers cut utilization, those tools are idled, obviously, don\u2019t need spares. So, I would say the spares business is impacted by those two impacts. Service, similarly, we can\u2019t service the tools in China that are restricted customers and technologies and also utilization customers tend to look to save money by doing the service themselves during these times or when tools are offline, they don\u2019t need service. And so those two product lines are kind of the most impacted, I would say, by these changes, reliant, again, growing because trailing edge still grows and upgrades. While I said some people might be delaying again, just to \u2013 from a CapEx sensitivity perspective, some upgrades I would say there is a less impact in that part of the business. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That\u2019s pretty helpful. And then one more of a long-term question for me. I guess one of your major customers noted like very elevated infrastructure cost, roughly 4x to 5x when they build out fab capacity outside of Asia. I guess what are the implications to equipment spend as customers try to obviously diversify capacity across the regions? Tim Archer : It\u2019s a good question. I mean obviously, there is \u2013 all customers are cost sensitive regardless of where they are building fabs. I mean we certainly know as people move into costlier regions, I think the story is the same. We compete and we win business based on building tools that deliver excellent technology with high productivity. And I think that if I thought about what probably that means from an equipment trending perspective, I talked a lot about equipment intelligence. You think about it, if you are moving into a region where already some of the base costs are higher, you are going to want tools that require less human interaction, less servicing tools that can do predictive work in order to try to keep them up and utilize more at a higher rate. And so I think that you will see those types of customers pull for some of our smart solutions where you can kind of pull some of that labor content down if you can keep tools up and running more often and therefore, extract more from the capital that you have invested. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for the color. Tim, that\u2019s very helpful. Tim Archer : Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had two questions. One, I just wanted to \u2013 obviously, a lot has transpired over the last 12 months and clearly a huge correction in memory. You are saying foundry logic down something less than the group the overall is. I am just kind of curious how you are thinking about that. I mean obviously, memory had to work through low utilizations and now they are pulling back on the capacity adds and same end markets. So, kind of just how are you thinking about foundry kind of progressing over this year or next? Tim Archer : Yes. I guess right now, obviously, we still see, as we said, memory or foundry logic being down substantially less than the memory this year. We have also made the comment that as a percent of total WFE memory is at levels that we haven\u2019t seen in 25 years. And so therefore, I guess we look at it and it\u2019s either we see strong foundry logic spending, but we actually think that with that foundry logic spending in the devices and applications that are created, that will be another one of the drivers that pulls through memory usage and causes and perhaps accelerates a memory recovery. And so I think that the two are intricately tied in terms of the end applications, but sometimes the timing of the capacity additions and such are absent I think that\u2019s what we see right now. Doug Bettinger : Blayne, I guess what I would describe is \u2013 go ahead, ask your next question. Blayne Curtis : I want to hear what you would say, Doug. Doug Bettinger : I was just going to say at the end of the day, you need all of this in the system architecture. When you look at hyperscale architecture, you don\u2019t just have logic devices and accelerators without memory, right. It\u2019s all got kind of all go on the same motherboard, if you will. What we have got going on, at least my perspective right now is we are sitting on excess inventory in the memory area to a significant extent, and it\u2019s just got to get consumed. We are at a different point in the classic cycle is what I was going to describe Blayne. Blayne Curtis : Okay. I guess \u2013 I mean it\u2019s a question \u2013 I am going to \u2013 I want to follow on to my own question, but it\u2019s also one for yourself. I mean you look across the industry in semis inventories are going up. I think you have seen this in memory, but also with semiconductor companies and your inventories as well, right? So, it suggests capacity exceeds demand, right? So, I guess one, I guess that\u2019s why question why foundry logic can kind of continue and I think memory might be leading the show there. But I guess as it relates to you, inventories are at a very high level. So, I am just kind of curious as another play on gross margin, where do you think your inventories need to go? And if you have to dial back your production, is there any kind of headwinds to gross margin to think about? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Blayne, our inventory is going to go lower, I guess is what I would describe, right. Business is coming down. We will need less inventory to supply a lower level of business, it will come down, that I can tell you for sure. Blayne Curtis : And does that have any impact to gross margin? Doug Bettinger : Yes, a little bit. But when I describe an expectation, I mean I describe an expectation that as we exit the year, gross margin is a point higher, that contemplates the fact that factory absorption, utilization and so forth is going to be lower, and we will be bringing inventory down. Blayne Curtis : Awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Blayne. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our last question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joe Quatrochi : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Last quarter, you had talked about the Reliant business or kind of one does with the decline in WFE and just kind of weakness in consumer electronics that, that business could also be negatively impacted. And it sounds like maybe this quarter, you are a little bit more constructive on that business. Is that, I guess the right way to think about it? And then two, maybe what\u2019s driving that? Doug Bettinger : Yes. No, Joe, we didn\u2019t mean to describe it any differently. I think last quarter and this quarter, we said we expect that segment of foundry and logic to be somewhat better than overall WFE. I think we said that last time. I am pretty sure we did and we are saying that again. Tim Archer : I think they may have come across \u2013 Joe, just a little bit \u2013 maybe a little more constructive than the other product lines that were within CSBG, I think why I think there was a question about kind of ranking them or stacking those. It\u2019s the least impacted by the changes like time restriction and utilization. That was \u2013 that was maybe why it came across that way. No intention to send a different message from last quarter, though. Joe Quatrochi : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of the total CSBG business, when we think about the impact from the China export restrictions, obviously, the utilization coming down just across the board is a negative impact. But would that business be, I guess closer to flat, it\u2019s just kind of like-to-like without the China export restrictions? Doug Bettinger : It\u2019s certainly being doing better and we described it as likely down somewhat. And historically, I have always said, this is a business that should grow every single year. I wish I wouldn\u2019t have said that because I couldn\u2019t envision the environment we are in with utilization in China and so forth. So, we are just giving you kind of the lay of the land right now, Joe. Joe Quatrochi : Okay. Thank you very much. Tim Archer : Thank you, operator. I think that concludes the call for us. We are wrapped up here. Tina Correia : Thank you all for joining. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thank you, Tina, and welcome, everyone. Lam's March quarter results reflect strong execution with revenues, operating margins and EPS all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Foundry-related system revenues achieved record levels, demonstrating our solid progress in both leading edge and specialty technology segments. We continue to prioritize investments in long-term technology road maps, customer support and operational transformation while prudently managing near-term spending and profitability. As our June quarter guidance indicates, the near-term demand environment remains challenging. We expect 2023 WFE spending to be in the low to mid $70 billion range, with additional weakness primarily from memory customers, partially offset by domestic China-related demand. On the China front, we see incremental strength in mature node logic and memory segments. Recently, the U.S. government notified us of a clarification to the rule issued last October governing exports to China. This notification allows us to ship certain products that we had originally excluded from our expectations. We expect to ship these tools in the second half of 2023. Overall, Memory customers continue to lower fab utilizations, slow technology conversions and reduce investments in capacity additions to limit bit output and drive inventory down to normalized levels. We expect memory spending for the year to decline approximately 50% from 2022, and led by NAND. Memory spending in 2023 is at a historic low as a percentage of total WFE. We believe this level of investment is unsustainable to support long-term growth in bit demand, especially considering the data-intensive applications such as AI, are still in the early stages of adoption and can have approximately 3x the DRAM and 8x the storage content of a regular server. In addition, advances in memory architectures such as DDR5 are driving process technology evolution and larger die sizes. As these trends accelerate, Lam's established leadership in memory, positions us to outperform as we benefit not only from investments in new tools for capacity, but also from the technology upgrades to our large installed base of tools. Our installed base for memory has increased close to 40% compared to the last down cycle. It is a valuable platform for growth when memory customers begin to ramp utilization back to normal levels, and convert existing lines to next-generation nodes. While Lam clearly stands to benefit when memory conditions improve, this is the one aspect of our growth opportunity. Rising manufacturing complexity tied to key technology inflections is positive for both overall capital intensity and more importantly, Lam's areas of product strength. For example, EUV patterning and gate all-around devices are two important inflections where Lam has made significant investments in new products for processing at the atomic scale. We are gaining traction with these new products, yet they are in the early stages of the ramp with the majority of growth still in front of us. If we look at patterning, it is already a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Lam. We have a leading share position in this segment, and we are broadening our footprint as EUV adoption scales. Lam's edge solutions have been developed to enhance productivity of EUV by creating well-defined smooth patterns with minimal EUV photon exposure. Our pulse plasma capabilities help reduced line width roughness, which is a particularly challenging problem as EUV resist become thinner at future nodes. Lam's etch portfolio is on track to win close to 75% share of these EUV patterning applications. Also, as the pattern is etched into the film stack, the hardness and stress in the films has a strong influence on Pattern Fidelity. Precise control of film properties is a hallmark of our deposited hard mask films. We are already the process tool of record for critical applications in the foundry logic segment for EUV patterning with continued growth expected as EUV adoption expands. Addressing EUV scalability challenges is also the central goal behind our dry resist technologies. Last year, we saw the first adoption of our drive development and underlayer plusses for EUV applications by a major memory customer. Our progress extended to include a second large memory player in the March quarter. Today, I'm pleased to provide another update. A key foundry logic customer is set to adopt our dry resist deposition, drive development and underlayer solution for their EUV applications, and we will start recognizing revenues for these products in calendar 2023. Looking ahead, the challenges of EUV patterning will continue to grow at every technology node, and in particular, when high NA EUV adoption dictates the need for even thinner EUV resist. With our differentiated pattern etch, hard mask and drive resist solutions, we see our product portfolio becoming increasingly vital to the industry's scaling road map. Moving to gate-all-around, this inflection introduces what we consider to be the first true 3D logic device from a processing perspective. It requires new etch and deposition capability to address the geometric complexity performing the all-around characteristics of the transistor. Processing for gate-all-around, just as the name implies, must take place on top of, underneath and inside the device, where reactors need to reach spaces that are perpendicular to the usual reaction direction. The 3D nature of gate-all-around architecture is well suited to atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching solutions, making a key inflection that plays to our strengths. For Lam, the transition to the gate-all-around node is close to $1 billion incremental opportunity per 100,000 wafer start per month capacity. Our expectation is for our share in this market to be at least as good as our overall goals for the Company. To address the manufacturing challenges of gate all-around devices, Lam has launched several new products including our Selis, Prevos and Argos suite of selective etch tools with more to come in the future. These tools can etch and treat all surfaces of the device with ALE like precision. Our selective etch tools have achieved process of record positions at multiple customers for gate-all-around applications, and we saw continued momentum in the March quarter with additional shipments to key customers. Atomic-level control is also increasingly critical in depositing films in the complex geometries very close to the transistor. Our differentiated approach uses a radical based plasma ALD reactor to deliver high-performance films with high-volume manufacturing ready productivity. Multiple customers have now adopted Lam's ALD low-case spacer and nitride films and we see this demand growing in future nodes. In summary, we are working through a lower WFE year in 2023 by managing near-term expenses, strengthening our operational capabilities and prioritizing R&D investments tied to critical manufacturing inflections. Our focus remains on ensuring that when WFE growth resumes, the criticality of our products to our customers' plans and the value of our installed base, which has grown nearly 40% since the last downturn, put us in a strong position to outperform. Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Our March 2023 quarter financial results came in at or over the midpoint of our guidance ranges for all financial metrics. We generated over $1.6 billion of free cash flow during the quarter, which was a record level for the Company. Overall, we not only delivered financial performance in line with our guidance for the quarter, but we also made great progress on our business transformation and cost-saving initiatives. Let me now move to our revenue and profitability results. Revenue for the March quarter was $3.87 billion, down 27% from the prior quarter. Systems revenue was the main driver of the decrease given the decline in WFE investments most notably in memory. As expected, with the improvement in supply chain constraints, we are exiting the March quarter having completed shipments for nearly all of our outstanding back order systems. Back orders are now at what I would characterize as normalized levels. However, our deferred revenue balance is higher than historic levels remaining flat with the prior quarter with a balance of $2 billion. This deferred revenue balance reflects the impact of increased customer cash and advanced deposits tied to orders from newer customers, which is offset by the decline related to the completed back orders. The advanced payments will remain in deferred revenue until we ship the related tools. And I would just mention that we do expect the majority of these deposits to convert the revenue during calendar year 2023. Looking at the revenue segment details for the March quarter. The percentage of systems revenue in memory was 32%, which is a decline from the prior quarter level of 50%. I would mention this is the lowest level of memory concentration for us in a decade. Within Memory, the NAND segment represented 23% of our systems revenue, down from the December quarter level of 39%. And DRAM decreased sequentially, coming in at only 9% of systems revenue compared with 11% in the December quarter. With the current weakness in memory investments, we anticipate a further decline in both NAND and DRAM revenue in the June quarter. In foundry conversely, we had a record dollar level of revenue in the March quarter, representing 46% of our systems revenue, higher than the percentage contribution in the December quarter, which was 31%. We had positive momentum in both leading and mature node devices. And I'm pleased with the progress we've made in this segment of the market. We are seeing particular concentration in the mature node investments this year. The logic and other segment had continued strength with a contribution of 22% of systems revenue in the March quarter compared with 19% in the prior quarter. Investments were from a broad array of logic IDM in multiple regions. Let me now shift and discuss the regional contribution of our total revenue. Korea and China were at the top of the list with each coming in at 22% of the total. The Korea region had a slightly higher concentration in the March quarter, up from 20% in the December quarter. China was down from 24% in the prior quarter, and the reduction was largely attributed to the U.S. government sales restrictions for certain Chinese domestic customers which were put in place in early October of 2022. Notably, in the United States, we had a record revenue from a dollar perspective in the March quarter, which represented 16% of our total revenues an increase from the prior quarter level of 10%. And finally, Taiwan decreased to a concentration of 18% as compared with 19% in the December quarter. Our Customer Support Business Group generated revenue in the March quarter, totaling approximately $1.6 billion, which was a decrease of 7% from the December quarter but 14% higher than the March quarter in calendar 2022. CSBG continues to be a resilient part of our business model, representing over 40% of our March quarter revenue. We saw utilization level -- excuse me, utilization levels decline at the memory customers which negatively impacted both spares and service businesses, but Reliance Systems and upgrade revenues increased in the March quarter given the demand strength we're seeing in mature node devices. The specialty technology market is performing better than overall WFE, and I expect this part of the business to continue to perform well during calendar year 2023. Let me now pivot to our gross margin performance. The March quarter came in at 44%, right at the midpoint of our guided range and down from 45.1% in the December quarter. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was tied to lower business volumes as well as customer and product mix. The Company is focused on improvements in cost and efficiency to enhance profitability which is aligned with our plan to expand gross margin by at least 1 percentage point exiting calendar year 2023. Operating expenses were $608 million in the March quarter, down 11% from the prior quarter amount of $686 million. We executed on cost savings actions and have managed spending across the Company while prioritizing investments in support of our customers' road maps. R&D expenses comprised nearly 70% of our operating expenses, which is a high point for the Company. The March quarter operating margin was 28.3% and above the midpoint of guidance, mainly because of the cost saving actions and expense management that we undertook. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.1% and in line with our expectations. Looking into calendar 2023, we believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid-teens with fluctuations expected quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $8 million in expense lower by approximately $30 million from the prior quarter. The decrease in expense reflects increased interest income due to the higher cash balances as well as rising interest rates. OI&E will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility each quarter. On the capital return side of things in the March quarter. We allocated approximately $483 million to open market share repurchases. Additionally, we paid $234 million in dividends in the quarter. We continue to track towards our long-term capital return plans of returning 75% to 100% of our free cash flow. March quarter diluted earnings per share was $6.99 and at the higher end of our guided range. Diluted share count was down to 135 million shares on track with our expectations and obviously lower a little bit than the December quarter. For the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash at the end of the March quarter totaled $5.6 billion up from $4.8 billion at the end of the December 2022 quarter. The increase was largely due to collections offset by cash allocated to share buyback and dividends and capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 77 days in the March quarter, an increase from 70 days in the December quarter. Inventory turns declined from the prior quarter to 1.9x, and we ended the March quarter with a slightly higher inventory dollar balance. We will continue to manage inventory balances during the calendar year. Non-cash expenses for the March quarter included approximately $74 million in equity compensation in depreciation and $14 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the March quarter were $119 million, down from the December quarter level by approximately $44 million. March quarter investments were mainly for our Malaysia factory, the Korea Technology Center and other product development activities. As we discussed in the January earnings call, we had a workforce reduction within the March quarter of approximately 1,400 people. Additionally, we reduced 700 temporary workers. We incurred a charge for the workforce actions in the March quarter of approximately $99 million, primarily reflecting severance-related payments. This charge was somewhat higher than our original estimate due to more impacted people with a somewhat higher seniority level. We also incurred other one-time charges in the quarter for product rationalization decisions as we prioritize technology investments within the Company and for transformation costs related to projects to improve our systems and operations. We anticipate we'll incur one-time costs in the range of $250 million within calendar year 2023 and which is inclusive of the $144 million that we expensed in the March quarter. We ended the March quarter with approximately 18,700 regular full-time employees, which is a slight decrease in the prior quarter. Due to the timing of our quarter end and our restructuring actions, a significant amount of the head count reduction we undertook won't be reflected in the headcount number until the June quarter. Now let's turn to the non-GAAP guidance for the June 2023 quarter. We are expecting revenue of $3.1 billion plus or minus $300 million. The sequential decline reflects a soft memory environment and the normalization of back order systems that occurred in the March quarter. Gross margin of 44%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; operating margins of 25.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point; and finally, earnings per share of $5, plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 134 million shares. So then let me summarize. 2023 is proving to be a challenging environment for our memory shipments, but I'm pleased with the progress we're accomplishing against this challenging backdrop. We continue to make progress on growing our technology leadership and focusing on our operational efficiencies. We will emerge from this memory-led downturn, is stronger better positioned, more efficient company. In closing, I just mentioned one more thing. that as we look at the profile of WFE spending this year, it now appears to be a little bit second half weighted. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C. J Muse : I guess the first question would be on deferred revenues. Exiting last quarter, I think you talked about trying to get to $1.5 billion and then we'd normalize there, whereas on this call, you said you expected to revenue the majority of these deposits in calendar '23. So can you help us understand the moving parts there? And what kind of contribution in the June quarter guide will come from a deferred revenue line? Doug Bettinger : Yes. C.J., I got a little bit wrong last quarter is what I would tell you. The cash and bank deposits from some of our newer customers ended up being a little bit more than we expected. Offsetting that, to a certain extent, was the decline in back orders. So we got that part exactly right. But what I didn't give when I told you 1.5 would be the normalized level was this cash in advance deposits I think that is going to be around for a little while. And like I said, I think the majority of that will revenue during calendar year '23, clearly in the second half. I don't think a whole lot of it shows up in the June quarter, if any of it. C. J Muse : Okay. Very helpful. And then I guess to follow up on your last comment around WFE being a little bit more second half weighted. That seems like a seismic shift. I guess, is that just the magnitude of the cuts that you've seen kind of in the first half? Or has anything else changed? And I guess as you think about that, if you do have the benefit of deferred revenues in the second half and WFE higher, it certainly would suggest that second half total revenues should be nicely higher than the first half. Tim Archer : Yes. C.J., I mean, I think that commentary on second half being a little bit higher, I think has something to do also with the effect that we talked about incremental weakness clearly, our June quarter has been weaker than what we probably thought as we came into the year. And so, some of that shows up in the back half, I think it is a case of customers continue to make pretty aggressive adjustments, both the utilization of tools as well as overall spending. That's what we're seeing here in the first half. We also talked about the fact that with the some clarification on the time restrictions, there would be additional shipments that occur through China in the second half that weren't originally anticipated. So that does help us with WFE in the second half as well. Operator : And the next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Tim, if I take your comments and I combine them with Applied and ASML earlier today, obviously, there's this huge explosion in demand coming from China lagging edge. How sustainable do you think this is? It sort of feels kind of like given the restrictions they're just taking what they can get, which is now they're pouring all their money into lagging edge. So does that worry you that maybe that's not sustainable? Or is there something going on there where there's real demand backing that? Tim Archer : Well, I believe that there is real demand. I mean every region, I think, is trying to build up a regional capability to manufacture all types of semiconductors. And as you just said, I mean, in China, this is one area that they have the ability to create that capability and also they have the demand to consume it as well. And so I think from that standpoint, it's good demand for us and for others in the industry. But I think in a bigger sense, this regional self -- call it self-sufficiency or regional resilience that's being built, I think, is going to have a long-term impact on spending in the industry. And so we're not trying to sort of play the game of is it or is it not sustainable? We're talking to our customers, and in some cases, these are new projects that are coming up. We do our own assessment of whether or not they will be able to invest if they have the technology. And I think that with not only U.S. chipset, but recent news on the European chipset, I think that this is something that it's going to have a positive impact on spending to the industry across both leading-edge and these trailing and specialty ecology segments for quite some time. Timothy Arcuri : And then I guess, Doug or Tim, can you just provide more color on -- you said that there's been some clarification of the export rules. Can you give an example of what can ship now that was assumed to not be able to ship in the past? Tim Archer : It's exactly the same as what was issued in the October 7 rules in terms of technology limits. We want to be very clear on Lam staying compliant with the restrictions. And so, at the time we had given the guidance for the year, we said $2 billion to $2.5 billion of impact. We knew we were looking for clarification on how to determine whether some shipments that were in there could be made. That's why there was a range. And so now with that clarification on how you determine what can and can't ship, we've added those tools back into our forecast the year. But if you look at the rules that are there, it's exactly what was printed on October 7. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Tim, just to put some numbers around it, it's a few hundred million dollars, I think, as we look at revenue for the year for Lam. Operator : And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : I do the first one, just a follow-up on the China question. Doug, just like trying to like put all the comments together with back half loaded WFE some of the relaxation of China constraints and strong demand from lagging in China. Is it that assumes June quarter is a trough quarter for you from a revenue standpoint? And heading into back up, your gross margin should improve as you start shipping more China? And then I have a follow-up. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I mean, Krish, what I said is it's a slightly second half-weighted WFE year. And by the way, I just clarify if there's any confusion about the deferred cash and advanced deposits that are sitting there, that's in the WFE number. So that's part of the second half weighting as well, just so everybody's clear about that. And then, Krish, yes, when I look at what we're doing with the cost structure and how we're sort of pivoting where we do what we do, I've been talking, I think, the second quarter about a view that we should exit the year at least a percentage point gross margin higher than where we are. I still believe that is the trajectory that we're on. Krish Sankar : Got it. Super helpful. And then just a technology question for Tim. You had the slide on gate-all-around, and you spoke about the opportunity in ALD and ALE I'm kind of curious because ASM International is a leader in ALD. And why would customers shift to someone else versus the incumbent just because of gate-all-around. Is or are there any gate-all-around specific technology issues that your ALD is addressing that the incumbent is note? Thank you. Tim Archer : It's a good question because I guess the point is we have a very strong position in ALD across a number of different types of films. And what I tried to speak to is there are specifically new types of challenges to introduce. And in the end, customers select tools based on the film performance, the deposition capabilities, the tool productivity reliability and manufacturing, lots of different factors. And I think these are areas that just over the years, Lam has excelled, and we -- I think we can in ALD as well. Thanks, Krish. Operator : And the next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore : I think you mentioned you saw some impact from utilization on the CSBG business in the March quarter. Can you talk about what that looks like for the next couple of quarters? Are you seeing impact from lower memory utilization within those numbers? And then as a follow-up, can you give us some sense of as Reliant keeps getting presumably bigger, how much of the -- what's in CSBG is actually kind of more on the Reliant tool side? Tim Archer : Yes. Let me take a crack at the utilization. I mean, obviously, you've heard a lot within the memory industry about utilization cuts and even some throughout the different segments of the markets. That clearly hits our spares and services business as customers look to save money in the near term, the idle tools. They also burn off some of the inventory they might have built up over the last couple of years. And so that's clearly showing up in CSBG. Eventually, that runs its course, and our expectation is that there's going to be -- especially on the memory side, you'll start to see CSBG revenues improve likely long before you start to see us talk about much higher WFE. And that's because customers will start to bring those tools back online, and you'll see CSBG revenues increasing. You'll then also see customers start to do some of the technology upgrades that they've been kind of holding off on doing in the installed base that will also show up in our CSBG revenue. And then finally, we will ultimately see increases in WFE for capacity additions. And so, I think that's where we'll see continuous improvement in CSBG. We're not going to cure a time frame on it, but it is it is causing us to be a bit low now. And I think we'll get back to that point when we say CSBG is a business we think grows kind of year-on-year, just not this year with utilization cuts. Joe Moore : Great. And then sometimes of the Reliant as a release qualitatively, how much of the business is from Reliant now? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Joe, I'll chime in on that one. I think I heard saying last quarter that the two biggest components of CSBG are now Spares and Reliant, and that continues to be true in the most recently reported quarter. Reliant is doing extremely well with the more mature specialty note investments that we've been talking about. So that's benefiting and the utilization stuff that Tim talked about is a little bit of a headwind for Spares. So -- but they're still the two largest components to CSBG. Operator : And the next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Your North American business again drove strong growth, right? Part of it is your share gains. But how much of the growth is simply -- you've got the one big U.S. customer that wasn't contributing to WFE intensity for six years because they were stuck on one node, but now they're back on track, right, trying to drive five node migrations in four years, so strongly contributing to foundry and logic, WFE intensity. How much of the growth is share gains versus just this customer back driving WFE intensity. Tim Archer : Yes. Harlan, I think we're seeing -- we're obviously seeing a combination of both. I mean share gains, and it's not isolated to any one customer when I dedicated a lot of my prepared remarks to was the progress we're making, expanding our SAM and our product portfolio primarily focused on foundry logic. We recognize and we've said that this is an area that we've been under-indexed, which means that it's an area of significant growth opportunity for the Company. And you see just a number of new products we've introduced whether it'd be through the EUV inflection or it's the gate-all-around inflection. And so it's SAM expansion driving our growth, and it's also share gains within that expanded SAM. And it's across all foundry and logic customers had some element of both. Harlan Sur : I appreciate that. And then, Tim, you also mentioned in your prepared remarks -- I'm sorry, I missed some of that, but you announced some new wins with your dry photoresists process module system solution. Can you just talk more about that? And when do you expect customer adoption curve to start to drive some meaningful revenues for the team here. Tim Archer : Yes. Well, yes, what I announced -- sorry, if you missed it, was the last year, we had announced on memory customer who adopted some elements of dry resist this technology solution. In March, a second memory customer did as well. And then more recently, a large foundry logic customer has chosen to adopt the resist deposition drive development as well as the underlayer processes. And -- so those are -- that's a really nice expansion across both memory, which is obviously DRAM using EUV, memory and foundry logic. And I think it sets us up well for continued momentum. Customers, look, everybody knows that EUV adoption is growing. And as I commented, it's becoming more challenging as people look for better productivity. They look for better technology capability within the resist. And I think that these are trends that are setting up well for us. I mentioned we'll be revenuing some tools starting this year, so that's a very nice milestone for us. And then I just would point you back, we have sized this at approximately $1.5 billion in revenue over a five-year time frame. And I think as adoption continues to grow the size of the subrogate and continue to grow for Lam. Operator : And the next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : The first on just the memory market, is second half better or worse than the first half for you in terms of your memory shipments? I'm just trying to gauge whether June is also kind of a bottom for memory? Or is there more to fall on the memory side? And I think related to it, one of your customers have said that for them, their WFE and memory could be down even in the next fiscal year. And I know it's a fiscal and not a calendar year view. But do you think that's an industry-wide view or just in terms of how customers are thinking about 24 WFE on the memory side. So, just kind of a near and longer term memory questions. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Vivek, I don't want to get into which segment is doing what in the first or second half. I mean memory is at a pretty low level right now. And we did say in the prepared remarks, June is even lower than March, and March was at a 10-year low in terms of our shipment and revenue anyway into that space. Hard to see a whole lot lower than we're seeing right now. I don't want to get into the parsing the little bit of growth in the second half where it comes from, but memory is at a pretty low point right now, I would say. Vivek Arya : And on the 24 WFE, again, not trying to get a 24 view specifically, but I think one of your customers has been public about reducing memory WFE even in their fiscal '24. Do you think that's a customer-specific view? Or is that an industry-wide view that Memory WFE could stay under pressure next year? Or is it too early to make that assertion? Tim Archer : Yes. I guess I could say that in 2022, you might recall, we gave you the 2023 outlook about a quarter early. Tim Archer : I think three quarters early might be a little early for '24. So I don't think we're going to give WFE for '24. But what I'd point to is that, as I just said, you look at from we signaled last -- in the September quarter call, the $23 million would be down in WFE. I think we wanted the first to do so is because we saw this decline in memory, we're already -- our revenue from December 22 to the June guide we just gave down 40%. So we're well into this cycle. And just as I laid out, I think we're going to see as we move through the remainder of this year and into next year, utilizations eventually come back, technology conversion start to occur. And then finally, WFE starts to tick back up. The great thing about the cost cuts that Doug talked about is we put ourselves in a position that we don't feel we have to be able to call the exact quarter when that's going to happen. But we think we're well into it and operating the Company well at these levels and with some upside to come. Vivek Arya : Right. And just a quick follow-up, Doug, maybe one for you. On the OpEx side, is this sort of reflecting all the OpEx actions? Or do you think that in September or December, OpEx could decline further. I mean that the last time you guys were at this OpEx level you were able to report revenues that were significantly higher. So kind of just two parts. Is this kind of the bottom in OpEx? And then should we see a lot more leverage, right, as the end markets start to grow? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Vivek. I think the majority of the cost actions we've taken, certainly, I talked about $99 million of non-related severance. That's largely complete. So I think a lot of it is already kind of in the run rate. Certainly, if you look at where we're at in June, it's down again quite a good amount. Tim Archer : So Vivek, I'd also just add to that. I spent a lot of time talking about the work we're doing to broaden our product portfolio and expand really Lam strength beyond memory into some of the fast-growing inflections that are occurring elsewhere. I think this quarter was nearly 70% of our OpEx spend in R&D. And so we're absolutely committed to supporting technology road maps to grow this company. And so we're watching that. Obviously, if we see further deterioration, I think you can count on us to manage this business prudently. But at this point, we want to also be prepared for when the market does come back, and we know it will come back that we are prepared to support our customers with the engineering capabilities and the new products and all the technologies that they're going to want to buy at that time. So we're really working that balance and that's what you see in our spending levels right now. Operator : And moving on to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : For the first one, I want to go back to these new customers that are in the deferred balance. I guess, are they all Chinese. And can you give us a view of which end markets that additional deferred revenue is in it? Like is it all foundry and not memory? Because I know you got one of the big Chinese memory places on the entity list. I'm assuming you're not able to sell anything to them. So just a little bit of color on is it -- is all Chinese are not and what are the end markets that are actually driving it? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Stacy, the end markets are primarily foundry and logic, the mature nodes, Andre and logic. And I will acknowledge it's got a decent Chinese footprint to it. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Got it. And so I guess you've got this -- I guess it's $500 million, right, because I mean, the deferred is like $2 billion in you said the $500 million reduction that you expected to be there before is actually there, and this was offsetting so I guess about $500 million. Is this coming back in the back half and this China revenue shipping? I'm trying to get -- are they the same things? Is the incremental China revenue that you've got like because you can ship more because of the sanctions? Is that the same as the incremental balances in the deferred? And as that kind of adds to the back half are those things -- I just want to make sure I'm not double counting anything. Tim Archer : Yes, Stacy, there's a very large overlap is what I would say. And I said the majority of that cash and advance payment will revenue in the second half. I didn't say all. I said the majority. And then the other thing I said a moment ago, the incremental clarification we got from China was a few hundred million dollars. So you got to think through where I left. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. Maybe if I could squeeze in just one more really quick. I know you said memory is down again sequentially, but there can't be very much memory in there at all, right? I mean, if you're guiding 31 I mean -- I mean your foundry plus logic in this quarter was almost 1.6%. And so if that was you can't be guiding equipment revenues much different than that. I mean, are we just literally taking memory kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel in June quarter at this point? I mean I know we don't know how long it stays there, but presumably it can't get much lower than it's going to be in June. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Stacy, I told you in March, it was at a decade long low point for us, and it's down again in June. It's -- frankly, my personal thing, it's hard to see down much more than we're describing in June, frankly. It's at a very low level. Tim Archer : I'd just add. I mean my comment, Stacy, I was just going to add that the fact that in many cases, the -- we see customers even delaying technology upgrades in order to, one, not necessarily make the investment, but also not add further bits into the market. That's a pretty rare case. I mean technology investments usually proceed because that's the path to lower cost and better capabilities. So I would agree if that's come out. It feels like we're about its lowest -- and that may be coming below maintenance levels I think here. So that's our view on memory. Operator : And the next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : As a follow-up to the last question, I'm curious how you're thinking about normalized levels of spending across the memory industry. When we look at your business, I think you did close to $7 billion in memory systems revenue in calendar. And given how things are going now, I don't know, maybe roughly $3 billion, this may be a little bit below that. Assuming, hypothetically, if you're customers are done shipping out of inventory exiting this year and DRAM bits are growing kind of in the mid-teens and NAND bits are growing kind of in the mid-20s. How significant how big would your memory business be in that sort of state? Is it kind of the midpoint between $7 billion and $3 billion? Or is it higher? How should we think about that? Doug Bettinger : Yes. And I'll give it a quick response. It's hard for me to envision it being lower than it is this year. I mean, it's down 50% memory in total, right, Tim. I think had that in the scripted remarks. That's done a lot. I can't ever remember it being down that much on a year-over-year basis. You might say, hey, last year might have been a little too high or somewhat too high? Probably to -- it's -- I'm not going to get into a precise number, but it's certainly higher than it is this year, maybe not the size it was last year, though. Toshiya Hari : I appreciate that. As my follow-up, Doug, just on gross margins, I appreciate the calendar year-end target of 45%. Curious, how you're thinking about gross margins beyond that. A couple of years ago, you guys were doing 47, some quarters close to 4 million you're introducing pretty differentiated product between EUV patterning and drive it. And I know those are pretty small businesses still. But you're putting out these products. You've got Malaysia, which hopefully with the recovery continues to ramp. Is there a path to, call it, 47-ish percent in calendar '24? Or are there headwinds that we should be aware of? Tim Archer : Let me take a shot and Doug can clean up as needed. I think the question about gross margin. We're not backing off on the financial models we put out in the past. And as you pointed out, we were getting big close to operating there while Malaysia was still a headwind. And so obviously, it will require a combination of some increased volumes. We've done a tremendous work to transfer a lot of our volume into lower-cost regions, really get a much more efficient supply chain. The COVID period was a real setback as you, again, sourced and grew in every possible location. But I think over the next period of time. And I hate to put a time frame on it again, to give a 24 outlook. But if we exit this year with the incremental improvement of 100 basis points, as Doug talked about or more and we have further volume and contribution coming through our new Asia facilities. I think that will drive right back towards those goals that we set back in 2020, which was in kind of that 47%, 48% gross margin range. Operator : And the next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : Similar to the last question on gross margins, Doug, can you help us understand by the end of the year, what percentage of your manufacturing will be in Malaysia and what are the steps you're taking in terms of asset optimization? Doug Bettinger : I'm not going to put a number on it Atif growth when it resumes, whenever that is, and we know it will resume, likely will pivot a little bit to that factory. We've said in the past, it will ultimately be the largest factory in the network. That is still absolutely the case. So that's part of what Tim just described getting back to the financial model is we'll just have a more efficient manufacturing footprint. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then generative AI is a topical topic these days. Are there products in your portfolio on high bandwidth memory or packaging side that you're seeing outside growth? Or is it roughly in line with your lodging exposure? Tim Archer : Well, I would say we haven't seen outsized growth. I think that I could attribute directly to generate AI at this point. But clearly, Lam has been a strong player in advanced packaging. And we continue to make investments in that area to expand our product portfolio and not only on a wafer basis, but also different formats as well to make sure we're prepared for whatever the future might be in advance packaging. Operator : And we have a question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis : I want to ask on leading-edge foundry. Clearly, you're seeing strength in the trailing edge. You've heard reports about maybe TSMC cutting, definitely, utilizations are quite low at the leading edge. So maybe just comment on what you're seeing from your leading-edge foundry customers. Tim Archer : Yes, I don't think we're going to comment about any specific customers, but I did make the comment that we see incremental weakness, I said, primarily from memory. And then I said we saw incremental strength in mature nodes. So obviously, primarily from memory, implies there's additional weakness elsewhere. So, I think leading edge foundry is a bit weaker. Obviously, our exposure and our insight into that market is a little bit less than it is in memory, but we are seeing some weakness there as well. Blayne Curtis : It's a perfect lead in. I guess I'm just trying to understand the second half comment. If memory players are kind of talking about second half spending being near zero, so I guess it could go lower. And I think prior question said kind of down 24, we'll see. But if foundry logic is just starting the correction that memory just saw, I mean, I guess, could you still be up if it's just trailing edge? I'm trying to understand those moving pieces. Tim Archer : Well, obviously, it's -- this is where we get a little bit stuck around the challenge of trying to forecast WFE for the industry. Obviously, we don't have product insight into every element of WFE, including tool lead times and demand in different markets. So we try to give you our best view. But I think if you sort of translate this to what really matters to us in running the Company, we've talked about the fact that we see -- assuming -- we see at some point memory coming back in terms of utilization starting to tick up at some point, but that's in the second half or it's fun four, we'll see. Technology conversions in memory will be extremely good for Lam from the standpoint of how much we capture of every dollar of spending on technology conversions. We talked about strength in mature node logic foundry, where Doug talked about these advanced payments, and we also talked about some trailing-edge shipments to China that we can now make after clarification of the rules. So all those things kind of contribute to how we think about Lam in second half. Then we try to translate that to an industry WFE, but I don't think we can spend a lot of time trying to dissect all of that low to mid $70 billion for you with great accuracy. Operator : And we have a question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : First question is, can you give us an update on your expectations of revenue performance for the CSBG group? I think you previously said it will be down somewhat, but there seems to be some moving parts here with memory utilization lower, but China revenue being less restricted. Just want to get some color would be great. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Sidney. I think what I said last quarter, and I'll reiterate the same thing. We expect CSBG will be down a little bit this year, but obviously, a lot more resilient than overall WFE. No new statement relative to that outlook. Sidney Ho : Okay. That's helpful. Maybe another question on the -- just thinking about the recovery in memory spending. Is the utilization level, the first thing you guys monitor ahead of the CapEx recovery? And how much of a lag do you expect memory CapEx to recover once utilization starts to improve? Doug Bettinger : Yes, maybe I'll come and then Tim, feel for to add on. Normally, the way this works, Sydney, the first thing I'd say is I cannot remember utilization being as low as it is right now. Usually, the fabs keep running, right, and other stuff gets adjusted. But right now, utilization is obviously down. The first thing the industry would do to get output growing again will be to move that utilization back up. That will benefit our spares business and probably a little bit of the upgrades, maybe a little bit. The next thing they will do is convert the installed base, which when that happens, the industry gets fairly cost-efficient output, and we get a disproportionate amount of that spending when it's in Memory, obviously because we tend to be the bottleneck tools. We get that upgrade business first, and then WFE comes back. So you got to think of that progression showing up in that order. We will benefit first in CSBG before you'll see it in WFE. Tim Archer : Yes. I think it's difficult to put a time frame between -- I think what you're asking is when it starts to when you start to see WFE investments. I think that depends on the shape of that recovery, which, again, we are confident that we'll be probably the first and greatest beneficiary of recovery. And we'll see what the shape of the recovery looks like once we have a better in demand. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : We'll take that question from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Vijay Rakesh : Just a quick question on the China side. I know you mentioned China revenues were 22%. But it looks like there are some U.S. restrictions. As you look out, do you expect that segment exposure to go down or stay flat? Or if you can give some color to the puts and takes as to how you're approaching that? Doug Bettinger : I think it's probably down a little bit in the June quarter from a percentage standpoint, although don't hold me to that. We don't always get that exactly right, but I think it's probably down a little bit in June. Vivek Arya : Got it. And on the Memory side, I know you mentioned spending is a 10-year low, probably comes in a little bit again in June. But in terms of where you see the bounds coming, do you think that's driven more by technology transition or capacity adds? How do you see that? Because I think broadly, memory OEMs are still hemorrhaging cash, I believe, but just wondering how you see that bounce? Tim Archer : Yes. I think as we've described, clearly, technology conversions occur first since that's the most capital efficient way for customers to not only add some additional bids but also to get better cost structure. So clearly, capital -- technology additions will come before capacity additions. Doug Bettinger : So operator, I think that concludes our time here. We can wrap the call up. Operator : Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

Tim Archer : Thank you, Tina, and welcome to everyone joining the call today. Lam posted strong results for the June quarter with gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share well above the guided ranges. CSBG at 47% of revenues in the quarter, continues to stand-out as a key area of strength and stability for Lam in an otherwise weak wafer fabrication equipment spending environment. Operationally, we achieved significant improvement in on-time delivery and critical backorder performance in the quarter and now see these metrics back at normalized pre-pandemic levels. Our focus on the resiliency of our global manufacturing and supply chain network is delivering greater predictability in the short term, but more importantly, positions us to scale more efficiently when WFE growth inevitably resumes. Looking near-term, we see WFE spending in 2023 tracking to the mid $70 billion range with the upside coming from domestic China related spending as well as strong growth in high bandwidth memory or HBM related demand. By device segments, we expect overall memory WFE to be down in the mid-40% range compared to last year and non-memory segments to be down approximately 10%. We continue to see second half 2023 WFE tracking higher than first half. While 2023 is a down year for WFE, the long-term growth dynamics for the semiconductor industry are strong. Emerging growth drivers such as generative AI are only in their initial stages of adoption and will be fundamental to driving increased investment in both memory and foundry logic fabs over the next several years. Advanced AI servers have significantly higher leading edge logic memory and storage content versus traditional servers. And every incremental 1% penetration of AI servers and data centers is expected to drive $1 billion to $1.5 billion of additional WFE investment. This creates tremendous opportunity for Lam as greater etch and deposition intensity is needed to enable higher performance and more scalable device architectures. To ensure we are best positioned to win long term, we have been making significant investments to broaden our product portfolio for processing at the atomic scale. Lam is the established leader in 3D NAND and we are well positioned to benefit from the move underway to 3D in other device segments. Gate all around, 3D DRAM and advanced packaging are important 3D inflections that are expected to drive strong SAM and share growth for Lam. Advanced packaging is becoming vital to the performance, power and cost roadmaps of high-performance applications, including generative AI. Customers are increasingly adopting a wide variety of packaging schemes to enable logic and memory integration. Some of these schemes enable up to 50% improved memory density, 10 times improvement in bandwidth and 60% gain in power efficiency. Lam has a track record of excellence in the advanced packaging segment with a strong set of manufacturing proven products. Overall, we have greater than 50% market share in deposition and edge solutions required for advanced 3D stacking of high bandwidth memory. More specifically, our SABRE 3D copper electroplating tool and Syndion etch system hold 100% market share across all leading memory customers for through-silicon via formation as a result of our long established expertise in etching and filling high aspect ratio geometry structures. Overall, we expect our packaging SAM to double in the next five years. We also see our market position strengthening as we bring technology and productivity innovation to address emerging opportunities. For example, in the June quarter, we had a critical win for a new inter-die gapfill application at a key foundry-logic customer for their chiplet architecture. As this latest win ramps into production, we will have secured a leading share position for this application across the top three foundry-logic customers. We won this application for a couple of reasons. First, we delivered higher productivity relative to the competition by leveraging our unique triple quad platform architecture and multi-station sequential deposition chamber design. This enables film deposition of greater than 20 microns in a single pass, allowing the customer to run more wafers between chamber clean steps. Second, we delivered superior on-wafer performance, including better film stress management, improved defectivity, and enhanced wafer to wafter uniformity versus the competition. As we expand our position in newer high-growth markets like 3D packaging and specialty technologies, we have looked to leverage existing R&D and tools within the Lam portfolio to broaden our product offerings most efficiently. In the recent example, our long-established Kiyo etch platform has proven to be highly suited to applications which are critical to enabling new die-to-wafer hybrid bonding schemes. By delivering better etch profile than the competition, we secured a key win in the June quarter at a leading foundry-logic customer. We are currently the tool of record for a suite of etches and resist strip steps at this customer and expect to start recognizing revenue for the new application in 2023. As this customer continues to shrink packaging dimensions with future hybrid bonding iterations, we have the opportunity to double our revenue with them over the next several years. In another instance, Lam has been working with customers within the specialty segment to port key 300 millimeter etch solutions, including atomic layer etch, to 200 millimeter to overcome challenges in the manufacturing of gallium nitride devices. Adoption of GaN technology is accelerating across multiple applications ranging from high-efficiency charging devices for consumer electronics and automotive to 5G RF infrastructure. However, the fabrication of such devices is complex and requires ultra-low damage etch processes with atomic-scale precision. With our suite of solutions, we can deliver a GaN etch process that improve surface roughness and other material properties that impact device performance. These solutions were developed as a result of Lam's deep understanding of the required technology, as well as key partnerships with customers and research institutions. Longer term, we look to outperform in the trillion-dollar semiconductor industry forecasted for the end of the decade. At Lam, we are executing a strategy to create competitive differentiation by focusing on what we see as three key vectors of rising complexity. First is the technical complexity associated with enabling the transition to 3D device and packaging architectures across all market segments. Second is the support and workforce complexity arising from the expanding geographic footprint, as regionalization efforts build momentum. And third is the sustainability complexity as we responsibly manage the carbon impact of the semiconductor industry as the output grows to $1 trillion. This quarter, we detailed one component of our strategy in a press release for our Semiverse Solutions portfolio of advanced simulation and modeling products. These products are designed to help engineers get to process solutions faster, develop new products at lower cost and collaborate across the global ecosystem with greater effectiveness. We believe that by combining the physical advantages of Lam's diverse global R&D and manufacturing footprint with the virtual development and digital twin capabilities of our Semiverse Solutions, we will be in an excellent position to innovate and outperform as our industry grows into the future. With that, I will turn it over to Doug. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. We executed well in the June 2023 quarter with revenue coming in above the midpoint of our guided range and our profitability metrics exceeding the high end of guidance. While we continue to work through a challenging WFE investment year, most notably with very low memory spending, our focus on improving our operational efficiencies is showing up favorably in our results. We're laser-focused on what's in our direct control and executing well. Let me dig into revenue. June quarter revenue came in at $3.2 billion, a decrease from the prior quarter as we expected. Systems revenue declined quarter-over-quarter as we had reduced levels of deferred revenue with the improvement in supply chain constraints. We closed the June quarter with $1.8 million in deferred revenue on the balance sheet, which was a decrease of $165 million sequentially. We've got all the deferred revenue related to outstanding back order parts completely back to normal levels. As we discussed last quarter though, our deferred revenue balance is currently still at higher than historic levels. The deferred revenue balance includes increased customer cash and advanced deposits tied to orders from newer customers. We expect a significant portion of these deposits to convert to revenue during the second half of calendar year 2023. Let me now turn to the revenue segment details. Memory as a percentage of systems revenue in the June quarter was low at 27%, which was a decline from the prior quarter level of 32% and our lowest concentration percentage for this segment in the last decade. The DRAM segment within memory remained flat at 9% of systems revenue. And NAND came down to 18% of systems revenue, down from the March quarter level of 23%. We continue to expect NAND spending to remain at low levels for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year. And I just mentioned, NAND spending is at the lowest levels we've seen since the advent of the 3D NAND architecture. Consistent with the prior quarter, we see strong concentration of systems revenue in the foundry segment with the June quarter revenue percentage at 47% versus 46% that we saw in the March quarter. Investments were biased towards leading-edge devices. There also continues to be robust spending to support more mature specialty nodes. We had a record level of concentration in the logic and other segment with 26% of systems revenue in the June quarter, compared with 22% in the prior quarter. There was broad-based spending in areas such as advanced packaging, microprocessors, analog, image sensors and power applications. These are areas where we've demonstrated strong momentum with our technology solutions, and I'd just point out that they are broadly distributed geographically. With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region was 26% of the total, which was up a little bit from the prior quarter, which was 22%. China domestic customers were the majority of the China regional revenue in the June quarter. The result was strong concentration of investments for our customers in the Korea and Taiwan region, which comprised 24% and 20% of our total revenues, respectively, in the June quarter. The US region declined from the record level that we saw last quarter, largely due to the timing of customer projects. The Customer Support Business Group revenue in the June quarter totaled approximately $1.5 billion, which was a decrease of 7% from the prior quarter level and 8% lower than the June quarter in calendar 2022. CSBG represented 47% of our June quarter revenue. This is a historically high concentration percentage, driven largely by continued strength in the specialty node investments which are serviced by Reliant systems business. The Reliant and Spares businesses continue to represent the largest individual portions of CSBG revenues. Both our spares and service businesses had been negatively impacted by low fab utilization levels, particularly at our memory customers. On the profitability side of things, our June quarter gross margin came in at 45.7%, above our guided range and up from 44% that we saw in the March quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase was related to cost and efficiency improvements, as well as a favorable product mix. We continue to expect to make further progress on our operational execution as we go forward. Operating expenses for June came in at $590 million, which was down from the $608 million in the March quarter, although it was a little bit higher than our original estimates coming into the quarter. Investing in research and development continues to be a top priority for Lam, with over two-thirds of our operating expense concentrated in R&D. We're focused on extending our product differentiation and ensuring that our competitiveness remains very strong. The June quarter operating margin came in at 27.3%, which was over the guidance range largely because of our strong gross margin performance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter came in low at 7.5% due to a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income and provision true-ups that occurred at the end of our fiscal year. We estimate the tax rate for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year will be in the low to mid-teens level. And as always, this rate will have some fluctuation quarter to quarter. Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $7 million in expense, consistent with the prior quarter amount and primarily related to our strong cash balances, as well as higher interest rates. And I'd just point out, from a return on cash standpoint, we're now realizing higher interest rates on our cash balances than we're paying on the longer-term duration debt in our capital structure. And as we've discussed in the past, OI&E is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of quarterly volatility. On our capital return activities, we allocated approximately $906 million to open market share buyback and we paid $232 million in dividends in the June quarter. We have $3.5 billion remaining on our Board authorized share buyback plan. For the June quarter, we returned 109% of free cash flow, and we're very much in line with our long-term capital return plans of returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow. June quarter diluted earnings per share came in at $5.98, over the high end of our guidance range. This was enabled from stronger revenue, improved gross margin and that lower tax rate. Diluted share count was 134 million shares, on track with our expectations and down from the March quarter. Let me now pivot to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $5.6 billion, which was flat with the March quarter. Days sales outstanding were 80 days in the June quarter. June quarter inventory turns came down from the prior quarter level of 1.9 times to 1.5 times. While we did bring inventory down slightly during the June quarter, the balance is elevated from historic levels. As business volumes reduce, we need to cancel a significant volume of purchase orders with our suppliers. As we work through these cancellations, we're taking more inventory than we need in the near term. This ongoing process will keep inventory higher than we'd like this year, frankly. We do expect inventory to come down though, albeit more slowly than we may have historically been able to drive it to. Non-cash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $68 million in equity compensation, $76 million in depreciation and $14 million for amortization. Capital expenditures were $79 million, which was down from the March quarter by approximately $41 million. Spending mainly centered on product development activities and our global lab infrastructure. We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,400 regular full-time employees, which was a decrease of approximately 1,300 people from the prior quarter. Most of this decrease is related to the restructuring actions we took earlier in the calendar year, with the timing of the headcount reduction showing up in the June quarter. Overall, we're on track with our transformation initiatives to improve our operations. And as we stand at the end of the quarter, we incurred approximately $143 million year-to-date out of an anticipated $250 million estimated range for calendar year 2023. Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September \u201823 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.4 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 46.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This improvement in gross margin is a function of our operational efforts as well as a beneficial mix. Operating margins of 28%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're purposely spending a little more in R&D in the second half of 2023. And finally, earnings per share of $6.05, plus or minus $0.75, based on a declining share count of approximately 133 million shares. So, let me summarize. The results this quarter demonstrate, I think, that we're on a solid path to strengthen our operations and our profitability profile. We're improving and optimizing all elements of the company and solidifying Lam's business foundation to ensure we're well-positioned for outperformance when WFE growth resumes. And I'll just reiterate what Tim said. We continue to see WFE a little bit second half weighted this year. Operator, with that, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Harlan Sur : Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. As we progress through this weaker period for the industry, right, the activity level can be quite noisy, but there will come a period of stabilization of fundamentals and business trends, right, fundamentals being the things that you can track, like your customers' utilization and business-wise, the level of pushouts, reschedules and cancellations. So, I guess, with that, has the team seen utilizations starting to stabilize, albeit at low levels? And has the rate magnitude of shipment pushouts, rescheduling also come down to more normalized levels? Tim Archer : Yeah. Thanks, Harlan. Yeah. I think that we've -- it probably varies by market segment, but clearly we've heard some of our customers, even just recently talking about more utilization cuts within certain device segments. Clearly, I would say it's slowing down as the majority of the cuts that were made in the first half of the year are kind of taking effect. I do feel like, and I made a comment about, in some ways, normalizing our operations is allowing the business to be more predictable. I think the same thing is happening on the end markets and customer side as well, where people are getting a sense of how the cuts that have already been made and how the capex reductions that have already been made are starting to flow through. So I do feel like we're in that position. And just as we, at this point, ticked a little bit up on WFE from our prior guidance of low to mid-70s to mid-70s, yeah, you're starting to see little strength in certain parts of the market, HBM being one of them. And as also we mentioned, some of the domestic China spending. So, I would feel like things are getting to the point where people are able to predict the business a little bit better than, say, six months ago. Doug Bettinger : And Harlan, this is Doug. Maybe the only thing I would add to what Tim said is we haven't really seen utilizations getting any better, quite frankly. You'll remember on the call last quarter we talked about, you'll see that from us in our spares and service components of CSBG. And as we sit here today, you're not seeing that at this point. So it's at a fairly low level and we really don't see it getting any better in the near term. Tim Archer : And the only other thing that we have said that when you think about especially utilization improvements in the memory space, we would anticipate Lam being the first to sort of benefit from utilization turning back on, just given our exposure in that space and the impact that it's had on our spares and service business through the first half of this year. Harlan Sur : Appreciate that. And then, I also appreciate you guys highlighting the advanced packaging opportunity. I think it's quite timely right, because you guys called out a slightly better memory WFE trends due to strong HBM DRAM demand. So you guys benefit both in your core memory silicon tools and now your advanced packaging portfolio as you outlined, right? But just given the overall sort of recent and strong demand pull for accelerated compute and AI capabilities, I mean this is driving advanced packaging demand across CPU, GPU, networking, memory, right? And so, your customers are capacity-constrained here. So do you guys anticipate your advanced packaging segment to grow this year? And can you just give us some sense on how big this segment is for Lam? Tim Archer : Yeah. I don't think we've -- we haven't exactly sized this business externally, but we -- it is growing and, it\u2019s in certain areas, especially as I highlighted things like etch for TSVs, copper plating for filling of those TSVs, pretty much anything related to the building of that advanced packaging structure through etch and deposition. So it is a strong area of our business right now, especially given the relative weaknesses that\u2019s seen in the other parts of the market. Harlan Sur : Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : Our next question comes from CJ Muse from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. CJ Muse : Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first question, Doug, last quarter you talked about expectations for 100 bps improvement at least exiting the year. You've clearly blown that away. So curious how much of that in the guide for September is due to mix versus kind of greater efficiencies that you've garnered? And what is kind of the new exit rate that we should be thinking about for calendar '23? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, CJ. Actually, I think if you talk to the leadership team at Lam, we're all pretty pleased where we've been able to drive the operational efficiencies in the Company and its gone quicker, I think, than I expected certainly. We're obviously beyond that 100 basis point improvement. Having said that, though, I would point to -- we do have a component of the September numbers that are mix related. I'm not going to, like, quantify it precisely for you, but we're doing real well operationally. I'm not quite ready to guide December for you yet. Except, I'd say I think we're pretty pleased where we're at and we're well beyond that 100 basis point improvement that we talked about, I think on that January call, if I recall, the first time we sort of talked about it. CJ Muse : Great, thank you. I guess the second question relates to CSBG. And how are you thinking about sustainability of Reliant? And then, as you kind of contemplate the timing of utilization picking up for memory, how do you see kind of a hand-off maybe from one part of the business to the other and how we should be modeling CSBG into September and beyond? Tim Archer : Yeah. I think that as you pointed out, I mean, obviously there is a Reliant component that's right now is quite strong. I talked about sort of at specialty technologies, I mean we're seeing still quite strong demand for our products across all of those different segments. Utilization driving spares and service to much lower levels than we've historically seen. And so, I think as people talk and worry about roll-off in the specialty technologies, maybe that does come at the time that the utilization picks up in the leading-edge and the memory fabs. But actually at this point, I would say we haven't yet seen demand for those trailing edge technologies to really be rolling over. I mean, demand is still quite strong for us, we're focused on new applications, new tool types and it's just not something that we're ready to forecast yet, although, again, as we've said nothing grows forever, but the broadening it feels pretty good to us right now. CJ Muse : So we should be modeling CSBG up in September? Doug Bettinger : CJ, I guided you to $3.4 billion in revenue, you can do whatever you'd like to do with the competition. You've got the total number. CJ Muse : Thank you, Doug and Tim. Appreciate it. Tim Archer : Yeah. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, CJ. Operator : Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question. Krish Sankar : Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And I have two questions. First one, maybe for Tim or Doug. Kind of curious, at SEMICON West a few weeks ago, Tokyo Electron spoke about a cryo etch product and I remember you had spoken about it a couple of years ago. So I'm kind of curious how to think about your high aspect ratio etch market share. And my understanding was, lot of it is geared towards 3D NAND and obviously NAND spending is at very low level. So I'm kind of curious, number one, how to think about your high aspect ratio market share and the cryo etch product, et cetera in that route? And then I have a follow-up. Tim Archer : Okay, great. Well, thanks, Krish, and I'll take it first. I think that relative to NAND, as you pointed out, I mean it's -- spending is at very low levels, down more than -- probably more than 75% year-on-year right now. But to this point of cryo etch, and I guess I would just say that at this point, Lam is the only company with cryo etch in high volume production. So it's an area where we do have strength, I mean hundreds of chambers of experience right now. We're the leader in high aspect ratio etch. I know that at the recent conference, competition has been out talking about a DTOR position for one pass at a memory customer for future node. But I think as probably everybody on this call knows, customers regularly engage more than one vendor when you're in the R&D stage for all these critical applications. And in this case, our production decisions are still quite a ways off. I look at Lam and our competitiveness. I mean, we take all of that experience that we have from years of leading in this space. We've developed a robust technology roadmap. We're engaged with the customer on a variety of different hardware and process innovations. But I think most importantly, when I think about our long-term competitiveness, we are still the only vendor that has this huge installed base from which every day we're getting learning about how to take processes from the R&D stage into high-volume production. And that's ultimately what really counts for affecting market share. And so, we've said in the past, we don't win every decision, certainly not always at the DTOR stage. But I think given where we are and where we've come from, we're very confident about maintaining leadership and market share in this space. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a follow-up on the advanced packaging. I understand you did mention the packaging SAM could double. And you spoke about the Syndion for TSV etch and SABRE 3D for metal dep. And if I remember, when I went back, looked at my notes, in 2015, you said it will be like a $200 million to $300 million opportunity. And then I think last you folks updated this in 2020 where you had said Syndion and SABRE actually doubled since then. I'm kind of curious. I understand a lot of it goes to HBM and all those things. So from that old realm of advanced packaging, how to think about like the opportunity from here? And also for AI, my understanding is some of your ALD for high k metal gate where DRAM can also be used. So if I put it altogether, is there a way to quantify where your Syndion, SABRE revenue numbers are today and how to think about it? And also, how to think about ALD for high k metal gate? Thank you. Tim Archer : Yeah. Well, you threw out a couple of numbers. We used to talk about a couple of hundred million dollar opportunity, doubling from there, puts it in the hundreds. I mean, it's growing from that point. I mean, it's becoming a sizable business for us. We just haven't quantified specifically for those two products. I think what you can take away is we talked about our market share position. We know -- I think everybody knows HBM and 3D chip stacking, those products also play into other elements of advanced packaging. It's a very fast-growing part of our business. And so, without giving you our forecast for those markets, I think you can apply what you think about how chip stacking and 3D packaging is building momentum. You know we have 100% market share. I think just -- we're very happy to see what's transpiring in that part of the market. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. And Krish, I would just add. You're right about -- I don't know how long back, we quantified it as few hundred million dollars, not billions of dollars, just to kind of frame it for you. But it is a very fast-growing component of the business as Tim pointed out. So, maybe that's a good way to think about it. It's something when you listen to every talk and everybody is very excited about high-bandwidth memory and its enablement of AI, we're right in the middle of all of that stuff from a packaging standpoint. Tim Archer : Krish, what I would say is in this environment, it's the -- those are the tool sets that people are actually pulling for in terms of accelerated deliveries. And so I think that gives you some sense of demand in that market. Krish Sankar : Got it. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thank you, Doug. Thanks, Tim. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Tim Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Tim, there's been a lot of debate that I hear on NAND WFE. And obviously, you have the highest share of all the major vendors. And you used to give this model that suggested $14 billion to $15 billion per year to drive sort of mid-30% bit growth, and there was some sensitivity around it. But since then, a lot of the producers have been basically down ticking on long-term NAND bit growth, Micron is now saying low 20s. So if you kind of use that old model, you get to something like $11 billion to $12 billion per year to drive low 20s bit growth. I know you've talked about more steps and so that number has gone up. But that's just optically, it's not a ton higher than the $9 billion or so that we're spending this year. And so I keep on getting a ton of debate in terms of just how much NAND WFE is going to come back. So I'm not asking you for a new model, but can you sort of like handicap what's changed vis-a-vis that old model in a market where bit growth seems to be lower going forward than what [indiscernible]? Tim Archer : Well, I think there probably is equal debate about what long-term etch growth is in the NAND space with some of the new applications coming out. But I certainly am not going to get crossways with our customers in terms of their forecast versus ours. I mean again, it's a market where we have such a strong position that ultimately -- we look to satisfy the technology roadmaps and the volume requirements of our customers, and that's kind of where we are. So right now, we know this year, NAND is extremely low. And without giving you our number, I mean it's -- I would say even if it gets back to something close to that model, it's a lot higher spending than where we are today. I think what's happened too is for Lam, specifically, is not only have we taken -- I mean, what might be different from that model of how much we capture of that SAM is the complexity of doing multi-tier stacking has increased our opportunity through a whole bunch of other steps that we've talked about in the past in terms of backside depth for stress management and gapfill -- ALD gapfills for plug fill, carbon sacrificial plug fills, lots of different types of applications. And so I think even an environment where you didn't do a lot better than the model, Lam would do a lot better. and we do a whole lot better than where we are today in such a low NAND spending environment. So I think we will get Tim, a new model out once we see a better view of the end demand picture, but that's the best I can do for you right now. Tim Arcuri : Thanks, Tim. And then, Doug, I guess just as a follow-up, how does your inventory situation play out? I imagine that it's still kind of a drag on gross margin, and you said it's going to come down, you said pretty slowly as you kind of get to the back half of the year. So can you quantify how much of a drag it is as you're -- as you still have pretty high costs, I would imagine, on these parts? And then when do you think it gets back to some sort of normalized level and it's not a headwind anymore to margin? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Tim, I don't really think about it right now as a drag on gross margin, honestly. It will prevent improvement in gross margin as we have to consume some of the inventory sitting there, right, to the extent that we're negotiating costs of some of the stuff down -- the stuff that we have is already on the balance sheet, right? So you've got to consume that first. So that's the right way to think about it. I don't really think of it as a drag in the near term. And Tim, it will come down, although what I tried to say in my script was it's going to come down a little bit more slowly than perhaps you've seen us be able to drive it to in the past because we canceled a lot of purchase orders, a lot of material in that as part of negotiating through that, you end up taking perhaps a little bit more than you need in the near term, we'll consume it over time. But it's just going to create a little bit of a delay in the reduction of inventory that you've seen us be able to do in the past. So it's going to be a little bit sticky, I think, Tim, through the year. And then I think it will -- it will come down through the year, but I think it's going to be a little bit sticky. And then you'll see it improve as we get into next year. Tim Arcuri : Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. Thanks, Tim. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Chin from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Chin : Hi, there. Good afternoon and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe just to backtrack on the increase to WFE this year of the, let's call it, $2 billion to $3 billion increase, is that mainly situated in second half? How should we think about, I guess, timing between calendar 3Q and 4Q? And I guess how much of the upside is HBM oriented? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Brian, I guess what I'd say is it is a little bit second half weighted, and the things we pointed to in our scripts were little bit of upside in China, China domestic and a little bit of high bandwidth memory. I don't think we're going to put a quantification between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the calendar year, except to say it's a little bit second half weighted. Brian Chin : Okay. That's fair enough. Maybe for my follow-up, clearly, there's a lot of focus on high bandwidth DRAM. But Tim, I was wondering, could you interject maybe your thoughts on the role of the role that SSD and flash storage might play in generative AI? And I'm sure that's factored into sort of that 1% penetration for AI servers in kind of $1 billion to $1.5 billion WFE investment? Tim Archer : It is. And I think that was even in my answer to the last question was, I think there's still a lot of debate as to how much storage really gets driven in this, but we're a believer that there is some element of demand driven there. I think that when we think about DRAM, there's a couple of things at play in terms of what drives it. One is, of course, the HBM also increases die size, I think, as you know. And that leads perhaps even greater WFE increase associated both with the silicon side of that as well as the packaging side. I'm not sure that same dynamic exists on the NAND side, but in terms of consumption, it feels like there should be some. But again, I'm willing to sort of let this play out a little further to see what the new model should be. And we talk closely to our customers to see what they're seeing in the marketplace as well. Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Brian, this is Doug. I don't know if this helps. But when I look at like the composition of some of these AI servers, nominally, there's roughly eight times the DRAM versus an enterprise class server and three times demand from a storage standpoint. I don't know if that will help you get your head wrapped around it. But DRAM is clearly a little bit more enabling on the compute side, but storage picks up also. Brian Chin : Okay. Got it. And probably scale out of these language models probably also could increase that storage potential over time. But thanks for your inputs. Appreciate that. Doug Bettinger : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tim or Doug. Just on China, I was hoping you guys could give a little more color in terms of what you're seeing on the ground. Doug, I think you said China was 26% of revenue and a big chunk of that was domestic. What\u2019s sort of the makeup by application, foundry, memory and other? And I guess, importantly, how should we think about sustainability going forward? It's really hard to tell from our standpoint, just given the spend is so strategic, right? It's not necessarily tied directly to near-term economics. So it's hard for us. But in terms of what you're hearing from customers, what is the feedback? And how much visibility are they giving you going forward? Tim Archer : Yeah. I think that it's split. I mean, obviously, on the domestic China side between some memory investments as well as a lot of specialty technologies, trailing edge focus on end markets, I think we're all familiar with automotive and industrial and those types of markets. As you mentioned, it's strategic. I mean, these are customers that are giving us long-term forecasts. Doug talked last quarter about deferred revenues are impacted by some of the down payments, at least within the visibility horizon that we need, we feel we have a pretty good view of a fair bit of investment that this continues in China, especially in those specialty technology markets where new fabs are emerging to try to capture some element of those trailing edge end markets. Toshiya Hari : That's helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, maybe one for Doug on gross margin. You talked about operational efforts and initiatives a couple of times. What exactly are you doing today? I know there's no ending to things like this, but which inning are you in, in terms of reaping some of the benefits? And you used to talk about Malaysia as a headwind a year ago, 1.5 years ago, where are you with the ramp there? And how should we think about the tailwind as volumes recover going forward? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yeah. I think, Toshi, the way to think about it is business is down. Right now, we're not really growing anywhere. I think as we see growth come back, whenever that is, the pivot to that Malaysia factory, which has an opportunity to do more than it's doing today, will be largely what you see from us. Now maybe to help with the restructuring activities, we embarked on plans to kind of restructure the cost footprint of the company. And maybe the best way to think about it, I've given you a forecast. We think we're going to take charges of $250 million at this point. We've taken $143 million at the end of the last quarter. So we still have some things we're working on. Although I would tell you the workforce portion of it is complete. We're done with that aspect of it. So that's behind us, we believe. So there's just some other things you're doing around looking at product, repositioning inventory, maybe a little bit of infrastructure stuff, we are embarked upon what will be a multiyear digital transformation initiative at the company, which will deliver efficiencies over the next several years. So there's a handful of things that are still coming in the future, I guess, is what I would describe. Toshiya Hari : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Toshiya. Operator : Our next question comes from Atif Malik from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Atif Malik : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions on leading-edge investments. I thought you gave an interesting data point that 1% AI server adoption leads to $1 billion to $1.5 billion incremental WFE. When I listened to the major foundry in Taiwan, they talked about 50% AI semi growth rate in the next few years but we did not really raise any CapEx this year. And we believe AI server adoption is probably like high single digit, 8%, 9%. So what explains the discrepancy in terms of not seeing a lift in leading-edge investments from the higher server adoption? Maybe it's just underutilization in other end markets. Doug Bettinger : I guess what I think about, Atif, is these are longer-term statements we're making. I think you're right about the composition of AI servers. In the short term, you're not really going to see a meaningful uptick in WFE, frankly. This is going to occur over the next several years. As more of -- and you're right, I think server volumes largely, I don't know, mid- to, I'd call it, mid-single digit percent of total servers. I think that grows over time. But in the short term, it doesn't really show up as quickly as you might think. It requires sort of capital investments to occur for future demand. That doesn't really happen in a meaningful way in the short term. Atif Malik : Got it, Doug. And then as a follow-up, you guys are very well leveraged to get all around, particularly on the edge side and they have been waiting for this technology inflection for the last three years. Your peer in Europe is talking about pilot line orders in December quarter this year. And Tim spoke about having better visibility versus six months ago. So my question to you is, when do you see the gate all around opportunity kind of grow meaningful for you? Is it the first half of next year or second half of next year? Tim Archer : I think it starts in line with the timeline that you just talked about and it's first -- through the first half and second half of next year. I mean these things tend to ramp and I think we are at the point where gate all around is going to become more meaningful. We'll see that in growth in some of the traditional products that are sort of lumped in with everything else. But then there are specialized products that we talked about, like selective etch those -- that suite of tools that's very specialized for applications like gate all around. We'll see faster growth in those segments, I think, as we move through '24 and on into '25. So yeah, maybe we're at that key inflection point. How that overcomes the rest of the market dynamics in '24? We're not ready to guide '24 yet, but some of those technology trends are starting to move in our favor. Atif Malik : Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Atif. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the China question. I guess, how are you seeing the impact of last year's export controls? Is that your China business has obviously done pretty well since then given the headwinds? Have there been -- have the restrictions been what you thought they would be? Is there anything that's different? And then there continue to be rumblings of additional controls. Do you have any visibility into what that could look like? Tim Archer : Yeah, Joe, we had talked last -- at the end -- towards the end of last year, right around the October 7 announcement that the impact to our business this year would be $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We clarified earlier this year that because we were able to make some shipments for trailing etch memory that we had not -- we weren't sure whether we could, that impact was going to be closer to the $2 billion mark. That is still what we estimate the impact of last year's restrictions, the October 7 restrictions on our business, $2 billion of revenues. Now in the same time, as China has shifted its focus towards the areas they can invest, these trailing etch, foundry logic and some of the trailing edge memory, we've seen that upticking a bit as we've moved through this year, and that's what we just spoke about. So I can't really speak to future regulations that may or may not be contemplated. We have a team in Washington DC that's regularly engaged with the government, make sure they understand our business and the details of the semiconductor industry, and that's about the best we can do right now. Joe Moore : Okay. Thank you very much. Tim Archer : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Tim, I'm curious, what should be the signs we should look for, for when memory utilization starts to pick up? And when orders to you guys start to improve? So if you look at historical trends, should we be waiting for like one quarter of pricing improvement, two quarters of pricing improvement? Just what are kind of the external metrics we should be keeping an eye on to try and predict when memory WFE should start to pick up? Tim Archer : Okay, a little bit difficult, I guess, just from the standpoint that, obviously, pricing improvement in memory, we tend to start to get customers interested in greater utilization of the fab. I think easier, I was going to answer relative to what you'd see in Lam. Obviously, once we start reporting an uptick in our CSBG spares and service businesses, obviously, it's an indicator that fabs are starting to be utilized more, and therefore, consuming spares and service. That's why I mentioned a little earlier that we are expecting to be really one of the first beneficiaries of a recovery in memory because so much of the -- there have been such deep utilization cuts in the memory fabs, that the spares and service side of our business has been impacted to a greater degree than we would have expected. When they turn those back on, that revenue should come back, and that will probably be your first indications from Lam's reported numbers of what's going on. Vivek Arya : I guess that was really the origin of the question because from what I heard on the call, I think you were suggesting there is a scenario in which CSBG revenues do start to pick up sequentially in the next quarter. But then you mentioned that the visibility around memory utilization, right, is not there from an industry perspective. So is there still a delta between the two? Doug Bettinger : Vivek, we did not suggest CSBG is picking up in the next quarter. That was not a statement anybody on the call made. So if we said something that led you did that conclusion, maybe we misspoke or perhaps you misinterpreted something else we said. Vivek Arya : Okay. Sorry. Maybe I misheard. Then maybe for my second question, Doug, the gross margin upside in Q3, right, it was quite sizable. I don't remember the last time you had such a strong gross margin upside. I think you mentioned something along the lines of mix. Is that mix unsustainable? Like is that likely to reverse, right, at some point? What is the right way to think about the sustainability of gross margins at these levels. So let's say if you assume that your sales continue to grow sequentially, then can gross margins continue to be at plus minus these levels? Or is there something that would dramatically change in the mix to change the trajectory of gross margins? Doug Bettinger : Vivek, I don't know if there's anything I'd point to that is dramatic. I suggested two things. One, our operational efforts in terms of just efficiencies and whatnot, it is maybe a little further ahead of where I thought it would have been. And I did point to favorable mix in the current quarter. You always see mix up and down, both products as well as customer mix. We're benefiting a little bit in the September quarter. I don't know if you'll see that same magnitude of mix benefit in December. The operational stuff, we will. I wouldn't run too far away from where we are right now into the near term anyway. But I would tell you, I'm very pleased with what we've been able to execute and the things that are in our own control, we've done extremely well. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question. Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, you talked about the bulk of the China $1.8 billion in deferred selling through in the second half. How much of that $1.8 billion actually is coming from China? And how much of that do you actually see yourself recognizing in the second half? And is it more in Q3, Q4? Do you have any idea on the timing of that? Doug Bettinger : Yeah. I've never said how much of it is in China. I've described it as newer customers, right? Customers that are new that we're not exactly sure of the creditworthiness, we require cash in advance before we build the tools. I haven't put a number on how much of it is China. Although a decent amount of it is. And what I said on how much that turns to revenue, as I said, the majority of it turns to revenue in the second half of the year. Stacy Rasgon : So, like, you have $1.8 billion of revenue that will be recognized in the second half from that deferred? Like, what would be the normal amount [indiscernible]? Tim Archer : No, Stacy, there's a normalized level of deferred revenue that's always here, always has been here, and you should expect to always be here. It's probably $750 million to $1 billion on a regular basis, I think, is what you've seen from us in the past. I wouldn't expect it to be too different than that. We've just got a lot of this cash in advance payments right now. That's why it's elevated. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Thank you. For my second question, so you're talking memory WP down in the mid-40s. Can you give us a feeling for how you see DRAM versus NAND breaking out in that? And whether or not your views on both of those have changed over the last 90 days versus like where we were a quarter ago? Tim Archer : Yeah, we've said that NAND is obviously by far worse. We said about -- about 75% year-on-year. So obviously, that was quite that. I mean DRAM then obviously less than down mid-40s. And I think that in terms of change, we've seen a little bit of improvement, as we've just talked about with HBM and some signs of, at least a little bit more optimism on our part that the DRAM would be the first to recover as a result of some of these trends. And again, just listening to our customers and talking to them, we've heard some customers talk about further cuts in NAND just in the last 24 hours. So... Stacy Rasgon : Like, do you think utilization in DRAM is still falling? Doug Bettinger : It's still at a pretty low level, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon : Okay, got it. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : You're welcome. Tim Archer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Blayne Curtis : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just following back up on what Stacy just asked. I was just kind of confused, you raised the outlook for WFE by a couple billion dollars, and it seemed like it was memory, that was the inflection. But then when you talk about memory, it seems like NAND is kind of flattish. And I'm just kind of curious how much of the increase is there in DRAM? Or is really the growth you're seeing in September more kind of this China part that Stacy was just asking about? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, Blayne, Tim pointed to two things. A little bit more in China and high-bandwidth memory as it's not a huge uptick in WFE, but those are the contributors. Blayne Curtis : Got you. And then I guess, I just want to understand, there's two moving pieces in foundry logic, and you've seen some delays at the leading etch. Can you just some commentary between those moving pieces, kind of the non-China piece, what are you seeing for the back half of this year? Doug Bettinger : We described in generally, when you look at WFE down, where it is memory is down mid-40s, and you probably know kind of where that is run rating suggested foundry logic, looks like it's down roughly 10%. And yeah, you're right, just been a little bit of a softening in leading-edge foundry logic. We talked a little bit about that last quarter. I'm not sure we're describing anything incremental. Perhaps we saw some things others didn't see sooner than they did. But that's how we see things setting up right now. Blayne Curtis : Okay. Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Blayne. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question please. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question. Vijay Rakesh : Yeah. Hi. Just a question on -- as you look at WFE for next year, any thoughts on how much some of these onshore greenfield fabs could contribute to CapEx for next year? Tim Archer : Well, I think it's -- as we're just in the middle of this year, it's too early to talk about '24 from an absolute number. But clearly, as we move through the next couple of years, I talked about this regional -- these regionalization efforts building momentum. I do think that we'll see that becoming a meaningful contributor to spending, not only here but in other parts of the world. Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And then on the AI side, obviously, you have mentioned packaging as a big roadmap there. When you look at CoWoS packaging, any thoughts on how much -- what your exposure is there and how you see that growing next year, I guess? Thanks. Tim Archer : Yeah. I mean everything related to advanced packaging is growing right now. And I would say Lam's exposure kind of across the board in etching deposition is very strong. So I called out specifically HBM, but you're right. I mean when you look at the importance of things like CoWoS-2 and AI packaged system, our exposure there even broadens further to the types of tools that we sell in there. And I mentioned this point, if people caught it, even in advanced packaging, we're having to invest in new technologies for atomic scale processing. And so you can see things like ALD being used in advanced packaging now. And so we're really in a world where ALD is being used for advanced packaging, ALE is being used for 200-millimeter GaN. I think that it is creating tremendous opportunities for Lam to leverage our really broad portfolio of technologies for all these new emerging growth opportunities. And it's pretty exciting. Vijay Rakesh : Got it. Thank you. Tim Archer : Yeah. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : And with that ladies and gentlemen, we'll be turning the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks. And management, are you able to hear me? Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be closing today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tina, and welcome, everyone. Lam produced solid results for the September quarter. Revenues came in above the midpoint of our guidance. And for the second quarter in a row, our gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share, all exceeded the high end of the guidance range. Our revenue and earnings per share are expected to improve further in the December quarter, demonstrating our continued strong execution in a cyclically soft calendar year 2023. Turning to the wafer fabrication equipment environment, we see spending for calendar year 2023 in the $80 billion range. The adjustment in WFE from our prior view of mid $70 billion is based on updated checks on non-Lam related markets, as well as restricted fab spending in China. It does not change our assumptions on Lam revenues for the year. On the device segment side, NAND weakness continued in the quarter as customers adjusted spending levels down and further lowered utilizations to drive a faster path to supply-demand balance. While NAND WFE is down significantly in 2023, supply actions are starting to have a positive impact. Customers have recently indicated that pricing trends have stabilized and NAND bit demand has increased from high single digits per cent year-over-year growth to high teens, as certain consumer markets are demonstrating greater demand elasticity in per unit content. DRAM spending is modestly up relative to our prior view, driven by better trends in high bandwidth memory related demand, as well as further upside from domestic China customers. Meanwhile, the foundry/logic segment is down slightly versus our prior baseline due to weakness in both leading edge and non-China based mature node investments. Looking forward, it remains hard to call the timing and pace of WFE recovery, but we believe Lam is in a good position to benefit from both cyclical and structural drivers of demand. When memory investments begin to recover from current cyclical lows, we expect to see early benefits in our installed base business as fab utilization improves, driving increased demand for spares, services, and equipment upgrades. Longer term, Lam's growth story is strong and is underpinned by the fact that etch and deposition are fundamental enablers of higher performance, more scalable semiconductor device architectures. To address emerging technical challenges, customers continue to identify new innovative use cases for vertical scaling. Backside power delivery is a good example, as it is an emerging device architecture being developed to address the scaling limitations of traditional back end of line integration schemes. Etch and deposition play a critical role in enabling this transition, and backside power delivery is expected to add close to $1 billion of incremental SAM opportunity for Lam per 100,000 monthly wafer starts. Today, Power interconnects increasingly compete for space in the complex back end of line wiring, while also taking up considerable area at the transistor level. Additionally, managing power loss between the external source and the transistors is increasingly challenging due to resistance. A backside power delivery architecture enables the separation of the signal and power delivery paths to free up valuable wafer real estate and minimize power loss. Furthermore, customers are implementing changes, including the use of thicker metal layers in order to efficiently integrate backside power with their advanced packaging schemes. New etch and deposition capabilities are needed, and the trends are favorable for Lam. Due to our existing strength in back end processes, we've been able to quickly extend the capabilities of our copper electroplating and [PCVD] (ph) deposition products to address the throughput and productivity requirements of backside power applications. We now have two record positions at a leading foundry/logic customer and expect these positions to continue to grow. As we approach the end of the year, our installed base is closing in on 90,000 chambers. As semiconductor manufacturing is becoming increasingly complex, our customer support business group is seeing more opportunities to deliver innovation, productivity, and yield enhancement. In the September quarter, we expanded our equipment intelligence offering and multiple customers to include the first big data application of high resolution optical emission spectroscopy or OES. The equipment intelligence capabilities we are delivering with OES are highly differentiated due to the complexity of collecting and interpreting plasma spectra in manufacturing over time and across a large fleet of tools. Our solution allows customers to resolve performance issues that would otherwise remain undetected. Recently, our CSBG team also put the industry's first collaborative maintenance robot, or COBOT, into a production fab at a leading customer. COBOTs help execute complex maintenance tasks with precision and reliability, leading to improved tool-to-tool performance matching and higher equipment availability. Also, we believe COBOTs as a new service offering can play an important role in addressing anticipated skilled labor shortages as semiconductor manufacturing expands and becomes more regionalized. Overall, we see tremendous vectors of growth ahead for the semiconductor industry and for Lam. Scaling and complexity challenges are driving multiple inflections towards 3D architectures and in turn greater etch and deposition intensity. Lam has a strong track record of execution and we are committed to making the strategic investments needed to position the company to outperform as the industry and our markets grow. Over the last two years, we've been laying the groundwork for greater scale and efficiency with the expansion of our manufacturing, supply chain, and warehousing capabilities in Asia in order to better serve our customers in that region. We are also increasing our R&D efforts to extend our technology differentiation and expand our product portfolio to capture new inflection driven applications. While the current business environment remains challenging, secular industry trends play extremely well to land strengths, and we are excited by the breadth of opportunities we see ahead for the company. Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. We delivered strong results in the September 2023 quarter. Our revenue came in above the midpoint of our guided range, and gross margin, operating income, and earnings per share all exceeded the high end of guidance. We're pleased with the company's execution during a year where memory WFE investment has declined by unprecedented amounts. Let's look at the details of our September quarter financial results. Revenue for the September quarter was $3.48 billion, which was up 9% from the prior quarter and down more than 30% from a year ago. Our deferred revenue balance at quarter end was $1.69 billion, which was a decrease of approximately $150 million from the June quarter, mainly related to revenue recognized tied to customer advance payments. We continue to have a higher deferred revenue balance versus historic levels given these advanced payments. We expect to recognize revenue in the December quarter for a portion of these deposits, which is comprehended in our guidance. Within calendar year 2024, I believe the deferred revenue balance will trend to more normalized levels. Let's now look at the segments. From a segment perspective, September quarter systems revenue and memory was 38%, which is an increase from the prior quarter level of 27%. The growth in the memory segment was driven by DRAM, which increased, sequentially coming in at 23% of systems revenue compared with 9% that we saw in the June quarter. As we noted in prior quarters, non-volatile memory spending is at historic lows in 2023. And for the September quarter, the segment represented 15% of system for revenue, which was down from the 18% that we saw last quarter. The spending levels in NAND are at dollar levels we have not seen since [planar] (ph) NAND was the predominant technology. The foundry segment represented 36% of our systems revenue, lower than the percentage concentration in the June quarter of 47%. The decrease is related to timing of leading edge investments within calendar year 2023. We performed well in this segment during the year with this quarter's spending coming mainly from mature node customers. And finally, the logic and other segments was 26% of our systems revenue in the September quarter, which was flat with the prior quarter level. Investments in this segment were heavily focused in the specialty device areas, including sensors, analog, and power devices. I'll now discuss the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at a high water mark of 48%, up from 26% in the prior quarter. The majority of the China revenue this quarter was from domestic Chinese customers. And we currently expect we will have another strong China geographic concentration profile in the December quarter as well. Our next largest geographic region concentration was Korea, had 16% of revenue in the September quarter and that compares with the 24% that we saw in June. Our customer support business group generated revenue in the September quarter, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, which was down 5% from the June quarter and 25% lower than the September quarter in calendar year 2022. Memory customers continue to operate their fabs at very low utilization rates. And customers are holding off on upgrading tools until there's more digestion of the outstanding inventory that is in the industry. The specialty technology market has been a bright spot this year, and we see that part of our business up year-over-year as we close calendar year 2023. Spares and the Reliant product line continues to be the two largest components of CSBG. Let me now turn to the gross margin performance. The September quarter came in at 47.9% above our guided range and higher than the June quarter level of 45.7%. Our strong gross margin performance compared to the prior quarter was driven primarily by favorable customer mix. We've improved elements of our cost structure during the year and are on track with our plan to improve gross margin from the March quarter level by approximately 1 percentage point as we exit calendar year 2023. September quarter operating expenses came in at $622 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $590 million. R&D as a percentage of spending was somewhat higher versus the June quarter, coming in at over 68% of our spending. The increased investment was focused on key technology inflections and development engagements with our customers. We will continue to invest in programs across multiple market segments to support our long-term strategic objectives for continued company outperformance. Operating margin for the current quarter was 30.1%, higher than the June quarter level of 27.3%, and more than 100 basis points over the high end of our guidance because of that strong gross margin performance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.4%, in line with our expectations. Our estimate for the December 2023 quarter as well as for calendar year 2024 is for the tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens range. Other income and expense for the September quarter came in at $7 million in income compared with $7 million in expense in the June quarter. The favorable fluctuation in OI&E was due to a variety of factors, including rising interest rates, generating income on our cash balance. OI&E will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of volatility quarter by quarter. Let me now pivot to the capital return side of things. We allocated approximately $830 million to open market share repurchases and paid $230 million in dividends in the September quarter. I'll highlight that in September we announced a 16% growth in our dividend in line with our plan to deliver disciplined annual dividend growth. Since paying our first dividend in 2014, we have now raised the dividend amount 9 times. We returned over 120% of free cash flow in the quarter, and we have $2.7 billion remaining on our board authorized share repurchase plan. Calendar year to date, we've returned 83% of our free cash flow to shareholders. September quarter diluted earnings per share was $6.85 over the high end of our guided range. Diluted share count was 133 million shares, on track of our expectations and down from the June quarter. Let me pivot to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the September quarter totaled $5.2 billion, down from $5.6 billion in the June quarter. The main driver of the cash decrease was obviously our capital return activity. I\u2019ll just mention, we also purchased buildings at our company headquarters as well as our Bay Area California factory for approximately $250 million, retiring the leases that were on the balance sheet. [indiscernible] cash was somewhat offset by improvement in days sales outstanding, which were 73 days in the September quarter down from the 80 days that we saw in the June quarter. Inventory turns were flat with the prior quarter level at 1.5 times. We continue to work to bring our inventory down, but as we've noted in prior quarter, we expect this to occur at a slower pace than we've done in the past. Our non-cash expenses for the September quarter included approximately $67 million for equity compensation, $76 million in depreciation, and $14 million in amortization. Capital expenditures for the September quarter came in at $77 million, which was flagged with the June quarter. Spending in September was primarily centered on product development activities and lab expansions in the United States and Asia. We ended the September quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was a decrease of 200 people from the prior quarter. Most of this decrease is related to the restructuring actions we took earlier in the calendar year with the timing of the headcount reduction occurring in the September quarter. Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2023 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.7 billion plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 47% plus or minus 1 percentage point. This level of gross margin reflects a continued favorable customer mix, albeit not quite as favorable as we saw in September. Operating margin of 29.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. The operating expenses embedded in this guidance increase from the September level due to growth in R&D. I'd also just mention that the June 2024 quarter will be higher as it includes an extra week in fiscal quarter which occurs every few years. It's going to be a 14-week quarter in March. And finally, earnings per share of $7 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 132 million shares. With our December quarter guidance, we see solid performance in both revenue and profitability. Lam is delivering strong financial results and technology leadership to our customers as we develop solutions for the next industry inflections. And before I wrap up, I'd just like to mention two things as you think about modeling our business into 2024. The first is that we're currently experiencing favorable customer mix that may not continue at the same level going into next year. This may create near-term headwinds for gross market. Second, given all the opportunities we see in long-term technology inflections, like date all around, dry resist, advanced packaging, changing metalization schemes, and continuing the evolution of other 3D structures like DRAM. 2024 may be an R&D spending growth year to take advantage of these future opportunities that we see. As a result, it's possible the historic leverage we've delivered takes a temporary pause. We will obviously continue to aggressively drive the operational efficiencies that we always have, and our longer-term profitability objectives remain unchanged. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Kim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. I had a question on China. So obviously, you've had a huge second half in China. Doug, it sounds like you think it's going to remain pretty strong in December. It sounds like maybe it's going to remain close to 50% of the mix. But it sounds like you're a little worried about -- sorry, not worried, but you think that it could actually come off a bit during the first half of 2024. Can you talk about that? What are the puts and the takes? I ask because, if you sort of back into where they're running in terms of WFE, they're running probably in the high 20s if I just take the back half of the year. So I'm wondering if that can sustain. Tim Archer : Yes, Tim, let me start on that and then let Doug add. I think that when we think about China investment, clearly it has been strong as we've messaged. Part of the mix story and why it's such a high percentage of our mix right now also has to do with the fact that other customers are not spending. We all know that memory and NAND in particular is at extreme lows. As we look into next year, and it's a bit too early for us to give 2024 WFE, so we're not going to do that. We think about longer term China and this overall move towards regionalization that you see people investing for long term demand in mature nodes. And so, we're not going to comment on whether we think it's sustainable in the first half or the second half of next year, but long-term, we do believe that there's growing demand in mature nodes that will drive China investment in a rather sustainable manner for the next several years. Doug Bettinger : And yes, Tim, just to parse my comments a little bit. I said, we believe China will continue to be strong, but I also said, albeit not quite as strong perhaps as we saw in September. And as Tim alluded to, the China investment is not going away. I don't know if it's up, down, sideways next year, but it's not going away. They're investing for opportunities in the market that they see. I think we're hopeful that rest of the market begins to recover at some point, because it\u2019s at pretty low points, and that will mitigate the China mix to a certain extent. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot for that. Can you just talk also, your major peer that makes litho talked this morning about there being a handful of fabs now with these new restrictions that they can't ship into. It's predominantly a litho thing, but can you just talk about sort of where we are in terms of restrictions? And then also, when you're talking about that what's the commonality in the etch and dep tool set for, let's say, 28 nanometer versus let's say 7 nanometer because technically you can buy tools for 28 nanometer and you can use them to pattern 7 nanometer from a dep/etch point of view. It's not as efficient but you can do it. Can you just talk about that? Thanks. Tim Archer : Yeah, Tim, I guess what I'd say is, we've reviewed the details of the regulations and our early assessment is we don't see any material impact to our forecasted business. Now, some of that has to do with the fact that we've already been quite restricted into what we can ship into China relative to technology engagement. And I think to your other point about tools being purchased for one node and used for another. I mean, that's something that obviously we're -- we have to follow very strict regulations to adhere to the US regulations. So I don't know that that's something that might be quite as common as what you're saying. So, but it's something that we make sure that we're fully compliant. Timothy Arcuri : Of course, Tim. Thank you so much. Tim Archer : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. CSBG down 8% year-over-year through the first nine months of the year. It did decline, as you mentioned, 5% sequentially. I assume the sequential decline was driven by continued utilization declines by your customers, especially your NAND customers, as you pointed out. You did talk about improving bit shipments for these customers in second half of the year, pricing stabilization, it sort of seems to be reflective of this sort of steadily improving supply demand environment. So does the team believe that utilizations have bottomed the cost of memory and foundry/logic customers? Have they started to at least stabilize at current levels? Tim Archer : Yeah, Harlan. What we said was that, those are the comments that obviously our customers are out talking about their business. There's clearly some time lag from when they start to see improvement in bit demand and in pricing before they start to bring some of that fab utilization back online. Our CSBG business, as we said, is affected by a couple of things. One is, clearly fab utilization are at levels that we really haven't seen in terms of how much capacity has been taken offline in the NAND space. And that's affected spares. But also, when you don't need to add bits and you're really trying to conserve your own spending, there's been quite a significant delay in technology upgrades to the install base. You have those tools offline, you're not really upgrading them at this point. So that has also hit the CSBG business in terms of our upgrades component. We anticipate that as the memory business starts to improve, which is what it seems to be the leading indicators are planning to, we would think spares would start to come back and the technology upgrades would be done. Because in that next leg of growth, customers are going to want to be able to scale on that next technology node for their own efficiency of manufacturing. So we're not seeing that yet, but the leading signs are that it will come. Harlan Sur : Thank you. And then you talked about this on the last earnings call, but you've got a strong position in [stat] (ph) chip architecture, advanced packaging. You guys have talked about this segment as being $200 million per year for Lam, potentially with the path to $1 billion business. On HBM specifically, where you have very strong share, right, HBM to HBM2 to HBM3 to HBM4, I think that there's a doubling of TSVs per chip, every new generation of HBM the DRAM stack height is also growing from like 8 to like 24 at some point. So this is -- this all is sort of a very strong tailwind for the team. Do you guys anticipate strong growth next year for your HBM/advanced packaging business? And some of your DRAM customers are also talking about HBM driving 10% of overall industry DRAM wafer starts. Is that how you guys are seeing it as well? Tim Archer : We'll let them talk about how much it affects their business. But from what it affects ours, I mean, everything you just said, I think we're generally aligned with, which is, we are trying to drive performance generally leads to more equipment needs and more sophisticated equipment needs. And so, we do see HBM. I talked about the uptick in our business that we've already seen from it. This appears to be an area right now that is still under-supplied, and we're seeing strong demand. And so, I don't anticipate, given the interest in AI that you hear so broadly in the industry right now, that our HBM business would grow pretty strong in the next year. To characterize our overall advanced packaging, you mentioned a couple hundred million. We basically said that we think that this could be a market in which our revenues actually exceeded $1 billion over the next -- sometime in the next fiscal years. So it is a rapidly growing part of our business. And 1 in which we have quite high share. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Harlan. Harlan Sur : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Tim, my first question is on equipment spending. I know you guys don't guide WFE until January, but your lithography peer was talking about maybe a softer first half and then things sticking up into 2025. And curious, if you're seeing a similar profile where first half is more in like a lamb and out like a lion. Tim Archer : In like a lamb, out like a lion. You know, I think that it's -- what we would say and without getting 2024 at this point, I think it is reasonable to my prior comments that I think spending will come back cautiously. And so, even though we may be seeing some of the leading indicators in some of our markets, I think people are going to want to see sustainability of that condition before we start to see significant spending. So if we were to think, and I believe that the general feeling is that 2025 is probably -- a lot of fabs opening, a lot of perhaps demand out in that timeframe. It's not unreasonable to think that you would ramp towards that as you move through 2024. Atif Malik : Thanks. And Doug, on the gross margins, you're still guiding to year-over-year growth but down sequentially because of the mix that you talked about. Can you walk us through which innings are we in terms of the structural gross margin improvement that you guys have been talking about this year? Doug Bettinger : Yeah, if you take yourself back to when we were talking about this in the March call, you know, we're at roughly 44% gross margin and we articulated a view that we would be able to drive 100 basis point improvement in that from the operational efficiencies that we were undertaking during the year. And I'm super confident that that's absolutely already happened, frankly, and we will continue to be in a good spot as we exit the year. Atif Malik : Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, either Doug or Tim, I don't know if you guys quantified. In the past you said like, the export restrictions with the $2 billion impact on your revenue. Is there a way to quantify with the new export restrictions? And I noticed that ALE was added to it, a way to quantify the impact in calendar 2024 or incremental dollar value? And then I have a follow-up. Doug Bettinger : Krish, there really was nothing material incrementally in what was clarified. I guess it was yesterday, right? So you're right. When we came into the year we said $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Now we've got clarification. We could ship a little bit. We took it on to $2 billion. That's still kind of what we see this year. And nothing incremental really came out yesterday. Tim Archer : And the reason for that, Krish, is that, in many of those cases, while specific tools might have been now, or technologies now, called out, they were already the types of tools that were used to produce the technologies that were below the limits that were already allowed. So we had already recognized that in our initial statement. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then now just to follow-up and to my -- I asked this question last time too, kind of like with respect to the whole cryo etch, the [indiscernible] etch versus [Tel] (ph), announcing a similar product, can you give us like an update on where you are market share wise on the [indiscernible] side? And is the cryo etch having any impact? Because my understanding is cryo etch does help the throughput, but it's probably a negative from selling number of tools for [indiscernible] etch NAND applications. I'm just trying to figure out how to handicap that. Tim Archer : Yeah, I mean, there's no change from what we've said before. I mean, Lam is a leader in high aspect ratio etch without a doubt. And I think that also on the last call I did point out the fact that while a lot has been made of cryo or these very cold etching conditions. This is already standard Lam condition. And so to a certain extent, many of these when we talk about our business and any impact that you talk about with throughput, those are already factored into our commentary. So it's not something that's new to us. And I think that in general, our focus in NAND has been and always will be, and memory in general, driving productivity at every technology node. That goes into our projected growth outlook that we always talk about. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Moore at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the DRAM uptick that you saw in the quarter. Can you kind of help us just understand qualitatively how much of that is coming from China? How much of that is from advanced packaging? Are you seeing kind of a resumption of technology spending? Just that kind of thing. What are you seeing that's driving that improvement? Doug Bettinger : I guess, Joe, one I would point to, and I'll let Tim add. Yes, China was a part of it, but it's not all of it. There was an earlier question about, hey, where we are with bandwidth memory? Yes, it's getting pulled in. I mean customers want it sooner, we can ship. You've got a transition from DDR4 to DDR5 with these new CPUs that are out there. So that also is a little bit of a bright spot. So I guess I'd point to both of those things as part of what we saw in DRAM. Tim Archer : Yes. No, I think that's pretty much it. I mean, as we've said before, you also have this transition to higher buy sizes, which ultimately will be a driver of wafer outs and therefore, equipment demand and probably starting to see some of the initial phases of that right now as well. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you. And then in your upfront remarks, Tim, I think you had talked about trailing etch, mature node somewhat weaker outside of China. Can you -- is there something there that could be a trend? Or is that just kind of more of a one quarter phenomenon? Tim Archer : Well, obviously, since we're not guiding future quarters, I mean, I don't -- I think it's just somewhat natural in general. I mean, we've seen in certain segments, very high spend rates as companies have looked to bring on capacity to meet demand in these mature nodes. And our industry goes through digestion phases where those tools have then started going up, and you get output and you sort of figure out whether demand is there, that requires more and it's what makes our investment cycle somewhat lumpy. And I think that's what we're really looking at right now. And if long-term demand, which we believe long-term demand for semiconductors is growing, eventually, you come back and put in more capacity into those fabs as well. Joe Moore : Okay. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a follow-up question to Joe's question on non-China trailing etch. And Tim, I apologize if I missed this, but can you point to any end markets or any device types that's driving the near-term weakness? And can you remind us how big or small of a market this is for you guys today? Doug Bettinger : Toshi, I'll take it and then let Tim add on. It's a broad set of customers investing when you look at this, the specialty nodes. I mean, it's across multiple customers unlike like leading etch foundry as an example. And so I can't really point to any one or another for you. And quite frankly, I think we all know there's inventory out there in a lot of these device types, but these are long-term investments as well, right? This isn't something that comes in one quarter and then goes away just because of what's happening in the near-term marketplace. But it is in any one segment or another, Toshi, just kind of the broad set of customers. Tim Archer : Yes. And Toshi, the only thing I would add is, I think this is going to be an area that I think we're going to have to sort of acceptably a little harder to forecast from the standpoint. It's also a part of the market that is impacted by a number of the different chip stack type government support activities around the world. And so, you may see as certain regions try to build up their capabilities we may not be able to point in that moment to the demand being greater than the supply, and that's why they're investing. As Doug said, this is about long-term build-out what I think everybody sees is a much bigger demand for these types of devices over all these various types of applications in automotive and IoT and CMOS image sensors, et cetera, et cetera, over time. Toshiya Hari : Got it. I appreciate the color. And then as my follow-up, one for Doug, on the 2024 model you talked about mix normalizing and you guys potentially experiencing some headwinds in gross margin. You also talked about 2024 potentially being a growth year from an R&D spending perspective. So I guess on gross margins, I guess what's the baseline that we should be working off of? Is the Q4 rate a good starting point? Or is that still kind of high given where China is. And then from an R&D spending perspective, I guess, relative to answer if you can kind of hold our hand and quantify how low leverage could be in 2024 versus history that would be super helpful. Doug Bettinger : All right, Toshi, I'll give you a couple of data points, maybe for a little bit of color, but I'm not going to guide next year. Yes, we're still at an elevated level of gross margin from customer mix relative to where I think things normalize. Maybe a good way to think of it is go back to the June quarter, which was before we saw a lot of this China favorable mix. That's not an unreasonable baseline to start from for gross margin. So anyway, I don't know if that's helpful. And then I guess what I described from an R&D standpoint. R&D, quite frankly, has to follow a cadence independent of the level of revenue sometimes. I don't know what WFE next year is going to be. I don't know what our top line is going to be quite yet. We'll give you some color next quarter. But I do know we see an enormous number of opportunities around these technology inflections that if we don't invest right now three, four years from now, we'll look back and say, why didn't we, right? I'd be all around. Tim talked about backside power. There's high bandwidth, there's so many things that play to the strength of what we do well. So I think if you look at the December quarter and compared to September, spending up, the March quarter independent of the fact that we're going to invest more in R&D is a 14-week quarter. So you got to comprehend that. And then we're going to grow R&D as we go into next year, maybe a little bit independent of what revenue turns out to be. I guess what I would want you to think about is, historically, when business grows at Lam, you've seen nice leverage in the model. It's maybe going to flatten out a little bit, honestly, is how I'm trying to like, come to you to think about it a little bit. And again, that's because we see a lot of opportunities that we think played at the strength and is going to set us up to win in the longer term. I don't know if that helps, Toshiya. Toshiya Hari : Yes, it makes sense. I appreciate the color, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I'm trying to understand the usual delta between the recovery in your CSBG business and your memory systems. So how effective of a leading indicator is CSPG recovery? And what is it telling you right now about conceptually when memory system orders recover? Like is it in Q1, Q2, Q3, of next year, like what has been that delta historically? And what is that telling you right now about when your memory system orders can recover? Tim Archer : Yes. I mean we've -- first, I'd point out the fact that it's been a long time if ever that we've seen fab utilization is quite this low. I mean our prior commentary had been that spares generally grows every year because the installed base continues to get bigger. One piece of that is true is the installed base continues to get a lot bigger. And in fact, we've said it's up more than 40% since the last cyclical downturn. And so the fact that we've seen spares and upgrades and all of these things sort of be off all at one time is pretty unique. We are anticipating that as fab utilization starts back, we'll see spares come back. And I think the one thing that will come back, and it's a little hard to predict is certain is the technology upgrade portion of this. It's been now a couple of years since any of these tools have been upgraded, and that will have to happen. In terms of your comment about offset, I think we'll -- typically, as customers start to turn the tools back on, you're probably a couple of quarters away from seeing further investments in the technology upgrades. And then I think when you're really talking about capacity adds, it's hard to predict what that time frame is because it really depends on many other factors about our customers' use of long-term demand. So I think the one thing we're certain is that we're at very low points now. We would anticipate things like utilization and spares and upgrades to start improving next year. And beyond that, I think we'll wait until January to give you a better view. Vivek Arya : All right. And for my follow-up, another China-related question. Part of your second half strength came, I believe, from clarification of some rules. And I was hoping you would quantify how much of that strength you saw in your shipments came from just that clarification? And does that kind of spill over to early 2024. I'm just trying to tease apart how much is sort of sustainable China strength versus how much is potentially from one-off clarification in rules? Or maybe those were not one-off, right? Maybe they're also sustainable. So just if you could give us some way to guide us to how we should think about China conceptually in your first half of next year. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Vivek, we're not going to guide you next year quite yet. But the clarification of the rules we described isn't changing, right? So we understood one node that a certain customer was doing was okay to ship to. The rules didn't change. We just had to do a little work to understand that. Collectively, as an industry, that's not going to go away. Having said that also, what our commentary on the call so far has been, I don't know if China is up now on our sideways next tier, but it's not going away. When we talk to our customers in China, they all communicate roadmaps that have multiyear horizons in front of them. Nothing new came from the regulations that you saw yesterday. So I see a level of sustainability in China as we go into next year and frankly, beyond. They have long-term objectives. Vivek Arya : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : HI, guys. Thank for taking my question. For my first question, you talked about in your WFE uptick on non-AM markets driving some of that. Am I oversimplifying? Are you just talking about litho or do you have something else in mind when you made that statement? Doug Bettinger : Stacy, it's primarily litho. It's litho and these restricted fabs in China that we didn't have complete visibility into what they were doing, frankly. It was those two. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. You have better visibility now? Doug Bettinger : I think we do. That's why we updated the number. We never get this exactly right, but we try to tell you what we think of it now. Tim Archer : Stacy, some of our visibility comes from the fact that our peer companies are reporting on the business and it\u2019s really their markets. So as the year goes on, we try to give you a view of the whole market, but obviously, we're most accurate on the Lam business. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Got it. But to be clear, I think you said there's no change to your forecast for the Lam business for the year, whatever that forecast is. Tim Archer : That's right. Because we understand that WFE quite well. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Got it. And so for my follow-up, I want to go back to the leverage question for next year. So I understand you're talking about like leverage, like maybe flattening out. Was that just a statement you just think OpEx, I mean, just to put on table OpEx growing with revenue, whatever revenue is? Or given the gross margin compression that we'll probably see at least from the current level, like do you think operating margins year-over-year could actually go -- could decline next calendar year? Or like just how do we think about those different pieces? Doug Bettinger : Stacy, if you look at what Lam has done over the last, I don't know, a decade, frankly. We've expanded margin as revenue has grown. At this point, I'm not sure what revenue is going to be next year, but I know we're going to invest more in R&D. That's what I'm trying to describe because we see all of these opportunities. And yes, I referred to the fact that we've got pretty favorable customer mix that likely mitigates somewhat next year. And so when you think about those two things, it's possible to think about kind of margin flattening off for a period of time. Our long-term profit objectives are unchanged. So I do want to reiterate that point as well. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. Tim Archer : Thanks, Stacy. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Srinivas Pajjuri : Thank you. I have a couple of longer-term questions, Tim. I guess if I look at the last five years, your logic and foundry business has been growing almost at a 30% rate. And historically, your memory was close to 60%. And now I think we're at the bottom kind of moving from 27% to 38% or so this quarter. I'm just curious, how do you think about the mix longer term, I guess, when things normalize for you? And what is, I think, in your view, what do you think is the ideal mix for you? And what implications, if any, that might have on your top line growth going forward? Tim Archer : Yes. It's a good question. It's a hard question to answer because the actual. Our view is we want more of everything. So we're not looking to reduce our position in memory just to make the mix look better. So we try hard every day. We have a fantastic position in memory, and we think there's still more to come there as over the next decade, I mean, NAND is going to scale customers saying to 1,000 layers, and that's a tremendous opportunity for Lam. DRAM going to 3D around the end of the decade, tremendous opportunity for Lam. So I'm afraid the memory side will keep growing simply because it's so well suited to our strengths. But you have heard us talk a lot about the fact that we see huge opportunity in the foundry logic side as well. And when Doug just talked about spending, I mean, I've tried to lay out for you in the last several quarters, the breadth of opportunities that are ahead of the company, many of which -- not all, but many of which are on the foundry logic side. I mean just to kind of recap some of those, I mean, the dry EUV photoresist and develop. When we said that's $1.5 billion opportunity over five years. And when you get towards the tail end of that five years, I mean, that's a revenue that's growing with the number of expanding EUV layers at every technology node after that. That's primarily foundry logic business. We talked about gate all around, about $1 billion incremental opportunity for Lam introduces opportunities to win new tools and selective etch and ALD. And so that's same expansion for us in foundry logic and opportunity to grow. We talked about advanced packaging. I mean you've already seen what's happened with not only the HBM side of AI, but also the entire formation of these big AI systems using interposers. Lam's invested now in panel processing as a way to ultimately bring down the costs of some of this chiplet -- these chiplet applications. And then finally, today, I just talked about backside power distribution as a new way of being very creative about how you use that backside of the wafer is additional real estate and it opens up a lot of new opportunities for us, and that's primarily a foundry logic application as well. And so really, what we're talking about is Lam has a long way to go to expand our SAM, especially on the foundry logic side. That's what we're investing for. And each of these is a $1 billion-plus opportunity for Lam over the next several years. And so we're pretty excited about that. But we're not giving up on our strong memory positions. Srinivas Pajjuri : Thank you. I appreciate that answer. And then my quick follow-up on the HBM, I guess, technology itself. A lot of questions have been asked already. Just on the capital intensity of HBM. Tim, I mean, I know you said the die size is larger and I guess, cycle times are longer, et cetera. But is there a way to think about capital intensity per wafer or per bit? How we should think about HBM versus traditional DDR? Tim Archer : Well, I think it's a -- I don't know that we've quantified that number, but it's -- it obviously is a much higher performance die than our device, and it does -- it is bigger and takes more capital. And so therefore, it's a performance-driven application. From our perspective, though, what really is interesting is that, many of the new tools that get added to enable HBM or Lam tools or tools that are in our market, things like silicon etch and copper plating for the TSV formation. And so that's what really makes it an even better transition for [indiscernible] company like Lam. Srinivas Pajjuri : Got it. Thanks, Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Sri. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brian Chin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Brian Chin : Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. So about a week ago, the U.S. relaxed its licensing requirements for some foreign companies that operate more advanced fabs in China. I know it's fairly recent, but have you seen a positive impact yet from this change in the licensing policy. I did note that in talking about China remaining a good concentration in the December quarter. It sounds like maybe there could be some shifting there between local and maybe foreign domiciled companies? Tim Archer : Yes. It's pretty -- that comment is pretty recent. But I think relative to multinationals, wherever they operate, whether China or certainty of being able to make the investment and benefit from that long term is very important. So obviously, in the last couple of weeks, we haven't seen any movement that we had talked about. I think long term, it allows people -- it allows our customers to ultimately make the right decisions for them about where to invest. And that is especially true when you think about our installed base and the upgrades to the installed base and a customer willingness to sort of move forward with those upgrades with certainties. Brian Chin : Got it. That's helpful. And then a lot of questions have been asked about sort of service spares and utilization improvements. But just curious, if memory companies are kind of talking as is they'll realize some of that utilization improvement, not just through increasing wafer starts, but also through some reduction in wafer start capacity as they emphasize newer nodes or capital efficiencies on some wafer loss there. How are you thinking about how that impacts maybe the trajectory of your service and spares revenue growth in calendar 2024? Tim Archer : Well, I think that we have to see and we -- as we said about the -- it's difficult to predict the pace of the recovery. But what happens there is we're just trading off 1 part of our business that CSBG business for another. If upgrades happened before spares, you're right, it brings utilization down. But there's also something that we've said, which is as technology moves forward, many of those applications become more spares intensive because the processes are longer and more demanding. And so I would just say that we're going to see a rise in both parts of our business as fab operations recover and customers start to fully utilize the equipment in those fabs. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mehdi Hosseini with [SIG] (ph). Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just two quick follow-ups. Opportunities with the back side power rate. Should I think about it more of a 3-nanometer or extension of 3-nanometer? Or are those opportunities materializing when we migrate to 2-nanometer. And I have a follow-up. Tim Archer : Yes. I think that it's still a little bit out in the future, I mean, you could go look at our customers' road maps and what they've said publicly, and I think that's probably the best way to put timing on it. I think what we're trying to highlight is the fact that our -- if you think about the challenges across almost every device, we're becoming more and more convinced that the technology solutions to those challenges involve vertical scaling, they move to 3D and you're seeing that backside power, advanced packaging, gate all around. These are -- it is something that is playing extremely well to our strengths in etch and deposition. And so timing is hard to predict, but the certain -- relative certainty of those changes happening is quite high. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And a quick follow-up for Doug. What should we think of a normalized or normal deferred revenue level? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Mehdi, in the past I've suggested maybe something around $1 billion is a normalized level and we're somewhat elevated from that. the longer we remain elevated, maybe the normalized level picks up a little bit, but I'll leave that statement, what I said, maybe roughly $1 billion. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from [Chris Caso] (ph) with Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thank you. Good evening. This question is about where your lead times delivery times are now and generally your ability to react when demand ultimately returns. You made some comments before that your customers you think would need to see some significant improvement before they started spending. Does this mean they have some -- a little bit of luxury of time to see things get a bit better before they start calling you and increasing orders. Tim Archer : Yes. I think that if we were to go back and talk about lead times compared to pre-COVID, I would say that generally still extended, but for a variety of reasons. I mean I talked about the investments we've made in our supply chain and our manufacturing facilities. A lot of that has to be more responsive, but I think we will be able to respond when realistically when demand starts to come back. Now in certain areas, it's a little tighter than others. And I think that's where, again, we still continue to work very closely with our customers to make sure we have good forecast as we talked about. High bandwidth memory has been an area that I think has been in tighter supply. And the good thing about the investments we made in our global operations is that in certain cases, we're able to respond a little bit more quickly than customers have urgent needs. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up. If you give a little more clarity on the extra week you're expecting, I think it's in the March quarter, both on -- do you expect a revenue impact from that extra week? And what do you expect the cost impact to be? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Usually, you don't really see much of a revenue impact, frankly. You kind of manage based on what customer wants when. But I know for sure, with an extra week, 14 weeks instead of 13, you got more salary expense, you've got more time to use project materials and whatnot. I don't know. I didn't give you a specific number, but I think it's pretty well chronicled about there. When people have a quarter coming in like this, how much spending grows just because of it. I'm not going to put a number on it, but just think about 14 versus 13. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. We can do the math. Thank you. Tina Correia : Operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Yes. Our final question will be from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Thanks for squeezing me in. In the past, you guys talked about memory spending recovery will go in several phases from increasing utilization to tech upgrades and then capacity expansion. One of the memory customers talk about converting some of this excess capacity to address the advanced note. Are you seeing that dynamics happening across other memory suppliers? And how does that change your view in terms of the timing of capacity expansion? Doug Bettinger : Sidney, you were breaking up a little bit. I think you were asking about the cadence of when utilization comes back, what we think will happen, I think that was your question. And I think what I would tell you, first, spares comes back. Second, you'll see upgrades, and upgrades will have to happen obviously, some of the customer base has taken some things offline. So there's a spend that needs to occur to get that back online and up to speed and then eventually new equipment gets purchased. That hasn't changed. Sidney Ho : Okay. So my question was more about some of your customers actually trying to convert some of the excess capacity to address the advanced notes, meaning that it seems like the timeline is compressed. Are you seeing all the memory suppliers doing that? Doug Bettinger : We don't talk about any one customer or another, but that will show up in that upgrades commentary that I was talking about, the stuff that gets taken offline eventually needs to get upgraded. That's the upgrade spend in CSBG. Sidney Ho : Okay. That's it. Maybe last question for you. Given your position in gate-all-around, has your timeline changed at all in terms of when do you expect to see gate-all-around related revenue as compared to three months ago? Maybe just remind us when that is going to happen? And what are the leading indicators you watching to gauge that timeline. Thanks. Tim Archer : Well, yes, it's -- I don't know that our timing on gate-all-around around has changed much from three months ago. I think that, again, it's a means of scaling device performance and device performance is something is important to our customers and their [indiscernible]. So we're just engaged with customers to make sure our tools get qualified into those new nodes and when they decide to ramp them, then we'll be ready as well. Sidney Ho : Okay. Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Sidney. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to the management team for closing remarks. Tina Correia : Thank you, operator, and we appreciate everyone for joining. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

Lam delivered strong performance in the December quarter. Revenues, gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above the midpoint of our guided ranges. Our results for December closed out a calendar year 2023, in which Lam executed well amid a decline in overall wafer fabrication equipment spending. Compared to the prior year cycle trough in calendar 2019, we achieved a near doubling of EPS. There are a few reasons why Lam has evolved stronger cycle to cycle. First, we have improved our positioning in the foundry, logic and specialty technology segments through sustained investments in innovation and new products. As a result, we have grown our total non-memory revenue share, and we continue to gain momentum at key technology inflections. Second, we have delivered tremendous growth in our customer support business group. Lam ended calendar 2023 with approximately 90,000 chambers in the field, an installed base almost 50% larger than in the previous cycle. CSBG revenue has grown by more than 80% from 2019 levels. And finally, we have further improved our ability to manage costs and drive operational efficiency through cycles, delivering operating margins in 2023 that were nearly 2.5 points higher than the prior trough. Turning to WFE. We estimate that 2023 spending ended in the low $80 billion range. This is up slightly from our prior view, driven by continued strength in domestic China spending predominantly in equipment segments where we do not participate.  Overall, memory WFE was down nearly 40% year-on-year, led by cuts in NAND spending of more than 75%. Non-memory WFE decreased in the mid-single digits range with mature node growth in China, partially offsetting declines in leading-edge node spending in the rest of the world. As we enter 2024, the business environment remains muted. However, we expect a modest recovery in memory spending to drive a stronger exit to the year. Our early view of WFE spending for calendar 2024 is in the mid- to high $80 billion range. Growth in DRAM will be driven by capacity additions for high-bandwidth memory as well as node conversions. NAND spending increases will largely come from technology upgrades. We see foundry logic spend growing in 2024 with higher leading-edge investment, offset in part by declines in mature node investment outside of China. Overall, we believe domestic China spending will be stable in 2024. Longer term, the setup for WFE investment is robust. With semiconductor revenues widely expected to reach $1 trillion around the end of the decade and device manufacturing complexity continuing to rise, we believe WFE spending will need to roughly double from today's levels. Lam's served markets of etch and deposition should outpace growth in WFE overall. For this reason, we have been executing a series of strategic actions to best position the company for the growth opportunity ahead. Importantly, we have remained committed to these initiatives despite the challenging spending environment over the past several quarters. First is our commitment to R&D, including planned spending increases in calendar year 2024 to extend our differentiation in products and services targeted at next-generation semiconductor device inflections. This next era in semiconductors will be defined by the broad move towards 3D architectures and advanced packaging to solve scaling challenges. We believe this will, in turn, drive an increase in etch and deposition intensity over the long term. Our focus is on multiple billion dollar SAM expansion opportunities across memory and foundry logic. We have profiled our advances in gate-all-around, backside power delivery, advanced packaging and dry EUV patterning over the past several quarters, and our solutions are continuing to gain traction with customers. In the December quarter, we secured additional advanced packaging wins for high-bandwidth memory, which is critical for enabling advanced AI servers. Our SABRE 3D tools, best-in-class plating uniformity along with our ability to demonstrate an overall cost of ownership advantage made Lam the clear choice over a large competitor. In 2024, we expect our HBM related DRAM and packaging shipments to more than triple year-on-year and outpace WFE growth in this segment by a significant margin. The specialty technology markets are also yielding a diverse set of new opportunities for Lam. For instance, we have recently delivered pulse laser deposition technology to customers targeting high-volume manufacturing of MEMS and next-generation high-frequency devices. We accelerated our entry into this market by integrating technology we obtained via small acquisition onto a production-proven Lam platform. Compared to competing deposition methods, Lam solution enables more highly doped scandium aluminum nitride films, which delivered the piezoelectric performance and cost our customers require. The second area of focus for Lam has been our investment in facilities close to our customers. By establishing process development capabilities near our customers' R&D fabs, we are maximizing collaboration and accelerating time to solutions. We have also made progress ramping supply chain and manufacturing operations within our customer ecosystems. These in-region capabilities enhance our responsiveness and resilience for customers and create significant economic value for Lam as we leverage the benefits of global flexibility. Our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia is poised to fully scale in the coming WFE upturn, providing us the capability to nearly triple the percentage revenue contribution from our lower cost manufacturing locations versus a few years ago. And finally, Lam is concentrated on reengineering our business processing systems to drive operational excellence at greater scale. Investments in digital capabilities like virtual twinning, advanced simulation and AI are helping us to accelerate problem solving, and we are building equipment intelligence capabilities and in-fab service automation into our most advanced product road maps. As we complete our reengineering efforts, we are also intent on achieving organizational agility. In this regard, we are announcing a small workforce reduction predominantly at the executive level to align our resources with our execution priorities and drive efficiency and speed of decision-making. In calendar 2023, Lam delivered solid results while investing to build strong capabilities for the future. Looking forward, I am confident that our strategic global infrastructure and differentiated technology portfolio provide Lam with the tools we need to capitalize on the robust semiconductor growth expected in the years ahead. Thank you, and now here is Doug. Douglas Bettinger : Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. We delivered strong financial results in calendar year 2023. Our revenue came in at $14.3 billion and diluted earnings per share at $27.33. We're pleased with the company's execution during the year where the memory WFE mix reached historic lows. Let's look at the details of our December quarter results. Revenue for the December quarter was $3.76 billion, which was up 8% from the prior quarter and down 29% from a year ago. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was $1.93 billion, which was an increase of $238 million from the September quarter, which was mainly tied to growth in customer advanced payments. We continue to have a higher deferred revenue balance versus historic levels given these customer advanced payments. From a segment perspective, December quarter, systems revenue in memory was 48%, which is an increase from the prior quarter level of 38%. The growth in the memory segment was led by DRAM, which was at record levels on a dollar basis, coming in at 31% of systems revenue compared with 23% in the September quarter. DRAM is benefiting from growth in high-bandwidth memory capacity and the move to DDR5, which is needed to address AI-related workloads, and it's also benefiting from shipments to China. As we've noted in prior quarters, nonvolatile memory WFE was at historic lows on a mix basis in 2023. For the December quarter, this segment represented 17% of our systems revenue, which was up a little bit from 15% in the prior quarter. The slight growth was predominantly related to investments in certain technology projects. NAND customers have aggressively reduced capacity throughout the year to bring inventory levels down. The Foundry segment represented 38% of our systems revenue, a little higher than the percentage concentration in the September quarter of 36%. Growth was driven by new fab shipments in various regions across several process nodes. The Logic and Other segment was 14% of our systems revenue in the December quarter, which was down from the prior quarter level of 26%. The decline was driven by general mature node softness as well as the timing of customer projects. Overall, in the Foundry and Logic segment, we performed well, delivering on the share gains that we've previously been discussing with you. Now I'll discuss the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 40%, which was down from 48% in the prior quarter. Most of our China revenue in the last 2 quarters was from domestic Chinese customers, and we expect spending from this region to be stable overall in 2024. China as a percent of our revenue is expected to stay relatively high in the March quarter, but it likely trend lower as the year progresses. Our next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 19% of revenue in the December quarter versus 16% in the September quarter. And finally, Japan and Taiwan rounded out the remaining of our top 4 regions. The customer support business group generated revenue in the December quarter of nearly $1.5 billion, up 2% from the September quarter and 16% lower than the December quarter in calendar year 2022. Overall, the business was steady, and we continue to see our memory customers operating the fabs at very low utilization rates. Given the strength of the installed base units, we have a strong foundation for growth with technology conversions and utilization rates resume growing. Spares followed by the Reliant product line continue to be the 2 largest components of CSBG. Turning to the gross margin performance. The December quarter came in at 47.6%, which is above the midpoint of guidance and generally in line with the September quarter level, which was 47.9%. We've improved elements of our cost structure during the year and delivered on our commitment to improve gross margin from the 2023 March quarter level by approximately 1 percentage point as we exited calendar year 2023 from those operational improvements. December quarter operating expenses were $662 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $622 million. R&D as a percent of spending was higher versus the September quarter, coming in at over 69% of total expenses. The increased spending reflects our ongoing focus on extending our product and technology differentiation across those critical inflections that Tim mentioned earlier. We will continue to grow investments across multiple market segments to support the long-term strategic objectives for ongoing company outperformance. Operating margin for the current quarter was 30%, in line with September quarter level of 30.1% and above the midpoint of our guidance primarily because of a stronger gross margin performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 12.3%, generally in line with expectations. Looking into calendar 2024, we believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid-teens with the normal fluctuations quarter-by-quarter. Other income expense for the December quarter came in at $5 million in income compared with $7 million in income in the September quarter. The slight fluctuation in OI&E was mainly due to variations in exchange rates. OI&E will continue to be subject to market-related fluctuations that could cause some level of volatility each quarter. On the capital return side, we allocated approximately $640 million to open market share repurchases, and we paid $264 million in dividends in the December quarter. For the 2023 calendar year, we returned 79% of our free cash flow, totaling $3.8 billion, which was largely consistent with our long-term capital return plans of 75% to 100%. December quarter diluted earnings per share was $7.52 over the midpoint of our guidance. Diluted share count rounded down to 132 million shares on track with our expectations and down from the September quarter. During 2023, we repurchased nearly 5 million shares through our share buyback program. And I would just mention, we have $2.1 billion remaining on our Board-authorized share repurchase plan.  Let me turn to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the December quarter totaled $5.6 billion, up from $5.2 billion in the September quarter. The increase was largely due to collections, offset by cash allocated to share repurchases, dividend payments and capital expenditures. Overall, 2023 was a record year for cash flows from operations coming in at $5.3 billion. Days sales outstanding was 66 days in the December quarter, which was a decrease from 73 days in the September quarter. As a result of our operational focus and execution, I'm pleased to report that inventory turns improved to 1.8x from the prior quarter level of 1.5x. We will continue to work on bringing inventory down throughout calendar 2024. Our noncash expenses for the December quarter included approximately $70 million for equity compensation, $78 million for depreciation and $13 million for amortization. Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $115 million, up $38 million from the September quarter. Spending was primarily centered on product development activities and lab expansions in the United States and Asia, supporting our global lab investment strategy. We ended the -- excuse me, the December quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was flat with the prior quarter. Let's now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2024 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $3.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 48%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This gross margin guidance is reflected -- reflective of continued favorable customer mix. I do expect this favorable mix to mitigate somewhat as the year progresses. Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. I would again highlight that the March 2024 quarter will have higher spending as it includes an extra week in the quarter, which occurs every several years. It's a 14-week quarter. And I will also remind you we will be growing R&D spending this year.  And finally, we're expecting earnings per share of $7.25, plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 132 million shares. We continue to be focused on improving our business operations to optimize efficiency and effectiveness as WFE growth occurs. Our profitability metrics reflect the progress we made during calendar year 2023, with business realignment and transformational activities well underway. We'll see these activities continue in the first half of calendar year 2024. Including the cost incurred for these improvement activities and headcount reductions that we saw in calendar 2023, I now expect we'll spend in total $300 million for these actions, which will continue to be reported in our non-GAAP adjustments. I had previously told you we would spend $250 million over 12 months. It's now $50 million higher and 6 months longer. So let me conclude. Over many semiconductor cycles, Lam has established a proven track record of successfully managing our business. With the actions we've taken over the course of the last several quarters, we expect to strengthen our operations and technology leadership and further enhance our profitability profile. When revenue scales into the next upturn, Lam will be stronger, better positioned and more efficient. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Tim Arcuri from UBS. Timothy Arcuri : I guess my first question for you, Tim, is I wondered if you could sort of translate. Obviously, you heard your big litho peer that reported today that had these huge orders and it looks like a couple of billion dollars in EUV orders for DRAM. So that sort of translates to an extra $9 billion to $10 billion, something like that. So it seems mostly for shipments during this year and even into next year for them. So like maybe you haven't seen that yet. But can you talk about what that tells you about the future of that segment? And I know you think it's going to be up, but it seems like it could be up a lot. And maybe any change in the planning outlook or the discussions that you're having with your DRAM customers? Timothy Archer : Sure. Thanks, Tim. And obviously, WFE is a tricky thing to forecast because generally, we have a very good view of certain segments of the market. And we try to give an overall view of WFE, and we do that based on listening to peers, talking to customers and making our own assessments. Yes, sometimes we get it wrong. And I guess we're always in a period of adjusting that. I think though -- I didn't -- I don't think there's anything out there that is completely inconsistent with what we've said. We've said WFE is up this year, modestly recovering because of memory. It's -- we'd see a stronger exit to the year. And I think to the magnitude, I think we're just going to keep watching it and having those conversations with customers. In this period, lead times of equipment and the framework in which certain pieces of equipment need to be ordered and brought into fabs can differ equipment supplier to equipment supplier, and maybe there's something at play there. But I think it probably further reinforces our bullishness that memory has been at a historically low mix of WFE. We said that memory spending across both DRAM and NAND. We felt was at unsustainable levels. We said that on pretty much every call last year. And -- so I think that it's not a surprise that, that eventually corrects itself. What I would point out is that we don't spend a tremendous amount of time trying to get the timing exactly right. In my script, I talked a lot about strategic actions, which play out over years and, in fact, catch the DRAM inflections that are coming now. The strength we have in high-bandwidth memory, the positions we have in applications in DDR5 and beyond. Those were established by us seeing DRAM opportunities years ago. And I think we're continuing to report more and more growth in that segment. And I think we'll just continue to do that. So we tend to take a long-term view of technology and spending patterns. Douglas Bettinger : And Tim, it's Doug. I'll just remind you something that I know you know very well that with those lead times are generally much longer than ours are in etch and deposition. And you never buy litho without eventually buying the process equipment that goes along with it. So if they're seeing something, we will see it, too. Timothy Arcuri : Totally, Doug. Yes, for sure. So I guess for you, Doug, super quick. So there's kind of a lot of moving parts, I know going on in gross margin. I know that the mix is helping you. And I know you're probably getting some tailwinds from some cost relief and things like that. So what's the right normalized margin? I know maybe 48% is not the right normalized number, but is it like is the mix helping you by 50 basis points, and that's what sort of goes away. Can you sort of help us there? Douglas Bettinger : Yes. Tim, I'll remind you what I said last quarter call too, still kind of the same thing. The customer mix is benefiting us again in the March quarter guide, maybe even a little bit more than it did last quarter. I took you back to that June quarter of last year before we had such a favorable geographic mix and that largely is what's driving the customer mix. We were around 46% gross margin, 45.7%, I think, if I remember the June quarter specifically. That's not a bad place to kind of start when mix normalizes back to maybe more normal levels. So think about it that way. Somewhere in between there and where we are here. These operational improved install that we've been talking about are real things and as growth resumes and we know growth will resume at some juncture, we should benefit from like repositioning the company to these lower cost locations. So that's still on the come line. but it will require some level of growth in the business. Operator : The next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Again, going back to your large litho peer that reported this morning, right? They called out seeing an increase in customer utilization of their litho tools, both in memory and in Foundry and Logic, appearing that this is the early signal of a positive turn in cyclical dynamics. I know you guys are also track in real time utilization, activity rates of your customers. I know they're at very low levels, but are you guys starting to see some pickup in utilization rates across your customers? And is that also maybe giving you further confidence in your modest growth outlook for WFE this year? Timothy Archer : Yes. We've said in the past that we -- obviously, we track that pretty closely. I think you've heard our customers talk about increasing utilization. We've certainly seen and heard from our customers talk of strengthening in pricing in those markets. How we said it would affect us? I mean, in markets like NAND, we said we would -- with so much utilization taken offline, we would see some uptick in our spares business. We see that start to flow through upgrades. And as I mentioned in my script, we anticipate that a big portion of the uptick in memory spending this year will be coming through technology upgrades where -- the installed base is Lam equipment and therefore, the benefit -- a lot of the benefit of that WFE spending will flow to Lam as we do those technology upgrades. The other element of the spending will be coming from the additional equipment that needs to get added to enable things like high bandwidth memory. And we've talked about the fact that in high bandwidth memory, Lam has a 100% market share of the critical technologies needed for stacking the DRAM. So I'll let our customers speak to what their utilizations are but what I'd say is that all signs are pointing to the memory market beginning to come out of its pretty darn near historic downturn over the last couple of years. And so that's what we're looking at for this year. Harlan Sur : That's very helpful. And then you mentioned this, I mean, your CSBG business has grown at a 17% CAGR since 2019, right? That's significantly faster than I think it was a 10% to 11% CAGR target that you guys put out at your last Analyst Day. I know it's been weak over the past few quarters, just given some of the supply side discipline of your customers, lower utilizations, slowing tech migration. But assuming that you will see the pickup in activity sometime this year. You combine that with a strong continued growth in the installed base business, number of chambers continues to grow at a low double-digit growth rate. Like how should we think about the growth profile, puts and takes of CSBG this year and going forward? Timothy Archer : Yes, I don't know that we're going to put a number on the growth rate for CSBG at this point. But clearly, that business has been heavily impacted by the utilization cuts that occurred within our customer fabs. And we saw that both in spares as well as a curtailment of many of the technology upgrades that typically would just occur year in, year out. And so that did have an impact on CSBG revenues. I think that going forward, I talked about how much larger the installed base is now. That's a much larger installed base that because of the delay in technology upgrades, there's pent-up demand there. I mean those tools need to be upgraded to be operating at the latest and most efficient and most competitive technology node for our customers. And so I don't know the exact timing, but I do know that installed base will be upgraded and will actually generate quite a lot of revenue for Lam going forward. Douglas Bettinger : And Harlan, maybe just like to remind you, there's 4 components in CSBG, spare service upgrades, all of which will benefit from what Tim was describing. You also have the Reliant product line in there, which has just done amazing in the last year. That will ebb and flow to a certain extent with more mature nodes, specialty node WFE. So don't lose sight of that one. There might be a slightly different dynamic with the Reliant product line. Operator : The next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Atif Malik : First one, Tim, historically, you guys have benefited disproportionately when the NAND spending happens. And -- if you were to think about your position competitively when the NAND spending recovers, I understand this year there's more technology upgrades. But how should we think about your position coming out of this NAND downturn competitively, particularly on more layers than the whole edge process? Timothy Archer : Yes. I think that -- it's a good question, and that was what I pointed out. I mean I think what we're looking at in the near term in those first stages of recovery is customers are very cost sensitive. And the best way to achieve that next technology notice by upgrading the equipment that you have in place. And so Lam, we spend a tremendous amount of time investing in technologies that enable the upgrade and extension of our equipment, and that's really of high value to our customers. I think that will actually go on for quite a long time. We have about 6,500 chambers of high aspect ratio etch, for instance, in the NAND marketplace. That creates a lot of next-generation technology through those upgrades. And beyond that, the learning you get from now running those upgraded chambers at that next technology node, tends to seed all of the ideas and understanding of the challenges that need to be solved at the mix node. And I think that's why the installed base positions and incumbent positions tend to be very difficult to break in this industry. And we've tried to break many others -- break into others. And so we know that very well. What Lam has done extremely well is to collaborate closely with our customers. I talked about our close to customer strategy, putting R&D labs in very close proximity to our customers. And again, that's just the way in which we ensure that we're adequately meeting both their technology and cost needs going forward. Atif Malik : Great. And then a quick clarification, Doug, on the OpEx. You said R&D will be up year-over-year. I wasn't sure if that implies total OpEx is also up or SG&A is down to offset the increase in R&D? Douglas Bettinger : Total OpEx is probably going to be up Atif, R&D will be up more, right? We had 69% of total spending in R&D in the last quarter. That's a high watermark. But we're purposefully growing R&D., primarily because of all those inflections that we've been talking about. Timothy Archer : I think the maybe the easiest way to think about it is the lead time for us to develop new products that we need to drive growth is unfortunately a little bit longer than the lead time for our spending revenue. So with an outlook that growth is coming and that we're entering this next upturn, where there are tremendous opportunities for the company, we feel very confident to invest ahead of that revenue showing up, and that's I think what we signaled through this year. But with the confidence that we're going to see that growth in new products and technology investment from our customers. Operator : The next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : The first one on WFE. Doug, I -- forget if you mentioned this, but is there a first half, second half sort of bias that you're willing to share as we think about the trajectory of WFE this year? And more importantly, curious how we should be thinking about your rate of outperformance vis-a-vis the market? You guys have talked about obviously, depth and etch intensity growing across the memory space. You talked about advanced packaging in HBM. HBM things like dry resist. So assuming you're accurate with your WFE assumption and the market's up call it, mid- to high singles. What sort of outperformance can we sort of expect from you guys in calendar '24? Douglas Bettinger : Yes. Toshiya, I guess the first -- I think it's a little bit second half weighted year this year. I think it's going to be sort of the slow start to the year, maybe, right? We just guided to essentially flat revenues quarter-on-quarter. So that's part of what you're seeing, but we would expect it will be somewhat stronger in the second half. And then overall, we're not going to give you the individual components between NAND, DRAM, Foundry and Logic, what grows more. I think everything probably grows to a certain extent. When we look at all these inflections so in all aspects of those end markets, we see etch and deposition intensity stepping up as you walk from node to node to node. So that is unchanged. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then as my follow-up on China, Doug, you mentioned China as a percentage of your systems revenue to stay elevated in the March quarter. And then you went on to say that, that number should decline as you progress through the year. Is that just purely a function of your other businesses, other regions improving throughout the year? Or are you sort of sensing absolute decline in your China business? And if so, what are some of the areas or device types or applications you're seeing a slowdown? Douglas Bettinger : We are not seeing China slowdown. It's purely just timing of when spending is occurring, honestly. Toshiya, we've preferably been using the word, and I think you heard it in both Tim and my comments stable, right? So that's a consistent description that we have been saying for a while. Operator : The next question is from C.J. Muse with Cantor. Christopher Muse : I guess I was hoping you could speak to kind of your vision for what a recovery might look like for NAND and where we might get to on a normalized basis, perhaps in 2025? And then -- and if you reflect on perhaps a lower normalized number and think about some of the new areas that you're investing in, whether it's memory or advanced packaging or changes in backside power gate-all-around. Is there enough kind of juice there to get you to where you can overall drive that rich WFE intensity and get us back to kind of those peak levels when 3D NAND was first adopted? Timothy Archer : Sure, C.J. I think the simple answer is, yes, we do believe that. I mean, we've -- let me address the NAND question first, which -- as I mentioned, this year, customers are primarily focusing on technology upgrades and what makes sense. I mean eventually, to drive the type of bit growth that we think we see longer term. Obviously, there are some additions that need to be made, but we're not forecasting that this year. With each of those technology evolutions, etch and dep intensity rises simply because of the increasing number of layers. And in a technology upgrade, we've talked about the fact that Lam captures a much higher percentage of WFE because of the goal that etch and deposition play in the technology upgrade. So I think that as we see NAND growing -- recovering and growing at a certain percentage rate, Lam will actually significantly outperform that rate because of the fact that most of that is coming from upgrades. Now longer term, I think we have turned to our attention and strategically, we've said we want to build resilience into our business by really capturing a lot of the opportunities that exist. Of course in NAND where we're very strong, but really outside of NAND and some of these other markets that are becoming more etch and dep intensive. And we've talked about those, whether it's gate-all-around or backside power or advanced packaging, dry EUV patterning. And each of those, we've characterized as a $1 billion-plus opportunity when fully scaled for Lam. So -- and those are SAM expansion meaning that they are incremental to where Lam has been before. So I think when you play those out and obviously, we have to be successful in execution. That's why we keep talking about we're gaining traction, but there's still a ways to go before these inflections and all decisions are made. But we think those can certainly drive Lam to new highs in terms of revenue and obviously profitability as well. Christopher Muse : Very helpful, Tim. I guess a quick follow-up, Doug. I know you're hesitant to guide OpEx for the full year, but perhaps you could help us understand maybe the impact of the extra week on the March quarter? And how you're thinking about driving that R&D growth through the calendar year? Douglas Bettinger : Yes, C.J. I mean, it's 14 weeks versus 13. That's the right way to kind of think about it. You can just ratio it to understand kind of it's a longer quarter. So that's the piece from that. And then any delta to get to the 29.5% op margin is part of that beginning to step up R&D. As we go through the year, though, we will purposely be growing the investment in R&D so that you might not see the historic leverage that we've delivered is what I described a quarter ago, and that's still very much how you should be thinking about it. Operator : The next question is from Srinivas Pajjuri with Raymond James. Srinivas Pajjuri : Tim, you talked about your trough EPS doubling essentially, which is a tremendous achievement and execution. I think part of the reason was your services business did increase as a percent of the mix. I think that helped for sure stabilizing the cyclicality a bit. So as we go through the next, I guess, as we kind of look out to the next couple of years as business recovers, just curious as to how you think about the mix shaking out between systems and services? And how -- what sort of implications that might have for your top line and also your margin profile? And I guess, on the next peak EPS, if you want to talk about? Timothy Archer : Well, here's why it's always a little difficult to answer this question is because we're certainly investing to grow our systems business tremendously as well. And so we don't look at it as one trading off versus the other. And so in fact, one kind of begets the other. The better our systems business does the faster our installed base grows, and that's really the story from 2019 in that -- until now, when we talk about how much the installed base has grown. We shipped a lot of new systems that grew that installed base by nearly 50%. So going forward, I think that we anticipate the ratio of CSBG revenue to overall revenue staying kind of in the historical range that it's been. And that's just going to be driven by kind of equivalent on success in both parts. But the CSBG revenue, the installed base business, not only gives us stability, but it also opens new channels for growth for the company. And I've talked about this on previous calls, which is we -- I think that when we think about how Lam leverages, things like artificial intelligence and data. It's in the installed base services business. On the last call, I talked about even cobots, the use of collaborative robots to start to do some of the service that today is done by skilled engineers. Our customers in this industry have to find ways to be able to innovate faster and also provide manufacturing services at a lower cost. And I think that -- we can do that by innovating around the installed base and create new products and service offerings that help us grow at a faster pace than the installed base itself is growing. Srinivas Pajjuri : Got it. And then Doug, one clarification on the deferred revenue. I think it went up about $238 million this quarter. You talked about prepayments. Just curious, are customers still prepaying because of any supply constraints? Or is this an ongoing, I guess, trend that you're seeing? Just if you can talk about how we should think about deferred revenue going forward, that will be helpful. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, Srini. I guess what I described is you think about the advanced payment is when we have a new customer that we're just kind of understanding what their balance sheet looks like, especially if they're a private customer that we could see the balance sheet. It's not publicly reported. And the creditworthiness might be sort of questionable. We require cash upfront before we begin manufacturing the tool, and that's what's going on there. That's all it is. Operator : The next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : For the first one, around the China BOP being stable in calendar '24. Do you see all market segments being stable? Or do you see some like being stronger and some being weaker? Like how do you see that interplay? Douglas Bettinger : Stacy, I don't really see a big change year-on-year relative to end market. I'll remind you, when China DRAM was second half weighted last year. It's probably a little bit first half weighted in China, maybe more than a little bit this year. But year-over-year, I don't think I really think about a significant change in contribution for the entire year. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess a follow-up on the China questions, and maybe it's a follow-up on one of the earlier questions. But it does sound to me like you are suggesting China mix should come down through the year. Maybe you can clarify that because if I've got overall stable China revenues like how does your China mix come down materially? It doesn't look like you're looking for overall like non-China WFE to grow a ton, right, in some of the other areas. So... Douglas Bettinger : Yes. Let me remind you, in 2023, China was a more modest amount of WFE that grew in the second half of the year. And so the comments we're making are year-over-year, it's relatively stable. Kind of the half-on-half stuff probably looks different in '24 than it did in '23 in China specifically. Stacy Rasgon : That's helpful. And so then exiting the year, you think you're back to that sort of normalized gross margin range as a result of that as China falls off in the second half? Douglas Bettinger : Yes. The customer mix stuff, I think, mitigates some as we go through the year, and it continues to be quite strong in the March quarter guidance. Operator : The next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : For my first one, I'm curious, what's your assessment of NAND supply demand as it exists today? I think in your WFE view, you are assuming that NAND grows but more because of technology upgrades. But what are your customers telling you for as to when they want to start adding more tools? And what's Lam's opportunity to grow NAND right at a measurable pace in the second half of the year? Timothy Archer : Yes. I think that -- first of all, I wouldn't necessarily talk about what we are discussing with our customers on that standpoint. But things that are out there. We do know, and I think you know that the utilization cuts were pretty severe in NAND last year. And so there's a tremendous amount of capacity that is -- has been offline and we've said in the past that needs to be brought back online. And I think the question and the discussions we're having is that what technology node should that capacity be restarted. And in many cases, there is a very high likelihood that technology upgrade certainly will occur as that equipment is brought back into service. And so in that case, we would actually begin to see a restart of some of the utilization driven revenue that we get from things like spares and services, as well as, at the same time, a restart of technology upgrade revenues. And that's why I think that from a NAND perspective this year, we think that will effectively represent the majority of the spend that occurs in this segment. Vivek Arya : Okay. And then, Tim, as many of the DRAM customers are saying that they plan to shift a bit more towards HVM from DDR. Does that have any positive or negative influence on your CSBG and the spares business? Timothy Archer : No, I don't -- I can't quite make that connection right now. I'm off to give us some thought. But clearly, we see an impact on our systems business, as I mentioned, where we're having to add the specific HVM related especially advanced packaging steps related to the stacking of HVM itself. And we're seeing significant growth in that area. But -- and so with that, given we're shipping additional systems, there is some incremental spares business and services business that goes along with that. But the systems portion of that kind outweighs from a dollars perspective. Vivek Arya : I guess maybe just to clarify, does your CSBG business start to kind of grow consistent with the growth in your tools business overall? Or do you think there is going to be a lag factor because it slowed down later? Does it start to regrow later also? Douglas Bettinger : Depends on the rate of growth in WFE to be perfectly frank, that are coming. See, spare service upgrades chug along, and we think that's going to benefit as utilization and whatnot begins to come back. Then to really answer your question, you got to go figure out what you think the pace of WFE growth is. I'm not going to put numbers on that right now. We're going to kind of wait and see. Operator : The next question is from Krish Sankar with CDT Cowen. Krish Sankar : First of all, for Doug. I think Doug has mentioned about a gradual recovery in WFE this year, kind of more back half rated. So I'm kind of curious, and Doug, I'm not looking for like guidance. What I'm just wondering is, is this better assume Lam's revenues in the calendar second half of 2024 is going to be better than first half? That's for my first question and then I have a follow-up. Douglas Bettinger : You're a little bit muffled, Krish, but I think you were asking about our performance along with WFE. And frankly, I think we will mirror whatever the trajectory of WFE looks like with an expectation that etch and dep outgrows to a certain extent. I think I answered your question, although you were a little bit muffled there. Krish Sankar : Doug, I was just trying to wonder if calendar second half '24 revenue for Lam is going to be better than calendar first half similar to WFE? Douglas Bettinger : Yes, I think it will be, Krish, I'm not going to put numbers on it yet, but we will mirror what goes on with WFE. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up is for Tim and Doug. You spoke about HBM and AI and all the good stuff. I'm just wondering does HBM and DDR5, 2 sets for dep and etch differ from DDR4 and Legacy in a way, is it more like [indiscernible] from a margin standpoint? Or does it -- is it like a mutual standpoint? Douglas Bettinger : I guess what I'd say, Krish, from a margin standpoint, you shouldn't think about any differential margin necessarily. The incremental piece for the stuff that goes in high-bandwidth memory is a bigger die, you know that. The die itself, building a DDR5 die is largely the same equipment that builds DDR5 that doesn't go into HBM. The incremental stuff comes when you go into the advanced packaging stuff, the Syndion deep silicon etch and the electroplating are areas where we are extraordinarily strong in addition to some other things. That is clearly incremental equipment. Timothy Archer : Yes. And I think from an etch and dep intensity perspective, in general, I think you mentioned DDR5 to DD -- DDR4 to DDR5. I mean I think in general, with each technology node evolution, whether it's DRAM, NAND, Foundry Logic, we've said etch and dep intensity rises with technology advancement. And so I think you can imagine that there's more equipment being needed, and that's in addition to the fact that larger die sizes drive greater equipment per bid out. So there's a lot of factors that every time we move forward, there's more equipment and more Lam equipment required with those technology nodes. Operator : The next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : If I can ask about your DRAM systems revenues in the December quarter. They were kind of back to the highs of a couple of years ago, but I know you had some China in there, I think there's some of the events packaging. Can you just give us a sense for what's kind of core DRAM within that? And then you're pretty constructive on where that's going. Can you give us a sense of the dynamics of China going forward versus other regions and other parts of DRAM? Douglas Bettinger : I guess, Joe, I would just to take you back to what I had in my script. Two things are driving the strength in DRAM in the December quarter, and you mentioned both of them, frankly. It's high bandwidth memory in DDR5. In addition to the fact that we've got a China customer in DRAM in the second half of the year. That includes September and December, that wasn't in the first half. So each of those things contribute to the strength you saw in December. Joseph Moore : Okay. And then looking forward, it seemed like you had more than 6 months of demand from that China customer in the second half going forward. Does that come down, but core DRAM comes up and HVM comes up? Douglas Bettinger : Probably. Operator : The next question is from Brian Chin with Stifel. Brian Chin : Maybe going back to NAND, the best ever quarter for NAND spending was probably higher than the total level of NAND spending maybe for all of last year. And so even if it's off a low base, isn't it pretty logical that NAND WFE should exhibit the largest or highest rate of improvement in '24? Douglas Bettinger : I wouldn't necessarily draw that conclusion, Brian. I think all we're going to tell you is that I think every segment WFE grows this year, NAND, DRAM, Foundry, Logic, it's all up to a certain extent. I'm not going to get into the business of quantifying each individual one because frankly, at the end of the day, we'll get it wrong. But I think everything will grow to a certain extent with peers. Brian Chin : Okay. Fair enough. And then just to kind of level set and DRAM and then also looking forward. How much did DRAM industry spending actually declined in '23? It seems to be better than what was initially thought based on HBM, et cetera. And also, can you give us a sense of the number of wafer starts or percent of the DRAM installed base that could be converted to more advanced 1-alpha or 1-beta like process nodes this year? Douglas Bettinger : I guess, Brian, what I'd say and Tim, I think had this in his script, memory overall was down roughly 40%. NAND was down north of 70%. The differential to get to the number is DRAM. You can do that. And yes, I think the second part of your question, HBM and DDR5 has been a big part of the strength in DRAM. Timothy Archer : Yes. Brian Chin : Okay. And that was actually the second part was kind of more towards, what is the potential number of wafer starts or the percent of the installed base that's sort of game for those conversions to 1-alpha, 1-beta light nodes? Douglas Bettinger : For the most part, in memory, everything gets upgraded to the next node, all of it. That's always been the case. It's not a new phenomenon. Operator : The next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Christopher Caso : The question is on delivery times. And you had mentioned, obviously, your delivery times may be different than some others in the industry. Where do they sit right now? And as a consequence, how much visibility do your customers need to give you? And with that, when we start to see some stronger perhaps memory spending, how quickly will you be able to react to that and turn that for revenue? Timothy Archer : Yes. So we don't obviously publicly telegraph our lead times. But we had talked about the fact that during the COVID pandemic, our lead times due to supply chain shortages, it stretched out quite long. And those have now come back to a much more normalized level, although they still are such that for us to make shipments within this year, we would have to know about those orders and that forecast pretty quickly. The one thing that's helped is I talked about our investments in new manufacturing and supply chain operations within our customer ecosystems. That's putting us much closer, it's diversifying our supplier base and I think it's going to -- through this next upturn make us much more responsive to customer needs. So really, we worry less about lead time and more about our ability to respond in the time frame, which our customers need to place orders to meet their ramps. We tend not to be -- we tend not to be in the bottleneck, let's put it that way in terms of a lead time perspective, planning a new fab. Christopher Caso : Fair enough. As a follow-up question, I wanted to ask about backside power. And last quarter, you made some disclosures about the revenue impact to Lam as that happened. Could you give a little more color on that and specifically, we know that the different customers are having different implementations of backside power. At what point does that start to become a meaningful driver for Lam? Timothy Archer : I think given the important role that both etch and deposition play in that and our strong position in parts of the backside power process like copper plating where some of those layers are becoming quite thick and therefore the processes become longer. It's -- I would say, going to very rapidly become quite meaningful for the company. And again, it's just a further demonstration of how going 3D and essentially using those -- using etch and deposition to create more complex architectures allows you to reduce power, improve chip performance and also reduce cost. And we talked about it in the sense of backside power. You're seeing the same thing with chip stacking and HBM and energy integration. And that's why I said, I think the next era of semiconductor is characterized by all of these more unique 3D architectures. They're all good for the types of products we sell. Operator : Operator, we have time for one more question. And that question comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Thomas O'Malley: I was curious if you guys had a view on the HBM market. Clearly, with the accelerator market growing as quickly as some think. There's concerns that the HBM market may actually be shipping above peak in '24 and '25. Do you guys have a view internally on just how fast HBM is growing as a market segment? And just -- could you just give us the perspective of when you look at an acceleration of a tool road map with a customer on HBM. How much of that has pulled in, in the last 6 months from what you would typically see from a DRAM customer when they're looking for a tool? Timothy Archer : Well, I think that as a real key supplier into the HBM market, as I mentioned, the strong position we have in the processes required before the stacking, this is an area where we're seeing very, very strong demand. I think that whether or not at some point, it's shipping above peak, I think that this AI market is continuing to evolve at a very, very fast rate. And all we're focused on right now is ensuring we are building out our own capacity and capabilities. And ensuring that we maintain that technology leadership that's allowing us to hold 100% market share of the TSV formation in HBM. And so really, that's our focus is hold the position and let the market grow as fast as the market grows. Thomas O'Malley: Helpful. And then just one on the makeup of inventory. You guys have talked about working down inventory throughout the year. Is there any color you can give us on the makeup of that inventory? Is it more memory related or foundry logic related? I know you don't want to give specifics, but just where do you see that inventory coming down through the first half of the calendar year? Douglas Bettinger : Yes, Tom, it's -- the rate of decline in memory as we went into '23 was pretty dramatic, and we ended up taking more inventory than we needed specifically for memory. So there's a bigger component of it targeted at memory and as memory recovers, the inventory will come down. Thanks for the question. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Timothy Archer : Thanks, Ram, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Lam is off to a strong start in calendar 2024. With revenues, profitability, and earnings per share for the March quarter all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. These results, as well as our outlook for the June quarter, point to Lam's solid execution in an industry environment that is progressing much as we predicted in our January call. Today, we see industry WFE spending for calendar 2024 in the low to mid $90 billion range, with the modest increase from our prior view driven mainly by additional lithography shipments into China. We see no meaningful change to our outlook for Lam's overall 2024 revenue profile. From an industry perspective, DRAM remains strong, with WFE spending driven by growing demand for high bandwidth memory and sustained investment in domestic China. In Foundry Logic, growth and leading edge spending this year is being partially offset by a decline in mature node spending outside of domestic China. Domestic China spending is running higher than we had previously expected probably we still see it being first half weighted with Lam's revenue contribution from China declining as the year progresses. In NAND, we continue to expect year- on-year growth in WFE spending in calendar 2024. Encouragingly, we've seen an uptick in fabulization and in the March quarter, this is translated into double digit percent growth quarter- over-quarter in our spares revenues. The supply and demand continue to normalize to the remainder of the year, we see a strong setup developing for 2025 NAND spending. As we move toward a broader WFE recovery, Lam stands to benefit from powerful secular drivers of semiconductor growth and innovation. Generative AI and other emerging smart applications are built on a foundation of semiconductor technology and are expected to deliver trillions of dollars of economic benefit at a global level over the next decade. AI's transformative use cases, foreseen in both consumer and enterprise markets, are only in the early stages of realization and we believe that significant investment in semiconductor manufacturing capacity will be required to satisfy the coming demand for advanced compute, memory, and storage. In this environment, the winners will be the equipment companies that can accelerate the pace of technology advancement while at the same time deliver innovations that disrupt the rising cost and complexity of semiconductor fabrication. To this end, Lam is investing in two differentiated approaches. First, we are putting more capabilities and resources close to our customers to strengthen collaboration. And second, we are leveraging Lam's proprietary semiverse solutions digital twin capabilities to reduce the time and cost of technology development. Already, we are seeing Lam's distributed R&D footprint having a positive effect. In the past quarter, we've used our customer-centric lab investments in Korea, Taiwan, and the US to accelerate cycles of learning on new applications resulting in important wins for Lam in both DRAM and foundry logic advanced packaging. With respect to semiverse solutions, we leverage a portfolio of digital twins created at the scale of the device, the process, and the reactor to model complex interactions that influence tool performance and productivity. Lam\u2019s engineers now regularly use these capabilities to optimize multidimensional etch and deposition process recipes faster and with less on-tool wafer experimentation. Turning to demand related to AI, the early impact has been most prominent in DRAM and foundry logic. We believe, however, that AI's impact on storage is still ahead and represents a key vector of long-term growth for our NAND business. More advanced AI applications need faster, more power-efficient, and higher density NAND storage. NAND-based enterprise solid-state drives, or ESSDs, are 50 times faster in read-write capability, 2 to 5 times more power efficient, and use 50% less space at the system level compared to hard disk drives or HDDs. Today, over 80% of enterprise data is stored on HDDs. And we expect this mix to shift in favor of SSDs as NAND capability and cost continues to improve. This is where Lam is playing a key role by enabling technologies which are critical for both performance and cost scaling. In deposition, for example, Lam is leading the transition from tungsten to molybdenum in the worldwide to improve device access time and reduce stack height per storage cell. In etch, Lam is using high aspect ratio cryogenic etch to enhance productivity of memory hole formation. Today, we are approaching 1,000 Cryo Etch chambers in our high-volume manufacturing installed base. In partnership with our customers, we're using the tremendous amount of data coming from this installed base to rapidly improve technology and cost at each successive layer transition in NAND. Recently, we combined the learning from the installed base with the capabilities of our semiverse solutions simulation tools to further strengthen our differentiation. As a result of our accelerated innovation, we have defended every NAND high aspect ratio memory hole etch production decision made so far by customers. With respect to DRAM, AI servers use high bandwidth memory, or HBM, to increase read, write speed and reduce server power consumption. HBM stacks multiple DRAM dies using TSVs, enabling 15x more data throughput than standard DRAM. However, HBM also requires an approximate threefold increase in wafers per bit compared to conventional memory. With this in mind, it's important that our SABRE 3D and Syndion tools not only provide best-in-class plating and etch capabilities, but also deliver industry-leading throughput and productivity to keep overall costs low for our customers. We are the leading player in TSV applications for HBM and expect our HBM-related shipments to grow more than three times in calendar year 2024. Finally, on the foundry logic side, Lam tools, including selective etch and ALD, are well-positioned to help enable the move from FinFET to gate all-around, a key transition needed to improve transistor performance per watt by 15% to 20%. We see our shipments for gate all-around nodes in calendar year 2024 exceeding $1 billion. Lam tools are also enabling foundry logic inflections such as backside power delivery, molybdenum interconnects, and drive holders as processes for EUV patterning. Our traction with customers is strong on these inflections, and together, they represent a multi-billion dollar growth opportunity for Lam as AI drives a greater need for faster, more power-efficient devices. To conclude, the proliferation of AI, the global push for localized chip manufacturing capacity and the ubiquity of semiconductors in new consumer and commercial products represent powerful, secular drivers for Lam and the rest of the semiconductor equipment industry in the years ahead. We are pleased with the company's execution and our results in the March quarter and remain focused on our opportunity to outperform through this next leg of industry growth. Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Doug. Doug Bettinger : Great. Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. We delivered solid results in the March 2024 quarter. Our March quarter results came in over the midpoint of our guidance ranges for all financial metrics. I'm pleased with the company's continued robust execution. We achieved the highest gross margin percentage since the merging of Lam with Novellus. We also continued to generate very strong free cash flow of $1.3 billion or 34% of revenue. Let's dive into the details of our March quarter results. Revenue for the March quarter was $3.79 billion, which was roughly flat with the prior quarter. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was $1.75 billion, which was a decrease of $182 million from the December quarter related to revenue recognized that was tied to those customer advanced payments. I believe deferred revenue will continue to trend downwards as we continue throughout the year. From a segment perspective, March quarter\u2019s systems revenue and memory was 44%, which is a decrease from the prior quarter level of 48%. The decline in the memory segment was attributable to DRAM coming in at 23% of systems revenue versus the 31% that we saw in the December quarter. DRAM spending was focused on the 1Y, 1-alpha, and 1-beta nodes, spending largely driven by DDR5 and high bandwidth memory enablement. As we noted in the last quarter, non-volatile memory WFE is increasing in 2024, but it remained at a subdue level on a mixed basis for the March quarter. This segment represented 21% of our systems revenue, up from 17% in the prior quarter. I do just want to mention one thing. We are characterizing one customer's investment in specialty DRAM as a non-volatile investment, since it has a non-volatile component to the device. This might be different than what others in the industry are doing. NAND investment was driven by very modest spending and conversions to 2XX and 3XX layer devices. The foundry segment represented 44% of our system's revenue, a slight increase from the percentage concentration in the December quarter of 38%. Growth was driven predominantly by domestic China shipments. And finally, the logic and other segments were 12% of our system's revenue in the March quarter down from the prior quarter level of 14%. The decline was driven by continued mature node softness. Now, I'll discuss the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 42%, up slightly from 40% in the prior quarter. While most of our China revenue continued to be from domestic Chinese customers, this was the largest quarter for multinational spending in China since mid-last year. We expect spending from this region to increase year-over-year in 2024. I believe it will, however, decline as we go through the year. Our next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 24% of revenue in the March quarter versus 19% in the December quarter. Japan and Taiwan rounded out the remainder of the top four regions. Our customer support business group generated revenue in the March quarter totaling approximately $1.4 billion. This was down 4% from the December quarter and 13% lower than the March quarter in calendar year 2023. Our Reliant systems revenue decreased in the March quarter due to continued weakness in mature node investments, partially offset by a higher level of spares. Reliant is at the lowest revenue level in the last two years, and spares is at the highest revenue level since the end of 2022. The spares business is seeing very early signs of positive impact from utilization increases from our customers. Turning to the gross margin performance, the March quarter came in at 48.7% above the midpoint of our guided range, and above the December quarter level of 47.6%. The increase was primarily a result of favorable changes in product and customer mix, as well as improved factory efficiencies. March quarter offering expenses were $698 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $662 million. This was due in part to expenses incurred for an extra week in the quarter. I'll remind you, it was a 14-week quarter, as well as our conscious growth in R&D spending. As Tim mentioned, we remain laser-focused on investing in R&D to extend our product and competitive differentiation. R&D, as a percentage of spending, was at a high watermark coming in at 71% of total spending. Operating margin for the current quarter was 30.3% in line with the December quarter level of 30% and at the high end of our guidance range. This was primarily because of the strong gross margin performance, which was somewhat offset by the growth in R&D investment. Our non -GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.7% consistent with our expectations. Looking further into calendar 2024, we continue to believe the tax rate will be in the low to mid- teens with some possible fluctuations quarter by quarter. Other income and expense for the March quarter came in at $10 million in income, compared with $5 million in income in the December quarter. The increase in OI&E was due to higher cash balances and higher interest rates. OI&E will be subject to market-related fluctuations that could cause some level of volatility quarter by quarter. On the capital return side of things, we allocated approximately $860 million to share repurchases and we paid $263 million in dividends in the March quarter. Our share repurchase activity included both open market repurchases as well as an accelerated share repurchase arrangement. The ASRs continued to execute into the month of April. And I would just mention, we continue to track towards our long-term capital return plans of returning 75% to 100% of our free cash flow. March quarter diluted earnings per share was $7.79 towards the higher end of our guided range. The diluted share count was 132 million shares on track with expectations and down from the December quarter. We have $1.2 billion remaining on our board authorized share repurchase plan. Let me pivot to the balance sheet, our cash and short-term investments at the end of the March quarter totaled $5.7 billion, up a little bit from $5.6 billion at the end of the December quarter. The increase was largely due to collections with an extra week in the March quarter offset by cash allocated to share buyback, dividend payments, and capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding was 57 days in the March quarter, decreased from 66 days in the December quarter. Inventory at the end of the March quarter totaled $4.3 billion, down $107 million from the December quarter level. Inventory turns remained flat from the prior quarter level at 1.8x. We are making progress in bringing inventory levels down, and we will continue to work on this throughout calendar 2024. Noncash expenses for the March quarter included approximately $77 million in equity compensation, $75 million in appreciation, and $15 million in amortization. Capital expenditures in the March quarter were $104 million, down $12 million from the December quarter. Spending was primarily centered on Lam expansions in the United States and Asia, supporting our global strategy to be close to our customers' development locations. We ended the March quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full time employees, which was flat with the prior quarter. Let's now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the June 2024 quarter, we're expecting revenue of $3.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million, gross margin of 47.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This gross margin decline from March is reflective of a quarter-to-quarter change in customer mix, operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This reflects our continued commitment to prioritize R&D spending. And finally, earnings per share of $7.50, plus or minus $0.75, based on a share count of approximately 131 million shares. So let me wrap up. 2024 is a year of continued transformation for Lam Research. We're investing in our long-term strategy to extend our technology leadership and operational excellence while efficiently managing overall spending. We're encouraged that the long-term drivers of semiconductor growth, such as artificial intelligence, are seeing accelerated adoption. And we expect Lam to be a strong beneficiary of these trends. We are well-positioned for the architectural and material change coming, such as gate-all-around, advanced packaging, backside power delivery, and the move to dry photoresist. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Tim. Tim, a question on high aspect ratio, etch for NAND, very high market share. And you said in your prepared comments, you defended market share there. Your competitor, the Tokyo Electron, introduced a Cryo Etch product a year ago, but you also have one from three years ago. So I'm kind of curious. Can you talk a little bit about the market share dynamics and high aspect ratio etch? And the fact that some of your customers are talking about using Cryo Etch for like 430 Lam NAND. So can you give us some color there on high aspect ratio, etch? And then I'll follow up with Doug. Timothy Archer : Sure. Kris, on Cryo Etch, I mean, I had a couple of data points in my prepared remarks. But one is we have an installed base of Cryo Etch tools used for NAND that's now approaching 1,000 chambers. So obviously, we've been in high volume production with this application for quite some time. And my comment was that there always are customers exploring different options during the development phase. But as my comment is, these are very complex processes to put into high-volume production. And so we continue to leverage the learning that we get working with our customers to focus on technology extension and manufacturing readiness. And by that focus, we've been able to defend the decisions once they come to that point of the customer really having to decide which tool to commit their next fabrication line to incidence. So all we can say is we're working hard to make sure we have the best tool for the application. And so far, it's winning the day. Krish Sankar : Got it. So good to hear that the share is still solid. And then a follow-up for Doug on margins. Doug, you kind of mentioned about the gross margin, maybe moderation in the June quarter due to the customer mix. Is it mainly a function of China and how to think about gross margins in the second half? And maybe if you can extend that question, how to think about OpEx into the back half of the year too. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Kris, I guess I'd say a couple things. First, gross margin sometimes is a little bit better when we're selling to smaller customers. And I'm not going to pin it to any one geographic region necessarily. But in China, there are some smaller customers, and they tend to, because we have volume purchase pricing sometimes, they pay a little bit more. But it's not because of the geographic region, it's because of the size of the customer. So that's one thing to think about in my scripted remarks as well as what Tim said is we think that the China region will modulate a little bit as we go through the year. So that's part of what you need to think about. And I've been talking about this for a couple of quarters. So anyway, have that in mind when you're updating your models. Second, we've been talking I think for a couple of quarters now, maybe actually three quarters, about the need to grow R&D investment this year because of these technology changes that we see like gate-all-around, backside power, advanced packaging and so forth, dry photoresist. And we are absolutely planning on doing that. You saw that in the March quarter, R&D is a percent of total spending was the highest that I have seen here at 71% and we intend to keep investing in R&D. So independent of whatever the top line is, we are going to grow R&D investment this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. So I want to ask about China. So it's good to modulate through the year the mix, but it sounds like it's still going to be up year-over-year for domestic China this year. So I guess my question is, we've seen some headlines on a few entities being potentially added to the entity list and I'm wondering if these comments reflect the potential addition of these entities. Or does it basically say, hey, if the status quo remains, this is what your assumption is, meaning that if there were entities added, that would be downside to these comments. Timothy Archer : Yes, Tim, I mean, obviously, we can't forecast changes in U.S. trade policy with respect to China that we don't know about. And so, we're basically giving you our best view of what we think our China business will be through the rest of the year and recognizing that there could be changes that we don't foresee. And what I will say is we, obviously, we've built up what we believe is a strong government affairs team. We've plugged in to all the relevant discussions. And I think over the last couple of years, you've seen we have a pretty strong track record of working with the U .S. government, responding to export control policy, and that's just what we're trying to do going on in the future. Timothy Arcuri : Sure, thanks, Tim, thanks. And Doug, I just wanted to ask about service a bit. So there's so much different dynamics happening in the Spares and in the Reliant business. Can you talk about that? Because certainly sounds, I mean, this is kind of an odd situation that we'd have, Spares be so strong and Reliant be so weak. So can you sort of give us any read throughs there? Like, what does that mean for the future of that business? Thanks. Doug Bettinger : Yes, listen, I think it's well understood right now that you got two dynamics going on relative to thinking about the different components of CSPG. First, industry utilization is starting to get somewhat better. I would definitely say it's early days for that. But the reason I specifically talked about the Spares level versus where it's been over the last couple of years is because of that. That clearly is beginning to show up in our Spares business. However, when you look at CSPG in total, we were down now because of the softness in Reliant. I also think that's pretty well understood in the industry, right. Mature node investment outside of the China region certainly is pretty soft right now. And so you have those two competing dynamics going on that's showing up in the CSPG line. If I was guessing, Tim, right now, CSPG is probably flattish this year from last year because of those two offsetting dynamics, if that helps you think about it. Timothy Arcuri : Perfect. I got it. Timothy Archer : Tim, I think the only thing I would add there is when you think about the CSPG business a little bit longer term. I mean clearly, we commented on utilization starting to pick up, but as we move into 2025, I think we also will see significant upgrade activity coming back in, especially in the NAND space. We talked about the fact that there is a large portion of that installed base that has not yet been moved towards the technology nodes that are most useful for our customers, and so I think that will also flow through into the CSPG business in perhaps not so much this year, but clearly as we move into 2025 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. With an accelerated compute and AI semiconductor segment to the market, there still seems to be a lot of constraints centered around high bandwidth memory and tightness and [inaudible] packaging. Obviously, you guys have a very strong position here, as you mentioned, Tim. You guys previously talked about this business, this opportunity is being potentially like a billion dollar per year type of revenue opportunity, but just given the strong demand pull and some of the expanding use cases, I mean, is the Lam team already on track to drive a billion plus dollars in advanced packaging revenues this year? And now that the trends are in place like what's kind of your new or maybe revised view on the revenue opportunity here for the team over the next few years? Timothy Archer : Yes, Harlan, I think that you're right. There is strong pull, and I mean, obviously, we are responding as quickly as we can to the demand. Our advanced packaging equipment this year will be over a billion dollars, and so that's kind of an important milestone for us. I don't know how to give you like that next milestone, obviously we're seeing tremendous growth and demand in this area. Our positions are strong, not only as you said in the Foundry Logic side of advanced packaging, but also as we talked specifically about our very strong positions in HBM related, what we consider packaging side of HBM. And so I think it's just an area where we'll see good long-term growth. We are investing again in this area. We've talked in the past about our work in the panel processing space, trying to look ahead to see where the packaging market is going to go to make sure that we are fully capable of taking advantage of what we see as a real long-term secular driver for semiconductors and the equipment industry. Harlan Sur : Yes, no, congratulations on hitting that milestone. For my follow-up question, with your customers and their spending outlooks looking more constructive, their cycle dynamics continues to improve, you got strong tailwinds on manufacturing complexity translate the growth. Look appears quite solid right for the team. So if I look out beyond this year and the ramp of your new Malaysia manufacturing facility I mean not only, is it low-cost geo like you guys have mentioned, but you've got highly skilled workforce. You also set up the supply chain support infrastructure locally as well. So I don't know if it's for Tim or Doug but is there any way to think about the incremental gross margin benefit on incremental revenues that flow out of the Malaysia factory as you start to load it. Timothy Archer : Let me take the first part of it and then I'll let Doug talk specifically about the gross margin comment. I think it's one thing that that I think we're feeling very comfortable with which is your last question was boy there must be a lot of demand and you've got to be ramping up for that. I think as we come into this next up cycle, we feel very well positioned relative to all the things you just talked about the physical capacity, the trained workforce, the supply chain has been built up and made more resilient since the last big upturn in the industry where we saw lots of constraints. And so I think from that standpoint, we feel really good that we have executed on the operation side of the house, now we just need to start seeing the kinds of new peak volumes that will demonstrate that externally. And I'll let Doug address here gross margin question. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Harlan, I guess I just remind you what I've said in prior quarters, which is I don't want you to run ahead of that financial model we put out in 2020. That's still the right way to think about it. Now, obviously right now we've got quite favorable customer mix. I don't expect that to continue long. I don't know maybe I'm wrong about that but the benefit from Malaysia after we came to the inflationary stuff and whatnot was completely how we intend to get back to the gross margin and better than that financial model, maybe we can push a little higher. Certainly, we're not going to stop staying focused on that. But that's the way to think about it is Malaysia is still into the future, it will show up when we ramp incremental volumes and we're ready for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Srinivas Pajjuri from Raymond James. Srinivas Pajjuri : Thank you. Doug, I think on the China side, just one clarification, were you expecting China to moderate in this quarter? Did it come in better than you expected? And then, just to go back to your comment about China moderation through the rest of the year, any particular segment within China, I mean, is it DRAM or is it logic or is it both? If you can add some color to that, that'll be helpful. Doug Bettinger : Yes, Srini, it came in pretty much as we expected. I suggested last quarter that it was going to continue to remain pretty good in March. So no, that was pretty much as we expected. And I don't know like at a segment level that I've got any specific color for you relative to the China slowing a little bit in the second half. There's such a broad set of customers there that are in every segment. It's in DRAM. It's in foundry. It's in logic and it's a broad set. So when we look at that in total, I do see it somewhat weighted here to the early part of the year and it'll modulate somewhat, but nothing specific I had to share with you from a segment standpoint. Srinivas Pajjuri : Thanks, Doug. And then maybe for Tim. Tim, some of your large customers got, pretty good amount of subsidies from the government recently on the CHIPS Act and other stuff outside of the U.S. as well. So I'm just wondering what sort of impact should we expect in terms of your own business as, I guess that money comes in and any, I guess, thoughts on the timing of potential orders from this incremental funding that they're getting? Thank you. Timothy Archer : I mean, obviously, you've seen in just even the last few weeks quite a few announcements about the CHIPS Act grants in the U.S. I'll also note that there are similar CHIPS Act programs going on in places like Japan and obviously a little bit further out in the future in Europe and elsewhere. And so, we've always said these are more of a \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 timeframe from the equipment side, especially the shorter lead time tools like we provide. So you see the FAB coming up, a lot of construction connectivity, you see long lead time tools go in and then we know that our time will come. I mean and so I think it's still a \u201825, \u201826, \u201827 opportunity for us. But the important thing is, well, that's a lot of extra money that maybe what's really exciting about it is most of that is targeted towards truly the leading edge nodes. And one thing about Lam's story is that we have focused a lot of R&D investment to build our position in leading edge foundry logic in the next generations of DRAM and high bandwidth memory as well as of course continuing our strength in NAND. And so as we see these new fabs come up, I mean it's not only additional spending, but it's at nodes where we believe that we will actually do better from a SAM and market share perspective. And so we're patiently waiting, but we know it's going to come. You can go visit the sites. The fab buildings are there, and they're feverishly working to get them ready for equipment. Operator : Our next question comes from C J Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Christopher Muse : Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I wanted to try to get a little bit more color on your updated WFE outlook. It looks like you're taking it up by about $7 billion. You talked about that being really litho, not impacting you. So I guess should we infer from that you're still expecting WFE up kind of low to mid-single digits? And as part of that, how are you thinking about those four large drivers, particularly I guess two or three of them, and the growth potential there and the relative outperformance that you expect to see? Timothy Archer : Yes, CJ. I mean, obviously one of our peers in the industry reported last week. We took a look at it and just have a view that we missed a little bit of what was shifting into China. That is the vast majority, if not all, of the change in WFE from our point of view. There are always some moving pieces. DRAM is maybe a little stronger. Trailing etch, foundry logic is probably a little bit softer. But at the end of the day, the biggest change that we saw was litho. We missed it a little bit because it's not part of our addressable market. I'm not sure I caught all of the second part of your question, CJ. Try it one more time. Christopher Muse : Oh, just as you think about those billion dollars plus opportunities, particularly around advanced packaging, and I guess including HBM within that, and also gate-all-around, how you think you'll fair relative to WFE in \u201824? Timothy Archer : Yes, I think given the mix we see in some of these technology transitions, it should be incrementally better than it was last year for sure. Christopher Muse : And then just as a quick second question, I guess third question, if I could sneak it in. You talked about normalization of China into the second half, and getting back to maybe a 46 percent-ish type of normalized gross margin. It sounds like China in your mind today is better, so I guess what would that number be if that continues to be strong for you guys? Thank you. Timothy Archer : I guess, CJ, you've got to just kind of look at where we've been, right. You're absolutely right, and thanks for mentioning the 46. That's sort of where gross margin was after we had done some of the Malaysia stuff and before China popped up with those smaller customers. And so the fact that we're above that level is largely customer mix. And so that's how you should be thinking about it. And if we have that mix wrong, then margin kind of, you've got a couple of data points in the last couple of quarters that you can kind of solve for to understand what it might look like. It will be in that 46 to 48 -plus percent range depending on what the mix looks like. Operator : Our next question comes from Atif Malik from Citi. Atif Malik : Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one for Tim. Tim, it's good to see some green shoots in the NAND market. You talked about double-digit spare parts growth in the NAND. And you also talked about that the AI storage inflection for high density SSDs is in front of us. But we do not have the 3x wafer surface offset that you're seeing on the DRAM site. So can you kind of paint for us the trajectory of the NAND improvement that you're expecting into second half of your next year? Timothy Archer : We're not going to give you a \u201825 forecast quite yet. It's way too early for that. It will be better though, right. I mean it's improving in demo. Yes, well I guess without giving you exact numbers, I mean clearly, we all know that the NAND spending has been incredibly weak for the last 12-18 months. And so we're in the very early stages of starting to see that recover. And I think if you look at what most of our -- we rely on our customer commentary that they make publicly for a lot of this. But they talk about the fact that maybe 90% of the bits they're shipping are at the leading etch. But when we look at the install base of our system, that was my comment. I believe that there's still going to be a large portion of the install base that will move forward to the next technology nodes. It\u2019s the most efficient way for our customers to do that is to upgrade what they already have. And I think you'll see that move forward. And therefore, NAND and WFE move up in \u201825. But because it comes to a large degree through upgrades, Lam\u2019s capture rate of every dollar of WFE spent will be much higher than in a greenfield capacity added. So when I think about Lam's opportunity to outperform in 2025, in NAND, I think it is obviously with high confidence because of the type of spending we would expect to be seen in 2025. And in the other market segments, it's also pretty high because of the, as I mentioned, the technology inflections that are occurring. And it's gate-all-around where we, this year we'll actually have over a billion dollars of shipments into the gate-all-around technology nodes. And obviously, as gate-all-around continues to proliferate, our tools like ALB and selective etch will do better in backside power delivery. We already talked about advanced packaging. And then, we obviously have out there in front of us also the work we're doing for dry photoresist processes for EUV. And so I just feel like there are a number of growth drivers for the company besides the one that is the most obvious, which is a NAND recovery in 2025. Atif Malik : Great, thank you. And then one for Doug. Doug, within your China, 42% of sales, you talked about multinationals picking up, which came as a positive surprise to me. Can you talk about what's driving that? Are those customers not worried about incremental restrictions or are they just trying to upgrade some of the older technology? Doug Bettinger : I think it's just being responsive to the demand they see relative to the capacity that's there. And yes, I said it's the highest level since mid-last year. Although I do understand I don't know over position that the vast majority of the spending in China continues to be the indigenous Chinese customer base. But I just observed it as I was going through the numbers and knowing everybody was going to be asking about China, that was something I thought I'd just mention. Operator : Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question on NAND as well. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the transition from tungsten to molybdenum potentially happening in the market, I suppose, over the next couple of years. Can you speak to the significance of that in terms of depth, intensity, and how that could impact your business over the next couple of years? Thanks. Timothy Archer : Sure. Well, obviously, any time there's a material change requires a new system, it's an opportunity for Lam to provide that technology into the market, and so it's an important change. We would call it moly just because it's so hard to say molybdenum, but the change to moly has some significant device benefits, and also, I mentioned that the important thing in NAND is, I mean, it's important in every element of semiconductor devices, but it's the cost and technology, and so one thing that's sometimes lost is part of the transition to moly is also about enabling stack height reduction, so you can go to more layers and limit the stack height in a way that allows you to then have more productive and just more productive depth issue and other things. And so, I think it's an important inflection for the industry and an opportunity for Lam, and we're well positioned to win that inflection literally. Toshiya Hari : Got it. Thank you. And then as my follow-up on HBM, you talked about your business growing more than 3X year-over-year, I think, and I think that comment was consistent with what you had communicated last quarter. Based on sort of the input you have, the market intel you have, what kind of growth or market growth in HBM, do you think that increase in your business supports in \u201824 and obviously demand is very strong, but how are you thinking about supply demand from your perspective exiting the year and into \u201825 in HBM? Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Appreciate it. Maybe I'll give it a try. I mean, when you look at overall good demand, HBM is probably a point or two of it, although it's growing and adding to the broad market. But it's clearly requiring incremental investment of our SABRE 3D tool, our deep silicon etch tool. And I think it's something you're going to hear us talking about for many years to come. This form factor is going to continue to be important relative to AI enablement, feeding the GPU the data that it needs. Small today, but growing quite rapidly. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore : Great, thank you. I wanted to follow up. You had mentioned that there was a customer that you're classifying as NAND, that others might be classifying as DRAM. I just wanted to double click on that. If you could talk to what's going on there, is that customer doing both and people just have different classifications? Should we be thinking that there's more NAND capacity coming on in China than I had thought before? Can you just talk to that change? Doug Bettinger : I guess all I'd say, Joe, is sometimes there could be a little bit of confusion. And I felt that as I was talking to people over the last quarter. So the reason I said it was, it's actually a non-volatile device or it's got non-volatile components. And early on, because of that, we put everything into non-volatile memory. So non-volatile memory is more than NAND. This isn't an enormous number, but it's big enough that I wanted people to hear us tell you where it is and you can go think about it. And you probably know who the customer is. I'm not going to disclose it here, but it is one customer in specialty DRAM. Joseph Moore : Got it. Thank you for that. And then on the Reliant business, can you talk about changes in that business as we sort of move into a lower level of utilization in trailing etch nodes? Do you see that kind of returning to more of a refurbished tools business, where there's stuff that you're able to actually refurbish and any ramifications we should think about for profitability there? Timothy Archer : Yes, I guess I'll just come in and refer. I would be surprised if we moved back towards a customer's investing of equipment from fabs and us being able to refurbish those tools. I think you could see obviously the ebbs and flows with demand of how many new tools we ship but I think it still remains mostly as a new tool trailing etch node business for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Doug, I wanted to go back to something you just mentioned here around the relative capital intensity of upgrades versus greenfield investments for NAND as we get into \u201825. And I get the idea that you should take a larger share of upgrades but am I thinking about this wrong? Wouldn't the absolute amount of WFE in an upgrade -driven cycle be a lot lower than if it was in a greenfield cycle? Like how do I think about the puts and takes of those two variables in the context of NAND growth into 2025? Timothy Archer : Sure, Stacey. I'll take that. I was actually the one who said the comment. Yes, no problem. I just wanted to own it in case you disagree so. I think you're thinking about it exactly right. The reason upgrades are so attractive for customers is the total WFE spend is lower. That's why they upgrade the installed base. And so for my comment was specifically about Lam's outperformance relative to whatever WFE is for the industry next year. In an upgrade heavy cycle, which obviously we haven't had for the last two years in that next cycle of NAND upgrades, we're saying we would capture a higher percentage of whatever that WFE is. Now, we've said in the past that Lam's opportunity, actually, because of that much higher capture rate is not so different in terms of revenue for every bit added through an upgrade versus a greenfield. So if WFE comes down, that's why it's attractive for customers. But for Lam, we capture almost the same amount of revenue because of the much higher capture rate, and so kind of both ways. Stacy Rasgon : So you're indifferent to like an upgrade cycle versus a greenfield cycle? Timothy Archer : Well, I would say, the only thing I would say is because there's been lots of questions about whether Lam's market share in defense and others, we're not quite indifferent because the power of the installed base is that, again, when the customer's preferred path is to upgrade what they already have, it means that the positions don't change. And so Lam's very strong position carries forward in that case. So agnostic from a financial perspective, but obviously our position in the industry continues to strengthen through each of those great cycles. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up again, I wanted to go back to the segment expectations in China. So I know this I think was Doug said you didn't have anything to tell us on segments. But if I look at your slide deck on slide 5, if I'm reading unless I'm reading it wrong it does seem to suggest that you see, it says sustained investment in domestic China for DRAM in calendar \u201824 and weakness in foundry logic, so is that actually what you're expecting? The China degradation through the year in foundry logic and DRAM sustaining or is this slide, am I just reading the slide wrong? Doug Bettinger : Yes, no. Spacey you kind of have one customer in China DRAM. So I got to be careful talking about that. China is going to modulate through the year, all right, it's not going to stay at 42% is the statement that I made and it's going to modulate in every segment I believe in the China region. Stacy Rasgon : Okay, I mean the slide says just to expect us led by a HAM sustained investment in domestic China under DRAM. So that's not what's going to happen? Doug Bettinger : Unfortunately, I know the slides in primary right now states you were having some technical challenges. It's all going to modulate. Timothy Archer : Slide 5 when you pull it up. Operator : Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question, I wanted to revisit your comment about spares doubling. How important is that data point like what were you expecting instead of versus the actual result? And how much does it increase your confidence about NAND recovery because you're not really increasing the WFE expectations for this year, right? So on surface this comment about spares doubling sounds, like a very important data point. But I'm not sure how to quite put that in context of what it means for Lam this year. Doug Bettinger : Okay, well, Vivek, we didn't say spares would double. We said that it was a double-digit percent growth quarter-on-quarter in our spares revenue, so not doubling. But I think that in general, I mean, the way we look at that and why we made that comment, obviously it's positive for us to see spares move up. If you think, go back to our commentary previously about CSPG over the last few years. We've said spares revenue will grow year-on-year because the installed base itself grows. However, through this downturn, the cuts in fabulization were so severe that we actually saw spares revenue come down, which surprised us a bit. So maybe to your point of expectations, we knew that as soon as customers started to utilize the fabs and bring some of the tools back online, we would see spares increase. We said that would be the first sign that the end market was really starting to improve. And so the reason we called it out was that obviously it further confirms, I think, what you're hearing from our customers, which is that utilization is starting to improve. It doesn't tie to WFE because utilization, what you have, is one issue. When you choose to spend more to either upgrade technology or add capacity is a second decision. We said that is likely still more of a 2025 event on the equipment spend side. But you have to get the first indication, which is utilization improvement, spares improving, and then the rest will come. Vivek Arya : And then the other thing on the call, I believe that you mentioned CSPG will be flat year or did I not hear that properly or did you mean it sequentially or did you mean it for this calendar year? Because if it is for the calendar year, that implies pretty strong kind of mid-teens growth in the second half. So if you could clarify what you said about CSPG growth and whatever timeframe you were referring to. Doug Bettinger : Yes, I said flattish, Vivek, plus or minus flat, and by the way, that's not a new disclosure. We said that last quarter as well. Vivek Arya : For this calendar year or for \u2013 Doug Bettinger : Correct, for this calendar year, yes. \u201824 over \u201823. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Christopher Caso : Yes, thank you. I guess the first question is on DRAM, and could you perhaps talk about some of the moving parts that are going on with that right now? And I think a previous question you talked about, the China part of DRAM expecting that to moderate through the year. Obviously, the direct revenue from HBM sounds good, but there's a broader capacity question going on in DRAM that's fungible with HBM. Could you talk about, what your expectations are for that as the year progresses? Timothy Archer : Yes. Let me start. I think just to address this one point about the fungibility of capacity, you're correct. Obviously, if you're looking at DDR5, I think we've made a couple of comments in the past, though. One, we're talking specifically about the additional tools that are needed to enable HBM. So that's why we talk about our electroplating and our Indian silicon etch tools, because those are added to whatever capacity you might have for DRAM. You need to add those tools to make HBM possible. And so that's what we're seeing rise by 3X this year. On the second side, when you go from conventional DRAM to HBM, our customers have talked about and the industry has talked about the much larger die size because you've had to create the real estate that's needed to add the TSVs. And so, while you may be able to translate some of the same DRAM equipment over to produce the same number of bits, you'll need more of that equipment as well. So, those are the key drivers as you're moving for additional spending growth as you move into HBM, DRAM. Christopher Caso : Got it. As a follow-up, you made in your prepared remarks a comment talking about a billion dollars in revenue from gate-all-around this year. Could you talk about that in context of, where the overall opportunity is for gate-all-around? Is this -- is that billion represent, what you would consider to be gate-all-around capacity? Is that just getting the processes started, kind of where are we with that gate-all-around ramp? Timothy Archer : Yes, I mean, I think it's, we're really just starting at gate-all-around. Our comment was a billion dollars of shipments into the gate-all-around nodes this year. And it's across all of our types of products that help enable gate-all-around smaller technology nodes. And so what we've said is that every technology node, etch in-depth intensity grows, and our SAM opportunity expands. So gate-all-around being an important node where there's need for new tools from Lam, like in our selective etch product portfolio or in our ALB product portfolio, that might not have existed to the same degree in prior nodes. And so those are the areas where we're seeing growth, as well as just growth in the rest of our advanced technology products in etch in-depth. Ram Ganesh : Thank you, Chris. Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Our next and final question comes from Brian Chin from Stifel. Brian Chin : Hi, there. Thanks for sneaking me in. The companies previously discussed an incremental $1 billion to $1.5 billion increase in WFE for every 1% AI server penetration. Last year, given the under-utilization of capacity and the focus on conversion activity, maybe the math was lower last year. But now that utilization rates for advanced foundry and DRAM nodes have recovered, do you see AI growth, I guess, driving spending levels more consistent with that $1 billion to $1.5 billion? And do you already see that maybe playing out to some degree in your order backlog? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Brian, we're not going to talk about order backlog. But the statements we made, and you've got it right, which was for every percent that it's an AI server versus an enterprise-class server because of the eight times DRAM, much bigger logic die, the GPUs, and the 3x NAND, it's a $1 billion to $1.5 billion amount of WFE. And that's absolutely still how we see it. And but you're right, if things are underutilized, you don't need to spend nearly as much. But that's a temporary situation. Eventually, things get back to being utilized. Brian Chin : Okay. Yes, that's helpful, and then maybe just kind of follow-up on the last follow-up but again of that $1 billion kind of shipment for gate-all-around in 2024 calendar year, how much of that is second half weighted? Is it more kind of pilot production or how much is it pilot versus high volume? Timothy Archer : Yes, we're not going to give color on exactly when we're shipping just because we think that's more for our customers to talk about in terms of their expansion on those notes. Brian Chin : Okay, fair enough. I think it is more second half bias. Thanks. Ram Ganesh : Thanks operator. Timothy Archer : That concludes our remarks guys. Thanks for joining the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

A replay of this call will be made available later this afternoon on our website. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Timothy Archer : Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. In the June quarter, Lam delivered another set of solid results with revenues, profitability and earnings per share, all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our CSBG business posted strong growth with revenues up 22% sequentially, led by Reliant and spares. On the manufacturing side, we achieved a key milestone in the quarter with our Malaysia factory shipping its 5,000th chamber. This is the fastest ramp of a new manufacturing facility in Lam's history, and we remain on track to achieve our long-term cost reduction goals through an expanded global manufacturing and supply chain footprint. As previously communicated, 2024 is a year of strategic investment for Lam, where we are prioritizing product development for key technology inflections, global R&D infrastructure close to our customers and digital transformation for operational efficiency at scale. We believe these investments will put Lam in a position to outperform as the industry moves into a period of multiyear WFE spending expansion. Now turning to WFE, we expect this year's spending to be in the mid $90 billion range. Our customer investment profile is generally unchanged from our prior view, apart from slightly stronger domestic China spending and additional demand related to the ramp of high-bandwidth memory or HBM capacity. We see foundry logic, DRAM and NAND investments all up on a year-on-year basis. Global spending on mature node technologies is expected to be roughly flat year-on-year. Looking ahead to 2025, we see a positive environment for continued growth in WFE spending. The power of AI is a transformative business tool is still yet to be fully realized. Today, the focus on AI model training is driving strong demand for GPUs and HBM. However, as AI use cases expand, we believe inferencing at the etch will spur content growth of low-power DRAM and NAND storage in enterprise PCs and smartphones. Investments for AI-enabled etch devices play particularly well to Lam's strengths. We anticipate that memory customers looking to scale capacity and lower bid cost will bias WFE spending toward technology upgrades of the installed base. For NAND, the etch and deposition intensity of upgrades is significantly higher than in a greenfield investment. When you consider Lam's sizable installed base in memory, including roughly 7,500 high aspect ratio dielectric etch chambers for NAND alone, we are positioned to outgrow overall WFE when customers upgrade existing memory production lines to next-generation nodes. Longer term, etch and deposition are set to play an increasingly vital role in the industry's efforts to develop faster, more power efficient and lower-cost semiconductors to serve AI-related applications by delivering critical solutions for atomic level device scaling, new materials innovation and advanced packaging integration, we see tremendous opportunity for Lam to expand our served market and increase our share at each successive process technology node. To this end, our R&D focus is yielding exciting new products, including this year, our first direct power coupled conductor etch tool with matchless power source and bias, known as DIRECTDRIVE. This new power source uses solid-state drivers to stabilize the plasma in the etch chamber 500 times faster than current industry standards. By combining direct power coupling with Lam's unique plasma pulsing capabilities, our latest conductor etch systems are delivering best-in-class performance for newly emerging 4F2 DRAM applications. In 4F2 devices, the nature of the bit line placement requires precise etching of ultra-small high aspect ratio silicon structures to avoid device shorts or leakage. With direct power coupling and plasma pulsing, Lam connects to vertically oriented 4F2 transistor architectures with unprecedented depth uniformity and profile controller. Similarly, conductor etch is becoming a critical enabler for EUV patterning for gate-all-around and DRAM due to the need to reduce etch placement error. For nodes below 2 nanometers, the requirement is for roughly 40% tighter control than at 5 nanometers. Our new conductor etch tool delivers a 30% reduction in feature roughness, which is one of the main contributors to etch placement error. In addition, we can achieve one to two orders of magnitude improvement in defectivity for a given EUV dose, further helping customers reduce the overall cost and improve the capability of the EUV patterning process. Turning to NAND. AI applications are driving demand for faster, higher-capacity enterprise SSDs. NAND makers are pursuing both vertical and lateral scaling of NAND arrays as well as increasing bits stored per sell through implementation of QLC and PLC technologies. In support of these efforts, Lam is developing new dielectric etch and deposition capabilities. Earlier today, we announced Lam Cryo 3.0, Lam's third generation of cryogenic etch technology. Building on our learning from nearly 1,000 cryogenic etch chambers, running in NAND fabs worldwide. This new patented cryogenic etch process delivers industry-leading control of the NAND memory channel hole profile. When a Lam Cryo 3.0 is deployed on our Vantex system, the etch are delivering the industry's highest available ion energy, we can create a 10-micron deep channel hole that has a top-to-bottom profile deviation of less than 10 nanometers or less than 0.1% relative to its depth. Such tight profile control allows customers to increase bit density by packing more cells per layer, while also having the flexibility to add more layers per tier. Lam Cryo 3.0 also addresses our industry's need for more sustainable solutions, delivering a 40% reduction in energy consumption per wafer and a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per wafer compared to non-cryogenic etchers. Deposition technology is also advancing quickly to support increased bit density and lower cost through multi-tier stacking. Polysilicon and tungsten gap fill materials have typically been used to enable tier stacking in high layer count NAND. Integration of these materials, however, has resulted in poor control of critical dimensions and overlay, negatively impacting yield and performance. Lam's innovative PECVD-based pure carbon and gap fill process provides an attractive alternative material. With the unique combination of high etch selectivity, superior mechanical properties and simplified dry post process removability, it also reduces the number of process steps required in some cases by approximately 50% compared to traditional approaches. Overall, etch and deposition are becoming increasingly critical to addressing the complex semiconductor requirements of a growing AI environment. We are excited by the breadth of opportunities we see ahead for the company, especially those created by technology inflections to gate all around backside power delivery, advanced packaging and [indiscernible] processing. All of these are etch and deposition intensive and each represents a $1 billion or higher growth opportunity for Lam. We look forward to sharing our progress on these fronts as well as our long-term financial model at our next Investor Day, which we are planning to hold in February 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Doug. Douglas Bettinger : Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We executed well in the June 2024 quarter. Our June quarter results came in above the midpoint or exceeded our guidance ranges for all financial metrics. We were pleased with the company's strong execution. For fiscal year 2024, we achieved the highest gross margin percentage since the merging of Lam with Novellus in 2013, coming in at 48.2% and we generated quite strong free cash flow of approximately $4.3 billion or 29% of revenue. Let's look at the details of our June quarter results. Revenue came in at $3.87 billion, which was an increase from the prior quarter and over the midpoint of guidance. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was -- excuse me, $1.55 billion, which is a decrease of $194 million in the March quarter related to revenue recognized that was tied to customer advanced payments. As we sit here today, I believe deferred revenue remains stable at these levels for the foreseeable future. Let's turn to the revenue segment details. June quarter systems revenue in memory was 36%, which was a decrease from the prior quarter level of 44%. The decline in the memory segment was mainly attributable to DRAM. DRAM came in at 19% of systems revenue compared with 23% in the March quarter as investments in mature nodes declined in the June quarter. DRAM revenue reached a new record in fiscal year 2024 with spending focused on DDR5 and HBM enablement as well as on the 1Y node. Non-volatile memory came in at 17% of our systems revenue, which was down from the March quarter level of 21%. And just a reminder, we are characterizing one customer's investment in specialty DRAM as a non-volatile investment since it has a non-volatile component in the device. Net revenue was at a low point for this year, and I expect NAND investment to gradually improve as utilization rates return to more normal levels, our customers slowly increased spending in conversions to 2XX and 3XX layer devices into the next year. The Foundry segment represented 43% of our systems revenue, which was roughly flat with the percentage concentration in the March quarter of 44%. Growth in shipments for gate all around nodes was offset by a decline in mature node spending. The logic and other segment were 21% of system revenue in the June quarter, up from the prior level of 12%. The increase was driven by strength in mature node spending in China. With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region came in at 39%, down slightly from the prior quarter level of 42% and a little bit higher than our expectations from the previous earnings call. This was driven by domestic China spending. The next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 18% of revenue in the June quarter, versus 24% in the March quarter. Taiwan was 15% of revenue in the June quarter, which was an increase from 9% in the March quarter. The customer support business group revenue in the June quarter pulled approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% from the prior quarter level and 14% higher than the June quarter in calendar 2023. CSBG revenue represented 44% of our June quarter revenues and reached the highest point since the end of calendar 2022, driven primarily by an increase in Reliant systems, followed by growth in spares. Our Reliant systems revenue benefited from strength in domestic China spending for specialty and mature nodes. Spares revenue increased largely due to continued improvement in utilization at our memory customers, as well as a little bit of inventory stocking. I do not think CSBG will grow modestly in calendar year 2024. Let's look at profitability. Our June quarter gross margin came in at 48.5% at the top end of our guided range and slightly down from 48.7% in the March quarter. June quarter gross margin benefited from continued improvement in factory efficiencies, which largely offset the headwind we saw in customer mix that we talked about on the last earnings call. Operating expenses for the June quarter were $689 million, down marginally from the prior quarter amount of $698 million. As Tim mentioned, we continue to prioritize spending in research and development to extend our technology differentiation as well as expand our product portfolio. I'd just point out that more than 70% of our total operating expenses were concentrated in research and development. The June quarter operating margin was 30.7%, above the guidance range mainly because of that strong gross margin performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%. We estimate the tax rate for the remainder of the calendar year 2024 to be in the low to mid-teens level, and this rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $19 million in income compared with $10 million in income in the March quarter. The increase in OI&E was primarily the result of fluctuations in the fair value of our venture investments. And as we've talked about in the past, you will see variability in OI&E quarter-to-quarter. Let's turn to the capital return. We allocated approximately $382 million to share repurchases, and we paid $261 million in dividends in the June quarter. During the quarter, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase authorization. We have $10.8 billion remaining in the plan at the end of the June quarter. For fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.7 billion or 88% of free cash flow, which was in line with our long-term capital plans of returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow. June quarter diluted earnings per share were $8.14, close to the high end of our guidance range. The diluted share count was 131 million shares on track with our expectations and down from the March quarter. Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5.9 billion at the end of the June quarter, up a little bit from $5.7 billion at the end of the March quarter. Day sales outstanding were 59 days in the June quarter, a slight increase from 57 days in the March quarter. June quarter inventory turns of 1.9 times compared with 1.8 times in the prior quarter. We are making progress in bringing inventory levels down, and we'll continue to work on this throughout the rest of calendar year 2024. Our noncash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $79 million for equity compensation, $74 million in depreciation and $14 million in amortization. Capital expenditures were $101 million, flat with the March quarter level with spending mainly centered on lab investments in the United States and Asia, as well as manufacturing facilities in Asia, supporting our global strategy to be close to our customers' development and manufacturing locations. We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,200 regular full-time employees, which was flat with the prior quarter. Let's turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September 2024 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.05 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 47%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This gross margin decline is reflective primarily of an unfavorable quarter-to-quarter change in customer mix. I expect this change to continue to be a slight incremental headwind in the December quarter. Operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Gross margin and operating margin included impact from ongoing transformation costs related to projects to improve our systems and operations. As we communicated at the beginning of the year, we're focused on reengineering our business processes and systems to drive operational efficiencies and to implement AI at greater scale. And finally, we're forecasting earnings per share of $8 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 131 million shares. Let me wrap up. As we finish the first half of calendar year 2024, I was pleased that we were able to execute to the objectives we shared at the beginning of the year. We prioritize investment to extend our technology differentiation while driving operational improvements. We're encouraged that the spares business recovery is beginning and upgrade activity should improve as we exit the calendar year. Longer term, Lam is well positioned to capitalize the increase in etch and deposition intensity by delivering new capabilities at multiple new manufacturing inflections that we see ahead. We look forward to talking to you in February at our planned Investor Day about the long-term opportunities for Lam to continue our outperformance in the semiconductor industry. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Doug, I wanted to ask about the service system mix in the guidance. So you said that the service -- I thought you said which you now think it's going to grow modestly this year. But if I flatline service in September and December, it's up 8% year-over-year. So can you just clarify what you're thinking for service in the guidance? Thanks. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, Tim, we don't decompose the individual components of the guide. I was clarifying, we now expect [indiscernible] to be up a little bit for the year. It was particularly strong in the June quarter. Whether it is up, down or sideways from that as we go forward. I'm not going to give you individual components of the forecast. But I do think for the year, it's going to grow a little bit. Timothy Arcuri : Okay. Great, Doug. Thanks. And then can you talk a little bit about -- just in DRAM, I think there's generally more excitement, Tim, about DRAM WFE among most investors out there about where it could go during this next peak. Obviously, you do very well in NAND. But in DRAM, you did talk about a lot of the investments that you're making. Can you just talk about -- I know your leverage to the advanced packaging part of the HBM dollars being spent but that's still a pretty small piece of it. So can you just maybe give a chance to kind of discuss some of the view that you're not very levered to DRAM and give us a sense of maybe where you're investing and where you think you can gain share in DRAM. Timothy Archer : Sure. Thanks, Tim. And as you said, we do very well in NAND. We still think NAND day is coming, as I said. We've seen some of that -- those commentaries around the enterprise SSDs, et cetera. But on the DRAM side, the reason we highlighted the progress we're making, especially in this conductor etch. One, it's a new tool we've introduced. It's new capabilities that are very exciting for the industry and really targeted towards the types of ultra small structures that are going to exist in future DRAM nodes going forward. Lam is the global leader in conductor etch. And so we're applying all of that expertise and learning we have towards future DRAM challenges. And I think there's tremendous opportunity for us on those applications, as I pointed out. The other side of it, a lot of the excitement around DRAM is related to HBM. And there, as you commented, we play extremely well with our strong position in both TSV -- etching as well as the TSV electroplating. And I think that we don't see any change in that strong position going forward. So we get the benefit both from the scaling and architectural changes that are occurring in DRAM going forward and from the advanced packaging and HBM related expansion. And all of these -- on both of those sides are multiplied by the fact that you get fewer bits per wafer. And so everybody recognizes you're going to need a lot more DRAM wafers processed going forward. And ultimately, that translates into more equipment from LAM. Timothy Arcuri : Thank you, Tim. Timothy Archer : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking question. My first one is for Doug. I think, Doug, you gave some color on China. Kind of curious how to think about China into the back half of this calendar year and into calendar 2025? And along the same path, you kind of mentioned that December quarter, there could be a slight more gross margin headwind. Is there a way to quantify how much that -- how many basis points of headwind would it be in December compared to the 47% in September? And then I have a follow-up for Tim. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, sure. Krish, I'll just remind you what we said last quarter. It hasn't really changed in this quarter and what that statement was that for the year, 2023-2024, China is up. However, it is a somewhat first half weighted year this year as opposed to last year, it was somewhat second half weighted. I'm not communicating, hey, it's going away. It's not going away. It's just the spending because sometimes these customers are a little bit bigger than a bread box, it can be a little bit lumpy and that's very much what we're seeing in China. I'm not ready to tell you exactly what next year looks like from the China region. But I do think it's going to be a pretty solid year, right? Again, it's not going away. It's too soon for us to quantify things for next year, but 25% should be a pretty decent year in China, Krish. Krish Sankar : And then, Doug, any color on the December quarter gross margin? Douglas Bettinger : I'm not going to give you a number, Chris, but I've been signaling for a while that because of customer mix, margin will have a little bit of some headwind going into the second half of the year. I just guided you to 47% in September and suggested that there might be a little bit of incremental headwind into December because of customer mix is what I said in the script. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Thank you for that Doug. And then, Tim, just a quick follow-up. When I look at all the upcoming tech inflections, like gate all around, backside power delivery, maybe down the road [indiscernible] DRAM. You spoke within that, the transition to 4F2 DRAM from 6F2. I'm kind of curious, is this really that material? And if so, is there a way to size the opportunity for Lam at 4F2. You spoke a little bit about [100 to etch] (ph) just kind of wondering if you can give some more color around how to quantify that number for the 4F2 architecture transition. Thank you. Timothy Archer : Sure. Well, I don't think we're prepared to quantify it for you today. But I think that -- what my comment was, though, we see each of these inflections. And 6F2 to 4F2 is a technology inflection that brings with it some important changes. I mean, one, the architectural layout of the device itself puts additional requirements on etch, which I think we're very well suited to serve. And that's why we've been developing new conductor etch capabilities to target those new requirements. So there is some incremental opportunity there. Clearly, the jump to 3D NAND is a much bigger step-up in etch depth intensity, but our goal is to increase our SAM and grow our share at every technology node. So we look at whatever is the new requirement and how we can best address that. You also look -- as you look at DRAM going forward, another thing that's happening, whether it's 6F2 or 4F2 is the implementation of more EUV layers and how Lam plays in EUV. Again, anything where effectively pattern transfer etches, the feature sizes are getting smaller, precision is required. These are the kinds of high-tech etches that Lam excels at. And so we look at participating in those. And then on the deposition side, of course, we've talked about things like our dry EUV resist process and how that plays into EUV as DRAM and foundry logic transition from EUV to high-end AUV. And so, we're just looking at every technology node as an opportunity for us to gain. Krish Sankar : Thank you. Timothy Archer : Thanks, Krish. Operator : Your next question comes from Srinivas Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Srinivas Pajjuri : Thank you. Tim, I have a question on DRAM. Obviously, the recovery has been ongoing and HBM is a secular driver that you talked about, and you do have a very strong position in that market as well. Then I look at your revenue, I think it peaked around December of 2023, and it's been kind of declining on a sequential basis. I'm guessing some of that is maybe mature now DRAM. Just wondering if you're kind of at the bottom and then given all the talk about HBM spending, I would think that it's going to kind of -- it should, at some point, come back strongly. So I just want to hear your thoughts on why it's been declining? And how should we think about, in particular, in DRAM revenue. Timothy Archer : Yes. I think you generally have it pretty correct. We had talked about the fact that some mature DRAM spending was a little bit heavily concentrated in the second half of last year through early part of this year even. And as that came off, there was some of a reset in what we would call kind of traditional or the conventional DRAM. That is being picked up at some rate by the growth in HBM, but HBM itself is still in its ramping phase. And I think that as we look into 2025 becomes an even bigger driver of wafers in DRAM. And so, I think that explains probably the profile. And I think that as we look forward to the secular driver of HBM, the impact on wafer effectively, how many wafers require us to produce that number of bits due to the dye size and due to the complexity of stacking these DRAMs means that we see DRAM demand for DRAM equipment continuing to grow through 2025 and probably well beyond that. Srinivas Pajjuri : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then on the CSBG business being up 20% sequentially, 22%. I know you don't want to give us guidance going forward, at least for the next quarter. I'm just curious about the sustainability of some of the trends that you're seeing, Tim. And then what does that mean for the overall WFE? Is this a prelude to something? And is this just the utilization improving? And then does this usually follow in terms of WFE increasing in terms of new tech migrations or capacity additions. So any color on that would be helpful. Timothy Archer : Sure. It's a good question. And I guess, again, reminding people that the CSBG business includes our Reliant business, which sells into mature nodes. It includes spares, it includes upgrades and services. And so each of those components move somewhat differently. And we talked about this quarter, particularly being strong as a result of Reliant and spares. We are starting to see a pickup in utilization in the memory fabs as we've talked about. And I've talked a little bit about the fact that as we look forward, we think that upgrades will begin to become a much more prominent part of our customers' WFE spending as they look to upgrade memory fabs that they really haven't been upgraded in quite some time because of the severe downturn that we've seen in that -- in those markets over the last few years. And so I do think, going forward, you see a little bit more of a balance between those different segments. Upgrades coming up stronger and spares continuing to grow simply because our installed base itself continues to get bigger. Traditionally, we would have always said that we would expect the CSBG business to grow every single year, and that's simply effective every year we ship more tools, and those tools then require services and spares and basically present new opportunities for Lam to capture revenue from those systems. So I think long-term, CSBG will be returning back to that growth and next year, probably much more biased towards the upgrades business as customers start to do brand new fab upgrades. Srinivas Pajjuri : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Your next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. CJ Muse : Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question I was hoping to focus on gross margins. A couple of quarters ago, Doug, you talked about kind of looking back to the June kind of 2023 quarter as normalized. But given the guide today, it sounds like that was conservative and it's a higher number. So just as you think about calendar 2025, as you get to kind of a normalized China mix and you normalize to Reliant, what would be kind of the base level we should be thinking about for gross margins? And then can you talk to what kind of accretion we should be thinking about related to Malaysia and/or some of these higher-margin upgrade drivers? Douglas Bettinger : Yes, CJ, I mean, you've alluded to some of the things that move gross margin on, obviously. Yes, I had previously anchored you and other with respect to that June quarter before the China mix improved or strengthened, I guess, maybe not improved. As the baseline -- I guided it down a little bit in September, described customer mix softening a little bit relative to moving that. And I'm not suggesting, hey, a little bit more in December potentially. It's all about customer mix. Too soon for me to guide you for next year, but the things you should be thinking about is what does that customer mix look like next year? I'm not sure yet, and I'm not ready to point you to numbers, but what we will begin to show up in a more significant fashion is the accretion for -- from those Asia factories as we ramp output, that will be a benefit to gross margins. So those are the moving pieces to be thinking about. The customer mix, I'm not entirely sure, but as we see a likely WFE environment next year, that's somewhat stronger, increasingly, the incremental volume will be supported from those Asia factories, which should be beneficial to gross margin CJ. CJ Muse : Very helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, in your prepared remarks you spoke to the 7,500 high aspect ratio etch chambers installed in demand industry. And just curious, as you see upgrades there, what kind of growth could that add to overall NAND WFE specifically to you guys? Is there a kind of percentage we should think about? Any help there would be great. Timothy Archer : We haven't quantified that, but the reason I included it was simply to point out, the installed base itself becomes powerful driver of revenue during those upgrade cycles. And we do think that the next phase, we've seen higher memory fab utilization, particularly when we talked about NAND beginning to improve last quarter, and that seems to be continuing as we move through the remainder of this year. When we get to next year and the upgrades start in earnest, those tools represent opportunities for Lam to help our customers achieve both a technology upgrade and a bit cost reduction as they move forward and accrues quite a lot of revenue for Lam relative to the amount of WFE spend. I remind people, the WFE Lam's capture rate of spending in an upgrade is significantly higher because etch and deposition represents so much of the upgrade. [indiscernible] size of our installed base. CJ Muse : Thanks so much. Timothy Archer : Thanks, CJ. Operator : The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask like if the NAND business next year is primarily driven by upgrades, what does that imply for growth? Like would it be conceivable that NAND WFE could double year-over-year in calendar 2025 that was purely upgrade driven? Or would you need capacity additions to get there? And are you seeing any signs at all of capacity additions right now? It doesn't sound like it. Timothy Archer : Well, Stacy, what I would say is that, obviously, we're not going to guide what NAND WFE is next year. Frankly, I think it's still a developing story. But what we're trying to say is that, as customers move to upgrades, whatever WFE is spent, Lam will be the primary beneficiary of that WFE spend. And so, that's a year in which -- my comment was, we would be confident that we would outgrow WFE in the NAND space if it was primarily upgrade spend. And upgrades represent a tremendous efficient way for customers to essentially advance their technology and lower their costs. And so, we do think that will be the next phase of NAND investment based on our thoughts. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Got it. I mean maybe to follow-up on that just a little bit. I mean, if you look at your current like NAND outlook for this year, would you say that, that outlook has gotten better or worse or stayed the same versus like 90 days ago? Douglas Bettinger : It probably hasn't changed much, Stacy. This is Doug. Maybe a little bit better. We're certainly see a little bit of an uptick in utilization. But I don't think it's meaningfully different, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon : So got it. So it's kind of a noise. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, kind of a noise. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Given the strength in CSBG, it looks like utilization by your customer base continues to rise. Did that also broaden out to start to include not just leading etch logic foundry, DRAM and NAND, but maybe also start to include mature and specialty fabs as well? Or are at a minimum, mature and specialty utilization at least stabilizing in line with some of the cyclical improvements that we're seeing in the semi industry? Douglas Bettinger : Harlan, maturing that stuff is still pretty soft, frankly. And I think you understand what's going on. If you just listen to everybody else's earnings calls in the analog, industrial, automotive space. There's still a lot of inventory out there, it's still relatively soft. The statements we're making on utilization have more to do with what we're seeing in the memory fabs, quite frankly. Harlan Sur : I appreciate that. And then on HBM and advanced packaging. I mean last night we heard AMD talk about supply dynamics being tight on their AI GPU supply next year [indiscernible] and HBM. On the custom ASIC front, we hear companies like Broadcom keep getting upside orders from their AI customers like Google. Last quarter, you talked about doing $1 billion in advanced packaging and HBM revenues this year. Has that number moved higher and is the team capacity constrained on advanced packaging systems and are your lead times here for those tools starting to stretch out? Timothy Archer : Well, it has moved higher, and we're not going to requantify it just yet, but it is -- we're seeing very strong demand in those areas. I talked about the expansion of our global manufacturing supply chain footprint. And obviously, that's giving us more flexibility than we had during the last ramp. Our goal through all those investments was to be able to respond in this next few years of expansion better than we did in the expansion that we saw right around the time of COVID. And so, I think that, that will position us. I\u2019m sure, you're always a little bit short when customers always drop in tools within your lead time, which keeps you busy. But I think that we're doing quite a nice job responding to the urgent request from our customers. We actually like this. I would say that generally from running the business, we like this environment where all parts of our business are a little bit supply constrained. I mean, you hear a lot of our customers talking about being cautious about adding capacity. Other customers talking about having a little trouble getting tools. I think that's a good place for us to be because it means that I think we're setting up for more manageable long-term ramp of demand than sort of a short spike followed by, again, periods of digestion that always creates a little bit of chaos in the industry. Harlan Sur : Thank you, Tim. Thanks, Doug. Timothy Archer : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Doug, if I look at the 2023 year-over-year China sales growth among the big five equipment makers. All of them are up quite well. [indiscernible] is up like 250% and the U.S. peers are up in teens or 20%, but you guys were down 11% total China sales in 2023. And this year, you're expecting China sales to be up. So I'm just trying to understand the dynamics last year. Were this just a function of maybe NAND spending and the NAND project not being active? Or are there competitive elements in China that are working against you? Timothy Archer : Atif, I'll remind you that perhaps our largest customer got restricted when the regulations came out, our NAND customer in China. That customer was pretty strong in 2022, went away in 2023. So the year-over-year comparisons you're making, you've got to factor that in. And then the strength we're seeing in 2023 to 2024 is a different mix entirely, really not any NAND in China to speak of, at least not domestic China. I don't know if that helps you, but make sure you're thinking about that. Atif Malik : Yes, it all makes it. That's helpful. And then on the cryo improvement, Tim, that you mentioned, are those improvements or process tool of record is going to solidify your market share next year or the year after? Timothy Archer : Well, I think that all of these things. When you introduce something new, I mean I think what people kind of lose sight of is. Generally, we're working several years ahead with our customers on R&D. I talked about the investments we're making where we make -- we're building labs close to our customers in different geographies. That's because, in many cases, we're engaging those customers a good five years ahead of production implementation. That's not to say Lam Cryo 3.0 is going to take five years to get into production. But it's not a technology disramping, say, this year, but it really is looking out at the needs of our customers wanted to generations out and really solving their difficult etch challenges. So sometimes when the benefits are so good, and I talked about the fact that we get about 2.5 times etch rate, tremendous profile control, customers will often pull that in sooner. But really, this is designed for kind of the 400-plus layer may ultimately end up being pulled in earlier than that, but that's where you really start to see the needs for this kind of capability. Atif Malik : Exactly I was asking about it. It is 400 layers or 200 layers, but it sounds like 200 layer. Timothy Archer : Yes. And I think that what we -- you'll see in our press release today, we talked a little bit about -- we're trying to chart the path across not only etch, but also our deposition films towards where the industry needs to go to get to 1,000 layers, because we truly see over the next decade that that's where you want to get in terms of satisfying bit density and cost as NAND demand continues to expand with AI. Atif Malik : Great. Thank you. Timothy Archer : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I joined late, so I do apologize if these questions have been addressed. Just on the third-generation cryo tool, Tim, that you spoke about. How is this technology or tool fundamentally different or better than your nearest competitor? I know you just spoke to some of the characteristics, but if you can clarify that for us to the extent you're comfortable, that would be really, really helpful. And then my second question, again, on the CSBG side, probably one for Doug. And again, you may have address this. For the full year -- calendar year, I think you previously said flattish, plus or minus. Is that still the view? Or given the strength you saw in June, is that -- should we be thinking about a higher growth rate for the full year? Thank you. Douglas Bettinger : Maybe I'll take that one first, and then I'll let Tim comment on the 3.0 stuff. Yes, you might have missed my scripted statements. As we sit here today, we now expect that for 2024 CSBG, the word I used was modestly grow this year versus last year. And part of that is, we saw particular strength in the June quarter in Reliant. Little bit of an improvement in spares. And as we think about the utilization trends that are likely occurring with our memory customers, I think spares continues to be decent and we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of the upgrade spend that we've been talking about for a while. And I'll hand it over to Tim on the 3.0 stuff. Timothy Archer : Sure, Doug. Yes. I think, obviously, what I would just start with is the biggest difference between what we're delivering with Lam Cryo 3.0 and what our competitors do is in the results on the wafer, which we talked about pretty amazing 10-micron deep holes with less than a 10-nanometer paper from the top to bottom. At etch rates that are 2.5 times conventional etching. So it's the results that are pretty amazing. We talked about the fact that the -- this is based on some new surface chemistries that are enabled in our tool -- and there's a whole combination of hardware issue -- hardware configuration and capabilities in our tool that I think allow us to achieve that result. And I can't go into all of those details today, but it is I did allude to one of them, which is on our Vantex system. The chamber design allows us to deliver a significantly higher ion energy than what is available from any other system available in the semiconductor industry. And that does play some role in etching these very, very deep near -- holes with near perfect verticality. So that's about all I can say today. . Toshiya Hari : Thank you. Appreciate that. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask you, I mean, there's been a number of press concerns about export controls with talking about the foreign direct product rule which doesn't seem like it would affect you, but also talking about entity list. And I'm just wondering, obviously, we don't know what would happen with any of that. But are you seeing any different behavior from your China customers? Are you seeing them push things in or pull things -- push things out because of any of those anxieties. Timothy Archer : Yes. Joe, I think that obviously, we don't know exactly what's going to happen either just as you said, and so we can't really speculate on that. I have mentioned in the last couple of calls that there are ongoing discussions all the time with the U.S. government and regulatory agencies were part of those discussions and will continue to be. I think in terms of change in behavior by any of our customers, I don't think it's something that's noticeable nor it would be something that we would be able to easily react to. We've talked about how we deal with some of these new customers that emerge with down payments and other things to make sure that we understand the -- those customers as viable customers. But beyond that, we service them like others at this point as long as we can ship to them, I would say, lead times and responsiveness from our perspective is same as we treat any customers of those size. Joseph Moore : Very helpful. Thank you. Timothy Archer : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : Hey. Thanks for let me ask question. I actually -- I know you got a couple on this, Doug, on the China business. I'm just kind of curious, you -- I think you qualified as a solid year next year, and I just didn't know what that meant. So I know you've been hesitant to kind of call China, I think you called it like flat, plus or minus, maybe up or down last time. Do you feel better about it, I guess, outside of this June that's the other kind of part of the question. Just if you can qualify a little bit. I mean, you should have some idea of what you're going to [indiscernible]. So was June kind of a cleanup and it might be a little bit lumpy and/or is China actually trending a bit better for you? Douglas Bettinger : I don't know, Blayne, that I'm trying to communicate anything any different than we said on the last call, to be honest with you. We described this year as somewhat first half weighted, really no change to that. The June quarter was maybe a little tiny bit stronger in China, but only a little tiny bit. It's too soon for me to -- for us to quantify 2025. But what I would tell you is, I expect next year to be a solid year in terms of spending in China. I'm not going to give you a number yet, because I'm not completely sure. But what I wouldn't want anybody to think is, it's going away because it's not. Blayne Curtis : Got you. And then I'm just kind of curious, the broad strokes was growth for next year. I know you don't want to give a forecast. But in terms of the moving pieces there, I mean, it's pretty clear leading etch is strong, DRAM spend is strong. I'm just kind of curious as you look into that forecast, if you're willing to venture kind of a view on the NAND business. Douglas Bettinger : Yes. I think NAND spending next year has to be greater than it is this year, right? We're off two years of quite low spending in NAND. I don't know at what magnitude. I expect next year -- we expect next year, you're going to see a lot of upgrades in NAND. But too soon for us to give you a number, but I would be shocked if it's not stronger than it is this year, it has to be. Blayne Curtis : Thanks, Doug. Douglas Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Blayne. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joseph Quatrochi : Yes. Thank for taking the questions. I wanted to try on the NAND side again. If we just think about your prior peak NAND revenue ex customers that are obviously now restricted, can capacity upgrade to just higher layer counts support your return to those levels, just given your higher share of higher etch and depth intensity for the transitions? Douglas Bettinger : Joe, if it\u2019s just an upgrade year, spending will be lower than when capacity gets added, obviously, our share of wallet will be greater. The fact that we lost a pretty large NAND customer in the China region, hard to replace that. I'm not ready to tell you what kind of next year is relative to previous peaks. But I know next year is going to be a stronger year in NAND than it is this year for sure. Timothy Archer : Yes. And Joe, I think that obviously, we're talking next year, it's very specific to the demand environment and the upgrade business in 2025. Longer term, I mean, we've laid out, in our view, is that NAND spending rises. And so it's just a matter of the time frame you're looking at. And from the standpoint of Lam's business, the etch and depth components and the complexity of tear stacking the precision that's required for implementation of QLC and PLC technologies, all of these skewed towards Lam's technical strengths and also SAM expansion opportunities. I talked about the PECVD pure carbon gap fill process, which is a new addition to the portfolio for NAND scaling technology going forward. And so, if I go back and I look at where we were in the portfolio, we had to sell, when people used to think of NAND is a very, very strong business for Lam, we've expanded that portfolio quite substantially with the gap fill, the backside stress management, the ALD oxide gap fill process plus the etch and stack debt that we've always had as well as metallization. So it's one of growth in NAND demand, but also growth in Lam's portfolio and served market as well opportunities ahead. So I think that bodes well for us once the NAND business itself starts to recover. Joseph Quatrochi : That's helpful color. And just as a quick follow-up. You talked about global mature node spending being roughly flat this year. Can you just help us understand just kind of how does that break down? I mean, I think clearly, the non-China piece is pretty weak. But just any kind of color there you could help us parse that out. Douglas Bettinger : Yes, you answered your own question, Joe. China is decent right now. Outside of China, it's pretty soft. And I think you understand what's going on, There's inventory that's built up for these inventories still need to come down in the mature node, analog, industrial automotive space and investment won't meaningfully occur until that gets adjusted. So that's kind of what's going on. You sort of answered your own question. Joseph Quatrochi : Fair enough. Thanks. Douglas Bettinger : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Next question is a follow-up question from Krish Sankar. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Hi. Thanks for taking my follow up. Doug, I just had a quick follow-up. It's a question on inventory. You spoke about bringing on inventory turns down. I was just kind of curious like how to think about inventory next year, especially you're planning for a strong WFE year in 2025? Or do you think most of this inventory would be in a bin, how to think about inventory next year? Thank you. Douglas Bettinger : Yes. Listen, if you think back to when business declined for us last year, a big part of what fell off pretty rapidly was our NAND business. And so a lot of the inventory that we still have sitting on the balance sheet will support NAND. So when -- assuming NAND is stronger next year, and it will be, we will consume that NAND inventory that's been sitting on the balance sheet for a while. What will offset that to a certain extent is growth elsewhere, where we'll need to procure new inventory. So I'm not ready to give you an inventory forecast quite yet, but we're continuing to work as we go through the remainder of this year to kind of bring it down and then what we do with next year will depend largely on the timing of business, the mix of business, the geographic distribution of business, but we'd like to get turns back to where they historically have been and they're not there yet. So that's how you should be thinking about it, Krish. Krish Sankar : Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks, Doug. Douglas Bettinger : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from Melissa Weathers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Melissa Weathers : Hi, there. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on the leading etch and specifically gate all around nodes. I don't think I heard an update to your $1 billion gate all around revenues in 2024 target. So is that still the case? And then as we think about those nodes ramping through next year, like what's the trajectory of that ramp that we should be thinking about as you move from pilot lines into high-volume manufacturing? Timothy Archer : Yes. Thanks, Melissa. I mean we always make choices about what we do and don't include it in the prepared remarks and gate all around fell out this time, just no intended message. In fact, if I look at what happened in the quarter, Lam, again, as we've talked on previous calls, is really positioned quite nicely with our forward-looking etch and depth portfolios. We really targeted those kind of markets with new tools in selected etch, which is a market we hadn't been in before. And in fact, in the quarter, we had additional selected etch wins for gate all around at multiple customers. We targeted investment in ALD films that are specifically needed for things like spacers and gate all around, and we had additional wins in the quarter for those films. Often with gate all around, we think of those -- they are obviously different technologies, but kind of occurring at the same node, the backside power delivery. That's an area that is really right in our sweet spot in terms of deposition and etch. And in the quarter, we had wins in backside power in ALD oxide. And so I would say net-net, I mean, given those wins and what you're hearing from the end markets about the need for high-power computing demand for AI, I think the $1 billion forecast we gave you, certainly, as we move through next year would be going higher. And so, again, that's a combination of rising demand, but also a product portfolio that's both expanding and one in which we're winning share. And so, there was no message about leaving it off, but thank you for asking the question so we could get that in right at the end. Melissa Weathers : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all my questions there. Douglas Bettinger : Awesome, operator, I think that concludes our call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at a variety of conferences and interactions as we go through the remainder of the quarter. Appreciate it. Timothy Archer : Thank you. Operator : Conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Lam posted a strong September quarter with revenues and earnings per share higher than the midpoint and profitability above the high-end of the guided ranges. These results mark the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth for the company. When combined with our solid outlook for the December quarter, Lam's performance points to strong execution in an industry environment where NAND spending has yet to recover. Our view on calendar year 2024 WFE remains mostly unchanged. Spending is expected to be in the mid-$90 billion range. We continue to see AI driving strong investments in leading-edge logic nodes, as well as advanced packaging segments, including high-bandwidth memory or HBM. We expect domestic China WFE will be down in the second-half relative to the first-half with China's share of Lam's overall revenue normalizing to the 30% range in the December quarter. Per our normal cadence, we will provide the full details of our 2025 WFE outlook on our January earnings call. However, at this point, our early view for next year is for WFE growth from the -- from 2024's mid-$90 billion range. More importantly, we see an outstanding opportunity for Lam to outperform overall WFE growth in 2025. This is due to the critical role that etch and deposition play as fundamental enablers of higher performance more scalable semiconductor device architectures. Lam is strongly positioned to benefit both from improvement in NAND spending and increased customer investments across multiple technology inflections. In NAND, we expect the spending recovery to be driven primarily by technology upgrades, which is a highly favorable dynamic for Lam, given our industry-leading position in critical NAND processes. In foundry/logic, and DRAM, we are set to benefit from growing investment in gate-all-around, backside power distribution, advanced packaging, and dry EUV resist processing. Each of these advancements is more etch and deposition intensive and we have talked about our progress in these areas over the past several quarters. We expect to see increasing adoption across all four inflections in 2025. First on NAND, this segment has seen a prolonged cyclical downturn, but technology conversions to more advanced nodes will be critical to meeting the increased demand for high-speed, high-capacity enterprise SSDs, as well as satisfying the need for low-cost, high-capacity storage in client devices. Currently, over two-thirds of bits are still manufactured using older sub-200 layer technologies. We believe customers will continue converting this capacity to more advanced nodes in 2025. With the industry's largest installed base of 3D NAND equipment, Lam should benefit disproportionately as these upgrades occur. Furthermore, NAND manufacturers must also address the growing challenge of word line resistance. This sets up an important materials migration from tungsten to molybdenum, or moly, which offers superior thin-film resistivity, simplifies the process of minimizing leakage, and yields the lowest resistance. Lam has more than a decade of learning embedded in our metal atomic layer deposition, or ALD applications, with customer engagements on moly across NAND, DRAM, and foundry/logic. We have production wins for the moly transition in NAND that will scale in 2025 with foundry/logic and DRAM ramps to follow. Outside of NAND, we continue to build momentum in gate-all-around nodes with our selective etch tools, including recent wins and a large foundry/logic customer. In advanced EUV patterning, our latest conductor etch tool with DirectDrive technology is gaining ground, with broader adoption across key customers. In the evolution to backside power distribution in foundry/logic, we see expansion of our served market and share in dielectric etch and copper plating in 2025 due to the introduction of additional VF formation steps and new metal layers. Advanced packaging has been a highlight this year, driven by the performance needs of advanced AI devices. Lam established early technological leadership in deposition for advanced packaging. Our unmatched experience in copper plating hardware design and process technology is enabling SABRE 3D to deliver best-in-class coplanarity, uniformity, and defectivity at high throughput. This has translated into significant market share gains in 2024 and strong momentum as we look ahead into 2025. Our SABRE 3D revenue has more than doubled this year as both the number of 2.5D and 3D packages and the metal layer count per package has grown. As the complexity of advanced packaging continues to increase over time, more stringent performance requirements should play to Lam's strengths. Finally, in our customer support business group or CSBG, we are seeing strong customer pull for productivity enhancement, extendibility, and reuse of Lam's installed base of tools. In both DRAM and NAND, there is intense focus on lowering bit cost through efficient reuse of the installed base. This has led to recent market share wins where upgrades of existing Lam installed base systems provided better value than the new build alternatives offered by competitors. Similarly, our customers' focus on installed base productivity is driving greater adoption of Lam's equipment intelligence services with an additional 500 process chambers subscribed in the past quarter. So to wrap up, as we look at the changes ahead for every leading etch device and every advanced package, we see more and more opportunity for Lam. The AI era is here. We have transformed our business and expanded our product portfolio to prepare for this next generation of semiconductor industry growth. Our investments are in the early stages of paying off. I'm looking forward to sharing more about why we believe the best is yet to come for Lam at our Investor Day on February 19 in New York City. Now, here's Doug. Doug Bettinger : Excellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a busy earnings season. Before I start, I want to remind everyone that on May 21, 2024, we announced a 10-for-one stock split, which was effective October 2 of 2024. All references made to share or per-share amounts in my remarks have been adjusted to now reflect the stock split. We delivered strong results in the September 2024 quarter. Our revenue and earnings per share came in above the midpoint of our guided range, while both gross margin and operating income percentage exceeded our guidance range. I'm pleased with the company's continued strong revenue and profitability execution, as well as our solid generation of free cash flows for the quarter, which came in at $1.46 billion or 35% of revenue. Let's look at the details of our September quarter financial results. Revenue for the September quarter was $4.17 billion, which was an increase of 8% from the prior quarter. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of the quarter was $2.05 billion, an increase of $495 million from the June quarter. This grew mainly due to customer advanced payments. I believe our deferred revenue balance will trend lower into calendar year 2025, but you will likely continue to see fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. From a segment perspective, September quarter systems revenue in memory was 35%, roughly in line with the prior quarter level of 36%. Within the memory segment, though, DRAM increased, coming in at 24% of systems revenue versus 19% in the June quarter. DRAM spending was focused on technology upgrades to 1-alpha, 1-beta, and some initial ramp of 1-gamma nodes to enable DDR5 and high bandwidth memory. The non-volatile memory segment represented 11% of our systems revenue, which was down from 17% in the prior quarter. This decline is driven by the timing of one customer's sequentially lower investment in specialty DRAM that we characterized as a non-volatile investment, because it has a non-volatile component in the device. The NAND segment has experienced a prolonged down cycle compared to historical norms. However, we anticipate that spending will increase in calendar 2025 as utilization rates improve to more normal levels and our customers begin to invest in conversions to 256- and 384-layer class devices. The foundry segment represented 41% of systems revenue, a slight decrease from the percentage concentration in the June quarter of 43%. In dollar terms, spending was relatively unchanged quarter-to-quarter. The logic and other segment was 24% of our systems revenue in the September quarter, up from the prior quarter level of 21%. The increase was driven by an uptick in both leading edge and specialty node logic devices. Now, I'll discuss the regional contribution of our total revenue. The China region accounted for 37%, down slightly from 39% in the prior quarter, and a little bit stronger than we expected. Most of our China revenue continued to come from domestic Chinese customers. And as Tim mentioned, we expect spending from this region will decline in the December quarter, I think perhaps to approximately 30% of December's revenue. Our next largest geographic concentration was Korea at 18% of revenue in the September quarter, which was flat with the June quarter. And finally, Taiwan and the United States rounded up the remainder of the Top four regions. Our customer support business group generated approximately $1.8 billion in revenue for the September quarter, up 4% from the June quarter and 25% higher than the same period in 2023. The sequential dollar growth was split evenly between Reliant Systems and all other components of CSBG. The spare parts component of CSBG continues to be the individual largest piece of this business unit's revenue. Let's turn to gross margin. The September quarter came in at 48.2%, which exceeded our guided range. Gross margin decreased a little sequentially, however, reflecting a decline in customer mix, as well as an increase in incentive compensation. These factors were partially offset by improved factory utilization as we continue to make progress on our operational initiatives. Operating expenses for September were $722 million, up from the prior quarter amount of $689 million. The increase was partly due to growth in program spending, as well as higher incentive compensation tied to the company's increased profitability outlook. R&D accounted for 67% of the total spending. Operating margin for the current quarter was 30.9%, slightly above the June quarter level of 30.7% and above the high end of our guidance range, primarily because of the higher revenue and continued strong gross margin performance. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 13.8%, generally within range of our expectations. Our estimate is for the tax rate to continue to be in the low- to mid-teens range in the near-term. Other income and expense for the September quarter came in at $13 million in income, compared with $19 million in income in the June quarter. The decrease in OI&E was primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations. OI&E will continue to be susceptible to market-related variations that could cause some level of volatility quarter-to-quarter. Let me pivot to the capital return side of things. We allocated approximately $1 billion to open market share repurchases and we paid $261 million in dividends in the September quarter. I just highlight that, in August, we announced a 15% growth in the dividend, in line with our plan to deliver an annual growth in the dividend. And I just mentioned, since paying our first dividend in 2014, we have now raised the dividend in 10 consecutive years. We have $9.8 billion remaining on our Board authorized share repurchase plan. And we continue to track towards our long-term capital return plans of returning 75% to 100% of our free cash flow. For the September quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.86, above the midpoint of our guided range. The diluted share count was approximately 1.3 billion shares, which was a reduction from the June quarter. On the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.1 billion at the end of the September quarter, up from $5.9 billion at the end of the June quarter. The increase was largely due to cash from operating activities, offset by cash allocated to share buyback, dividend payments, and capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding was 64-days in the September quarter, an increase from 59-days that we saw in the June quarter. Inventory at the end of the September quarter totaled $4.2 billion. Inventory turns improved to 2.1 times from the prior quarter level of 1.9 times. We will continue to manage inventory levels to the best of our ability to align with customer demand. Our non-cash expenses for the September quarter included approximately $80 million for equity compensation, $80 million in depreciation, and $14 million in amortization. Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $111 million, up $10 million from the June quarter. Capital spending was mainly centered on lab investments in the United States and Asia, as well as manufacturing facilitization supporting our global strategy to be close to both customers' development, as well as manufacturing locations. We ended the September quarter with approximately 17,700 regular full-time employees, which was an increase of approximately 500 people from the prior quarter. Headcount growth was predominantly in field and factory personnel to support increased tool installation, as well as growing manufacturing activity levels. Let's now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the December 2024 quarter. We're expecting revenue of $4.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Gross margin of 47%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. The gross margin guidance is reflective of a quarter-to-quarter headwind in customer mix. Operating margins of 30%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This reflects our continued commitment to managing our expense level as we prioritize critical R&D investment areas. And finally, earnings per share of $0.87, plus or minus $0.10, based on a share count of approximately 1.29 billion shares. So let me wrap up. We continue to execute well in 2024. I believe that's reflected in our September results, as well as guidance for the December quarter. We're on track to achieve modest improvement in our operating leverage for the full calendar year as we prioritize critical investments to extend our technology differentiation, while carefully managing overall spending levels. The investments we're making position Lam well to benefit from the architectural and materials inflections we see ahead. We believe that we will continue to gain traction and outperform the overall growth in WFE in calendar year 2025. We continue to see 2025 as a growth year in both WFE, and more importantly, Lam's top line. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open up the call for questions. Operator : Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Tim Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Tim and Doug, I know that you don't want to project 2025 WFE and I'm not asking you to give us a number, but can you just talk about the puts and takes? I guess, particularly around China. I mean, obviously, there's going to be some additions to the entity list, but it seems like even a bigger factor might be the consolidation of some of this legacy node stuff. It seems like there's a huge consolidation of a lot of these fabs that have been built that are ultimately connected to either Huawei or BYD. So can you just talk sort of conceptually about the puts and takes and particularly about China? I mean, it's down about 10 points of your revenue. Thanks. Tim Archer : Sure. Thanks, Tim, and thanks for not pressing us on an early 2025 guide. We are trying to -- we are -- we realize there's a lot of questions, and we are trying to give some additional color where we can. We said that we believe year-on-year WFE overall would be up next year. Specifically, our view for China WFE next year would be that it is lower. For all -- you can pick all the variety of reasons that you may have just listed and that as a percent of Lam's total revenue, China would represent a lower percentage next year than this year. And so I think that's about all we can say right now. Obviously, in January, we'll give a lot more color on the full market. Doug Bettinger : I'd just add a little bit. Tim, outside of China, they'll think about everything else going on leading-edge foundry and logic continues to be quite good. DRAM continues to be pretty robust with DDR5 high-bandwidth memory. What the trailing edge specialty node stuff does outside of China, I think we'll, as an industry, work our way through the inventory positions we're in. So trends are actually pretty good. in most of the industries. I'd just remind you of that, and I know you know that. Tim Archer : Yes. And I think, Tim, that's -- maybe I think gets lost when we talk about percentages is we talked about a tremendous number of technology inflections and investments during my prepared remarks, none of which would actually be occurring in China as a result of the either restrictions already in place or the technology nodes that they're at or the fact that -- I mean, again, NAND, for instance, for us, those upgrades would be generally occurring outside of domestic China. Nodes like gate all around, obviously, are outside of domestic China. And so when you think about percentages, the stronger those trends are for Lam and for the industry, then naturally, that's why we see China continuing to trend lower as a percent of our total revenue. Tim Arcuri : Right, thanks. And then just like super quick, Doug, for you. So CSBG was up. It was better deferred being up a lot. Is that like Reliant related? Doug Bettinger : Yes, a little bit. What you heard me say is the growth in CSBG was a combination of growth in Reliant and then everything else. So Reliant was pretty strong again last quarter. So yes, Tim, that's part of it. Tim Arcuri : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Tim. Operator : And our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Last call, you guys talked about NAND utilizations moving higher, driving growth in spares. Did you see that trend continue into the September quarter. And you've talked about confidence on NAND WFE growth outlook for next year. Is the confidence level as strong on WFE spending growth outlook relative to let's say, 90-days ago? And are you starting to get some order and forecast visibility to support that? Tim Archer : Yes, Harlan. I think that what I'd like to point out on NAND is it's a combination of things. We continue to see utilization being strong for the capacity that's in place. But what I was talking about in my prepared remarks was this need for what we would consider to be higher quality bits, higher performance to meet the needs of enterprise SSDs and other applications are now tied to sort of this move in AI, and so when we think about it, this is going to drive -- even if you're not looking as an industry to add a lot more bit capacity itself, you're going to want to shift that two-third that is manufactured still in the 1xx-layer technologies you're going to shift that to nodes that are taking advantage of things like sell under array or be able to do QLC, the moly transition we talked about, all of those things allow and manufacturer to be a lot more competitive for the parts of the market that are seeing a lot of strength. And so the reason that is so important for Lam is we play a really critical role and we capture a very high percentage of all of those upgrades. And so our anticipation is that the industry will be still in a recovery mode next year. But if most of the spending is directed towards technology upgrades and it's pulling in all of those things I just talked about, that's right where Lam's product portfolio plays. It's really our fleet spot. And so that's why we're optimistic on NAND almost regardless of whether WFE itself like rises a tremendous amount. It's really spending will be in our favor. Harlan Sur : Yes. I appreciate that. And then AI and accelerated compute dynamics continuing very strong, right? Obviously, that's pulling the need for more HBM memory, as you mentioned last call, you talked about driving more than $1 billion in HBM revenues this year. Is that number even higher now? And I'm wondering if you can maybe quantify the HBM outlook for this year. As we look into next year, although HBM bid supply is only going to represent 6%, 7% of total bit supply it's going to account for something like 20%, 25% of total DRAM wafer capacity, right? And that in and of itself is up 60%, 70% versus this year. How are you thinking about sort of the growth trajectory of your HPM and advanced packaging business next year and even over the next several years. Tim Archer : Yes. Sure, Harlan. I think we'll -- we're not probably going to give a new milestone number, but we did talk about this $1 billion achievement in our advanced packaging business, really driven by the strength in AI. What I would say is since the last call, that part of our business has continued to strengthen even beyond what we had originally thought. I highlighted some of that in my commentary around the SABRE 3D, the copper plating. It's just a very strong part of the business right now. And I think the companies that have good exposure to it, which primarily are companies like etch and deposition companies are seeing outsized benefit right now from that trend. I don't think advanced packaging slows down any time from my view and from my conversations with customers. It's an enabling technology that's allowing system-level performance. It's very hard to achieve through chips themselves. And I mean it requires really this architectural change. So we're very positive on advanced packaging next year. And when we get to January, we'll probably highlight a little bit more about what we see in terms of new numbers for that segment. Harlan Sur : Thank you, Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Harlan. Operator : And our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Toshiya Hari : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had two as well. First, Tim, you talked about the adoption of Moly and 3D NAND, and you also mentioned leading edge foundry and logic and DRAM to follow in the out years. I was hoping you could help us sort of translate some of that, maybe not the specific numbers, but how we should be thinking about your ability to grow the business with Molly in '25 and beyond. Is it a net gain opportunity for you? Or because you're already quite strong in that space, is there an offset to the introduction of moly? Tim Archer : Yes, it is an area where we're quite strong already in the Tungsten, as you point out, especially in NAND, but it still turns out to be a net gain for us as again, there is a certain benefit that comes from upgrades and moving technology forward, and there's additional benefit if you're basically selling in new high value-add technologies for our customers. And so again, the fact that it helps resolve some of the word line resistance issues that exist and really is a major materials migration that then can sort of carry the industry forward for several nodes after that. It's a kind of step up for us in terms of business through that transition. And then as we see those same transitions occur in foundry logic and DRAM, I think it represents a gain opportunity for us there as well out into future years. Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then my follow-up is on leading-edge foundry logic. I both -- I think both you and Doug characterize that area as an area of strength. A peer of yours last week, they kind of lowered their '25 outlook based on some of the competitive dynamics going on in that space. I think there's one customer that's doing really well, maybe two others that are doing not so well. is the net-net in your view as it pertains to the '25 outlook, is that unchanged relative to 90 days ago? Or have you seen any kind of shifts in the outlook when you think about overall leading-edge foundry and logic? Tim Archer : Well, I don't think it's really changed from our perspective in the last 90 days, but that's because generally, if I think about what's driving our business, it's a little less has to do with volume as much as technology inflections. And so as you move forward from a node that wasn't gate all around to one that's gate all around, that creates opportunities for Lam that some companies that might actually be somewhat of a similar opportunity. But for Lam because we can now penetrate new tools like selective etch and ALD at rates that we had not been able to previously, we think that, that may be why it hasn't changed as much for us. We see it as a positive opportunity. We also see -- again, we have put an exact timing on it, but we have said we believe in 2025, you start to see the introduction of what we would consider to be quite etch and depth intensive inflections like the backside power distribution and further advanced packaging use in leading-edge logic foundry. And so those are things that I think primarily benefited companies with portfolios that look like Lam that shouldn't that position strong. And so I don't know, I can't speak to everybody's outlook, but I know that the way we look at these technology transitions, they're quite favorable for our portfolio setup. Toshiya Hari : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Tim Archer : Thanks, Toshiya. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Vivek Arya : Thanks for my question. For the first one, going back to China. So it's indicated down about, I think, $250 million or so in calendar Q4. Does China stay at these levels for the next several quarters? Can it build off of it? Does it decline? What is sort of the broad assumption. And I think, Tim, in the last earnings call, you had suggested '25 could be a decent year for China, but that view seems to have changed somewhat. And I'm curious what changed, what markets, what are the signals? So just kind of China versus December levels and then what has changed in the overall China view for '25? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Vivek, maybe I'll take it. This is Doug. Yes, China is trending down a little bit right now, but let me be very, very clear. It's not going away. It's just trending lower as a percent of our overall revenue. That's partly due to the fact that, yes, we -- as we sit here today, we look at China WP is lower next year. But other things are strengthening at the same time. So when you look at the percent of the total revenue, it's trending a little bit lower. But let me be very clear. It's not going away. Tim Archer : Yes, I think that was -- if I made the comment about China being a decent year next year, it's basically, I think it's the comment Doug just made, which is we always have expected it to normalize as Lam's business in our strongest markets like NAND. And now some of these new emerging areas like advanced packaging really come on even more strongly in 2025. And so we've always expected, as a percentage of our total revenues, it would trend down. And so I don't know if the outlook has changed dramatically in the last few months. Vivek Arya : Okay. And then for my follow-up, maybe one on gross margins. So I think Q3, you beat quite nicely up -- so what drove that? And I think for calendar Q4, it's coming to 47%. So as we look out, Doug, over the next several quarters, given that China mix will be lower. Should we assume that 47% is the baseline and then you get some leverage on top of it? Or just how should we conceptually think about calendar \u201825 gross margin versus calendar \u201824. Is there a scenario where you can keep gross margins flattish year-on-year calendar year. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Vivek, thanks for the question. Yes, listen, there's many, many things that can move gross margin around in the near term here, customer mix, product mix, operational efficiencies and so forth. We've been trying to signal for a while that, hey, this customer mix stuff is going to be a little bit of a headwind as China percent of total begins to soften a little bit. And you're seeing that in the December guide. However, if you remember back when business turned down at the end of '22 into '23, we embarked on what we described as operational efficiency initiatives, trying to pivot the company, grow that footprint in the factories in the Asia region, which as business grows, will benefit from those operational efficiencies. So you're beginning to see some of or maybe more than some, you're beginning to see that show up. If you remember before China ticked up as a percent of our revenue, we were at, I don't know, roughly 46%, and now you kind of see it at 47%. So we've pivoted the company actually in a beneficial way from a cost standpoint, and you'll still see more of that as we go forward. But there's a lot of things that move gross margin around. I'm not going to get into guiding it specifically. But that's some of the steps you should be thinking about. Vivek Arya : Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Vivek. Operator : And our next question today comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess for the first question, I was hoping to focus on CSBG and Reliant. As you think about a world where China is slowing down, -- is that a piece that we should be thinking about at least as part of CSBG that would decline? And just for my education, as you think about slower China, is that better or worse in terms of CSBG revenue intensity for you guys? Doug Bettinger : Yes, C.J. I mean, from a Reliance standpoint, when you think about investment in the specialty nodes or maybe the trailing edge nodes, that's where Reliant will ebb and flow. And obviously, you know where the restrictions sit in the China region and so mainly, that's what you've got going on in China. But there's other components of it as well, right, outside of China, there's a decent profile of investment there. But yes, as WFE perhaps reduces a little bit in China, that will be a bit of a headwind for the Reliant business unit. The other components of it, though, spare service upgrades will have a lot to do with what's going on globally in the overall capacity of every process node. Tim Archer : Yes. And I think, C.J., I would just add. I mean, I mentioned a couple of these -- a couple of things around the equipment intelligence and previous calls. We've talked about our cobot activity I think that as leading-edge devices continue to grow and also become more complex, the need for these types of data-driven troubleshooting and tool matching capabilities and even sort of automated maintenance will become a bigger part of our CSBG revenue stream as well. And so we look to that as an area where we can continue to keep moving forward. C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And then I guess maybe on OpEx. You started the year, Doug, talking about the need to invest for projects that have real line of sight for growth. And OpEx will narrowly outgrow top line this year. Curious, are you at the stage where you are funding what you need to fund? And how should we think about operating leverage into calendar '25? Doug Bettinger : Yes, C.J., thanks for the question. Yes, we funded pretty much everything, but as we came into the year, we expected that we needed to fund, in fact, maybe even a little bit more, right? Revenue turned out to be probably a little bit stronger. And in fact, remember, as we began the year, I was suggesting, we were suggesting that you wouldn't see leverage from us this year. And in fact, you actually have we've delivered over a full percentage point of operating margin leverage at the midpoint of the December guide. So I think we all feel pretty good. Tim, and I feel pretty good about what we've been able to do. As we get into next year, depending on how WP grows, how our top line grows, I hope we'll be able to continue to deliver some leverage into next year as well. C.J. Muse: Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, C.J. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First one, Tim, I understand, thanks for the early view on calendar '25 WFP, and you said that Lam revenue should outgrow or continue to outgrow WFE. Historically, outperformance happened during strong NAND years, and you do expect NAND WFE to grow. But I'm just wondering, is NAND still going to be the driver, especially with all this noise around Cryo-edge, maybe to 2026 even not 2025. I'm just trying to figure out what are the drivers for outperformance for Lam in calendar '25. And then I have a follow-up. Tim Archer : Yes. Well, I think you probably did see the announcement from Lam in our Cryo 3.0 technology not too long ago. And so I think that some of that noise is what Lam is creating around the benefits of new technology upgrades to our own systems. And so I think the most important thing to think about with NAND is that the most efficient way to go from a certain layer count to a higher layer count and get the benefits of those new technologies is to upgrade the installed base you already have in your fab. And so that's why we're talking about this high capture rate Lam has around NAND upgrades and how that's beneficial both for us and for our customers. And so I think 2025, whatever the WFE spend is in NAND, it will be dominated by those technology upgrades and Lam is by far in the best position to deliver both the technology and the economic value to our customers. So that's kind of the way I see the NAND market playing out next year. And it's a little too early for us to say exactly what the spending will be. But again, the requirements for those higher quality bids, I think, are being discussed and talked about in light of these new AI applications pretty publicly. Doug Bettinger : I think Krish, it's everything else that we've been -- we've also been talking about for a while, right, advanced packaging, backside power, gate-all-around, dry photo resist, right? Tim talks about this every time in his script because we're going to outperform in those areas, too. So when you layer these two things together, that is where our confidence comes from. Tim Archer : Yes. I think the -- I mentioned in the script, the -- this comment, which I assume people are picking up on, but it's the etch and depth intensity of the technology inflections that are coming. I think the technology landscape is changing somewhat, and it's beneficial to companies that are well positioned to help in the building of these three-dimensional architectures that exist, whether it's backside power distribution, which is effectively a three-dimension architecture on the backside of the wafer or the advanced packaging, 2.5D and 3D packages, those get built by etch and deposition equipment. And so as those parts of the market are kind of the outperformers, because of what they do for power consumption and high power, high computation devices, what they're doing in terms of enabling these multichip packages. I would expect etching depth to continue -- would actually outperform WFE with those as the underlying technology trends. Krish Sankar : Got it, got it. Very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up for Doug. The inventory level has been pretty -- like you've been managing it really well. You're talking about an up cycle next year. Historically, you kind of start building inventory maybe a quarter or two before. Kind of curious, is it more unclear of the shape of the recovery next year? Or is it more the inventory management has gotten -- has changed and is much more efficient than it's kind of more like just in time. Doug Bettinger : Yes. I mean, you got to actually peel the onion back on inventory one level beneath just what's the total number to understand this. So a lot of the inventory, when you think back to when business turned down, a lot of it was in memory and specifically in NAND. And so a lot of the inventory we have, just to build tools that go into the NAND segment. And so you'll only really be able to move that inventory lower when NAND business ticks up, which obviously we think that will happen this year. So that's a little bit of a -- you've got to wait for that. Offsetting that, though, other things are strengthening. Obviously, you saw the guide at 4.3. And so you have to have components ready to build tools that go into those segments. So those are the two things that you have to think about relative to the total balance. Krish Sankar : Thanks, Doug. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Krish. Operator : And our next question today comes from Srinivas Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Srinivas Pajjuri : Thank you. A couple of follow-ups at this point. Tim, on your comment about WFE growing next year, I'm just curious, either by market segment or by product segment, where would you say you have the best visibility? And where do you think there is still some uncertainty out there? Tim Archer : Okay. Well, we'd start getting very close to giving a full 2025 outlook, if I go through all that detail. But I think that, obviously, some of our comments. One is we believe NAND has been in a very prolonged down cycle. And so it's not too much of a stretch to say that we would see NAND WFE higher. We're not going to quantify that. But again, higher and driven by these technology upgrades that I just talked a lot about. I think that we said that leading edge for logic, we continue to see quite strong. And with many of those investments targeted towards new technology pull-ins that help with performance and power consumption. And then finally, we think advance package. I think it's not a stretch to say that we believe advanced packaging I made the comment, it's gotten stronger in just the last 90-days, and so I don't see what would prevent that from continuing to trend higher as we move through 2025. And then we said China WFE lower. And so you're kind of like there's a third puts and takes. But in general, a lot of the things that are key to us, we think fed higher. Srinivas Pajjuri : Great. That's helpful. And then another follow-up, Tim. I guess -- on the tech transitions that you talked about, there are a lot of questions on NAND, et cetera, but I look at your product -- I mean, your revenue mix, logic and foundry is like 60% of your mix today quite different from what it used to be. So you talked about things like backside Power GA, et cetera, increasing the intensity for you. I'm just curious, outside of just the deposition and etch intensity going up. How do you think about your market share? Because we hear about these tech transitions from some of your competitors as well. It looks like a lot of you are benefiting, but I'm just curious as to how you think about your market share? What is the implied market share assumption when you say you're going to outperform WFE next year? Tim Archer : Well, I think that in some of these areas, I talked about specifically when you think about what foundry logic, leading-edge foundry logic is really doing is -- it is pulling in nodes like gate-all-around. For us, that allows us to gain -- expand SAM and gain share in markets where we didn't previously compete. So every selective etch win for us is basically new market. ALD is expanding in new share market for us. So we do have opportunities where, again, we've -- I talked about transforming our product portfolio, and we've expanded the product portfolio to address those markets. And so -- for us, many of those are not only they're new wins and their share gain. And for those who've already been participating in those markets at prior nodes and prior technologies, you'd probably see a lot more replacement revenue versus actual share gain. So I think that is one thing that distinguishes Lam, we're coming from a historically lower exposure to that particular segment. Advanced Packaging, again, very strong product portfolio for that. Backside power, I think everybody knows we're extremely strong in terms of our positioning in copper plating. There's a lot more uses, you add more metal layers on to the backside of the wafer represents share gain of overall WFE when you see cases coming like that. So I think you're right to say that a lot of people are going to benefit from continued technology advancements and general equipment intensity increases overall. But we do think that then net position increases faster than many of the other segments, and therefore, land has an opportunity to gain share. Srinivas Pajjuri : Very clear. Thanks, Tim. Tim Archer : Thanks, Pajjuri. Operator : And our next question today comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to drill again a bit more into the China gross margin trade-off. So clearly, if WFE is growing and your share is going next year, but China is down, your China mix does get worse. And I know you don't want to guide gross margins, but do you think that the other drivers you have on gross margins can be enough to offset the negative mix from trend like mix went down to 25% of your revenue next year. Like, is there enough around the other drivers you have to try to offset that? I'm just -- I'm wondering if I should be thinking about gross margin as the floor is the trough and then growing from there with some of the other drivers? How do we think about that? Doug Bettinger : Yes. Stacy, listen, some of the things I pointed to, you have to think through it holistically. And part of it will depend on revenue levels. And obviously, I'm not going to guide specificity into next year. But we have done a whole bunch relative to pivoting the footprint of the company to be closer to where the customers' fabs are lower cost structure, more affordable supply chain, shorter freight distances. I mean those things are going to be beneficial as we get into a growing top line, offset by some of that customer mix. I'm not going to give you specifics yet, because I'm not sure exactly what revenue is next year, but I feel pretty good about our ability to continue to drive the operational side of gross margin improvement. And then the customer mix will be one of the things we're working to overcome. But I'm not going to give you enough specificity that you want right now. But certainly, we'll do that as we get into next year on the next call. Stacy Rasgon : Okay. And at a minimum, I guess, you do see revenues up at least, so that should be a positive. Doug Bettinger : Yes, it should be, Stacy. Yes. Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Thanks. For my follow-up, I want to drill in a little of this NAND tech transition versus capacity. And I think I understand the idea that tech transitions are lower WFE, but you have a big installed base and your share is higher. From a dollar basis, what is better for you, a capacity-driven market or a technology transition market? I know you've said you're agnostic, but I don't -- I just don't see how that can be true. So like what am I missing? Tim Archer : Well, I mean, I guess, when we talk about outperformance of WFE, then there's no doubt that tech transition market is better for us. I think that there's been a lot of questions. I think what we've been trying to address is perhaps some of the skepticism about the desire and need for the market right now to invest in significant additional capacity. And so whether that's true or not, that will be our customer's decision, but what we're saying is that regardless of within that, that's why we gave this two-thirds a bit to fill it sub-200 layers. We believe there is a need both technically and economically to move those forward to more advanced nodes. Stacy Rasgon : I'm just asking if would your NAND dollars be higher in a capacity-driven market or an upgrade driven market. That's what I'm trying to understand. Doug Bettinger : It depends on the overall level of investment, Stacy, it's not a straightforward question. We did a decently higher share of spend when it's a transition or an upgrade year. but the industry obviously spends less. But our relative outperformance in a situation like that, which is largely what we see next year, we're going to outperform more. Then the rest of it, you have to get into the specific numbers, which obviously we're not going to do right now. Stacy Rasgon : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you guys. I appreciate it. Doug Bettinger : Thanks, Stacey. Sure. Operator : And our next question today comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Atif Malik : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. My first question is on China WFE. It sounds like you're expecting China WFE to come down, but not as much as your peer that reported last week, they're expecting the China sales to come down 30% next year. Are the dynamics between lithography and depth edge that will help explain why lithography could be coming down faster or maybe something to do with your alliance business or star parts or anything. If you have any thoughts on that? Doug Bettinger : Atif, obviously, it's extremely hard, if not impossible, for us to compare what someone else is thinking versus what we think, because we don't know what they're thinking for sure, to be perfectly honest. I would observe, though, if you look at how much perhaps some of our peers' growth in that specific geography grew versus what we did, the numbers are very different, right? And the lead times are very different between different tool types. And so something shipped sooner than others. And so you can't make a direct comparison because, frankly, I don't know exactly what somebody else has seen. But others have grown a lot more in that region than we have, and so you have to kind of factor all this stuff in, I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything? Tim Archer : No, no. I think it's just -- it's very hard to make those comparisons for all the reasons that Doug just mentioned the especially in terms of the rate at which people have been shipping at this point and lead times and so not much more we can say. Atif Malik : Thank you. And then my follow-up, Tim, I was positively surprised to see that one of your large memory makers in Korea is adopting Dry Resist for their 1C DRAM 6 generation process. We've been under the impression that maybe drive this happens when the high NA to come out. Have there been any changes in terms of the adoption curve for Dry Resist? Tim Archer : Well, we -- I don't know how Dry Resist ever got intricately tied to high NA other than what we've said is when you get to high NA, we had believed that there likely is no other choice. But clearly, we've been working hard. There are -- to answer earlier, based on all of the benefits we've talked about with Dry EUV and dry UV processing in general, which is multiple steps. It's the underlayer, it's the resist, it's the dry develop. And in those cases, there's economic benefits from having to be able to shorten exposure. We've talked about pattern fidelity benefits. There's benefits from using the dry developer versus a wet process in terms of defectivity. And so I think that you just with each customer, you reach a point where they see enough of those benefits tipping over to where they make the change. And so it's not necessarily tied to any particular node. And so I think that I think that we'll see, over time, customers adopted different technology nodes. Atif Malik : Thank you. Tim Archer : Thanks, Atif. Operator : And our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Joe Moore : Great. Thank you guys. Sorry to ask about China again. But as you make these comments about December and next year, how are you thinking about the Commerce Department export controls? Have you had -- and I'm asking what you think the decision will be. But have you had conversations where you have some kind of general sense of what the restrictions may be? Or are you kind of guessing like the rest of us? And if you're guessing how are you making those guesses. Tim Archer : Yes. I think that the view we've given you contemplates our best understanding and our best estimate of what we think will happen. And so I don't know if you call that a guess, an educated guess. I mean, I doubt all of you guys are just guessing you have sources of information. And so I think that that's just -- that's our view. And the best we can say right now is what we've said about our -- how we see China WFE both through the next quarter as well as into next year. Joe Moore : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then as you think about December, if China drops down to 30%, you've got double-digit growth ex-China. And I mean -- first of all, am I going to literal and precise about that. And -- but if you are going to grow double digits ex-China, kind of what gives you the confidence around that. Doug Bettinger : I mean, Joe, it's the same thing we do every time we guide you with numbers. We understand what customers expect from us, what we think they're going to order what -- to the best of our ability every single region in the world is going to do every single customer, every single fab and so forth, we put it together the same every single quarter, and that's what we've just done. The only thing we've done incrementally here because there's been so much chatter about China is give you a number on China, which normally we don't do any geographic stuff. But the $4.3 million we just guided you to, we've gone through the same process we do every single quarter to put data together to support that. Joe Moore : Okay. Thank you so much Doug Bettinger : You\u2019re on. Operator : And our next question today comes from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Blayne Curtis : Thanks, for squeezing me in and I feel bad that Joe said one more on China because I had one more in China, but I just got curious, I think you come back to that to the beginning $250 million is the math that come out in December. I guess going into this, the expectation was that like the Chinese DRAM would be front-end loaded. And I guess you've seen. I think you recognize that is non-volatile, that's come down. So I'm assuming that's less of a headwind. So I guess, roundabout way of saying such CSBG be down in December, it would seem like that would be the bulk of the $250 million that comes out. Just can you dial us in a little bit as to where -- what segment that headwind is in? Doug Bettinger : Man, Blayne, I don't know if I can answer your question. Is it possible CSBG is down next quarter. Sure, it\u2019s possible. The relying component does attach to the specialty node stuff, which is obviously correlated to a certain extent with China, not only but elsewhere also. But there's other stuff going on in there that ties to upgrade cycles and utilization and so forth. I don't know if I'm helping you. I'm just kind of rambling here a little bit. Blayne Curtis : It's fine. I just want to ask you also, I think the messaging on NAND is a lot more positive. I think people have gotten incrementally more negative on timing of NAND. Just kind of curious the timing that you'll see those upgrades. Obviously, you've had this headwind from the Chinese customer. But do you expect that tailwind to be a tailwind kind of the rest of this calendar year? Or is it truly a '25 storyline? Tim Archer : No, I mean, we were speaking about that primarily from a 2025 perspective, it don't give any timing within that particular year. It's just, again, predicated on this idea that the down cycle has been quite long and the -- which has put a number of -- quite a large portion of the capacity at technology nodes that we think can be significantly improved for current uses through technology upgrades. And those are the conversations we're having with customers will give more on the timing once we have a better view of it as we move into early next year. Blayne Curtis : Got it. Thanks so much. Doug Bettinger : All right. Thanks, Blayne. Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : And our final question today will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Caso : Yes, thank you. I guess a question on DRAM. And not a little discussion on that heading into next year. What's your view on the trends you're seeing there? And again, have the -- there's been a lot of mixed signals on that. Has that changed in the last 30 days -- last 90 days for you? Doug Bettinger : No, Chris, it really hasn't changed in the last 90-days. You've got a product cycle in DRAM, DDR4, going to DDR5, you've got the high bandwidth memory that's going on there and that's pulling through a need for incremental equipment, we believe that grows again next year, I don't think too much has changed relative to our outlook in ramp. Chris Caso : Okay. Just as a follow-up and there'll be one more close it out on one more China question. With what you said about China 30% of revenue exiting the year, is it safe to say by what always hold with the expectation for some of the other segments, Foundry Logic for NAND to grow next year that most likely that China comes in, if we look for the full-year at below 30% of total revenue as we look in the whole year. Obviously, I know it depends upon what your total revenue looks like. But it feels like you're seeing growth elsewhere and probably not in China from the fourth quarterly level. Is that at least a rational way to think about it? Doug Bettinger : Yes, Chris, it's not unreasonable to be thinking about it that way. And frankly, like I said, we're not guiding 25 numerically yet. It's possible that China trends down below 30% for sure. it's too soon for us to get numerically specific on next year, but we will certainly do that on the call next quarter. Chris Caso : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Doug Bettinger : Yes. Thanks, Chris. Operator, that concludes the call here. Thanks, everybody, for joining, and I'm sure we'll be talking to most of you as the quarter progresses. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
