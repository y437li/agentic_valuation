Rice - UBS Gary Taylor - Citi John Ransom - Raymond James Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Anthony He - RBC Capital Market Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Operator : Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Filton, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Steve Filton : Thank you. Good morning. This is Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risk and uncertainties inherent in these forward looking statement I recommend the careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.38 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarters reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night\u2019s earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased 11% to $1.36 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $1.22 per diluted share during the first quarter of last year. On a same facility basis in our acute care division revenues increased 5.8% during the first quarter of 2014. The increase resulted primarily from a 6.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. The revenue increase was due in part to strengthening surgical volumes, additionally payer mix improved in the quarter with less uninsured patients and more Medicaid and commercial insurance patients. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 19.8% during the first quarter of 2014, up 16% during the first quarter of 2013. On a same facility basis revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.7% during the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.3% and adjusted patient days were relatively flat during the quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.1% during the first quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division decreased to 27.9% during the quarter ended March 31, 2014 as compared to 28.5% during the comparable prior year quarter. The decline is largely attributable to continued length of stay pressures and a reduction in the number of military patients. Our cash provided by operating activities increased 9% to approximately $195 million during the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $178 million in the first quarter of 2013. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 57 days during the first quarter of 2014 from 56 days during the comparable 2013 quarter. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 48.6% at March 31, 2014 as compared to 56.4% at March 31, 2013. We spent $92 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2014. We\u2019re pleased to answer your questions at this time. And in the interest of fairness I ask that everybody limit themselves to one question. Operator : Your first question comes from Justin Lake from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Good morning. My question is on reform obviously your great payer mix in the quarter can you give us a little more color on what you saw in terms of the benefit to reform maybe in state that expanded versus that expand commercial mix et cetera? Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure. So I think that I sided in my prepared remarks I think factors that really contributed to the strength in acute care revenues one is the increased surgical volume and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily reform related it\u2019s probably more related to the improving economy and hospitals gaining traction in that regard. As far as the payer mix goes as I suggested in my opening remarks we saw slight reduction maybe a 2% or 3% reduction in our uninsured volumes in the quarter and an increase of a comparable maybe slightly lower amount in our Medicaid admissions our Medicaid volumes and maybe a slightly larger increase in our commercial insurance volumes. We saw those trends probably more pronounced in the states that have opted into Medicaid expansion which in our case from an acute care perspective are California and Nevada and Washington DC. We saw in a state like Nevada more definitely more than impact from the Medicaid expansion the State of Nevada has been pretty open about the fact that they\u2019ve had a very robust expansion process, California which just had a more robust commercial exchange expansion process we definitely saw the impacts of that and saw more release would cover California in that location. The difficulty is it\u2019s difficult particularly on based on one quarter\u2019s worth of data to take our payer mix changes and isolate them and identify them as specifically related to reforms. So we saw improved payer mix quite frankly in states that are not participating in Medicaid expansion. We saw some payer mix changes that we believe are unrelated to payer mix; they\u2019re more related to the recruitment of new physicians or opening of new service lines or a contract in the market that has gone to a narrower network that we\u2019re benefitting from. So all those kinds of things also at play and it\u2019s difficult for us to isolate any one change. We certainly feel like there was a benefit from reform in the quarter but difficult to quantify with precision. Operator : Your next question comes from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird. Your line is open. Whit Mayo - Robert Baird :  I guess just to clarify on the 2% to 3% decline in you paid volumes. Steve are you saying that in terms -- that\u2019s in terms of a percentage of your total volumes? Are you saying that on an absolute basis yourself pay volumes declined 2% to 3%. Steve Filton : So I think it\u2019s the ladder, so our self pay volumes declined and in this case I am using patient days as a volume measure we saw a bit of a spike in our self pay length to stay in the quarter. So our mission is actually and self pay mission has actually declined a little bit more and I am not quite sure how you can really explain what would drive the increase in the length to stay in a particular quarter. But the 2% to 3% decline is a decline in our self pay patient days on an absolute basis. Whit Mayo - Robert Baird : Got it. And how do you classify your Medicaid pending? Does that fall under Medicaid or does it fall under you pay receivables? Steve Filton : Medicaid pending we categorize as Medicaid and not surprisingly given the expansion activity in the quarter we definitely saw spike in Medicaid pending and that was included in the 1% or 2% increase in Medicaid overall. So we included counts in Medicaid pending but we reserved for those or we only account for the revenue on our historical portion that we are able to successfully qualify from Medicaid. Whit Mayo - Robert Baird : Got it. And I guess to make a note around that the state processes, I guess adjudicating those plans. Have there been any issues that you think could have a potential future impact? Steve Filton : No, I think the only thing I would say is that some states I think Nevada notably I think because of the flood of new Medicaid applications have been measurably behind in processing application and processing payments. I don\u2019t think the state believes and what we believe that will ultimately impact in the long-term, anything it won\u2019t impact cash it won\u2019t impact our ability to take those patients et cetera. But I think there is some administrative backlog there. Whit Mayo - Robert Baird : Got it. And my last one just on kind of the uncompensated bad debt trends. There is some confusion of what the right readers your compensating care as a percentage of growth was down slightly, bad debt down meaningfully, the bad debt plus charity up a little. So I guess can you just spend maybe a minute flushing out some of those moving pieces and what the right read is from your perspective? Steve Filton : Sure, so as I think we always do, I think we encouraged people to look at the uncompensated care expense in total that is the cumulative total of bad debt charity care and uninsured discount. And as we disclosed in our press release as a percentage of gross revenue that is down slightly in the quarter that trend is clearly over the last several years been an upward and a fairly measureable upward trends and the fact that it is slightly down I think I Q1 is the meaningful take away in the quarter. As you suggest there is a pretty big shift between that debt and charity and our insurance for the quarter is always I think that as far less meaningful. Our hospitals are sort of frequently changing their policies to sort of fit their local needs in terms of how much of uninsured discount they give. In this particular case in the first quarter we increased our uninsured discounts at most of our hospitals and that resulted in just more dollar shifting out of bad debt and into uninsured discount but again I would suggest to people that the real meaningful movement is the total. Operator : Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : I wanted to ask about the behavioral margins, Steve you mentioned a couple of things. We continue to see the length of state pressure, so I can understand that. You mentioned a reduction in military patients; I\u2019d be curious just to get a little bit more commentary on what you think is driving the margins and if you can maybe also comment as to whether there was any weather impact at all in the behavioral business or anything else. So we ought to be thinking about from a margin standpoint as we listed the rest of the year. Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure. So I appreciate, actually you\u2019re mentioning the weather down, I should have mentioned it myself. We didn\u2019t really had any weather impact for the most part in our acute care hospitals because of our geography is we tend to be in market, other than Washington D.C. that really don\u2019t experience much severe winter weather. But behavioral geographic footprint is different, we\u2019re in the upper mid west, we\u2019re in the North East and even in places in the South and places like Atlanta we clearly experience some bad weather in the quarter, probably resulted in a couple of million dollars lower earnings in the quarter, which I think as the years goes on, we should ultimately recover from. As you suggest the length of stay issue has been, one that has -- it's been a continuing one, pretty much uninterrupted for the last few years. We\u2019ve seen so a little bit of improvement in Q4, maybe little bit of stabilization. But that, the trend seems to -- and as we discussed we have largely assumed that that trend would continue in our guidance for 2014. And then lastly, we reference as we did in our year-end call. Some amount of reduction in the business from, as the military -- and even though that\u2019s a relatively small part of our overall business probably less than 10% in all division. If we seen a immeasurable decline it is fairly profitable business, that\u2019s just a function I believe, the federal budgetary pressures obviously in the last year, we\u2019ve had sequestration, we have the government shut down, I think military basis have felt that pinch unlike other insures and other employers if you will, they\u2019ve look for a way to put their employees their soldiers in the lowest cost setting that they can. I think that means trying to keep them out of hospitals or at least trying to keep them on the base hospitals. I think that\u2019s a delicate balance these are flocks that are often, as we all know from just reading the newspaper in need of fairly significant care and I think even there are some early signs in Q2 that pendulum maybe swinging the other way. If not improving that trend at least stabilizing it, so we\u2019ll continue to track that. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay. That\u2019s great. If I could, just want to follow-up on one team with Alan. As I relates to PIW Alan, you reference GW in the release, I\u2019m just hoping you can help us think about, how are seeing that hospital setting and whether it will be fairly rated with GW and looks like there are prestigious hospital, so can you just comment on few there? Thanks. Steve Filton : We are excited about it. And it\u2019s been a very fine hospital for a number of years and they were independent. And now they selected us and we closed yesterday and they will be working closely with GW. Interestingly, the Medical Director of GW is a physiatrist, which is unusual, a very fine guy and knows the hospital well. And we are very excited about, that we\u2019re working together. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Great. Okay. Thank you. Steve Filton : Just as a quick note and to add onto that, GW has always had, has had for some time that we use in patient physiatrist unit. So obviously, adding behavioral debt into the market is complementary to a service they already had, so my plan would be to try and make sure that the hospitals are synergistic with each other in terms of a service. Operator : Your next question comes from Collin Lang from FBR. Your line is open. Collin Lang - FBR: Hi, good morning. Steve just on the future side given a very strong performance we saw this quarter. Are there any changes to your underlying assumptions or revenue in EBITDA growth as a balance of the year or is it too early to call the positive trends that we saw in Q1, two trend? Steve Filton : It\u2019s a very good question Collin, and wondered we struggled with in preparation for the release in the call. I think it\u2019s always tough to make a call on long term trend based on one quarter\u2019s results, most flocks remember 2012 in the -- first quarter 2012 we reported really kind of a banged up first quarter with very strong payer mix and you had a hard time quite frankly explaining at the time and even in with respect cut out time explaining it. And as the year went on the payer mix had moderated and we kind of return to more normalize results. Obviously the big difference in 2014 as we have the presence of the affordable care act as I mentioned earlier though however it\u2019s been difficult that sort of tease out the precise impact of that. So the bottom line to answer your question is, we\u2019re not prepared to really change any of our forecast, change in any of our trends, we\u2019re certainly not prepared to change our overall guidance for the year. But we\u2019ve been pleased with the strength of our acute care revenues in Q1. And we\u2019ll certainly continue to track and try it as fast as we can pass out what the drivers of that improvement is and we obviously we can sustain it as the year goes on. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Gurda from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Good morning. Thanks. Steve how long does it take to get a Medicaid get approval on patient on Medicaid is going to get paid for? Steve Filton : I think in the normal course Jason that\u2019s probably one or two months of us and as I said in a couple of states it\u2019s probably going to extend it for the moment. Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets : And then so you\u2019re using a sort of Medicaid conversion rate in order to estimate sort of what happened in March. Steve Filton : Correct. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ve always done. So for each hospital we track our historical experience or our historical success rate in converting Medicaid pending patients to Medicaid and that\u2019s what we use to book our contractual. So if we have a historical two thirds conversion rate then for two thirds of the patients in Medicaid pending we assume we\u2019re going to pay the Medicaid rate and for the remaining one third we assume we\u2019re not going to get paid anything. And we changed those assumptions as our actual experience changes. Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. And then lastly you have the potential for new behavioral role coming out shortly, and expectations or new expectations on that? Steve Filton : Our expectation is that there will not be any major surprises in the new behavioral rule I think it\u2019s entirely possible now that the industry is six years into the full implementation of the perspective payments system that there will be tweaks to the rule and changes in how core morbidities and that sort of thing are treated. But I think that our expectation is that our base rate will not be materially impacted by any of those changes. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Thanks. Steve just following up on sort of the Medicaid process I\u2019m curious what percentage of your sort of uninsured volumes those that show up at your hospital as uninsured. What percentage of those did you assume in the first quarter were now Medicaid eligible and how did that change relative to 2013? Steve Filton : I\u2019m not exactly sure on answering your question but I\u2019ll do my best. I think as we talked about in our year end call and as we thought about guidance that our assumptions for 2014 were that something like 7% or 8% of our uninsured volumes would be uninsured and then we made further assumptions about I think the most of those would become insured through Medicaid and others through lesser number through commercial exchanges and I think we ramp that a bit as the year went on. But I am not sure I have that the exact assumptions for Q1 or just in front of me. Josh Raskin - Barclays: So I guess what I\u2019m getting at Steve is that it sounds like your process is still conservative in the sense that you\u2019re not assuming any change in the conversion rate the number of people that you think are Medicaid eligible that actually get signed up. But I am just curious are you assuming is there a risk that you\u2019re assuming more of these people Medicaid eligible and therefore may be even that conversion rate might even go down in the future because it turns out that you were being more you were assuming that more people would be eligible for Medicaid now. Is that possible? Steve Filton : So I think that your point and I have this question from others which I think is really premised on the idea that present of eligibility is likely to change sort of the conversation rate I am not sure we\u2019re convinced with that. But if you\u2019re convinced of that that presented eligibility will mean a much greater percentage of patients who quality from Medicaid then I think you could argue that we\u2019re being conservative using our historical percentages. I do think there is a little bit of offset to that in that as where accounting for our commercial exchange patients we obviously don\u2019t have any experience yet as to this whole idea of how many of them have actually paid premiums et cetera. So if somebody presents an insurance card to us we\u2019re able to verify that insurance. There may be a payment risk there that we\u2019re not accounting for as well. So I think in our own minds those two risks to some degree offset each other. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Got you, that was actually my next question and my second question was just on the exchanges. What happens when someone doesn\u2019t pay their premium they get the card they show up at your hospital they receive service the health plan may even pay that. But what happens in a situation where the health plan hasn\u2019t paid that claim yet and it turns out that that individual actually never paid their premium who is on the hook there? Steve Filton : Yes, and so this is one of those questions that I think we are so early in the process does not to really have any experience to be able to answer but my gut is that either the insurance company will not pay the claim until the premium is paid or if they have paid they will make an effort to recoup that payment. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Right, so on your exchange base numbers that have been showing up with exchange insurance. Are you booking 100% of those revenues? Steve Filton : Yes. Josh Raskin - Barclays: You are, okay. Steve Filton : I mean, and the reason for that for the most part is we really don\u2019t have access to that payment information. So again when we verify the insurance I think the insurance company is verifying that there is insurance they\u2019re not giving us payment information. Sometime in the future we may do this much like we do Medicaid pending and if there is sort of a historical percentage of people who ultimately really don\u2019t qualify we may alter our procedures to try and take that into account. But at the moment it\u2019s been too early for us to do that. Josh Raskin - Barclays: Yeah the market assumption sounds like 15% or so who are not paying their premiums, so I didn\u2019t know if you were just sort of thinking, let\u2019s take a haircut. Steve Filton : The part of that is because I think as the first part of your question I think we solved it on the Medicaid pending side we might have some cushions to offset there. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Just a question for you around those exchange assumptions. I think you kind if said 7% or 9% reduction on sort, I think that the enrollment numbers seem to have all come in above everyone\u2019s expectations. I guess two questions then. First is, how do you think about that range? You feel better at the high end of the range because of all this or the leasing not to kind of move up here and form assumptions. And secondly I think we can see in payer mix and pricing and acute care margins, some benefits reform how much I guess is unclear. But it\u2019s not as clear what happens on the side, you kind of had some benefit built in at the high end of your range from maybe slight season benefit. Is there any indications in that side of the business we\u2019re seeing something? Just wanted your perspective on this too. Steve Filton : Sure, so as far as the exchanges assumptions go Kevin just to be clear we talk about the experience being better than what most people assume. To be fair about it I mean we gave our guidance two months ago. We were using pretty recent data when we made those assumptions and put our guidance. So I think we were using I forget the exact number, but something close to the 8 million newly insured numbers that the government has been working with. So I think our assumptions were relatively up to date when we made them two months ago and therefore I don\u2019t think they\u2019re terribly out of date in that regard today. And like I said I think that we will feel much more comfortable certainly a quarter or two down the road another quarter or two down the road before we start to modify those assumptions one way or the other just given a lot of the uncertainty if it still exists. On the behavioral side as our guidance sort of implied, I think that at the low end of the guidance there was sort of a presumption that there would be no impact from the ACA on behavior. And that was really premised on the idea that from a Medicaid perspective and the idea that most of the benefit or most of the impact in 2014 would be for Medicaid that the behavioral hospitals would not enjoy that benefit because of the IMD exclusion. And then I think the further assumption was that for some of the commercial exchange products the nature of sort of the high deductible benefit design in those products would limit the benefit that we might get on the behavioral side as well. So that\u2019s why we saw or we presume that there would be no benefit to the behavioral hospitals in the low end of our guidance. And in the first quarter I would say that we really didn\u2019t see any impact. Now again if you assume that one of the challenges is the high deductable nature of the plan in theory that might ease some as the year goes on and those deductibles get exhausted but we\u2019ll see. But I think the bottom line was we would say that there was no visible impact from reform on behavioral in Q1. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That\u2019s interesting I guess. You should have told me that you were expecting 8 million people back in February, at the time it was 4 million and it\u2019s really looking 5.5 to 6 and their estimate down to 6. So I am surprised that we thought it was going to be as high as it was. Steve Filton : Kevin as we used, all we did to do our assumptions was we used the data that HHS had published and I thought it already by February had reflected 7 million people. But whatever reflected is what we use. Operator : Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse :  Steve just struggling little bit still to understand why the charity would go up so much? I think the last several quarters we\u2019ve seen bad debt actually pop in one of the sort of rationale around that was that you guys went to operators and sort of had them maybe more aggressively but maybe go after payments as oppose to just sort of writing them off right up front. And now we sort of get into reform. And I would think that a lot of even that just the charity care would go away particularly in Medicaid expansion states. So am I missing anything in terms of the thought process around that? Steve Filton : No, two things Ralph. I mean one is I think just the new ones but from a process perspective I think we\u2019re trying to allow our hospitals to do what they think is best as oppose to the other way around. And you\u2019re right; they have tweaked this number of times. So we have gone in the last few years, we have moved along and continuing in some quarters or in some periods increasing or making the charity care policy more liberal which I think is what we did in Q1 of this year, which just has the effect of shifting some of those unpaid dollars into charity care versus that debt and then in some cases we\u2019ve made the charity policy more rigorous which is simply have the opposite effect which I think is what you saw in \u201913 of shifting dollars into that debt. I appreciate the fact that it\u2019s confusing but at the end of the day all you\u2019re doing is taking uncollected dollars based on gross billings and allocating them among these three buckets. Effectively based on sort of this idea of why a patient hasn\u2019t paid I\u2019ve always viewed that as a fairly stimulus sort of distinction and at the end of the day I am only concerned with what we really are billing (Ph) paid which is why I think they are always focused on our actual cash revenue as opposed to the deductions from gross revenue. But I appreciate the fact that it\u2019s confusing because the accounting powers that they still insist on showing that bad debt on the face of the income statement and nothing anybody cares what I think but the way to solve this problem is simply to take the bad debt off the face of the income statement. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : What was charge master increased to? Steve Filton : I don\u2019t have that in front on me Ralph but I am guessing it was probably 6% to 8%. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And if I could just sneak one more in can you talk a little bit more about the acuity mix in the quarter the drivers of that maybe any stats around who much surgery was up and maybe the categories where you\u2019re seeing that strength? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes so I think our inpatient surgeries were up like 1% in the quarter and our outpatient surgeries were up 5%. I think if you compare that to where we were a year ago we were down 5% for both in and outpatient so it\u2019s a pretty significant swing don\u2019t necessarily have the service line analysis in front of me but my recollection was that strength was kind of and across the board sort of strength across all specialties and quite frankly across most of the hospital portfolio as well so it wasn\u2019t limited even to certain specialties or even to certain geographies. Operator : Your next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open. A.J. Rice - UBS: Hi everybody I think I might just to ask first real quick about the capital deployment obviously you\u2019ve done a couple one off behavioral deals lately not anything on the acute care side. Can you just comment on what you\u2019re seeing out there, what you\u2019re greatest positions are and so forth? Steve Filton : I think as we\u2019ve said before A.J. we have the sense that most hospitals for profit, not for profit really reevaluating their going forward strategies kind of taking stock et cetera and I think they\u2019re making all kinds of decisions about how they should position themselves or could position themselves for the future. I think some of those processes are resulting in hospitals who have chosen to look for a partner or to sell out right et cetera we\u2019ve been involved in some of those processes. And we continue to be very interested in any hospital that is looking to change their strategy in any form whether that\u2019s looking to take on a partner or looking to sell out right et cetera and we continue to be interested in those opportunities I think a lot of those opportunities as we\u2019ve discussed over the last few years have been focused more on the rural end of the continuum and I think that not surprisingly therefore the rural hospital companies have been more active but I think we believe that going forward the universe of the hospitals that are considering those kinds of changes is expanding to include larger hospitals in larger markets. A.J. Rice - UBS: Okay, and maybe just follow-ups as we\u2019re now seems to be doing one question plus a follow up specifically on Temecula Valley obviously that opened in the fourth quarter. Is that still a drag for you in the first quarter or is it breakeven it\u2019s a contributing and second can you just comment does that have any impact on the metrics that we should be aware of when we think about your same store volume trends for example? Steve Filton : So clearly A.J. I would not make a good grade school teacher since no one listens to my instructions. But as far as Temecula goes Temecula is and this is that how we anticipate is still a drag in the first quarter and I think we expect that it would be dilutive in the first half of the year and then accretive in the second half. I will say that the overall California market has been fairly strong I kind of alluded to this in some earlier comments I do think they\u2019re benefiting again from the two trends both from increased surgical trends but also from in their case improved payer mix and specifically I think improved commercial payer mix. Obviously California has probably had the most successful state exchange implementation and I think we\u2019ve seen some benefit from that. A.J. Rice - UBS: Do you need to [indiscernible] your admissions in non-clinical basis in this quarter? Steve Filton : I think it\u2019s a payer mix issue again I mean I think those exchange patients are replacing what patients who are previously uninsured? A.J. Rice - UB: Right. No, I guess I am asking about Temecula Valley is that somehow the press that your same store\u2026 Steve Filton : I think there is a bit of cannibalization here A.J. but again I think that\u2019s clearly been included in our guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Taylor from Citi. Your line is open. Gary Taylor - Citi: Good morning Steve. Couple of questions on the same store I just want to go back to yourself paid decline on the patient days and you said, admissions were actually down more than 2% to 3%. Would you care to actually give us that number? Steve Filton : Yeah so I think self pay admissions were down 7% or 8% Gary and then I think the length of stay was up sort of 5%, 6% which that makes the patient days down 2% or 3%. Gary Taylor - Citi: So would it be fair to think about probably double-digit decline in expansion states versus probably much less in Texas? Steve Filton :  Definitely more pronounced, that\u2019s probably right but I don\u2019t have the data in front of me. Gary Taylor - Citi: Last question, on behavioral you called out -- you said 2 million to 3 million I guess EBITDA of EBIT you were talking about impact from the weather potentially. Does that imply roughly like 1% top line or 1% adjusted patient day impact am I kind of in the ballpark of what you\u2019re thinking? Steve Filton : So you have obviously done the math, I am trying to do it in my head. I think that\u2019s right, that sounds right. Gary Taylor - Citi: I was just thinking what kind of, your average margin on there and take it up to the revenue line and divide it. So that\u2019s what it comes out to around 1%, so there weren\u2019t any other assumptions about significantly different operating leverage or anything as you guys came up with that, doesn\u2019t sound like? Steve Filton : No. Operator : Your next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is open. John Ransom - Raymond James :  I just wanted to try to recap to make sure I\u2019ve got it. Are you saying essentially that it was almost a one-for-one swap lower, fewer on ensured days and increased Medicaid? So in other words very little impact from the exchanges so far? Steve Filton : Well and I think that\u2019s part of the challenge John is that we saw an increase in commercial lives which I did say earlier in the call. It\u2019s not clear to us in every case what that\u2019s attributable to. So in a place like California it\u2019s sort of easier to see where that\u2019s attributable to the exchange process in California. But we saw some payer mix improvement in Texas which by the way I meant. So we\u2019re just making the assumption that obviously there is nothing or little to do with the exchange impact, especially in the markets that we\u2019re in, because we just don\u2019t sense that there is not a lot of exchange activity. So we think in those cases it\u2019s recruiting newly recruiting physicians or new contracts that we have or other dynamics. But again this is the sort of ongoing challenge I have mentioned a few times in the quarter I think it\u2019s difficult to take everyone of these metrics on payer mix and attribute a very specific part to reform to the economy and then other dynamics to play. John Ransom - Raymond James : If a patient comes in with an exchange plan, do you even know that it is an exchange or it\u2019s just another commercial plan to you? Steve Filton : Again I think that in some cases the answer is yes, but I think it\u2019s a little too early in the process for us to know with great confidence how accurate we\u2019re about that. I think as time goes on I do believe we will get better data. Operator :   (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Paula Torch from Avondale Partners. Your line is open. Paula Torch - Avondale Partners : Was curious what are the learnings as you have increased physician employment in acquisitions. Are they generating the returns you have hoped for? How should we think about the growth there and maybe what types of physicians would you prefer to employ versus outsource and maybe you could give us some of the percentages outsource versus employee. Steve Filton : Generally I think when you\u2019re talking about outsourced physicians, I think you\u2019re talking about hospital base physicians, ER doctors, radiologists, pathologists et cetera. I don\u2019t have the exact percentage I mean the vast majority of our ER physicians are outsourced as far as our other house based physicians. It\u2019s really a market by market decision. As far as your actual admitting physicians, as we\u2019ve discussed in our calls I mean it varies by market how many of those and what percentage of those are employed? We employ both primary care physicians and specialists. Although I think our emphasis tends to be on primary care physicians. And in terms of lessons learned, I mean I think all hospitals would generally have the same observations. We like to or the advantage of implying physicians is to integrate them into the hospital and to hopefully have them associated more exclusively with your facility and the challenge is that once physicians are on a salary as oppose to working on their own. The historical I think tendency has been for them to lose some of the incentives and to be less productive. And I think that\u2019s the delicate balance that all hospitals try and work through as they employ physicians. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo :  I guess the comments regarding the impact of reform versus the economy. When you think about the impact of the economy, what or maybe some metrics or some of the things you have seen in your market would leave you to believe that there is more or some impact from the economy? Steve Filton : Well, I think the main Gary, as I said at the outset and we talked about couple of time. The increase surgical volume, to me that -- if it\u2019s related to either the ACA or the economy, which seem to be much more logically related to ACA since highly possible it\u2019s related, excuse me to the economy. It\u2019s entirely cost was related to other things as well, again recruiting a new positions, new contracts et cetera, but I don\u2019t know that anybody was really predicting that the ACA will drive more surgical volumes. So to add to that, the best example I can give, the acute care revenue strengthens the quarter that I think clearly didn\u2019t have much to do with that. The other piece is, as a result of more people going back to work but just saying in the market like Las Vegas, I think that we would expect to improve payer mix just from that trend from lower unemployment more people going back to work and getting insurance from their employer. And again in those cases it\u2019s been difficult for us to tease out whose got insurance as a result going back to work and who\u2019s got insurance as a result of a commercial exchange probably. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo : And then maybe you should follow-up on that, as you look out towards your 2015 negotiations or manage to your contracts are you seeing any impact from the exchanges in terms of mange share looking for more now and that works or anything like that? Steve Filton : I think it\u2019s still pretty early when you talk about negotiating 2015 our benefit plan design and rates, et cetera. So I would say the answer to your question is now, although I think that\u2019s an expectation that we have that as we get into the late summer and early fall and those negotiations are taking place more and earn it, that those kinds of conversations will become more frequent. Operator : Your next question comes from Anthony He from RBC Capital Market. Your line is open. Anthony He - RBC Capital Market : Thanks. Just curious to see if you have any update on the AR build up, I believe it was Illinois and Texas? Steve Filton : So our Illinois receivables are actually down I think about $10 million in the quarter, so that\u2019s a good development. We get a $25 million payment on our Texas UPL receivable in the quarter, although I think the receivable also have been filled up some as well. Obviously the Temecula opening and the fact, with our new payer et cetera. New debts contributed on to the receivable build up as well. Anthony He - RBC Capital Market : Okay. And then any update on the, the plan psych bed expansions for the year? Steve Filton : No. I mean again, I think we talked in the call, in the UN call and you know gave a psych bed target for the year which was in the 600 range. And I think we believe we\u2019re still tracking to that number. Anthony He - RBC Capital Market : Can you give a number that you made there in the first quarter or is it\u2026 Steve Filton : We do not have first quarter number in front of me, Anton. Operator : Your next question Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just the clarification, so what, it assumed in the guidance for the year and you\u2019re dropping in sort of mission versus the 2% to 3% you saw in the first quarter. You\u2019re assuming 79% drop? Steve Filton : That was what was in our guidance. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Okay. The first quarter was -- obviously very strong and you barely saw any benefit relative to what\u2019s you\u2019re looking for the year, correct. Steve Filton : And mostly because of the increase in line to stay in our uninsured volumes, Chris, and the answer to your question earlier, I think with actual drop in uninsured mission was pretty close to what we have guided to. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna: Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : I have no further question. Thank you. I turn the call back over to presenters for closing remarks. Steve Filton : We would like to thank everybody for their time. And look forward to speaking with them next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you everyone. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Rice - UBS Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird Gary Taylor - Citigroup Operator : Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Thank you. Good morning. This is Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014. During this conference call, Alan, I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.51 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS, increased approximately 30% to $155.6 million of $1.55 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2014 as compared to $118.9 million or $1.20 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year. On a same facility basis in our acute division, revenues during the second quarter of 2014 increased 11.5% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.6% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 7.7% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals increased to 19.2% during the second quarter of 2014 from 14.8% during the second quarter of 2013. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5.9% during the second quarter of 2014 as compared to the second quarter of 2013, during this year's second quarter as compared to last year's adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 4.4% and adjusted patient days increased 1.8%. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.6% during the second quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 28.6% and 28.7% during the quarters ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our cash from operating activities was approximately $264 million during the second quarter of 2014 as compared to $212 million in the second quarter of 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 17% to $458 million over the $391 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2013. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 53 days during the second quarter of 2014 as compared to 57 days during the second quarter of 2013. At June 30, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 47% as compared to 54.2% at June 30, 2013. We spent $94 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2014 and $187 million during the first six months. Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first six months of 2014, we are increasing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $5.55 to $5.85 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year as well as the impact of the other items reflected on the supplemental schedule for the six months ended June 30, 2014, represents an increase of approximately 15% to 16% from the previously provided range of $4.80 to $5.10 per diluted share. This guidance range, which is subject to certain conditions including those set forth in last night's earnings release also excludes the impact of future items, if applicable, that are nonrecurring or nonoperational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, costs related to extinguishment of debt, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets, impact of share repurchases and other material amounts that may be reflected in our financial statements that relate to prior periods. Our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program whereby, from time to time as conditions allow, we may spend up to $400 million to purchase shares of our Class B common stock on the open market or in negotiated private transactions and they have also increase our third quarter dividend payable on September from $0.05 a share to $0.10 a share. Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. We would ask that you try and limit yourself to one question each. Thank you very much. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Justin Lake. Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning. My question would be on the acute care side. Obviously, great quarter you guys had there. Anything you could share with us in terms of breaking out the outperformance in terms, would you think that the ACA related in terms of coverage expansion benefits versus core improvements, whether economic driven or just business investments you have made, and then maybe even talk to specific markets, that would be really helpful. Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure. We will try to do that, Justin. So I think as it was the case in the first quarter, I think we believe maybe a little bit more so than our peers that there is a fair amount of imprecision in trying to parse out or tease out the ACA impact and the impact of payor mix improvement coming from other sources particularly the improvement in our underlying economies. I think our best effort would be that in the quarter, if you look at the acute care year-over-year improvement, we would attribute somewhere between the third and a half of that improvement to the favorable ACA impact and the remainder of that improvement to improving economies in our local markets as well as idiosyncratic factors in our markets. And by that I mean the market share shifts, new service lines, et cetera. As far as the geography of it, I think we had relatively strong performance across the acute care portfolio but as we said in Q1, I think that the pleasant surprise of 2014 has really been the performance of our Texas markets, Texas not being a Medicaid expansion state and not being one that had set up statewide commercial exchanges, we were not necessarily anticipating a big ACA impact in that state, but generally I think the economy in Texas has improved fairly markedly and that's being reflected in our results. And our California markets as well have been very strong. Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Thanks for all the color. Operator : Your next question is from the line of A.J. Rice. A.J. Rice - UBS: Thanks. Hi, everybody, and also congratulations on the beat there. Maybe just to flesh up further on reform benefits. I know the guidance, I think it said reform was $0.15 to $0.20 embedded in the original guidance. Have you updated that number? And then specific, seemed like quarter, most of the benefit was Medicaid related. Can you comment it that's still the case? And are you seeing any benefit from exchanges start to kick in at this point? Steve Filton : Sure, A.J. I think that in terms of the latter part of the question, you have described it accurately. The ACA impact in Q1 was definitely more skewed to increases in Medicaid enrollment and clearly in Q2 we are seeing more of a commercial exchange impact, not surprisingly, since I think that the government's data showed that a lot of that exchange enrollment activity was taking place at the end of Q1. And so I think it's starting to filter its way to our business in Q2. As far as the ACA impact on our guidance, I would answer that in much the same way I answered Justin's question and that is, I think if you take a look at our revised guidance and you think about that as improved over the prior year, I think we would suggest that somewhere between a third and a half of that improvement is from the ACA and the rest is from other non-ACA factors. A.J. Rice - UBS: Okay, all right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joshua Raskin. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital : Hi, thanks. Good morning, Steve. The first question just, and I don't want to beat the dead horse, but can you actually tell if its exchange lives relative to just general commercial improvement? Or are you seeing, its better in California, so that's why we think it's exchanges as opposed to economy or something like that? Is there a way for you guys to actually know that? Steve Filton : So I think the way that we have approached it, Josh, is the way that we approached quantifying the ACA impact is to say that in Medicaid expansion states, we are going to attribute any benefit from increased Medicaid enrollment to the ACA and not really do that in the non-expansion states. As far as then the commercial exchange patients go, to the best of our ability, we are trying to identify those patients specifically, but I think that's really where we believe the imprecision comes in that in some cases we can clearly do that and we are very comfortable doing it. In other cases, it is not so clear. Somebody comes in with a Blue Cross card or another card and it is not actually clear to us whether they are exchange patient or not. So that's why we have this sort of range, and feel that to some degree we are estimating that impact. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital : Got you, and then just specifically on the buybacks. Do you guys have sort of a formulaic approach, debt to cap minimum that you hit and then you start buying back or are you just going to be more opportunistic, based on what the stock price does? Steve Filton : I think the history of UHS is that we have been an active acquirer of our shares from time to time over the years and have generally been an opportunistic acquirer when we have been active. I think the message in the buyback authorization, from my perspective, is obviously just sort of a bullish message on the business. We are just very pleased with how the business is going and its outlook for the near and intermediate term for sure, but also as we talked about in our Q1 call, we have been very diligently paying down debt and reducing our leverage, really ever since the PSI deal more than three years ago. And I think we certainly feel that our leverage levels now are at a sufficiently low level that we are very comfortable with them and don't feel that they need to be a great deal lower, so that if we continue to generate cash at these levels and don't necessarily find other opportunities to deploy capital in the short-term, we will be more than happy to be acquirers of our own shares. And again, we will do that on an opportunistic basis. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fishbeck. Mr. Fishbeck, your line is open. Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello. Can you hear me? Steve Filton : I can hear you. Go ahead. Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So I guess last quarter you guys gave some specific information around the reduction in uninsured as far as, I think in the last quarter you saw extra admissions in the quarter, but length of stay and patient days. Do you have the updated data for this quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think that the results in Q2 suggest this, and the underlying metrics having supported, the trends that we saw, I think, in Q1 probably accelerated some into Q2. So the reduction in self pay or uncompensated patients grew to probably 10%, 11%, 12%, Medicaid utilization increased by 9% or 10% and commercial utilization increased probably 4% or 5%. So I think all those numbers were a little more favorable than they were in the first quarter, again reflective of a trend that we didn't see a lot of new trends in Q2, but an acceleration of the ones that we did see in Q1. Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that makes sense. Now jus the one last question on Vegas. The minority interest number actually was down year-over-year which is a bit surprising to me. I wasn't sure there was anything in there around the liability accrual that maybe reduced the comp year-over-year or was Vegas actually a somewhat difficult quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. Vegas was ahead of last year's quarter, but I will remind people that the second quarter of last year was the first quarter where we called out a really measurable improvement in the Vegas economy and in our results. So the Vegas market rise was really the only difficult comparison in Q2 to last year and that's reflective in the fact that we certainly cosmetically, our Texas markets or our California markets were sort of outperforming. It's also worth noting, depending on what numbers you are looking at, but on that minority interest line, we had a favorable malpractice adjustment in the second quarter of 2013 and to the degree that that was allocated to the Vegas facilities, it made their second quarter 2013 results look somewhat better and so that's making the comparison again on the face of the income statement a little more difficult. Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Darren Lehrich. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And Alan, congrats on 35 years. Alan Miller : Thank you. Thanks very much. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : So I wanted to maybe ask about behavioral and I know I have been asking this question pretty consistently, Steve, about length of stay in behavioral. It was down, I guess, seems to around 2.5%. I would be curious just to get any feedback here you are getting from the operators about whether you are sensing there is any bottoming at all there? And then on the other behavioral question I would like to sneak in here is just, are you getting any feedback at all about health plan design, now that July 1 has come around and the benefit years post July 1 has to, taking an account, the mental health parity? Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure. So answering your second question first, Darren. As far as benefit plan design and then I think your question is, are we getting a sense that benefit plan design is changing in July to comply with the final mental health parity regulations which become effective in July, I would make two comments about that. One is from a practical perspective, I think all our sense is that the majority of those changes will likely take place in January 2015 when benefit plan design routinely changes. Anyway, for the most part, we will certainly press to the degree that we can for earlier changes, but again I think from a practical perspective, and I think it's part of the reason why we have always sort of tried to create the expectation that the ACA/mental health parity impact for the behavioral business would be more either backend loaded in 2014 or probably even skewed to 2015. As far as the length of stay issue -- and one other comment I will make just about benefit plan design is, I think the managed care companies are always going to be ahead of the curve from us in terms of understanding how that's changing. We will see those changes as those patients really start coming to our hospitals, and we get a quarter or two experience under our belts. So we will see. So I think it's probably too early for us to really answer that question in a meaningful way. As far as the length of stay goes, you suggest you have been asking this question for a long time, obviously, we have been answering it for a while as well. This trend has existed now and been in place for several years, really, I think since the height of the recession when Medicaid programs really started cutting back length of stay, I think as a means of controlling expenditures. We saw I think a little bit of improvement in Q1. Q2 took sort of another step down, although not a real significant one. I think very much consistent with our expectations. I would just say that in general the behavioral division, I think was right on our expectations for Q2 and just as a financial person impresses me quarter-after-quarter, with just their very strong consistent performance. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : And Steve, just so we are clear that the behavioral margins year-over-year, would they have been positive if the (inaudible) you reserved wasn't in the numbers? Steve Filton : There is a few small plusses and minuses, Darren, and I think you know I could certainly make an argument that we were a tenth of point or two-tenths of a point ahead, but again I think what you are seeing in behavioral, from my perspective, is again is just very consistent margin performance in the high 20s. And to me, the real upside to that is really getting back to your original question, if the length of stay does not even improve, but just level off at some point and/or we do get some of the impact from either the ACA or the mental health parity final regulations, I think that's when you might see note that the next step-up in those behavioral margins. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Great. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Frank Morgan. Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets : Good morning. I was hoping you could comment a little bit or detail around the surgical volume, both inpatient and outpatient? And I am curious if you are starting to see any kind of change in the mix of the payor mix of that business suggesting that maybe you are starting to see some of this newly insured business that in that area? Steve Filton : Yes, Frank, so the metrics are easy to talk about. I think we had a 4% increase in our outpatient surgeries and a 2% increase in our inpatient surgeries. And I think in both cases, those numbers are really the best surgical volumes that we have posted probably since the recession began. So that's encouraging. Again, so looping back to the conversation I was having with Josh Raskin earlier, it's a little difficult for us to sort of parse that out between how much of that increase is reform related or ACA related and how much is not. I think our general sense is that most of that surgical strength comes from the improving economies, people going back to work, people feeling more comfortable about being out at work, those kinds of things than it does from necessarily ACA patients, new ACA patients are having those procedures. But to be fair, we can't tell that with great precision. Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets : Okay and then changing gears, just on cash collection. Are you actually starting to see cash collections on those newly insured Medicaid patients that were coming in the door last quarter? Has that process been fairly seamless? And have you noticed any change there? And then finally I am going to hop, what is action -- this is a mechanical question, what is the run or the EPS for the first half of the year that you are using to update your annual guidance? What is the number you are actually using to build off to get to your new full year guidance? Thanks. Steve Filton : So I would refer people to the supplemental schedule in our press release, where we adjust for the electronic health record number and the nonrecurring gain we had in the first quarter and that will show you effectively the adjusted earnings that we are using to then say, you know, this is what we are basing our revised guidance on. Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets : So that cash collections on the newly insured Medicaid patients? Steve Filton : So the cash collection and I think our DSOs reflect this, Frank. I think there was a little slowdown in Q1 in some of the states like Nevada, where I think they were frankly overwhelmed with new Medicaid enrollees. But again, as you just see from the general cash flow in Q2 and just that the DSOs, I think for the most part, those initial bumps are working themselves out and we are collecting on both the newly enrolled Medicaid patients as well as the new commercial exchange patients that had a pretty normal, I would say. Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paula Kurt [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more broadly about the urban acute hospital landscape? And are you seeing some better opportunities for any M&A activity there? Are there any assets you have identified or any particular markets that you are really focused in on? And when might we start to see some activity there at all and what might some of the challenges be in getting anything done in the next couple of years? Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure, Paula. So UHS has generally been situated in the middle of that continuum that you are sort of suggesting of the rural and urban and however sweet spot, particularly in our acute care division has been kind of the midsize urban, large suburban markets we have tended to try and locate. I think we have a sense that not-for-profit hospitals around the country in those kinds of markets are having all sorts of conversations and evaluating their future, and thinking about how they want to position themselves in the healthcare landscape over the next three years and five years, et cetera. But I will also say that those conversations, historically, I think take a long time to evolve and mature. We are trying to stay on top of them as much as we can and as those hospitals decide that they want to look in a different direction or want to consider other alternatives. We certainly have, as we were alluding to before, the capital flexibility and the desire to respond to those opportunities as they arise. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great, and I just have one follow-up as we think about guidance. I guess in terms of the same facility revenue, let's take it on the acute care side, you had guided to 3% to 4%, with EBITDA flat to slightly up. But obviously, we are much better than not. So where should we be thinking about taking that number in terms of how we are modeling the second half? Steve Filton : I will answer the question just a little differently, Paula, in a sense. And I think what we try to do in revising our guidance was to take our first half of the year performance and for the most part just assume that that kind of improvement over the prior year and over our original expectations continues at about the same rate as it did for the first six months. We obviously then adjusted for a couple of the known plusses and minuses like the Texas Medicaid reimbursement that we disclosed, et cetera. But other than that, it was really pretty much as straightforward as that, and if you go through that same exercise you will land very much within the confines of our range. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks and good luck. Steve Filton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Rigg. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to try to parse out the economic versus ACA improvement a little bit more. I know you about Texas being very strong. But when you think about sort of the relative benchmarks, the inpatient, outpatient surgeries, are there other major regional differences, say in Texas versus California and Florida, et cetera that that might be worth highlighting? Thanks Steve Filton : Sure, Chris. Generally look, I think that obviously you talk about a 4% increase in outpatient surgery, you are going to see some hospitals doing a little better there and others a little worse. But in general, the trends that we have discussed, the improved payor mix trends, the stronger surgical mix trends, really have been pretty much spread fairly evenly through the portfolio, as I said. As I think about 2014 in terms of how we originally envisioned and how it's played out, I think that our original thought was this would be year in which we would feel, as we described, a significant ACA impact in places like California and Nevada, which were Medicaid expansion states and California which had a robust commercial exchange program, et cetera. But what surprised us, I think, was the really strong performance in Texas that I think for the most part is not ACA related. And even the really strong performance in California that is beyond the ACA impact. So that's the sort of geographic trends or differences that I would point out. But I will say that, for the most part, the trends that we describe are trends that we are really seeing across all of our markets and my sense is obviously, given the couple of other acute care companies that have reported so far this quarter, at least give an indication of where they are going to report, those trends seem to be fairly widespread. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group : Okay, and then just one quick follow-up. Are you still excluding the California provider tax from the guidance ? I will leave it at that. Thanks. Steve Filton : And the answer is yes, we are still excluding the California provider tax. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ralph Giacobbe. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I was hoping you can maybe just talk about the progression through the quarter. Was it sort of evenly spread? Did it improve month-to-month? And I know it's only few weeks in, but any initial views on July trends? Steve Filton : So I think as some of the sell side surveys have indicated, I think the quarterly, both payor mix and volumes tended to improve as the quarter progressed. I think it's difficult to really give much of an indication of any early signs of the third quarter only because so much of this improvement is really payor mix based and that's much harder for us to measure on an interim basis before the month closes. So I don't think there is really anything we can say that's terribly meaningful about the about the third quarter just yet. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Okay, fair enough. And if I could sneak one more in. Are you guys seeing any greater mix of out-of-network revenue coming in? Is that helped at all? And within your markets, maybe just remind us of what your position of being in versus being out? Thanks. Steve Filton : I think in the vast majority of our markets, we are in almost all the networks, except for some sort of long-standing historical exclusions. I don't think that there has been any developments in recent, you know, in the last year or two where we have really been excluded from a noteworthy contract. And again, occasionally, you will see a significant amount of out-of-network activity or sort of outlier activity but I would say, in general, that's not something that has really come to our attention in this year, at least. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Zimmerman. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs : Hi, thanks and good morning. I appreciate the color on surgical trends, but I was hoping you could also give us an idea of what acuity looked like in the quarter? And then maybe some of your other service lines in terms of like ER visits in particular? Steve Filton : I think, Brian, the revenue strength, meaning that revenue per admission number, which quite frankly, I didn't go back and try and find the last time we were that high but I know it's certainly been multiple years. But I think that's reflective of obviously the improved payor mix that we have been talking about, but also increased acuity. I think the increased acuity occurs for a couple of reasons. I mean, one, it's a function of the improving surgical volumes that we have talked about already. Two is this whole, what I call the two midnight phenomenon that as payors, most notably Medicare, but other payors drive out the shortest length of stay and by definition therefore I think the least acute patients, the inpatient component that you re left with tends to be a more acute mix of patients, et cetera. So I think that also drives the acuity up, but in general I think acuity has been strong this year and we would expected it to remain so. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs : And on the ER visits? Steve Filton : The ER visits have been up, I think, 5% or 6% for the year, although again going back to sort of what I call the two midnight phenomenon, the conversion of those to actual inpatient admissions is going at a lower rate than has been the historical case, I think because of the emphasis on making sure that patients meet admitting criteria that will pass muster with Medicare and other payors. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs : All right, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gary Lieberman. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on last point. Steve, do you happen to have the statistic for the percentage of admissions that came in through the ER and how that would compare year-over-year? Steve Filton : I don't have it in front of me, Gary. I will tell you that historically, we run in the mid-to upper teens, those 16%, 70%. But I know that again over the last two or three quarters that percentage has declined some, although again I do not have the data right in front of me. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, and then could you comment on any impact if at all that you are seeing that you are aware of in South Texas from some of the immigration issues that have been in the news? Steve Filton : Yes, I think we have seen very little. As I watch the news along with everybody else, I think that these folks, particularly the children who were coming across the border are generally being treated in these separate facilities. I have not really heard other than some of the anecdotal story here or there that we are really seeing any of those patients. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, and then maybe just to wrap up, on the behavioral side, are you still on track to add, I think you said it was 600 beds, for the year or are you considering changing that based on some of the volumes that you are seeing there? Steve Filton : No, I think that those bed additions that we have undertaken are generally decided upon based on a fairly long-term view and I don't think our long-term view of this business or the demand has really changed. So we are sticking with our expansion program, not only for this year, quite frankly, but I think we hope to continue the bed expansions at about that same annual rate for at least 2015 and hopefully into 2016 as well. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Whit Mayo. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird: Hi, thanks. Steve, you have excluded HITECH income and the cost from your guidance for some time now and clearly that's had the impact of understating your earnings in prior quarters. But how do you think about that over the long-term and presumably the cost will continue into perpetuity and the reimbursement doesn't? So I am just kind of curious on your thoughts there. Steve Filton : Well, I think our rationale for excluding them was just the opposite, that the actual implementation of the electronic health record and those are really the cost that we have excluded, really doesn't continue into perpetuity. That was a finite sort of process that began in 2009 or so and will continue for four or five years. I think from a cash perspective, we will largely be through a lot of that impact at the end of 2014, certainly from a cost perspective. And I think again, our rationale for excluding both the HITECH revenue and those cost was, they weren't being recorded on a very ratable basis in many cases and therefore in our minds were a distorting the current earnings power of the company. So again, as you know, we have been very transparent about what those numbers are. We have tended to exclude them from our ongoing earnings in that supplemental schedule we do but the cost are out there so that any analysts can treat them exactly the way they want. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird: That's fair. I was just curious. And maybe just on cost for a second, is anything new on either side of the business? I think you and others within the sector have really worked down your cost structure for years now and that presumably helps on any new incremental dollar revenue that flows through, but anything new or worse on supplies, registry cost, anything that we should be aware of? Thanks. Steve Filton : I don't think so. Look, I think what you have actually described it pretty accurately. I think UHS and the industry in general really tightened their belt as the recession began several years ago and I am not sure we or they have loosened that at all or much at all. And I will say that because so much of this revenue strength is coming from improved payor mix, there is not necessarily cost that are directly associated with improved payor mix and that's why I think you are seeing such a powerful leverage mechanic on that acute care margin line. To the degree that we are seeing volumes pick up as we did in Q2, obviously there is some increase in costs associated with that and obviously also to the degree that we are seeing surgical volumes pick up, I think our supply expense does tickup commensurate with that. But other than that I don't think we really feel like there is any significant pressure points on cost at the moment. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird: Thanks. Operator : (Operator Instructions). This question is from the line of Gary Taylor. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Hi, good morning. Actually I just had one clarification and one question. So it feels like I can get away with that. Steve, you might have said that, I stepped out just a second, but on the Medicaid supplemental payments and the portion those that are out of period, are those included in the same-store metrics that you report or excluded? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think you know it's only the in-period revenues that are included in the same-store metrics. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: So it's all been scrubbed already for that. Steve Filton : Right. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay, perfect, and then my question. it is kind of interesting, obviously really strong fundamental performances has overshadowed everything else but just a few days ago the biggest thing going on in the space was some of the legal decisions coming out of the court cases and consuming a lot of people's thoughts and you guys are fairly well-positioned in Nevada, California. My question would be, and maybe Alan might want to weigh in on this as well. You do have significant exposure to Texas. There is some ACA benefit there presumably with 700,000 or 800,000 exchange enrollees in that state. I guess the question is, any sense out of the hospital association or yourselves, the willingness of the state of Texas to actually establish their own exchange if it ever actually got to that after some additional legal decisions? Or it still look like, your still best guess would be that Texas would be a standout and probably wouldn't want to move along those lines? Interested in your comments. Thanks. Alan Miller : We haven't heard anything with regard to Texas changing its position at the moment. I think the Governor is positioning himself to run for President with the border business and his position. So we will say. But I think that is a plus what we have been able to accomplish without Texas and exchanges. I think that's a plus. I would expect at some point that this whole thing will be resolved and it will be favorable to us. Gary Taylor - Citigroup: Okay, thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks? Alan Miller : A.J., still with us? Steve Filton : Well, he can't answer. Alan Miller : He can't answer. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Steve Filton : It's okay. Thank you. We just want to thank everybody for their time. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call.

Rice - UBS Ana Gupte - Leerink Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Operator :   Good morning. My name is Tanya and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services' Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Thank you.  Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Good morning and welcome to Universal Health Services third quarter 2014 earnings call. During this call, I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. I'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.  As discussed in our press release last night, the Company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $0.82 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarters' reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 26% to 137.5 million or $1.36 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 109.5 million or $1.10 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year. On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2014 increased 7.9% over last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 4.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.6% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 18.3% during the third quarter of 2014 from 14.4% during the third quarter of 2013. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.2% during the third quarter of 2014 as compared to the third quarter of 2013. During this year's third quarter, as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 5.4% and adjusted patient days increased 2.1%. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.9% during the third quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 27.6% during the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 27.3% during the third quarter of 2013. Our cash from operating activities increased approximately 25% to 231 million during the third quarter of 2014, as compared to 185 million in the third quarter of 2013. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 57 days during the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 59 days during the third quarter of 2013. At September 30, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 48.9% as compared to 52.9% at September 30, 2013. We spent $123 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2014 and $309 million during the first nine months of this year. In late September 2014, we acquired the stock of Cygnet Health Care Limited for a purchase price of approximately $327 million. Through this acquisition, we have added a total of 18 facilities located throughout the United Kingdom, including 16 inpatient behavioral health hospitals and two nursing homes with a total of 734 beds. Cygnet has a national footprint and is one of the largest independent providers of behavioral health facilities in the United Kingdom. They are the leading specialist mental health provider in the UK which includes services for children, eating disorders and autism among others. They have outstanding customer relationships and a well established reputation for excellence. The Cygnet facilities generated aggregate revenues of approximately $161 million during the 12 month period prior to our acquisition. During 2014, we have opened a total of 242 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest facilities. We expect to complete construction and open another 258 beds in the fourth quarter, including the opening of the 102 bed Quail Run Behavioral Hospital in North Phoenix. Near the end of the second quarter of this year we acquired a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada. Included in our operating results for the third quarter of 2014 is approximately $48 million to $50 million of revenues and other operating expenses recorded in connection with its operations. During the third quarter of 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, whereby from time-to-time as conditions allow, we may spend up to $400 million to purchase shares of our Class B common stock on the open market or in negotiated private transactions. In conjunction with this program during the third quarter of 2014, we repurchased 227,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $25.2 million.  I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Justin Lake - JPMorgan: Good morning. Steve one question here, can you give us an update on the benefits of reform in the quarter versus the Q2 run-rate and then maybe some comments on how to think about a framework for 2015 ACA benefits for the company? Thanks. Steve Filton :  Sure, Justin. So I think, what we had said in our second quarter call and I think we acknowledge that our analysis was limited by a number of factors and so it was not absolutely precise. But we estimated that of the acute care improvement year-over-year somewhere around 35% - 40% of it was attributable to the Affordable Care Act and the favorable impacts of that. Another 35% to 40% attributable to an improved economy in many of our local markets and then finally another maybe 15% to 20% attributable to local market factors, market share increases that sort of thing. I think we felt like for the most part those percentages held relatively steady in the third quarter as well. As far as thinking about the impact of reform on next year, obviously I think we're going to wait as I'm sure most of our peers will to see what the enrollment data looks like. Obviously, this year open enrollment for exchange products will be completed by the end of the year, so by the time we give our guidance at the end of February we should have a pretty decent picture of new enrollment both from a Medicaid and an exchange perspective. And we'll base our 2015 estimates in part on that data, much as we did this year although, the data was not available until later in the sort of chronology this year. So, that's how we'll go about framing our 2015 ACA impact. Justin Lake - JPMorgan: One clarification, Steve, you said the breakdown of the growth was similar in terms of how much was ACA in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Obviously, third quarter growth was great but not as significant as the second quarter's growth especially in the acute care business. Should I take that to mean that your ACA benefit in your mind declined in terms of absolute dollar benefit sequentially? Steve Filton :  I think that's right, Justin. We talked a little bit about the fact that we had a sense in the second quarter because our same store revenue acute care revenue growth in the second quarter which was 11.5% was so significant that there was some aspect of that that was perhaps sort of one-timeish in nature whether that was because of the sort of bolus of enrollment that occurred in the second quarter or some pent-up demand that was exercised in the second quarter. But, it certainly appears as if the growth rate that we realized in the third quarter of 7.9% was still very strong seems to us to be sort of a more sustainable rate going forward. So yes, I think we felt like that real strong revenue growth that we saw in Q2 whether it was attributable to ACA or to an improving economy, decelerated just a little bit in Q3 Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs : Hi, thanks and good morning. I was hoping, if you could give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in terms of exchange volumes versus Medicaid expansion in states that have done so. Just any more granularity there would be helpful. Steve Filton : Sure, Brian. So I mean I think that we continue to believe that in 2014, the larger portion of the ACA impact is from Medicaid expansion. And we've seen our Medicaid volumes increase by double-digits, certainly in that sort of 12%, 13% range year-to-date. And exchange or commercial volumes increased definitely increased by a measurable amount but by certainly less than that. Again not difficult to be terribly precise about it but I think we would sort of attribute maybe two-thirds of the ACA benefits to Medicaid expansion in '14 and maybe a third to exchange expansion or exchange enrollment. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs :  Okay and then can you give us a bit more detail on what you're seeing in terms of acuity in payor mix in the quarter? Steve Filton : Again I think, from a payor mix perspective, the trends are similar to what we've seen all year which is a relatively measurable decline in uninsured volumes, uninsured volumes are down probably 7% to 8% for the year and those are offset by an increase in both Medicaid and commercial volumes as I just noted, and those trends continued into Q3 and I think our expectation is they will continue into Q4 as well. Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs :  Alright. Thanks a lot. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks. Good morning. So I guess I wanted to ask two things here. The first, you mentioned the acquisition of a managed care plan and I guess, I'd just be curious to get a little bit of flavor for what you're doing with that plan and, I guess, specifically inside this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about maybe the earnings impact? I know you gave us a revenue number, obviously -- that's a lower margin business. Were there any transition costs of any sort? And just help us put that into perspective. Steve Filton : Sure. So from I think a strategic perspective, Darren, the acquisition of the health plan is really part of sort of the broader preparation and, I think, foundation that we're building for the more integrated or the demands for a more integrated health care delivery system that we anticipate and I think, frankly, most of our peers anticipate is going to be required in the future. And so, as we continue to form more integrated relationships with our physicians and some of our long-term care providers, et cetera, and other niche providers, we also I think wanted to have the option in at least certain markets of being able to offer an insurance product, in some cases, the Medicare Advantage Insurance product. And as we thought about how best to create that infrastructure and capability, we looked at potentially building it on our own from scratch or buying it and ultimately decided that buying a small insurance company and the one we chose was in a market that we already operate in Reno, although I don't think there was anything terribly significant about the location itself, because I think for the most part we would like to be able to transform that or transmit that capability to other markets. So that was the driver behind the decision. As I indicated in my remarks, maybe approximately $50 million of revenues and expenses in the quarter, slightly dilutive at the EBITDA line and I think we anticipate that it will remain that way for the first, maybe 18 to 24 months of operation at which point we think it would become accretive or positive from an EBITDA perspective. But again, the real goal here is not to create an insurance business that\u2019s going on its own become terribly profitable but really to help us drive some of the results in our markets and alignments that we're really looking for. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just the EBITDA dilution, should we thinking, a few million or is there something... Steve Filton : Yeah. I would say on an annual basis, in that sort of $5 million to $8 million range. Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank : Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess I wanted to ask also here about the Cygnet transaction. With regard to the skilled nursing facilities is that, I guess those two facilities, will you continue to operate them or how should we think about that in terms of the enterprise you're buying? And then, what do you think the EBITDA contribution for Cygnet can be on a run rate basis? And then, just I guess specific to guidance, it was not implicitly in the original guidance so how should we put the annual guide into context? Steve Filton : So trying to work backwards, I think that when we announced the Cygnet transaction, we talked about a margin profile for that business that was fairly similar to our own which I think translates to something like $10 million to $11 million of incremental EBITDA a quarter. And I think also it translates to something like $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS accretion in the first year of operation. So to your point, Darren, with a quarter of that to be realized in the fourth quarter, we didn't think those numbers were material enough to change our operating guidance given any other moving parts that we might have. And then as to your first question about the two nursing homes that the company owned, I mean, that's a long standing \u2013 those are long standing facilities that the company owned, not necessarily an indication of a business that we're looking to expand, et cetera. I don't know that we're in any rush to divest any of the Cygnet facilities, but I don't think we also have any desire to expand the nursing home business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. So, I guess a couple of questions. I want to go back to your comment about how -- the reform benefit in Q3 might be a little bit less than the reform benefit in Q2. If I remember correctly your adjusted admission number actually was better in Q3 versus Q2 on a more difficult comp. So, trying to understand, it sounds to me like you're saying that there is demand in Q2 that might have inflated the benefit and that came back to normal, where would we see that if not in the volume number? Steve Filton : Well, again, Kevin, what I was sort of referring to was the fact that our same store revenue growth in Q3 was some 360 basis points better than it was in Q -- than our revenue growth in Q2 is better, 360 basis points better than in Q3. And to your point if the volumes are the same then obviously it's in the revenue per unit and that becomes sort of a mix issue. And again, to be absolutely fair about it I'm not sure that we can specifically identify why the mix was so good in Q2, and returned in our minds to a more normal range in Q3. But I think, the things or the dynamics that we speculated on was potentially the impact of sort of you know utilization occurring as enrollment incurred whether it was Medicaid or commercial, or the fact that you know perhaps, there was some bolus pent-up demand among those newly insured. Again, whether they were newly insured as a result of an improving economy or of the ACA we also had a little bit of as we have disclosed in Q2, some catch up, Texas reimbursement that drove those numbers a little bit as well. So I think that -- it's just the issue of trying to offer an explanation of why that same-store revenue growth was somewhat higher in Q2 versus Q3. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay. I guess, in the past when you talked about why you think it's 35% to 40% reform and 35% -- or 35%, 40% economy you talked a little bit about performance in the expansion versus non-expansion states. Can you talk a little bit about what happened maybe in Texas versus Nevada? Steve Filton :  Yes. I mean I think, I'm not sure that, I mean I do think another dynamic that is affecting that slight deceleration in revenue growth is the fact that the Las Vegas market and I think the economic improvement in the Las Vegas market that drove higher revenues was something that we began to experience in the middle of 2013. So, by the third quarter of 2014 we were clearly starting to lap or anniversary that improvement, and that comparison consequently has become a little bit more difficult. I think we're still clearly ahead in the third quarter of '14 versus '13 in Las Vegas but probably further ahead in some of the other markets like Texas and California whose improvements started later and really didn't start in 2014. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And I may have missed this from the question before, but did you comment on transaction costs around Cygnet in the quarter? Steve Filton :  I'm sorry no, I did not. But there were no significant transaction costs in the quarter for Cygnet. Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  But will you have any in Q4, or they're just not [indiscernible]. Steve Filton :  No I mean, we had basically legal fees and some related transaction fees but no fees for an advisor or anything like that. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets :  Yes. I guess, just a follow up on that last question. You were starting to talk a little bit about Texas given that the recovery in Vegas area lapped. But, I was hoping you could go around some of the other markets and maybe comment on those, where they are and maybe give us some color on how long you think the runway is in the recovery, is there anything different about how long we should expect the recovery in Texas and some other states? How long should that be sustained compared to what we saw in Vegas, and then secondly likelihood of a California provider tax hitting in the fourth quarter? I know it's not in your guidance but, do you still think that's a likelihood and is that still like a $9 million or $10 million kind of number? Steve Filton :  Sure. So, again, trying to take it backwards and at the risk of forgetting something as I work my way back. The California provider tax we did quantify as having the value to us of about $9 million or $10 million annually. As we said in -- when we offered our original guidance early in the year we did not include it in our original guidance, we did not include it in our revised guidance and specifically because it was pending CMS approval and while we ultimately expected that CMS approval will be granted, it was difficult for us to project or predict when that would happen and et cetera. And I think that's still the case. So, we continue to hope that we get CMS approval and that we get those moneys but, I have not projected that in our revised guidance and I think we'll continue to take that position. As far as your other question Frank about the individual markets again, I mean, I think that what we've seen and I think we commented on this after the end of our Q2 reporting was we've seen strength in all of our markets. And I think, that strength can be attributable to both Medicaid expansion in places like California and Nevada and D.C.  It can attributed to an improving economy in a number of states including -- and I think notably Texas as well as exchange enrollment in a number of states including Texas and California. I think our sense is that those benefits that is the people who have enrolled in insurance plans whether, they be Medicaid or exchanges as a result of the ACA or people who have gotten or maybe even reentered the insured market because they've returned to the job force, et cetera. I think, we think, those benefits definitely continue for the most part into 2015. I think what we are not necessarily sure of is to what degree there will be new enrollment, ACA enrollment in 2015. I think that was sort of the context of my answer to Justin's question earlier. And I think the other piece that is sort of obvious is there is a sort of initial benefit as these un-insureds reenter the insured marketplace. And while that benefit is sustained, it doesn't continue to incrementally increase. So, while we\u2019re starting to lap the Las Vegas benefit in Q3, maybe and I think from here on out, we won't lap the other the benefits that we started to enjoy in the beginning of '14 until next year. But there will be some element of that occurring next year. Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. One final and then I'll hop off. Just looking at the implied range for the fourth quarter given that you're reaffirming guidance, a pretty wide range there, I think it's something like 127 to157. Anything we should be mindful of in considering as we look at that wide range and try to hone in a final number, just anything we should be aware of? And I'll hop. Thank you. Steve Filton : I don't think so. I mean, obviously, it was an intentional decision on our part not to narrow the range. I still we still continue to believe that there are -- there's a decent amount of volatility in the markets, et cetera, but generally are comfortable that we will meet our original range and I'm not sure that any further commentary was intended or required. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. Just want to go to same facility side of things, you had sizable improvement in the acute care and a bump up on the behavioral side, but when I look at in aggregate we didn't see the same level of sort of margin pull through or improvement. So what outsiders for the organic is preventing the better margin performance. I know you mentioned the Reno health plan, but is there anything else in terms of corporate overhead or other costs that's sort of impacting the margins? Credit Suisse : Thanks, good morning. Just want to go to same facility side of things, you had sizable improvement in the acute care and a bump up on the behavioral side, but when I look at in aggregate we didn't see the same level of sort of margin pull through or improvement. So what outsiders for the organic is preventing the better margin performance. I know you mentioned the Reno health plan, but is there anything else in terms of corporate overhead or other costs that's sort of impacting the margins? Steve Filton : Yes, Ralph. So, I mean, we had 7.9% same store revenue growth in our acute care business and almost 400 basis point improvement in margins. I realized that the audience can be sometimes pretty tough, but I think we consider that to be pretty strong performance on the behavioral side where we already have very robust margins. We had a 30 basis point improvement in margins, again, I think we felt like both of those results were kind of well within our expectations. I think when you compare perhaps the acute business sequentially to last quarter, again, I'll just go back and highlight the fact that the results that we posted in Q2 with an 11.5% increase in same store revenue were a little bit better than what we posted with a 7.9% increase in revenue that's just the nature of the model. But again, I think the third quarter results were well within our expectations and honestly I don't know that we could do a whole lot better than that. Ralph Giacobbe : No, that's fair, Steve. I guess what I was asking more was sort of on an aggregate or consolidated basis as opposed -- I mean, the same store numbers were clearly strong from the acute and the behavioral standpoint. The pull through wasn't there from a total margin perspective, so I'm just trying to reconcile and I know the Reno piece, the Reno health plan probably, to your point earlier, dragged it down. I guess I was just wondering, are there other corporate overhead or other costs that sort of didn't allow you to show through better on the sort of consolidated margin line, not on the same store? Credit Suisse : No, that's fair, Steve. I guess what I was asking more was sort of on an aggregate or consolidated basis as opposed -- I mean, the same store numbers were clearly strong from the acute and the behavioral standpoint. The pull through wasn't there from a total margin perspective, so I'm just trying to reconcile and I know the Reno piece, the Reno health plan probably, to your point earlier, dragged it down. I guess I was just wondering, are there other corporate overhead or other costs that sort of didn't allow you to show through better on the sort of consolidated margin line, not on the same store? Steve Filton : No. And I don't think there are Ralph, I mean, nothing of any material amount. Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse : And then I guess on the behavioral side, you showed sort of continued momentum and strength in the revenue there, driven by the volume side. Any thoughts on sort of drivers of that? Are we starting to see -- do you think we're starting to see some parity benefits take hold or you think it's still too early on that front and then maybe how you expect that to play out in 2015? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, the pace of revenue growth has picked up in behavioral as the year has gone on. I think we were in the sort of 3.5% range of revenue growth in Q1 and then a little under 6 in Q2 and a little over 6 in Q3. And again, in much the same way and maybe even a little bit more so, it's difficult I think for us to precisely identify either in ACA or a mental health parity impact in the behavioral space. But I think the sense in Q3 was that maybe we started to get a little bit of benefit, not terribly material, but a little bit of benefit from one or both of those dynamics. Certainly, I think we had entered the year with a notion that our behavioral business would grow by about 4.5% - 5% same store revenue, so we've done a little bit better than that in the last two quarters. And I think there's a general inclination to believe that a little bit of that is coming from reform/parity. Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. All right. Great. And then just my last one. Did you have any headwind from Texas Medicaid waiver cuts or I guess the deferral around that? Steve Filton : So, I mean, I think that question is prompted by the HCA announcement that they had sort of two, I'll call it non-recurring revenue items or will have in the quarter, one is they recognized their RAC settlement in the third quarter. We did not do that. We will recognize it in the fourth quarter when we receive the settlement or sign the settlement, that number is not terribly material. I think it's probably in the $5 million or maybe a little bit lower range. And then HCA announced that it was reversing either some or all of its Texas uncompensated care revenue. We did not do that in part because, we are not in the same counties that CMS targeted with their deferrals. So, we are not in any of those same counties and so we continue to record our Texas uncompensated care revenue at the same rates that we have then. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Whit Mayo - Robert Baird :  Hey thanks, good morning. Just first question is really just on Cygnet just meaningful impact on your tax rate looking out over the next year and how do you think -- or how should we think about the growth opportunities in the UK and what's similar and dissimilar versus the U.S. market? Steve Filton :  Sure. So, from a tax rate perspective Whit, the UK effective tax rate is much closer to 20% than the high 30s that we incur here in U.S., and we should continue to enjoy that lower tax rate as long as we don't repatriate those moneys or effectively bring them back to the U.S. So, I think in the short and intermediate term, the expectation is that on those Cygnet earnings we will enjoy a lower effective tax rate. As far as the growth opportunities, I think when we announced the deal we articulated the notion that I think one of the things that drove us to enter the UK was the opportunity to grow in ways that may be coming a little more difficult in the U.S. We've got a bunch of facilities now in the UK, 18 facilities that are mostly operating at very high occupancy rate so, we have the same sort of organic capacity expansion opportunities that we have here in the U.S. I think, we also have the opportunity to acquire other facilities in the UK and while we have those same opportunities here in the U.S., the opportunity to do that in a big way in the U.S. is certainly becoming more limited, and also we're restrained because we have such a significant footprint with our behavioral facilities here in the U.S. that in many markets and with many acquisition opportunities we are limited by some FTC and similar restrictions that obviously we don't have in the UK. So, we're very excited about the opportunity not only as I articulated in my comments to have acquired this very well run behavioral business in the UK but, to have also acquired a platform that I think, will allow us some of the robust growth in the UK that we've enjoyed here in the U.S. over the last few years. Whit Mayo - Robert Baird :  Is there a range for kind of organic revenue growth and maybe inorganic revenue growth that you think is reasonably achievable out over the next two to three years? Steve Filton :  I mean again I think, in terms of the inorganic or the M&A activity, we've always been of the mind that we never really try and frame that or guide to it because, I think we always had the view that we're going to be opportunistic about those opportunities. If there are compelling opportunities to earn an above market return then we're going to pursue those aggressively. And frankly if there are not, then you know we'll be judicious about it. As far as the organic growth I mean I think, that our activities here in the U.S. where we were adding something like 3% to 5% on the incremental bid base here in the U.S. that we've been doing for seven years or eight years, I think that's probably not an unrealistic way to think about what we might be able to do in the UK. Whit Mayo - Robert Baird :  Okay and my math might be off a little bit but Temecula looks like it's probably off to pretty good start, looks like the third quarter revenues may have in fact, doubled over the second quarter and it does appear to be EBITDA positive. So, just any update on that hospital, how it's trended with your expectations? Steve Filton :  Yes. So, I don't have those numbers right in front of me Whit so I'm unable to confirm what you're speculating, but I will say that in general, which I have said on our previous calls, our California results have really been very positive this year. And we tend to look at the overall what I'll call the overall Riverside County market that Temecula is part of. And certainly that has exceeded our expectations. Temecula itself as we expected, kind of ramping up and again, not -- I don't have it right in front of me but, I think it may be a little bit short of our internal expectations although, as I said, I think the overall market is clearly ahead of our expectations. Whit Mayo - Robert Baird :  Got it and one last one just on buybacks and I know it's less than a formality to extend or increase your authorization but, how do you think we should be thinking about the pace of buybacks over the next 6 to 12 months? Thanks. Steve Filton :  Sure well I mean, I want to put it in the context when we announced the buyback in late July, we did so with the notion that we really felt our leverage levels were as really as low as we wanted or needed them to be and certainly didn't intend for them to get much lower than they were at that time. Now at that time, we were not at all certain that we were going to do the Cygnet deal. Obviously, two months after the announcement of the share buyback, we deployed $327 million of capital to acquire Cygnet. So, in that sense I think we had some capital deployment that we were not anticipating. And so I think our basic approach to share repurchase will be much like we articulated at the time and that is we view share repurchase as another opportunity for us to deploy capital. And we will compare that to the attractiveness of both organic and inorganic opportunities we have, and we'll continue to make that judgment as we move along. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Raskin - Barclays: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question just on the behavioral side. The revenue per adjusted admission trends to have obviously been sort of zero-ish numbers for a pretty long time. I guess are we getting to a point where length of stay and some of the other impacts there are going to start turning at some point? I mean, obviously, the revenue growth has been very strong on the behavioral, but just curious on the revenue per adjusted admission. Steve Filton : Yeah, Josh. I mean, I think that we've been facing this length of stay challenge for some time. And while I think it is reasonable and rationale to expect that at some point it will level off, we quite frankly and, I'll say, I, personally haven't been very good at predicting when that will be. So I think it while we took the approach that we took this year is we're going to assume that length of stay continues to decline at sort of this 3% to 4% rate that it has been, until we really see some evidence over the course of a couple of quarters at least that that's not the case and it really has leveled off. To be fair, I just don't think we're there yet, although certainly at some point we think we will see that. I think you sort of described of behavioral dynamic pretty well in the sense that we're seeing a very steady reliable revenue growth and volume growth and we've seen that for a while. I think the real upside as you suggest at least to some degree in the behavioral business occurs when either that length of stay levels off which we assume will happen at some point, and, or we start to get the benefit from reform and/or parity. And as I suggested in some my earlier comments, maybe we started to get a little bit of that in Q3. But I think we feel like and have always felt more like we would start to see a more measurable benefit in 2015and beyond. Joshua Raskin - Barclays:  That makes sense. And then just last question on the fourth quarter, I know you guys are confirming the guidance which obviously is a wide range. But anything, we should think of as unusual from either of seasonality or a sequential change in the fourth quarter that would be atypical relative to what we've seen in the past for the fourth quarter? Steve Filton : No. I mean, obviously, the normal seasonality should be present but other than that no, I don't think there's anything that we know of that people should be thinking about in terms of their expectations for the fourth quarter. Joshua Raskin - Barclays: Okay, unless California provider or something like that happens. Steve Filton : Right, right. That would be obviously something we're not anticipating at the moment. Operator :   Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice - UBS: Hi, everyone. Maybe just a couple of quick ones here. When you think about looking ahead to 2015 and ongoing reform benefit, obviously there's some discussion about potential states expanding. I don't know if you have any particular view on states that if they expand, that would be particularly helpful to you that are likely to expand. I guess also, though, there's clearly the exchange population, and there'll be some natural growth there. But I'm also curious. So we've got some new some of the managed care guys are going to be more aggressive next year. Is there anything you're doing in terms of new contracting, recontracting, approaching that business that's worth noting in terms of 2015 and its potential benefit to you? Steve Filton : Sure, A.J. So, as far as the expansion \u2013 further Medicaid expansion goes, I mean, the two states that are significant to us that have not yet expanded are Florida and Texas. I'm not sure that my commentary on those states is any more valuable than anyone else's. I think they're big states and people are following the developments there. I don't think either of those states is about to imminently expand Medicaid. So, we will follow that along with everybody else. But those are clearly the two states that continue to or would make a difference for us if they did expand. As far as next year goes on exchange enrollment, I don't know that we're seeing a whole lot of new developments. I think we anticipated that maybe we would see a greater move to narrower networks next year. I don't know that we are seeing that. I think like all other providers, we are having sort of developing conversations with our managed care providers about changes in contracts to move to, to move away from fee for service reimbursement and to some sort of fee for value proposition, but I think those developments continue to be relatively slow developing and I don't think our anticipation is that in 2015, we will have a significant amount of our reimbursement that will be sort of new or different from our traditional fee for service. A.J. Rice - UBS: Okay. And I know we've talked around some of the growth opportunities in the UK with Cygnet deal. I think one of the things that\u2019s been thrown out is that there are other properties held by the private equity, held by different private equity groups and that there might be opportunities down the road for bigger transactions as well. In your thinking about that, would you say, hey we've got to run Cygnet for a while, get comfortable with market or if one of those bigger transactions came along fairly quickly would you guys be comfortable feel like you have enough of understanding of the market to go for that? Steve Filton :  You know A.J., I think our experience is opportunities present themselves when they present themselves so, I think ideally I would, sort of echo the position that you just articulated. We'd certainly like to be able to run Cygnet for a while, get used to the new market. But on the other hand we're very comfortable with the experienced management team that we have in place there, and so I will tell you that we're evaluating opportunities as they're arising in the UK. And we'll continue to do so. So, I don't think we will be limited by sort of an absolute prescription that we have to wait. I think, we're going to try and do what we think is right for that investment there in the UK. A.J. Rice - UBS:  Okay, all right, thanks a lot. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. Ana Gupte - Leerink:  Yeah thanks, good morning. Just wanted to follow up Steve on the comments or the attribution on payor mix. I think, you said two-thirds is Medicaid, one-third is exchanges is that -- and have you been able to see any difference between the exchange membership that came onboard in April and May which was more late enrollment probably lower acuity any observations there? Steve Filton :  So, I think I would say two things, Ana. I mean my two-thirds one-third comment I think, it was a year-to-date comment. I think that earlier in the year in the first quarter, it was really more heavily weighted to Medicaid and then in the second and third quarters it began to swing with a little bit less weight towards Medicaid and more to commercial as the commercial enrollment increased. And again, I suspect that dynamic continues into Q4. As far as acuity and I know others have commented a little bit differently but, I think for the most part we feel like the acuity of our newly enrolled ACA patients whether they be Medicaid or commercial patients has been largely reflective of our existing insured population and not terribly different. Ana Gupte - Leerink:  And have you been able to distinguish you know -- with your systems can you tell us if it's a commercial life or if it's an exchange life at this point? Steve Filton :  Ana, I think from the beginning we've said that, I think in some cases we feel we can do that very precisely and in others it is not so clear, and which is I think why whenever we've given ACA impact estimates, we've given a fairly broad range because it is not always absolutely identifiable and easily and objectively identifiable. Ana Gupte - Leerink:  Okay one last question. It sounds like the exchange rates are looking still pretty good and the contracts are fairly long-term. Have you had any data so far to see whether collectability of deductibles now might be an issue and put some pressure on the margin? Steve Filton : I think that our accounting has anticipated the idea that the collectability of coachers and deductibles on those exchange plans might be less than what we have experienced historically, I don't know so, I think our accounting has been appropriately conservative in that regard. I don't know that we have enough actual experience to really make that statement definitively however. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna:  Hi good morning. I got in here a little bit late so, I apologize if this was asked. But, I know you talked about Reno in a little more detail relative to what was in the second quarter 10-Q. It looks like the capital being allocated there is coming in a little bit more significant than what I would've expected and so, would just love some sort of qualitative -- a better qualitative understanding as to the strategic rational there. Is it entirely due to market dynamics, capitation or something like that or is this sort of a beta test for something that could become more significant in the future? Steve Filton :  Yes so and we did [indiscernible] about a little bit, Chris so I'll be brief but, I think that it is really more of the latter. First of all, it is not really at all specific to the Reno market, that just happens to be where the plan is located. I think it's really to give us the capability as we think about this sort of integrated healthcare delivery system of the future with closer relationships with physicians and other long term care niche providers and I think the ability in some markets to be able to offer an insurance product maybe a Medicare Advantage insurance product. We think it's just a worthwhile capability to have, that's what really drove the desire to have this what I'll call insurance infrastructure or platform. Chris Rigg - Susquehanna:  Okay and then just on the comments on leverage I mean, what is sort of the internal target these days or what's sort of the level you'd like to be at going forward? Steve Filton :  [Indiscernible] we have a very specific target. I think if you sort of look at our history here, we were comfortable levering up to do the PSI deal to a little bit over 4 times debt to EBITDA, that was obviously an extremely attractive and perhaps a fairly unique deal. On the other hand then, when we levered back-down to into close to the low-2s, I think we clearly felt that was about as low as we wanted or needed to go. So, certainly, within that range and I appreciate the fact that it's a fairly broad range, but we're certainly comfortable operating within that range. And again, we'll operate within that range and be responsive to compelling opportunities as they arise. Operator :   There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks? Steve Filton : No. I just want to thank everybody for their time, and I look forward to speaking again next quarter. Operator :   This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services Fourth Quarter 2014 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead sir. Steve Filton : Good morning thank you. Alan Miller our CEO is also joining us this morning, welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. During this call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements.  For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the Company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $5.42 for the year and a $1.71 for the quarter. After adjusting for a reduction in malpractice reserves relating to prior years and the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was $1.51. On a same facility basis revenues on our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increase 6.8% and 2.8% respectively during the fourth quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.2% during the fourth quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter. We define operating margins as operating income and net revenues, less salaries, wages and benefits other operating expenses and supplies expense divided by net revenues. Our operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased slightly to 28.0% during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior year period. On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 14.9% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted emissions increased 5.5% while revenue per adjusted emission increased 8.8%. On a same facility basis operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 18.1% during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 14.1% during the fourth quarter of 2013. Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $346 million during the fourth quarter of 2014, as compared to $308 million during the fourth quarter of 2013. Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $1.04 billion during the fall of 2014 as compared to $884 million during 2013. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 56 days during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 57 days during the fourth quarter of 2013. At December 31, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 47%. During 2014, we opened a total of 602 new behavioral health beds including 162 beds opened at two de novo hospitals and 440 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. In addition, we already have approved projects to add approximately 550 new behavioral health beds and convert approximately 50 beds from residential treatment center to acute during 2015 and that number could grow as we continue to pursue opportunities to add and convert additional beds. We spent $82 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2014 and $391 million during the full year of 2014. During 2015, we expect to spend approximately $375 million to $400 million in capital expenditures which includes expenditures for capital equipment renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities. In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter we repurchased 321,500 shares of our stock at an average price of slightly less than $102 per share. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015 is $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share. The guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.12 per diluted share of EHR expected EHR impact expected during 2015 as described in our press release last night. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 6% to 13% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $5.78 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014 as calculated on the supplemental schedule including last night's press release. During 2015, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over our 2014 net revenues. Included in our estimated 2015 at revenue, our revenues associated with the previously announced acquisition of Cygnet Healthcare in the UK and a health insurance company in Nevada. In addition, during the fourth quarter we acquired a 46 bed behavioral health hospital located near Taunton in the United Kingdom. Now I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Raskin : Yes, hi. Thanks. Steve, just wanted to dig in on the 14.8% growth on the acute care same store and maybe get a little bit better sense on the revenue per adjusted admission up 8.8%, maybe any specific markets or any other commentary that can point to that strength? Steve Filton : Sure, first I think there are a couple of sort of extraordinary things in the quarter, we called out the $11 million Texas disrupt in the press release we also have spoken before about $4 million California UPL that I know some of our peers have recognized as well in the fourth quarter, so if you adjust those things out it probably brings the revenue growth down by couple of 100 basis points still by any measure a very strong and robust revenue growth quarter. Our admission growth seemed to be fairly consistent with our peers who reported similar strong volumes what seems to distinguish the UHS performance in the quarter was at really robust revenue intensity and revenue per unit per admission or per day. I think a lot of that Joshua was driven by strong surgical volumes we had both in and out patients surgical volume growth of approximately5% and for the first time I can remember a long time the inpatient growth actually was outpacing the outpatients. So I think that\u2019s why really drove some of the revenue intensity. Joshua Raskin : And no specific market Steve that jump out? Steve Filton : No I think honestly Joshua when you get a performance that strong, it\u2019s got be pretty sort of pervasive throughout the portfolio and I think our as was. Joshua Raskin : That makes sense. And just last one 15, any sense of the impact of reform that you\u2019ve baked in to the guidance, I know there is no sort of medicated expansion state, so just curious there is got to be some anniversary et cetera, is there a way to quantify the positive benefit in 15? Steve Filton : Yes, I am going preface my answer with first saying but I think as time elapses and each quarter goes by, we find it a little more challenging to be able to discretely identify the reform impact from other sort of pair mix improvements and kind of specifically sort of the general economic improvement we\u2019ve been enjoying in our markets. I will say however that I think our best estimate is that we\u2019ve got and I think again this is fairly consistent with what I understand some of our peers have said, but I think in the acute care division we assume that the ACA impact in 2015 will be able about 6% to 7% of our overall earnings and that\u2019s I think a little bit of increase over 2014. Joshua Raskin : Okay and behavioral still sticking with same impact as you saw this year? Steve Filton : Yes I mean I think behavioral we\u2019ve mentioned before that we find it difficult to discretely identify the ACA and I\u2019ll also include in that the mental health parity impact in the behavioral divisions so that we have not really discretely budgeted or guided for that to the degree that we enjoyed a little bit of that in 14 which I think is possible. We certainly sort of included that in the base and the growth of our base but have not really included as we have in the acute care division a specific impact for either ACA or parity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Chris Rigg : Good morning. I was just the leverage at this point is down to about 2 times. You've got some internal stuff going on with regard to development but I guess just more generally how are you thinking about capital deployment at this point, share repurchases, more M&A, etc.? Just trying to get a sense and where are you comfortable at 2 times or do you want -- you actually want to see that go a little higher at this point? Thanks. Steve Filton : Chris, I am going to largely I think reiterate the comments that we made at the end of the second quarter when we talked about the fact that our leverage had declined to a level that we were very comfortable with and that\u2019s when we announced our $400 million share repurchase authorization. And I think we\u2019re in largely the same place we were there now obviously since then we announced the Cygnet acquisition and dedicated about $335 million to that, but we continue to look for growth opportunities both externally and internally in both of our business segments. We announced just in the call, a small acquisition in the UK. We continue to look for other opportunities in the UK as well as other M&A opportunities in both behavioral and acute here in the U.S. and also continue to expand organically I mentioned that new behavioral beds that we\u2019ve got online for next. We talked about our new acute care hospital that we\u2019re building in Las Vegas, so we\u2019ve got a number of things going on but I think we\u2019ve also said that if we don\u2019t find sufficient sort of opportunities for external growth were also more than happy to continue to repurchase shares under the previously announced authorization. So I think from our perspective we're likely to pursue sort of all those avenues in 2015. Chris Rigg : Okay and then just one follow-up. I know we've talked about the IMD exclusion and legislation around that in the past. Can you give us an update for where that stands and just some general parameters in terms of likelihood for this happening sometime in the near future? Thanks. Alan Miller : So I think that we certainly have done nothing to presume that the IMD exclusion will be lifted in the near-term certainly at least in the context of this conversation the near-term being 2015. But I think the industry in general is becoming more and more positive about the idea that from a public policy perspective that either legislatively or administratively there will be progress on this issue. As you know there is a demonstration project that's part of the Affordable Care Act that lifts the IMD exclusion and about a dozen states and we're participating in some of those states in that project. We believe that the outcome and the data from that demo project will support the idea that a broader lifting of the exclusion makes sense from a public policy perspective in terms of access and cost. And again as an industry we continue to lobby hard for that and that remains one of our main priorities again from a legislative/regulatory perspective. So we'll continue to work for, we continue to feel that there is positive movement there but I think it's difficult to predict with any sort of level of precision when there might be a substantive change. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc. Jason Gurda : Good morning, thanks. Steve, just taking a look at the guidance you're expecting growth of about 6% to 13% and I think you did high 20%s this year and you're putting up almost double-digit revenue growth or particularly double-digit in the acute care side. Is the guidance conservative at this point? Steve Filton : Obviously I am going to tell you that I think the guidance is realistic. I will say this, I mean our performance in 2014 was really extraordinary and then we certainly view at that way and couldn't be any more pleased with it. But certainly feel it will be difficult to replicate as you sort of suggest the sort of growth that we saw in 2014. Think a good portion or a good reason for that is while we were all meaning the company as well as our peers were focused on the potential ACA impact in '14 and I think we largely anticipated that correctly. We didn't really anticipate the benefit we were going to get from improving economies in a number of our other markets, particularly in Texas but also in Florida and California, et cetera. And I think as we looked towards next year we are cautious about again our ability to replicate that same level of growth. I think we feel like we'll continue to see improving economies in those markets for the most part. Now I will also add that I think in the last month or two we've gotten a little bit more cautious about the Texas economies specifically given the pressures from oil and gas prices. I think we've step back our projections in those markets particularly. But other than that again I just think we're forecasting strong performance in '15 just not quite as robust as we saw in '14. Jason Gurda : Thanks, that's helpful. Then I may have this wrong but it looks to me that the range of your guidance is a little bit wider than it has been in the past. If that's the case is there a reason for that? Steve Filton : No, honestly we felt like the range was fairly consistent, I mean made a little bit wider than what we had last year but fairly consistent with sort of the ranges that our peers were putting up and there was nothing necessarily be read into it. I think we actually think it's a reasonable range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Steve Baxter : Hi, this is Steve Baxter on for Kevin. Many of your peers have talked about how their exchange contracting strategy has evolved for 2015 relative to the 2014. I guess could you give us a sense of the flavor of what you learned from your 2014 approach and what you've done differently for 2015? Thanks. Steve Filton : I think in our case Steve we have said and largely reflective of our experience that we were participating in almost all of the exchange products in our markets in 2014 with the couple of maybe minor exceptions. And honestly I think for the most part that's our experience in '15 again, I think that we're pleased with that. We continue to work with some payers in our markets in the context of potentially more narrow networks in which we would be a preferred provider and again I think we have a couple of minor examples of that in '15 but not as much of maybe we anticipated we would had last year. So I think again the broad description of it is that we are in virtually every product and every network every exchange product and every exchange network in all of our markets which is the couple of very my receptions. Steve Baxter : Okay, thank you. Then just switching to the behavioral side, length of stay was down less than it has been for a long time. Do you think you're getting closer to stabilization or a turning point here and I guess how are you thinking about that for 2015? Thanks. Steve Filton : I\u2019ll answer the first part first or the last part first and that is and thinking about for 2015, I think we\u2019ve assumed another decline in length of stay at about the same rate that it has been going down and I think the reason for that is it\u2019s been difficult to sort of project this quarter to quarter, some quarters it looks the decline is slowing a little bit other quarters not so much, so we continue to project that let those length of stay pressure will continue into 15 that\u2019s what our guidance reflects. I will say that I certainly noticed in the fourth quarter that some of the decline is length of stay that we experienced was self imposed or self executed if you in the sense that I mentioned to some degree the conversion of residential beds to acute and we\u2019ve been doing that for a while into the degree that we continue to do that. We will drive the length of stay down our self was because the length of stay in our acute facility is lower than it is in our residential facility. But I do think that\u2019s reflected in that stronger revenue per day that you saw in the fourth quarter because obviously as we shift beds and therefore days in admissions from residential to acute we\u2019ll see a drop in length of day but we ought to see a rise in revenue per day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Paula Torch : Steve I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on your expectations for 2015 on maybe the safe facility revenue and volume expectations by segment, can you help us or pass that up for us? Steve Filton : Okay, great, thank you, Steve, for that color. I just have one quick last one on Medicaid expansion. I was just wondering if you could share some of your thoughts with us on the potential for more states to expand, in particular Florida, just given Tennessee and Utah reaching dead ends or so it seems for now. What does that mean for Florida if anything and maybe some of your thoughts there? Thanks. Alan Miller : Sure Paula, I think on the acute side our expectation of revenue growth is probably in that 6% to 7% range which I think in turn yield EBITDA growth and probably be 8% to 10% range. On the behavioral side, I think that\u2019s a little bit lower and probably more in the range of 5% and 5.5% on the revenue side which translates to 7.5% to 8% on the EBITDA side. Paula Torch : Okay, great. Thank you very much for that color. Then just going back to the acute metrics, how sustainable do you think these trends are in the first quarter in 2015 given the guidance that you just gave us? Is there anything about the surgical volumes that were so good in the fourth quarter that would indicate those would continue to be strong? Steve Filton : I think the way that we went about budgeting for 2015 was really not to assume that anyone quarter the year was particularly representative and particularly I think not necessarily taken the approach that the fourth quarter exit rate was the rate to use for the full year 15. We had a couple of very strong surgical volume quarters in 14. The second quarter was really strong. The fourth quarter was really strong. I think even in retrospect it\u2019s a little bit difficult for us to identify exactly why that was, so I will say that I think the 2015 guidance presumes a more modest sort to surgical experience that when we experienced early in Q4 and something that\u2019s more reflective of our full year experience. And to the fair I think the year has started off at least in January with kind of more muted surgical volume and there is a lot of at least speculation in the back half of 14 that there is -- so hospitals to some degree would experience a surgeon volume at the end of the year given the increasing prevalence of high deductable plans and that really might influence patient behavior as people exhausted their co-pays and deductibles late in the year and would take advantage of that. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what really drove the dynamic that we experienced but we certainly has a real strong surgical quarter in Q4 and a little bit weaker as 2015 started, so we at least not inconsistent with that theory. So again I think we just been more kind of rationale or muted about what our 2015 volume should look and I think that what\u2019s reflected in the guidance. Paula Torch : Okay, great, thank you, Steve, for that color. I just have one quick last one on Medicaid expansion. I was just wondering if you could share some of your thoughts with us on the potential for more states to expand, in particular Florida, just given Tennessee and Utah reaching dead ends or so it seems for now. What does that mean for Florida if anything and maybe some of your thoughts there? Thanks. Steve Filton : Well again I\u2019ll sort of give the short answer is we certainly have not assumed that any new states new for us would expand Medicaid in 2015 which again for UHS I think really means that we have assumed neither Texas nor Florida would expand in 2015. I think we have had a view really from the beginning of ACA implementation that in the long run all states would ultimately participate in Medicaid expansion because it\u2019s just made economic sense for them to do so. Obviously I think in the lot of cases economic sense is being overwhelmed or pressured by political considerations and I think we find those very hard to sort of measure and calculate. So we continue again in our state hospital associations and other forums to work for expansion in those states and then which we operate that have not have not expanded yet. Again don't expect anything necessarily to happen in '15 as you suggest there has been a kind of a struggle in a couple of the states that have tried it. So we just continue to press the issue. Again as an industry especially with both our profit and especially not profit peers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. The quarterly progression was pretty lumpy in 2014. I know you don't give quarterly guidance but any general direction on how you'd expect or see it playing out in 2015? Steve Filton : Ralph frankly part -- one of the reasons why we don't give quarterly guidance as we think it's difficult to do, and I appreciate the fact that folks in your position are forced to do so. I suggest that before you have alluded to the fact that we had as you describe some lumpiness in 2014. Honestly we were unable to predict that. I guess the best advice that I would give to people is to budget 2015 or think about 2015 a bit more ratably and not necessarily try and mimic the sort of seasonal or quarterly trends that we experienced in 2014. Because I think in our own minds it's not obvious that those trends would be repeated in that same fashion in '15. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, that's fair. And then you've obviously talked about acuity in surgical mix. Can you talk a little bit about payer mix and what you saw there between the various buckets? Steve Filton : Yes I think we basically fell like our payer mix strength which of course I think at the end of the day was really what drove the outsize performance of particularly of the acute division in 2014 really was relatively stable throughout the year. Now the character of it changed some in the sense that in the beginning of the year the payer mix improvement was clearly more weighted to Medicaid, more Medicaid patients and managed Medicaid patients and I think was a function of Medicaid expansion in some of our large states like Nevada, like California and the District of Columbia. And then in the back half of the year we saw a bit more of a ship from the Medicaid impact of the commercial exchange impact. But just generally I think the payer mix was the payer mix improvement was really a constant for us in 2014. And as I said generally the biggest and primary driver of the really strong performance. And again I think as we answered -- answer your question before about the guidance, I think we expect that that payer mix improvement continues into 2015 and our guidance reflects that, but that is does not necessarily continue at the same rate. And certainly one of the sort of muting dynamics that we is that we don't have any new states as we just talked about that we'll participate in Medicaid expansion next year. So to some degree the Medicaid improvement certainly levels off pretty considerably in '15. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. And then one more if I could, I think charity and discounts were up in the fourth quarter. Just trying to understand a little bit the dynamics around that, why that would maybe be the case, and what if anything you're doing as patients present to get them signed up? Steve Filton : I think that, I'll answer the question a couple of different ways. And I think that in terms of signing patients up like many I would probably speculate most of our peers. We've developed a pretty rigorous process to make sure that we have certified counselors in all of our facilities and that we're both proactively and reactively responding to patients who come to our facilities uninsured and trying to find the most effective and efficient way to get them insured whether that's enrollment in Medicaid or through the commercial exchange opportunity, we're doing all of those things. Now at the end of the day I think as said most hospitals are probably building something similar. As far as the swings in charity and the debt I know I am sound like a broken record when I say this. But we find it difficult even internally to explain some of the specifics movements between those buckets. And I always make the point that as a company we analyze uncompensated sort of single unified bucket, and we include bad debt and uninsured discount. And again I think if you look at those numbers on a combined basis, it reinforces the comment that I made before which is there has been a significant decline in those numbers in 2014 throughout the year and it's reflective of the ACA and improving economic dynamics that we've already talked about. Ralph Giacobbe : That's fair, Steve. I guess from my perspective I'm just trying to understand the dynamic of when you offer the charity care there's no pressure on the individual to have to pay for it. So I guess my thought process was why wouldn't there be more of a push to bad debt even if you have to write it off the pressure on the individual would ultimately then perhaps force them to consider getting on the roles via either exchanges and/or Medicaid versus just writing it off right up front. Am I not thinking about that right? Or would there be an initiative by -- because I think in the past you've talked about letting each of the individual hospitals determine that. Would that make sense in terms of trying to even push that number lower? Steve Filton : I think the balance that we and all hospitals walk is trying to reasonable about what is a reasonable level of income and assets poor patient to quality for charity cares, so somebody comes in the hospital with no health insurance and a very low income level and no assets and the general decision is made based on those criteria that there really is no point in making an effort to collect from those patients. I think your question is what don\u2019t you try and collect from as many patients as you possibly can and I would answer in two ways I mean I that one from sort of just public policy perspective we recognized that for people at a very low income level with little assets, it really is just too much of a burden for them to pay some of these bills and then secondly I think from a business perspective it\u2019s an effort that we have found can consume a fair amount of time and money and really yield very little, so again we try and have a charity policy that I think is fairly consistent with the industry that tries to walk that line and collect from people who really can\u2019t afford to pay but really doesn\u2019t try and collect from that portion of the population that really can\u2019t. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte : Yes, thanks, good morning. Steve I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments I thought I've heard from you recently on the state Medicaid budgets and pressures in 2015. Just kind of giving us color on why you might be concerned and are you baking in anything in guidance that might not have happened or are these already events underway? Steve Filton : So Ana I think that the comments that you\u2019re alluding to our comments that I made consistent with what I\u2019ve said earlier in the call that over the last couple of months we have backed off our projections and guidance for our Texas markets and to be fair I don\u2019t think we've seen currently a lot of softness in those market but are just anticipating the possibility of such given the fact that the Texas economy seems to be slowing and again we could see that softness in the number of ways through slightly deteriorating payer mix or slightly lower volumes or through some pressure from either in traditional Medicaid rates or some of the special reimbursement program that we benefit from and so those of the comments you\u2019re thinking about. So in general we didn\u2019t make any specific cuts or assume specific cuts in Texas reimbursement, but just sort of steps back or Texas earnings projects for next year a little bit and on a broad basis in expectation that we might feel some pressure in that economy in 2015 that we clearly did not feel in 14. Ana Gupte : Okay. So it sounds like it's more a second order aspect that could happen at the state level rather than just currently insured consumers? Steve Filton : I think that\u2019s right and also I think it\u2019s current because I mean the fact in the matter is that our Texas markets are really tend not be markets that are directly tie to the oil and gas industry markets like Dallas or West Texas. We tend to be in markets that are sort of more indirectly impacted by the overall Texas economy. Ana Gupte : Then just switching gears to the March 4 hearings in SCOTUS as per your recent discussions with the lobby groups and with Congress and the state officials, what are you expecting or hearing in terms of if this thing gets subsidies get caught off what might happen and who might take the lead in addressing this? Steve Filton : Yes so first of all obviously I mean while we follow this closely as to all of you, we certainly don\u2019t feel like we have any particularly valuable insight into the how this might turnout and so we\u2019re just continued to follow it very closely. If the Supreme Court were to rule against the subsidies, we would certainly work very hard in the various states that we operate in that they don\u2019t state exchange at the moment to get them established but again I think that at least in the short run we acknowledge that would be sort of a difficult hurdle to overcome. So obviously we\u2019ve done nothing in our guidance as I don\u2019t think any of our peers have to reflect the Supreme Court decision if it were to be unfavorable, our guidance presumes status quo, but if decision is in a negative one from our perspective we\u2019ll just work very aggressively with our state associations to try and accomplish the source of works around that people have identified and written about it. And I\u2019ll make the obvious comment here that I think as a company we are less exposed to this than our peers since two thirds of our earnings come from the behavioral business where I think we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve got a much of ACA benefit and therefore really not exposed if this would be a bit of headwind into 2015 or maybe beyond. Ana Gupte : And this 1% you think is an appropriate estimate for exposure, 1%-ish or less? Steve Filton : I think a number of those sell side estimates have been that are the amount of our overall earnings that are subject to states that have just federal exchanges or maybe 1% to 2% and I think that number tends to be lower for us than for our peers again because it's really just specific to the acute care business. But I think that's a pretty accurate guesstimate of what that impact would be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Josh Kalenderian : This is actually Josh in for Darren. Can you just first talk about your UK pipeline and if you're seeing much over there market? Steve Filton : I think that the UK acquisition landscape is in some respect only what is like here in the U.S. it's fairly fragmented, we obviously as I said just in my prepared remarks announced a small deal of kind of one off acquisition, we're perusing de novo development project right now in the UK and I think pursuing kind of a hole array of other potential possibilities. I think we described when we announced the Signet deal that we thought this was a landscape that was right for continued expansion and was sort of one of the motivations for getting into that markets. So our view of that has not really changed, I mean we've been enthusiastic about the early results from the existing facilities that we bought in the UK and remain enthusiastic about the growth opportunities as well, which I think will be both sort of again organic, inorganic, some small over time maybe some large. Josh Kalenderian : And then just in terms of your guidance, can you maybe talk about some of the bigger swing factor that either gets you to the high end low end of that and maybe the level of capital deployment you guys are assuming. Steve Filton : So from a capital deployment perspective we've assumed as we said in our press release and I said it in my remarks somewhere between $375 million and $400 million of CapEx and that's fairly similar to this year's experience. We have historically never included share repurchase assumptions in our guidance and we have not done so this year as well. as far as other sort of pushes and pulls if you will, I think we've already talked about a couple, from a special reimbursements perspective and we include in that sort of broad category -- char there is DSRIP funding in Texas, finding in taxes, provider tax and UPL arrangements. I think overall that reimbursement decline. So little bit in 2015 maybe $5 million or $10 million. I think that we have some dilution in; I assume dilution is probably not the right word. But we had a big improvement in our to market in '14 that facility opened in late in '13 we had a fair amount of startup costs and start up losses and now this year we've been profitable. And so as a consequence that was a big swing, we'll continue to improve in that Temecula market but the improvement in '15 just is not going to be as greater as it was in '14, so depending on how you think about that's a little bit of headwind. I think those are the only couple of things that I think we have not mentioned yet, but I would call out otherwise I think it's largely kind of steady as it goes other than sort of what we already talked about where I think we've just been a little bit more muted in how much payer mix improvement we can expect in '15 versus what were able to achieve in '14. Josh Kalenderian : All right, great, thanks a lot. Then just lastly it just looks like from the 10-K there was some additional developments in terms of your ongoing investigation. So maybe can you just provide us with an update on what's going on there and if there's anything new? Steve Filton : I think that the only real change in our disclosure in the 10-K was the added disclosure that we had received a request from the government from information for a one, incremental facility in Salt Lake City. Other than that I would just sort of broadly say that the investigation continues, we have had some preliminary conversations with the government but I think it's fair to say for anyone who in hospital and I think most hospitals have encountered some version of this process that it takes a long time and I think we would say we're in the early stages and it would be difficult for us to either project with any precision the ultimate resolution and outcome or even the timing of such. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One of your peers noted some uncertainty regarding Texas uncompensated care payments. Can you maybe discuss if you've got any uncertainty or range of variability around those payments? Steve Filton : So I think Gary I hope that what you're referencing is HCA has some of these waiver programs and they had originally reserved for some of those payments when CMS had sort of targeted the earlier in the year and then when CMS sort of lifted there, their deferral of payments, having recognized those payments et cetera. We really  had none of that back and forth because we were not -- we do not have program in any of the same counties that ACA did that had been sort of targeted by CMS, so I would say that for the most part we have assume that our again Texas special reimbursement which includes those program and DSH and DSRIP will continue next year pretty consistently again with the one caveat that in total and that includes all the states we operate that special reimbursement decline by $5 million or $10 million next year. Gary Lieberman : Okay, great. And then maybe be interested to get Alan's thoughts on the potential for a congressional fix maybe even ahead of a Supreme Court decision or if the government loses the SCOTUS case? Alan Miller : Yes I think that I would be very simple to have a fixed legislatively but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. If you\u2019re following what\u2019s happening with the Republican Party at the moment in all the meetings that\u2019s not going to happen, but that would be very simple, but the Government said that they have not developed the plan B which I can\u2019t believe. So there will be a number of works around. I think the thing to focus on is that 5 million people will lose insurance immediately and I think the public policy on both Democrats, Republicans, etc., that those people should be covered. So I think there will at some point a fixed for this -- should it come negatively from the Supreme Court. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Frank Morgan : Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple of random ones here. On your ED -- I'm just curious about ED volume growth, maybe with and without the flu impact in the quarter? Alan Miller : So Frank I am not exactly sure about the flu impact ED volumes, I think flu tends to impact ED volumes sort of disproportionally more than admission, I will say that I think our general sense of the flu impact on admission was probably no more than sort of 30 or 40 basis points. Frank Morgan : Okay. And what about just ED volumes in general? Do you have a number there? Steve Filton : The ED volumes were very strong and we definitely saw heighted ED activity as a result of flu but I think also we saw heighted activity just in general and again as I think our admission numbers reflect I mean it was a very strong volume quarter end. Generally admission growth tends to move in proportion to ED volumes and I think that was we experienced in Q4. Frank Morgan : And then secondly on surgical volumes, were there any particular areas where surgery was more strong, particularly on the inpatient side any particular type of procedure that you saw more volume? Alan Miller : No I think it was really kind of cross the various lines so that was not necessarily isolated to cardiology or orthopedics or even general surgery. It was really -- again as I think I mentioned or in response to a question before when you see this kind of strength I think it tends to be pretty broad based I think all to get to these kinds of numbers unless you have real broad based strength. Frank Morgan : And then finally are there any other developments that will be carrying a drag, a startup drag in 2015 that's built into your guidance? Thanks. Alan Miller : No I think I was trying in response to Joshua question before identified the couple of large sort of pushes unfold that I can think of, but other than I don\u2019t think there are other big headwinds and tailwinds that we have not yet identified. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Just a couple of questions if I could, I know you talked about -- you've talked around health reform on a couple of answers already but do you have a Q4 run rate of ACA benefit? I know it's maybe not precise but just in general can you break that out between what you think is the Medicaid benefit versus the exchange benefit? Alan Miller : So AJ, I think that we tried and again caveat this by saving that I think even more so than our peers I think we\u2019ve also described the process of discretely identifying the ACA benefit as less or more emphasize than maybe some people think it might be, but I would generally say our best efforts sort of quantify the ACA impact for 2014 at about $40 million or something like that and I think that the quarterly progression of that there has been somewhat of an increase as the year has gone on and as more and more enrollment has taken place in both Medicaid and commercial exchanges, but it hasn\u2019t been terribly dramatics so I would say if you think about that 40 million distributed throughout the year maybe we had 8 million in the first quarter and 12 million in the fourth quarter something like that just in terms of order of magnitude. A.J. Rice: Okay and then the split between exchange versus Medicaid? Alan Miller : Yes, I think as we mentioned earlier again for the year we\u2019ve think it\u2019s probably about two-third Medicaid related and one-third commercial and I think that shifted I mean that was even more pronounced early in the year and then it got a little bit weighted more to commercial as the year went on, but I think ultimately it was about two-third, one-third split for the year. A.J. Rice: Okay. And you mentioned California provider and the Texas; specifically on California provider I know there's two pieces to it, the managed care piece and the fee-for-service. Are your booking both of those now and do you have both those assumed in your guidance or how much are you showing versus how much are you keeping potentially on contingency? Steve Filton : Prior to this I think we identified our potential benefit from California UPL to be in sort of $8 million or $9 million range for 2014. We recorded and recognized $4 million benefit in Q4 and that's because as you describe in [AJ] that piece of the program that was approved. And so we've only recorded the income associated with the piece of the government has approved, we have guided or included in our guidance for '15 comparable number and so if there is an approval of the second piece of that program that would be an upside when it gets approved. A.J. Rice: And the similar order of magnitude they're about the same? Steve Filton : It would be another sort of $4 million or $5 million for '14 and a similar number for '15. A.J. Rice: And then just maybe my last one, I know sometimes at the end of the year you have some AR backup in a couple of states. I know Illinois and Texas are notorious for some of theirs. Did you have any of that and how much did that impact cash flow and when do you think you might see that money come through if it is there? Steve Filton : I don't have that in front of me AJ but we actually disclose those numbers pretty specifically in the 10-K, so you can find them there. But I would generally say that in both cases we actually are in pretty decent shape in both those states, still had outstanding receivables, but not anywhere near the sort of the balances when they were at their highest levels. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citi. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just a few quick ones. Steve, is there a specific EBITDA range that ties to the earnings guidance that you'd be willing to provide? Steve Filton : Gary we have historically not sort of provided EBITDA guidance and honestly I don't have the numbers in front of me. Generally people came back into it but I don't have. Gary Taylor : You gave us some same-store stuff to get pretty close. Is there a case mix number to what kind of support all of this surgical growth or is it more in the commercial side and not really reflect in case mix. Steve Filton : I think it's actually both, I mean I don't have our actual case mix data in front of me but I do recall that case mix as you would expect with surgical volume was up both Medicare case mix and our overall case mix, because again I think I would make the point that the surgical strength that we saw in the quarter was intended to be across all payers. Gary Taylor : Last question, I don't think I heard you comment unless I missed it just on uninsured volumes overall. On the acute side is there a percentage decline or a percent of admissions versus last year that you could share? Steve Filton : You are right Gary, I didn't specifically sort of speak to that metric other than to say that I think we've seen a pretty steady decline and I think that decline is sort of we've seen a decline probably between 8% and 10% in our uninsured volumes pretty steadily drop here now. Here is a little bit of quarterly variation but I think for the year it sort of comes to that level. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just, Steve I know you guys exclude the IT incentive payments and costs from your numbers but can you share what you're spending in terms of CapEx in 2014 from those IT conversions and is there a thought about 2015 and do you have an idea what you think that the normalized recurring expenses are to just simply maintain those systems? Steve Filton : Sure, so we began the implementation of EHR in 2010, and I think have disclosed previously that originally projected we spent a couple of hundred million dollars and I think that's what we spend, I think most of that spending was over the probably four year period from 2010 to 2013. So actually I don't think there is a lot of IT spending particularly related to the EHR implementation I either of '14 numbers and certainly I don\u2019t think envision a lot of it in '15. I think we're largely through that process; there are small components of it that are bringing enhanced around position order entry and things like that. But again the amount of incremental capital expenditure is pretty small. Whit Mayo : Couple of hundred million is that 200 million 300 million? Steve Filton : No I am sorry, should be more precise when I said couple of hundred, I mean 200 million is the number that we talked about as being our investment obviously a substantial amount of that was recouped through the EHR reimbursement. Whit Mayo : So spread sort of evenly across four years or maybe 50 million of CapEx ballpark. Steve Filton : And I think and again even though these are completely unrelated and if you look at our overall capital spend its remained a pretty constant from '13 to '14 to '15, and I think what has happened although as I say unrelated is that $50 million a year in EHR spending has been replaced by additional behavioral beds spend. Whit Mayo : Yes, and I guess the question that I'm going to get to is that as we think about CapEx over the 2016 and 2017 time frame, the IT spend has gone away, you will continue to add beds although probably not at the same rate and you've got the Las Vegas hospital coming online. So I guess I'm just -- do you think that this CapEx number is one that you can hold for the next few years or will we see it go up? Alan Miller : So 15 I think it will sort of third year in a row that we\u2019ve run at sort of 375 to 400 range, and I would say that it has included a few years of some EHR spending it included an increase behavioral bed component. All those years have included some new acute hospitals for several year that was the Temecula facility and then for the next couple year that will be the Las Vegas facility, so I think it will tell you in our own model we continue to use a CapEx place holder at about that same level. Operator : So we have no further questions in the queue at this time. Steve Filton : Okay we want to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody again at the end of first quarter. Operator : Thank you, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Rice - UBS Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets Whit Mayo - Robert Baird Joshua Raskin - Barclays Dana Nuntin - Deutsche Bank Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo John Ransom - Raymond James Operator : Good morning my name is Kelly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.  Steve Filton Thank you and good morning. Alan Miller our CEO is also joining us this morning, welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2015. During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimate and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements.  For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the Company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.73 for the quarter. After adjusting depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.78 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015. On a same facility basis in our acute care division revenues increased 12.2% during the first quarter of 2015. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions and a 6.1% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.6% during the first quarter of 2015 from 19.2% during the first quarter of 2014. On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 6.0% and adjusted patient days increased 2.6% over the prior year first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.7% during the first quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter.  On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division increased to 28.6% during the quarter ended March 31, 2015 as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior during the comparable prior year period. Our cash provided by operating activities increased 39% to approximately 271 million during the first quarter of 2-015 as compared to 195 million in the first quarter of 2014. Our accounts receivable days outstanding remained at 56 days during comparable first quarters of 2015 and 2014. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 44.6% March 31, 2015 as compared to 48.6% at March 31, 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we spent $89 million dollars on capital expenditures. During the quarter we completed construction and opened 54 new beds in our acute care division and 148 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest behavioral facilities. Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Q - Kevin Fischbeck : I guess the market often times has a hard time getting your numbers right on a quarter-to-quarter basis. How would you characterize this quarter versus your internal expectations? Steve Filton : Sure Kevin, at least certainly would share the view that this was a strong quarter. I would note that our internal expectations for the quarter were somewhat higher than the street\u2019s, maybe by $0.07 or $0.08. So we didn't we didn't have quite as much of an internally beat still a very nice beat in the quarter. But it's also part of the reason why we chose not to revise our guidance at this point. Kevin Fischbeck : If there's anything that you could point to that kind of, versus your internal budget, where numbers came in a little bit stronger? Steve Filton : Yes, my guess is, directionally our experience was much like the street expectations and model and that clearly the biggest excess over budget or expectations was in the acute division, the 12% plus revenue growth, same-store revenue growth in acute division and it was well in excess of the 7% to 8% that we talked about having guided to in our 2015 guidance, so that was clearly the biggest element of the beat. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I know that you guys usually don't update numbers with Q1, but any thoughts about how reform is coming in versus your expectations? And I will jump off. Steve Filton : Sure. Look I think we've made the point, throughout 2014 that I think the science if you will of identifying the discrete impact of reform was difficult in 2015 I think as we move into the second year of reform implementation it becomes even sort of more blurry from our perspective. I think that we estimated that about 6% to 7% of our acute care EBITDA would come from reform patients either Medicaid expansion patients or commercial exchange patients and I think we still believe that that's a best guess number and I think we ran, at that rate in Q1. One but again I'll I will sort of caveat that I think we believe that it is becoming more and more difficult to precisely identify that impact and I think it will be become even more difficult as time passes. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Paula Torch : Great, thank you so much for taking the question and congrats on a very nice quarter to start the year. I just wanted to know if you could update us on the percentage of the business that may be related to the economic environment improving and maybe how we should think about those trends for the rest of the year in 2015? And also if you could give us more color on may be your larger markets and what is happening in Texas, Florida and Vegas? Steve Filton : Sure, Paula. I think what we\u2019ve said in 2014 was reattributed something like 35% to 40% of our acute care improvement to a CA related impact, a comparable amount of 35% to 40% to just the economic improvement in our market and then the remaining 15% to 20% to kind of discrete market share improvement et cetera in our individual markets. Again, it strikes me that those percentages are probably still reasonably accurate in 2015. In terms of sort of geographically how the quarter looked, we had a very, very strong quarter in our Las Vegas market. Volumes were very strong in the Las Vegas market, we continue to see a full quarter's worth of benefit of the Medicaid expansion in Nevada which is a Medicaid expansion state obviously. And so just real strong results in the Las Vegas market in Q1. Paula Torch : And do you think some of the strength is sustainable throughout the year, I mean you talked about the 7% to 8% increase, we had a 12%, so would that mean that just given the difficult compares that we might see some softness sort of as we go through or is it too soon to tell? Steve Filton : Well I think part of the reason why, we made no change to guidance is that I think after one quarter e think its generally premature to make changes to the outlook. We certainly feel like the core strength that the both business segments demonstrated in Q1 is largely sustainable. I mean that 12+% same store revenue growth in acute division, particularly as the year progresses and the comparisons become more difficult and the volume comparisons in particular become more difficult, I think it will be difficult to sustain but I think the core directional trends that are very strong in the two businesses we certainly believe should be sustainable. Paula Torch : Okay, thank you for that color. And I just wanted to know, what do you attribute the strength in the revenue or the pricing per adjusted admit to? Is there anything in particular that you could call out for us that happened during the quarter in terms of pricing or payer-mix shift? Steve Filton : I think it's a continuation of some of the trends that we called out in the fourth quarter. We talked about in Q4, very strong surgical volume strength. We saw those same trends in Q1. I highlighted in Q4 the fact that I think for the first time, at least in recent memory our inpatient surgical growth rate was higher than our outpatient, we saw that same dynamic continue into Q1. So that's certainly driving a lot of the sort of acuity element of the revenue improvement and then secondly we just had that continued pair mix improvement. We anticipated that 2015 would benefit from a full year of that enrollment that we saw occur, sort of incrementally throughout 2014 and I think Q1 was a reflection of that. And again in particularly in places like Las Vegas which had a huge Medicaid expansion growth in \u201914 and you're seeing that play-out in a full quarter in the first quarter of 2015. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: First of all, obviously you had a good cash flow quarter as well as operating quarter. But you didn't do too much in the buyback mode. Is that indicative of you are seeing an uptick in deal activity or any thoughts about the buyback going forward? Steve Filton : So the first quarter is a little different for us and I think for most in the sense we spend most of the first quarter in a quiet period so most of the buyback during the first quarter is done in our case under [indiscernible] pre-planned repurchase that we established some price and parameters around and you know sometimes we missed those estimates. So I think I wouldn\u2019t read be relatively modest repurchases in Q1 to be terribly meaningful in any regard. I'll repeat what we have said in the last few quarters since the buyback authorization in Q2 of 2014 was approved by the board and that is we anticipate we're going to generate a significant amount of free cash. We're not really anxious to see our leverage levels go any lower than they were when we established the share buyback. And while we continue to explore opportunities in the M& A space in both of the business segments, I think we feel comfortable we have the room to do -- most size deals as well as share repurchase as well as continuing CapEx at the current levels. So we're really comfortable that we can accomplish all those things and still maintain what in our minds is a comfortable leverage level. A.J. Rice: And I might also just ask you, because we get asked a lot about it. A couple of weeks ago you filed another 8-K indicating some additional request for information in the behavioral business. Broadly, I will just throw out on the table, is there anything that can be said about what is happening behind the scenes there? And then I would also throw it out in terms of the operating performance looking at the behavioral business from a high level, doesn't look like those inquiries are having any impact, at least in aggregate on the business. Is that your assessment of it or anything we should be aware of? Steve Filton : So the investigation has been on going now for a little over two years, A.J. we take it very seriously. We've cooperated fully with the government and we have responded to all their requests and continue to respond to any new and incremental requests that they make. But I think your observation is a fair one in the sense that we also continue to operate our business consistent with what we believe are the highest standards and will continue to do so. I think, unfortunately those who follow the industry know that these investigations can be a long process and it certainly has been long already but I also don't believe it's necessarily in its end stages so it may go on for a while and while it does we'll continue to take it seriously and comply with the government and cooperate with the government but at the same time we're going to continue to run the business which we feel delivers high quality, care throughout the portfolio. A.J. Rice: Okay, maybe I will slip in a last technical question. The California-provider fee, I think you were not accruing previously the managed care portion, did you accrue anything in this quarter? And what might that be if it ever comes to fruition for you. Steve Filton : So we did not recognize any incremental California UPL drive in the quarter and I think if it were to be approved, it's probably another my recollection , A.J. is another sort of $5 million to $6 million It's not a huge number. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Ralph Giacobbe : Thank you, good morning. I just wanted to jump to the behavioral side, do you think there was any help from mental health parity in the quarter, any way to discern that? And then I know we talk about this every quarter, but any more visibility or optimism around sort of the length of stay challenges? Steve Filton : So I think on the length of stay issue, we continue to see length of stay declined, although I'll repeat a comment that I made in the fourth quarter and I think it continued into Q1 and that is that at least some of that length of stay decline at least in the last few quarters is self-imposed or self manufactured in the sense that we continue to convert residential beds and residential services to acute beds and acute services. And when we do that we are by definition lowering our length of stay because acute services length of stay is markedly lower than the residential length of stay. So at least some element of the length of stay decline is intentional and quite frankly I think in our minds a positive development in that we're replacing higher revenue beds with lower revenue beds and I think that's partly what you see in the strong revenue growth that same store revenue growth of 6+% which is clearly at the high end of our or own expectations. As far as being able to identify the effects from parity, I think we always believed that would be difficult to do and I think we still believe that, almost well not impossible to do and that\u2019s because when we see a patient who has valid and legitimate insurance, we really don't sort of know the history of that insurance to what degree benefit plan design has really changed et cetera. I think the insurance companies or the government might have a better insight into that. What we are very focused on as a company I think and as an industry is in making sure that the parity rules and regulations including some of the newer ones and some of the clarifications are being properly enforced because I think we believe that there still are plans and that there still is executions of plans that are not compliant and therefore that there is sort of upside as if we can ensure that compliance is met throughout the country. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. That's helpful. And where are you, I guess, in the process of converting beds? Is there a timeline for us to think about in terms of where you are at this point or is this just ongoing? Steve Filton : I don't know that it's sort of a finite sort of process Ralph, where we have X number of beds that we want to convert. I think it's an issue we're always looking at the best and highest use of all of our beds and to the degree that beds become sort of underperforming because rates go down or length of stay is under great pressure, whatever it may be and if the demand is there for another better performing service, we're willing to convert those beds. So I don't know that we would sort of put it in the context of whether we're done with 50% of our conversions, I think for us, it's just sort of an ongoing process and will remain so. Ralph Giacobbe : Just SWB came in a lot better, is it anything more than just leveraging the top line or are there specific initiatives there that help? And I guess more importantly on a go-forward basis, can you help us in terms of what a fair range on thinking about that line item as a percentage of revenue, particularly considering your commentary around being tough to sustain the level of topline growth that we have seen in the quarter? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean salaries and wages are obviously the single biggest expense side in both of our divisions and get a lot of attention from the operators. But the nature of the business is such that when you have the really sort of strong revenue growth that we had in Q1, you are likely to see a significant amount of operating leverage, we did see that -- particularly in the acute division in Q1. If that revenue run rate does start to sort of modestly regress as I suggested before that it might from the 12+% we ran in Q1, be a little bit challenging to generate quite as much leverage as we did but our operators are very focused on controlling those salary numbers and delivering in efficient and high quality product. So I think they'll continue to remain focused that way. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Frank Morgan : Good morning. I guess hopping back to that discussion on parity. I know CMS recently put out a proposal about extending mental health parity to manage Medicaid and shield, and I'm just curious how much of an impact that might have? And do you think this may be a step in the direction at least toward striking down the IMD exclusion? Steve Filton : So look Frank, I think you get to the point and I think is most of the people listening know that the IMD exclusion precludes freestanding behavioral facilities from treating or from being paid at least for adult Medicaid patients and that's a big hurdle From our perspective. The recent parity clarifications that you mentioned I think are helpful for the non adult population may be that the Medicaid population at under age twenty one and I think what it says is that Medicare managed care organizations and other like organizations have to comply with parity as to and in our case that under 21 population. So I think it's helpful, not in a sort of game changing way but it's definitely helpful around the ages if you will. We are hopeful and continue to work as an industry for a more rational sort of approach to the IMD exclusion and that means I think we continue to lobby CMS can co-operate with day to gathering activities to try and demonstrate that, lifting the IMD exclusion would be the correct thing to do for a public policy prospect. And we also continue to work on the legislative end of it. I\u2019m working with congress men like working with legislatives like, Congressman Murphy, who has a bill out there that would eliminate the IMD exclusion. So, we are working on a number of fronts. I think that, lifting the IMD exclusion would be a game changer. I think the continued modifications to the parity law and the parity rules are helpful. But the sort of a end goal would be the lifting of the IMD exclusion. Frank Morgan : In terms, you mentioned good, broad-based performance across most of your markets, but I guess if there anywhere that you see really still has up-side maybe on a relative base, some markets that are underperforming but still have up-side. And also I think you have got any hospital, at least in the works in Vegas, could you get us comment there. Thanks Steve Filton : I think what you\u2019re seeing and we talked about this for years and I think, during the several years of the recession beginning in 2009 for us as a company, I think has an industry in extending, you know well through 2013, we had this sort of multi-year pressure from the recession from un-compensated care et cetera which put a burden on our volumes, our volume were rather muted during that period and our uncompensated care levels just grew throughout that period. And then beginning in 2014 with the benefits of the Affordable Care Act providing insurance to millions of people, who didn\u2019t have it before as well as the improving economy allowing people to go back to work and get reinsured, all that\u2019s been helpful in our markets I think because the decline was a multi-year decline. We always anticipated that the recovery would be a multi-year recovery and, we are certainly seeing that. I would suggest, either the second or the third year of the recovery in Las Vegas and the second year of recovery in a number of other or other markets. So, I\u2019m not sure that we feel like we can sustain these Q1 levels of growth, I think we are comfortable that, again the course sort of recovery that\u2019s taking place, is something that should last for a number of years. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Whit Mayo : just saying looking back historically, you guys have earned 30% of acute-care EBITDA in the first quarter on some modest site performance for the rest of the year, I think I can easily get near the high end of the range. Is it fair to maybe think about, given the outperformance in the first quarter, that you could be tracking closer to the high end than maybe the midpoint at this time? Steve Filton : Sure I mean, I think although you described it as dangerous Whit. It would be, if you do the math, I think there is a real change in the operating landscape, or unanticipated hurdles either in the core businesses. We should be comfortably, moving towards the high-end of our existing range. I think again just for a, all the reasons that we sided before, we just felt it was, you know not terribly prudent to tinker with the range if high-end and low-end at this point and we I\u2019ll take a, kind of a closer look in, and a more measured look at it , at the end of the second quarter. But certain I think if you do the math, it\u2019s not at all unreasonable to make the observation that we are, headed for the higher-end of the range. Whit Mayo : It seems appropriate. And maybe just on cost trends for a second, is there anything new that you are paying attention to an either segment right now and any increase in registry cost with the volume that you're seeing come through the acute care portfolio and you've leveraged supplies maybe a little bit more than I would have thought, given the strength in the surgical performance in the quarter, and the specialty pharma has gotten a lot of attention lately. So I guess I'm just trying to wrap my head around the cost trends and what you are seeing and what initiatives you have underway? Steve Filton : I think, again as a company and as an industry, we really did a significant amount of belt-tightening and kind of real structural reviews of our cost structure during those years of the recession when our revenues were really challenged. And I think that left us in a very good position, beginning in 2014 when the revenue trends reversed themselves and revenue growth began new and earnestly and as a consequence you know we've seen these pretty robust expansion of margins, particularly on the acute side of the business. I think from a cost perspective you know you cited the things that we're certainly concerned about as volumes grow. There is pressure on wages, we see that in higher over-time and higher use of temporary nurses. We see it to some degree and pressures in terms of placing doctors. we see quite a bit of pressure frankly on the behavioral side in finding an adequate number of psychiatrist in all of our facilities and that's put some pressure on use of, locums physicians and that sort of thing. But as I think we step back and look at it, I don't know that there's anything on the sort of the cost landscape that we would describe or think about as a huge discrete threat, rather it's always the challenge that as the business grows you want to just make sure that you remain efficient. And I think our operators have been doing that for the last year and a half or so and they have been doing a very good job of that. Whit Mayo : Okay, might sneak one quick one in, and just looking for an update on Cygnet and the updated performance of that asset? Thanks. Steve Filton : The behavioral company that we bought in the U.K. at the end of September was running at a very healthy occupancy levels, probably close to 80% when we bought them. We didn't really believe there was a huge amount of upside opportunity in the existing business but we're happy to say that even on the core business occupancy rates have risen in the six months we've owned them and are getting close to 90% and that obviously is generating better than expected results for that business and at the same time we announced a small acquisition in our first six months of ownership where we've started a development project in our first six months of ownership and we continue to look at a whole series of other opportunities both sort of large and small. So we are couldn't frankly be more pleased with that platform in the six months that we've owned it than we are. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Raskin : First question just on what we are seeing in terms of institutional providers and health plan collaborations, and whether that means sort of capitation or even all the way down to provider sponsored health plans. I'm just curious what your perspectives, if you guys have any pilots going on -- I'm thinking more of the 24 acute-care hospitals? What your thoughts are on the future of that? Steve Filton : Josh we certainly share the view that over the long term the reimbursement or payment landscape in acute care will change from a fee for service-- the traditional fee for service reimbursement to some sort of fee for value reimbursement that will include things like bundle payments or accountable care organizations and ultimately get to the end of the continuum which is sort of the capital model on the risk, on the sort of the pure risk model that I think you're referencing. I think we believe that that process is definitely an evolutionary process as it is one that will take multiple years. Honestly, in the vast majority of our reimbursement remains fee for service reimbursement although in some cases like in Medicare there are quality components and element of that but it still largely remains fee for service reimbursement. What we are doing, a number of things both in terms of our relationship with our physicians and really trying to integrate with our physicians particularly on the information technology side to prepare for that move to kind of more of a risk shifting environment with bundle payments and capitation et cetera. We\u2019ve talked I think at some length over the last few quarters about some of the initiatives surrounding the purchase in the middle of last year of health insurance company in Nevada to better prepare us again for that sort of risk taking to allow us in certain selected markets and with certain selected products to go out there and have a provider sponsored product in certain of our markets. So we're trying to move and adjust the right pace in our markets, not trying to get ahead of the curve but also absolutely ensuring that we are nowhere behind the curve in terms of these changes that we know are coming in certainly at least the acute care space. Joshua Raskin : So, Steve is that pace being driven more by the payers then and you're sort of reacting to or trying to accommodate those changes as opposed to this being a UHS-driven? I'm just trying to think, do you think ultimately this is good or bad? Steve Filton : I don't know that we would have a value judgment about it I mean I think what we would say is it inevitable. I think that payers and I think public policymakers have determined that the ultimately the real way to control costs in the healthcare space is by a shift of risk from the employer and the payer to the consumer and the provider. And so I think we're going there and it's not necessarily I think on the surface a good or bad thing. I think it's a good thing if you can react nimbly and flexibly to the changes and I think we're prepared to do that. So you can be the one to have and put together a large network in our markets and deliver high quality, low cost care efficient care and in the market then I think it will be a good thing and I think we believe we're well positioned to do that. Joshua Raskin : Okay, and then shifting topics, one last one for me. Just on the behavioral health hospitals, just thing about the M&A pipeline? We haven't seen a ton of activity. I'm thinking more domestically, so forgetting about the UK. Any updates on thoughts and maybe juxtaposing the commentary around lack of buybacks in the first quarter? How we should think about the psych hospital and M&A pipeline? Steve Filton : I think that the behavioral business is characterized at the moment by a lot of strong result, certainly all results are reflective of the underlying strength in this business. So as a result, I think most of the larger and far and away the largest but most of the larger consolidated providers are right now in growth mode as opposed to in a sale mode or in a divesture mode. So we're competing for assets with a number of other providers. I do think there are still are a lot of other providers out there to be acquired. We have talked number of times about the opportunity for the 50% or so half of the days are admissions in this in the behavioral business that are currently serviced within acute care hospital so that's behavioral beds within acute care hospitals, some of the growth for instance of beds that I mentioned in my opening remarks are beds at acute hospitals, non-affiliated acute care hospitals that we have opened in connection with newly, sort of formed partnerships with acute care hospitals. And we still think that a significant opportunity in the future. Now to be fair those opportunities are relatively by its size. We will get thirty beds at a time or fifty or seventy beds at a time. We're not going to get thousands and thousands of dead at a single stroke but the ultimate opportunity I think is enormous and as far and away the largest provider of freestanding Behavioral Services in the country,I think we're very well positioned to take advantage of that. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Dana Nuntin : Hi, it\u2019s Dana Nuntin in for Darren. Just a follow-up on an earlier question in the behavioral segment as particularly in the UK, can you provide some more color on bed additions and development there and how you might be working with NHS on getting approvals and finding opportunities to expand beds there? Steve Filton : Well I think that the opportunity in the U.K. broadly is sort of a twofold opportunity. One is that the overall demand or private psychiatric beds is going to continue to grow as the National Health Service continues a trend towards outsourcing, more of that business and deciding that they're going to spend their capital on investments other than behavioral investment and I think leave a lot of the new incremental capital to be invested in the behavioral industry to the private sector. At the same time, the market much like it is here in the U.S. remains fragmented and as a consequence there are you M&A opportunities and we were pursuing those and also doing all the same things we're doing in the U.S. which I think you alluded to in your question where we're running as I said in response to a previous question at very high occupancy rates, so we're looking at adding beds to our existing facilities as we are here in the U.S. we're looking at building Greenfield de novo projects and will continue to do all those things. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial. Chris Rigg : I just wanted to keep going with the M&A theme here for another minute. I know you guys have talked about in the past the potential for an appetite for sort of larger nonprofit deals and I guess I\u2019d love to get your view, we are seeing very strong results from the publicly traded trends. Are the results we're seeing you from you guys sort of an illusion to what's going on amongst the sort of nonpublic guys? Or do you think the dynamic has actually changed materially because of the ACA? And that is a setback to sort of nearer-term, larger nonprofit deals? Thanks. Steve Filton : Chris I'm not sure that I'm the foremost expert on this subject but I think if you if you look at the not for profit financial data that is out there in any sort of consolidated way, I think that probably the best data comes from the rating agencies. And I think that their data suggests that the not for profit financial results have not improved at the same rate over the last year or year and a half as the full profit result. And so I think you still find a number of not for profit acute hospitals that find themselves financially challenged in a variety of ways. I think also going back to Josh Raskin\u2019s question, I think a lot of not for profit hospitals look at the landscape of changing reimbursement and the challenges that presents and the need to be in a large network and find that they may not be able to check all the boxes and I think they're looking for either partners or they're looking for some sort of sale arrangement that allows them to be sort of the better position to move forward in the future. So you know we're talking with a number not for profits about those sorts of opportunities. I think those sorts of opportunities are going to be there in the next few years. It's difficult to predict how and at what rate that will develop and all we can do is respond to them as they develop but we're certainly ready to do so. We certainly have the financial flexibility to do so. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have a question in queue from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte : Steve, I think you said a little bit about Las Vegas, and I apologize if I've missed any more color but as you are looking at the various geographies, particularly in your acute-care business, Medicaid expanding states, non-Medicaid expanding states, and then Vegas, which is, as you said, the third year of economic recovery; Texas, which has had a recovery, but is going to a bit of a state of layoffs and so on. How is the payer-mix to the extent to your visibility deferring from one core market versus another? Steve Filton : The trends have been directionally the same over the last year and a half and that is we certainly have seen a decline in uninsured patients and an increase in insured patients mostly in Medicaid and commercial exchange patients, the percentages and the magnitude of that change differs a little bit from market to market and it's a little challenging as I suggested at the outset of the call to kind of discreetly identify to what degree those changes. Those payer mix changes of the given by the ACA and to what degree they're being driven by economic improvement or other factors. But I think our view is as I said doing you know in earlier response that those trends the ACA implementation will continue this year and probably for at least one more year and I think the economic improvement will likely continuum and you know, there are individual market average, which I think are also driving, some of this improvement. And I think, it has been very successful and I think our minds will also those results will be sustainable as well. Ana Gupte : Do you have any real-time visibility into Texas just on recognizing your exposure to the oil-heavy economies is a bit more limited than your peers about working Americans in Texas that might want to use more care, do more surgeries or whatever, because they are fearful of layoffs? Is any of that visible at all in the first quarter? Steve Filton : Well, I think is worth knowing that, while we are in a number of markets in Texas. We are really not in any markets, that are heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry, and I don\u2019t think we are therefore directly impacted by any other softness and that sector of the economy, to be fair. While we continue to watch it closely, I don\u2019t think we are seeing any pressure on either volumes or pair mix currently. In our markets in Texas, frankly I think, you know one of our broader concerns is that, If there really is a squeeze on the Texas economy, and it gets, sort of Felton and impact at the state budget level, we are big Medicate provider in Texas both in terms of traditional Medicate re-imbruement as well as some of the special programs like, disproportion share and UPL. So, but that\u2019s sort of thing that we keep, close eye on but to be fair, we are not really seeing any impact from our software Texas economy in our markets as of this moment. Ana Gupte : Thanks. My final one. On the other OpEx that showed some deterioration, is that a transient spike and might get better? Steve Filton : A few of the items that I noted previously, in terms of some of the cause pressure thing like temporary. Some of our temporary causes et cetera are recorded on that line but I think for the most part, that line should remain as a percentage revenue at least, fairly static. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of the Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman : Two cash flow statement questions. In the release you said you had repurchased $5.6 million worth of shares and in the cash-flow statement it looks like $29 million. Steve Filton : Yes, so the difference I think is stock based compensation, Gary that\u2019s the reconciling item. Gary Lieberman : Okay. And there's an item for a sale leaseback of real property of about $12.5 million. Steve Filton : Yeah so, we have to pre-standing ED\u2019s in Texas that we sold to universal health realty income trust, at-leased back in the quarter. Gary Lieberman : Okay. And then maybe just a final question on the behavioral business, the pricing looked particularly strong. Is that a domestic function? Is that being impacted by the UK business at all? Steve Filton : I think, it probably is more impacted by the dynamic that I was talking about before which is the continued shift of beds from residential to acute. So what I was sort of talking about cosmetically that will make our length of stay look lower but it will also clearly drive up our revenue per day. And I think you know that\u2019s your seeing that element in our strong pricing. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. John Ransom : Hi, good morning. This is just a nit, but your provider-tax programs, how much of that is Texas and how much of that are other states? Steve Filton : We have virtually no provider tax reinforcement in Texas, we do have that upper-payment limit program, but it\u2019s not really a provider text. And I believe John that those upper- payment limit reimbursement amounts are all disclosed in our SEC filings. John Ransom : But you also have provider-tax programs as well? Steve Filton : We do, and some other states like California and other states and again, I think all those are announcer, very sort of disclosed in a fair man in detail in the SEC filings. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. A - Steve Filton : We thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everyone again next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call, you may now disconnect.",

Rice - UBS Josh Raskin - Barclays Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Paula Torch - Avondale Partners Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Dana Nuntin - Deutsche Bank Whit Mayo - Robert Baird John Ransom - Raymond James Jennifer Lynch - BMO Capital Markets Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Filton. Sir, you may begin. Steve Filton : Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimate, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015.. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.80 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter\u2019s reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of Electronic Health Record applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night earnings release. Adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 20% to $186.6 million or a $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2015, as compared to $155.6 million or a $1.55 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year. On a same facility basis in our acute division, revenues during the second quarter of 2015 increased 8.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 19.8% during the second quarter of 2015 from 18.7% during the second quarter of 2014. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 5.1% during the second quarter of 2015, as compared to the second quarter of 2014. During this years second quarter as compared to last years, adjusted admissions to our Behavioral Health facilities owned for more than a year increased to 4.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.6%. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 4.1% during the second quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating margins for our Behavioral Health hospitals owned for more than a year were 28.5% and 28.4% during the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $532 million over the $458 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2014. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015, as compared to 53 days during the second quarter of 2014. At June 30, 2015, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 42.8%, as compared to 47.0% at June 30, 2014. We spent $81 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2015 and $171 million during the first six months of 2015. Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first six months of 2015, we are increasing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share. This revised guidance which excludes the expected Electronic Health Records impact for the year represents an increase of approximately 9% to 10% from the previously provided range of $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share. This guidance range which is subject to certain conditions including those set forth in last night's earnings release also excludes the impact of future items if applicable that are non-recurring or non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, costs related to extinguishment of debt, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets, impact of share repurchases and other material amounts that may be reflected in our financial statements that relate to prior periods. We would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch : Yes. Good morning. Can you hear me? Steve Filton : We hear you fine. Matthew Borsch : Okay. I wanted to just ask on, if you could comment on the factors impacting pricing on the acute care side and what your outlook is on that front for the second half of the year? Steve Filton : Sure, Matt. So, the 3 plus percent increase in revenue per adjusted admission was somewhat lower than we ran in the first quarter, but still very much within our expectations. I think it continues to be driven mostly by an improved payor mix, less uninsured patients, clearly our total uncompensated care decline for the quarter as it has the last six quarters now. But we are also, I think, in the second quarter had a pretty difficult comparison with the second quarter of last year. So we were -- we again -- we are pleased with the 3 plus percent revenue per unit growth. A lot of it being driven by increased government business Medicaid -- more Medicaid patients as result of the continued Medicaid expansion and in those states that are participating. And also increased Medicare utilization, which we reported as well in the first quarter of last year, not sure, I have a terribly insightful explanation for that, but I know that, some of the managed care companies have reported a similar dynamic, but we definitely saw increased Medicare utilization the quarter as well. So all those factors I think contributed to the acute care revenue per unit growth. Matthew Borsch : Wouldn't the, I'm sorry, I am missing something here, but wouldn't the, I mean, the higher Medicaid volumes displacing sort of charity care uninsured, that make sense how that's going to positively impact the revenue per unit? But on the Medicare side, is that just sort of the same mix even though obviously Medicare isn't expressly offsetting uninsured, I mean, Medicare is lower certainly than commercial when you think about the pricing mix? Steve Filton : Yeah. No. I think you make the right point and I probably shouldn\u2019t have been Matt. So, yeah, I think, to the degree that we've got increased insured business whether it's government or commercial versus uninsured business, clearly that's driving the overall revenue per unit up to the degree that we got more Medicare and slightly less commercial that that tempers it some, yes, that\u2019s correct. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Okay. Sorry, I just wanted to make sure, I wasn't missing something and one last, in terms of the incremental volume improvement and you made the comments on Medicare, which is interesting? But do you still generally see that being two-thirds core economy and one-third ACA? Steve Filton : Matt, we talked about this I think in Q1 and I think from our perspective as each quarter passes we sort of view the exercise of trying to parse out where volume growth is being generated whether its ACA related or economy related becomes more and more difficult, and honestly from our perspective sort of less and less meaningful. So I think in this quarter we effectively sort of stop doing that analysis and really are much more interested in things like geographies and service lines and payor mix and that sort of thing and really a focus a lot less on trying to sort of parse out exactly what the ACA related. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Michael Ha : Hi. This is Michael Ha on for Sarah. Just kind of following up on\u2026 Alan Miller : Please speak up. Michael Ha : Hi. Can you hear me? Alan Miller : Yeah. Steve Filton : Yeah. That\u2019s better. Michael Ha : Hi. So, this is Michael Ha for Sarah. Just kind of following up on Matt\u2019s question, same facility acute care adjusted admissions growth grew by 5.7% -- the same growth in both 1Q and 2Q. In 1Q, you mentioned those numbers, especially volume counts would be difficult to sustain moving through the year. How should we be looking at this for the back half of the year? Alan Miller : Look. And I wish that we had perfect insight into that dynamic. You are absolutely right. So we\u2019ve run 5.7% adjusted admission growth for the first half of the year. That is really significant improvement over what we've been running but I think even if look at in the broader context and look at it back over multiple years in the decade or two, I mean that\u2019s at a high-end that our business has run at in it sort of best day. So I think to some degree we have the view that it\u2019s going to be difficult to sustain that level of growth. We -- obviously we work hard to do so and are focused on doing it. But I think to be realistic about it and I think in the way that we crafted our guidance for the balance of the year, we presume that that growth slows some. And I was speaking with somebody last night and made the point that look if we think, acute-care same-store revenue growth is 3% or 3.5% in the back half of the year. If you would have asked us that a year ago, I think, asked just about anybody observing the acute care business, they would have been pleased with that sort of growth. So I think we're looking for that volume growth to moderate some in the back half of the year although we will certainly work hard to maintain what we've experienced in the first half. Michael Ha : Thank you. Also, debt-to-EBITDA this quarter was lower sequentially. And you guys had mentioned previously that you wouldn't let that leverage continue any lower from current levels. Taking this into account and seeing that your M&A activity has been slower year-to-date versus peers, how do you see the pipeline compared to last year -- smaller or just as big? Alan Miller : I think it\u2019s always hard to judge but I do think that we have a sense that there is sort of an increased level of activity. We seem to be reviewing a number of deals, potential deals in both the business segments. It's always hard to predict what might materialize or not materialize. But certainly I think we've been of the mind that it looks to us like there may be more opportunities in the next 12 months than they have been in some time. Michael Ha : Great, great. Thank you. And just one last question, on the behavioral front, you saw an increase in length of stays sequentially. Is your conversion of residential beds to acute beds completed? And could that be the driver of the increase or do you believe this is more related to stabilizing trend of length of stay that's starting to pick up? Alan Miller : Yeah. So I think you have to be careful at what you look at. If you look at length of stay a same-store basis, it\u2019s still down 3.5% or so from last year. If you look at it on a total divisional basis, it\u2019s up. But I think that\u2019s largely because it includes the U.K. facilities which clearly have a longer length of stay. So I would sort of echo many of the statements that we made in Q1, which is we still see length of stay declining some. Although we also believe that some of that decline is kind of self-imposed or self initiated as we convert more beds from residential to acute. So which I think is reflected in the fact that even though we have lower length of stay and lower patient days, we have higher revenue per day. The 4 plus percent revenue per day growth is, I think, among the best that we\u2019ve seen in some time. And again, I think is reflective of our efforts to convert from residential to acute beds. Michael Ha : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: Hello, everybody. Maybe first I'll ask you to comment a little bit on the geographies. Obviously with the strong results you're probably seeing strength across the board. But is there anything to call out on geographies? In particular, maybe in addition to Vegas and Texas which we always talk about, anything on the new facilities and how they're coming on line that you've -- in the last -- that you added in the last year or so? Alan Miller : Sure A.J. So I think your comment is well taken in the sense, that I think when you have almost 6% in same-store adjusted admission growth and over 8% same-store revenue growth in the acute division, you basically, I think have to assume and I think it will be correct to assume that there is pretty strong performance across the portfolio. It would be difficult if there weren\u2019t to post those kind of numbers. On the other hand, what we did in Q1 was we called out the performance of the Vegas market and the Riverside County market in California. Those two markets again I would say outperform the divisional averages in Q2 and that includes sort of to your question the Temecula facility, which has been open for about a year and half, maybe a little bit longer at this point. But I think what's really impressive about that Riverside County market is not only Temecula is doing quite a bit better than it did last year, probably not a surprise and so we\u2019re just ramping up but our other hospitals in that market are also doing better. So that\u2019s a real strong market in addition to the Vegas market which continues to outperform. And I think that's also within our expectations in the sense that through several years of the recession, we talked about what a drag the Vegas market was for us. And we were so used to it being an outperforming market that the difficulties and high unemployment in that market were a real struggle for us. But as the market has improved and as unemployment has dropped in the Las Vegas market like 6.5% from the high 15% at the height of the recession, I think our business has in turn improved both volume wise and payer mix wise. And so we see that. The flipside is, I think the Texas market was a little bit slower. Again. I think that's a relative term. It\u2019s still up. It\u2019s still has positive volume growth but in terms of our different geographies, it\u2019s probably performing under the average whereas Vegas and California are performing over the average. A.J. Rice: Okay. And maybe just switching gears for a follow-up on the psych business side. Since the first quarter there's been this proposed rule out of CMS mainly related to Medicaid managed care, but it does incorporate some language around at least partially alleviating the IMD exclusion that's impacted your psych business. Can you give us a little flavor for what the impact of that would be if it goes ahead and gets implemented? And any thoughts on timing on when we might see that actually happen? Alan Miller : Sure. Well, as you suggest, I mean that rule was issued, I believe, at the beginning -- early June if I'm remembering correctly. And as a consequence, CMS can issue a finalized rule until early August. And then that sort of the earliest they could do it, they can certainly do it after that. What the rule would do and I think it was pressed for quite frankly by the manage Medicaid companies is it would allow those companies to contract with whoever they chose based on certain conditions. But they would be able to contract for adult Medicaid patients regardless of the IMD exclusion rule. So we certainly believe that if that rule is finalized in your anything close to the form that it was proposed and depending on when it is effective, we will get a -- certainly get a benefit from that. Difficult for us to quantify what that benefit is because we never had those patients really before us. So it's mostly guesstimate work at this point but we\u2019re certainly looking forward to the final rule being issued and starting to contract with those manage Medicaid companies for their adult Medicaid patients. We view that as a nice potential tailwind for this business. So we're anxiously awaiting the issuance of the rule. A.J. Rice: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Steve Filton : Good morning, A.J. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just on the expense side of things. Overall seeing good control there, I'm just curious, are you seeing anything in terms of wages in your markets, and any market specifically, any pressure, et cetera, on wage growth? Steve Filton : Look, I think it\u2019s always a competitive market, Josh and I\u2019m hoping that's really changed. But I think if you look at it, one of the reasons why acute care margins are up is that when revenue increases and when volume increases the way that it does, there is just the nature of the hospital operating model, there's four efficient providers that\u2019s usually a fair amount of operating leverage to the exercise. And I think our operators deserve credit for doing so. So yeah, I mean, clearly as a percentage of revenue, our salaries are down and we\u2019re exercising some of that leverage. Even though I do believe that there is a fair amount of wage pressure in some of our markets. Josh Raskin : Okay. But it sounded like, Steve, you don't think that's changed, that wage pressure, nothing you would call out relative to say last year? Steve Filton : No, I don\u2019t there has been significant developments now. Josh Raskin : Okay. And then on the psych side of the business, have you guys thought about other lines, ancillary sort of services beyond just the operation of the actual psych facility? Steve Filton : So I'm not exactly sure of what that implies. I mean, again, we do offer a wide array of behavioral services. We tend to talk about them in terms of acute and residential. But we\u2019re one of the largest provider of specialty behavioral services and have been for a long time specializing in things, like eating disorders and sexual trauma and all kinds of other specialties. And so we continue to do that. And I think we will continue to do so. I know that you know addiction treatment is kind of a hot topic in the industry. But we've been -- we probably have eight or nine facilities that are dedicated to a CD and addiction treatment. We also have for a long time now had a real emphasis on supporting behavioral disorders within the military. We have what we call our Patriot Support Program and that is a program that is fairly widespread throughout the division. So in terms of service lines, I think we touch on most of them and continue to look for ways to expand them. Autism is another one that we\u2019ve clearly emphasized more in the last few years. In terms of other behavioral-related services, we had outpatient services in the number of our markets, not really sure what else you might be alluding to. But we\u2019re always open to ways as the largest behavioral inpatient provider in the country always looking for ways to enhance and kind of make that position more robust. So I think we\u2019re open to just about everything. Josh Raskin : Yes. I was thinking outpatient and addiction treatment, etcetera, so that's very helpful. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial. Chris Rigg : Good morning. Thanks. I know at this point you're kind of saying it's a fruitless exercise to try to isolate ACA-driven strength, but at the same time, I guess people are still trying to get a sense for how much that could be helping you out in the industry. So is it possible to sort of -- when you think about the pockets of volume strength, commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, where the relative outperformance was in those buckets, where you saw the most pronounced improvement year-to-year volume trends? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, and I suspect my answer was still be unsatisfactory for you, Chris, in the sense that, I think what we\u2019ve said for a while is that look we assume that the growth in our Medicaid patient base and utilization is related at least in large part to Medicaid expansion. We see it quite clearly most dramatically in those states, Nevada, California, the District of Columbia that have participated in Medicaid expansion. Although as others have noted, we've seen Medicaid utilization increases in our non-expansion states as well, I guess most people referred to that as the woodworker fact and we certainly have seen that as well. Some of the commercial growth clearly comes from expansion patients. That\u2019s the trickiest part for us. It has not always been easy for us to identify exactly who is a commercial exchange patient and who is just a regular commercial patient. So that\u2019s where I think we've always felt was the greatest level of imprecision. And then as I said in the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve clearly seen an increase in our Medicare utilization, which is difficult for us quite frankly to attribute either to the ACA impact or quite frankly to economic improvement only because historically our Medicare utilization has been relatively insensitive to those sort of factors. But that\u2019s kind of where we've seen our payer mix go. Chris Rigg : Okay. And then one big picture question. I guess with King pretty well behind us, there's a theory that that's a catalyst for additional states to opt into Medicaid? Steve Filton : Go ahead, Chris. Chris Rigg : Sorry. That's a catalyst for states to opt into Medicaid expansion sooner rather than later. I guess could you give us your take as to whether that really is a game-changer, and that you will see states move to expand Medicaid over the near term versus just keep delaying it? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, honestly, Chris, I wish I could predict this very accurately. I mean, in lot of our case, I think you're really talking about a couple of states that really make the difference. For us the two states that have not chosen to participate in Medicaid expansion that I think would make a significant difference in our acute care operations would be Florida and Texas. I think all sorts of people have speculated on the likelihood that those states might or might not choose to do so in the future. I don't know whether the Supreme Court ruling really makes that more likely or not. I don't think we used to have a view that in either of those states that Medicaid expansion is going to take place imminently. So we continue to work for it along with the state hospital associations and others in those states, but I wouldn\u2019t make a prediction as to how likely that is. Chris Rigg : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Joanna Gajuk : Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Thanks for taking the question here. So I just want to come back a little bit to the question earlier about the capital deployment. And I guess you talk about interest in other I guess areas in psych, but is there anything on the acute care side in terms of the deals that you might be considering? Or maybe outside of acute, any sort of outpatient sites you're also looking to add? Or any color around the capital deployment here, or whether maybe you're more focused on increasing your CapEx spending? Steve Filton : So Joanna, just to be clear about what I said, what I was clear about saying that we have seen an increased number of opportunities in both of the business segment, both acute and behavioral. And I think it's in both cases sort of across the continuum. Meaning, it\u2019s hospitals it maybe outpatient facilities, it maybe physician type practices, and we are exploring all those items. I think the landscape of healthcare is such that it's changing and that payers and employers are looking for more comprehensive and coordinated continuum of care and looking for sort of the ability to go to one or two providers, who can really kind of sort of provide that. So we are very focused on that in both of the divisions. And I think that it creates I think a universe of opportunities that is broader than what we necessarily have been used to for the last few years. So we will say now again I -- as I also said before, I think it's always difficult to predict how this is going to sort out and what will really become actionable and what won't. But I think we\u2019re very focused on what those opportunities might be again in both business segments. Joanna Gajuk : All right. And then on the -- more on the policy side here, can you comment about the proposed mandatory joint replacement demonstration, or the bundle that came out? How do you feel it could impact the industry and your business in particular? And also, maybe briefly on the -- I guess the set of hospital payment reforms that came out from the House Ways and Means Committee just recently? I know it's very early stages, but any color you can give us would be helpful. Thank you. Steve Filton : Joanna, I am not going to sort of comment on really specific developments in part because I don\u2019t know that we've had a full opportunity to review them. But I am going to just sort of to reiterate a little bit and maybe expand on the comment I made before. We certainly have a view that the reimbursement mechanisms that have been sort of the historic ones for the industry are changing. They are changing I think incrementally. And I think that change will continue to be incremental. But we are doing great many things to prepare for that, to prepare for things like accepting bundle payments and accepting Capitated payments in some very limited instances etcetera, because I think we do think that\u2019s at least part of the future of the industry. And so we\u2019re very focused on that. Now exactly what form that\u2019s going to take, to what degree the government is going to initiate that or the initiation will really come from the private sector, hard for us to predict at this moment. But I will tell you, and there is probably not enough time in the context of this call to discuss it meaningfully. But we've got a number of initiatives underway to make sure that we are absolutely prepared for that. Joanna Gajuk : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc. Jason Gurda : Good morning. Thank you. Steve, I saw in the news that the Doctors Hospital of Renaissance had filed to expand or double the size of the number of beds, but they have to get approval from CMS. Do you have any sense for how likely that is? Alan Miller : We don\u2019t. As you might imagine, there are others in the market I think who are sort of questioning the appropriateness of that. And so as CMS will have to weigh, I think a number of different factors as they think about that. But for those who followed us for a long time know that the physician owned hospital in the McAllen market is a formidable competitor of ours. When they first opened, we had a fairly significant diminution in our earnings in that market. We\u2019ve regained a lot of that over the years and done a number of things to strengthen our position in the market, including a number of physician integration strategies, a number of physical strategies, physical improvements. And again, I think we feel like we are well positioned in the market regardless of what the physician hospital ultimately is able to do. Jason Gurda : Okay. I'm not sure if you're going to want to comment on this or not, but I'd be interested in hearing maybe an update on your relationship of working with EmCare? Alan Miller : Yeah. I mean, EmCare is the emergency room provider in probably the majority of our acute care hospitals and they provide some other physician contract services in some of our hospitals as well. As with any sort of contract service vendor, we work closely with them to try and provide services that are both satisfactory to our patients and to our other physicians, as well as from our perspective, cost efficient. And I think EmCare is a good solid company. We will continue to work with them. But as always, we will continue to explore all the alternatives to increase patient satisfaction and increase our cost efficiency at the same time. Jason Gurda : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Paula Torch : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the U.K. for a second. Just wondering how that business is progressing in the behavioral side. Are you happy with it and maybe how much is that business contributing to your overall behavioral revenue, and what are some of the growth plans there for the next 12 months? Alan Miller : Yeah. So, Paula, I think that we talked little bit in Q1 and I will largely repeat those comments in the sense that when we bought Cygnet in the U.K. late in the third quarter of \u201914, they were already operating at what we consider to be high occupancy levels, probably around 80%, maybe the low 80s. We've been extremely pleased because I think they are now operating at close to 90%. And so while we didn't think there was a tremendous opportunity for improvement, we\u2019ve based on our short period of ownership have already experienced some fairly significant incremental improvement that has been very beneficial. I will say that -- at the end of the day, we acquired a company that had roughly $170 million, $180 million of revenues and $40 million of EBITDA, something like that. So, it\u2019s not a terribly material part of our behavioral business or certainly of our consolidated results at the moment. But we also viewed it as a platform for growth. We've already in the short time, we've owned them and announced a small acquisition in a number of bed expansion opportunities, both de novo facilities as well, as incremental bed expansions and existing facilities. So, I think it is turning out to be everything that we expect it would be and maybe more. And the hope is that it continues to be a platform for growth in the future. And that we will continue to expand both the existing facilities, as well as find other opportunities to acquire streams of EBITDA in that period. Paula Torch : And just as a follow-up to that, 90% occupancy is certainly high. I know you mentioned de novos and bed expansion and so that should help sort of fill in some of that demand. But wondering on the acquisition front, are there some larger players still in that market that you could think about acquiring? And what are some of your thoughts there, I guess in terms of how big you want to actually take this business? Alan Miller : The challenge when asked -- anywhere whether it\u2019s in the U.K. or the U.S. about acquiring other consolidated players is -- unfortunately that decision is largely up to those other players. There are other consolidated players in the U.K. and we certainly are doing our best to stay in touch with those players into the degree that any of those players decide that they are looking to pursue some other strategy, whether it's an exit strategy or joint venture strategy or some sort of partnership to develop new facilities. We\u2019d be interested in all of those opportunities. So the difficulty of sort of pegging kind of a likelihood of that is again, this is largely dependent on what somebody else wants to do or chooses to do so. For the most part although we try and stay on top of it, we have to be reactive to that. Paula Torch : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color there. Just one last one, maybe for me. Certainly a very strong first half, you raised guidance. And it seems like the second half we're still taking a little bit more of a prudent approach. So just wondering what type of metrics do we need to see on the revenue side to maybe hit the high mark in that EPS guidance? Alan Miller : So, I would say that to get to the high end of the EPS guidance, Paula, we\u2019d have to sustain most of the metrics that you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter, including the volume growth which I think is probably the most aggressive piece of it as I mentioned before. I think realistically, we\u2019ve assume that there will be some tempering of that volume growth. And I would suggest that the midpoint of our guidance sort of is -- would sort of suggest that there is, at least a bit of tampering of that sort of growth. I think the high end is -- would be more of a continuation of all the trends that we\u2019ve seen in the first half. Paula Torch : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to again tease out some of the elements of what were the drivers of the guidance raise. Some of this might be, Steve, a repetition or at least a follow-up of what others have already asked. But in February you were pretty conservative. The pull-through to EBITDA was weaker than the street had expected.  So firstly, when you raised guidance this time, is this because the exchange enrollment that you had factored in was lower than what eventually manifested itself, or are you more confident at this point in the mid-point of the year on the economic recovery as a driver of the volumes? Steve Filton : Again, Ane, a little bit of your question is sort of based on this idea of what\u2019s driving the improvement -- not to be repetitive but I think we struggle ourselves with exactly what is driving the improvement. I would say again what makes us confident about raising guidance after the first half of the year is simply the acute care future performance, which clearly was an outperformance in the first half. It's really based on the strong revenue growth and I think that strong revenue growth is really driven by this 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions, which honestly is well above what we were guiding to and what we were budgeting for when the year began. And as sort of suggested in my answer to Paula, I think that\u2019s the sort of trickiest variable from our perspective as we think about the back half of the year. We certainly believe that our acute care demand will continue. It will be strong. Whether it will be quite as strong as the 5.7%, which again, I\u2019m going to make the point is really at the very high end of our historical trends, not just us as a company but as an industry. Whether that can continue, I\u2019m not clear and again, we've tempered a little bit in our guidance. But I think that's what's really driving the confidence here is that strong, very consistent performance in the first half of the year and especially in Q2, when I think the comparisons were far more difficult. Ana Gupte : And then on the Medicaid utilization that you alluded to that's accelerating. I know the payer mix is not that clear at all times, but any color on whether this is from the Medicare Advantage side of it, versus the government Medicare that's up? And any color on the types of the acuity and the types of procedures and services that you're seeing in Medicare? Alan Miller : Sure. So, we always look at our Medicare and Medicaid blocks of business in total and we look at them as, both the managed portion and the traditional portion in part because they are certainly a continuing shift of patience from the traditional Medicaid and Medicare programs to the managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. So if I were to question the directly like that, I would say no, clearly the increase in Medicare utilization is coming from an increase in Medicare Advantage patients. But I don't know that that's all that meaningful because clearly, there are just more Medicaid Advantage patients today than there were a year ago or two years ago whatever. But the overall, we\u2019ve seen more total Medicare and total Medicaid patients. That to me is the meaningful dynamic. In terms of who those patients are and what's driving them, as we review our service lines, as we review our surgical lines, et cetera, we see strength really across the board, orthopedics, cardiology, oncology, all the service lines that are traditional sort of Medicare intensive service line. So I wouldn\u2019t point to a particular procedure or diagnoses, et cetera, that's really driving this strength. I think it's pretty much across that board. Ana Gupte : That's very helpful. Thanks, Steve. On the Texas economy and the Medicaid concerned that you had in February and it seems like the oil and gas, and I know you're not fully levered to those geographies, but just broadly speaking the layoffs haven't abated if anything they're accelerating, are you comfortable at this point that there will not be any Medicaid funding pressures or might we see that further down the line? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, I think, the answer is little bit of both, I think, that we don\u2019t think there is any immediate threats to our reimbursement funding in the State of Taxes. I think that that\u2019s always over the longer-term you look out the more uncertainty there might be. We have seen in an earlier question or in response to an earlier question, I said that, our Texas markets have performed a little bit more modestly than some of our other markets like Vegas and California. So, I don't know if that\u2019s the economic impact of a slightly slowing economy. Honestly, Texas is a big state and we\u2019re only in a handful of markets in the State. So I don't know whether our performance or our experience is necessarily reflective of what's going on more broadly. But for us at least, Texas has slowed a little bit. Again, I made the point earlier that's a relative term, Texas markets are ahead of last year and both volume wise and earnings wise, but not quite as much ahead as some of those -- some of our other markets like California and Vegas. Ana Gupte : And then one final one if I may, on the consolidation that's now been announced in managed care, out of the two deals, the two mega-deals, would you see both as potentially impacting the pricing dynamic? One is more of a complementary rather than an overlapping commercial-only story. The other one is commercial. Any thoughts on that and what might be the strategic response from the hospital industry? Steve Filton : I mean, it's difficult to respond. I think, first of all, I think, the industry, the provider industry broadly will, I think, raise questions about the lack of competitiveness or diminution in competitiveness that these transactions might drive. And I think one of things the industry will point out is that it may not necessarily be or they -- the most appropriate way to look at this may not simply be on a service line business that I think when an insurer in a market gets increased commercial lives and increase manager lives at the same time that increases their market power in the market, even though there might be two different service lines. So I think the industry as a whole will make those points as the government reviews these transactions. And I certainly are not smart enough to know how that\u2019s going to play out. I think for us individually, we know we tend to look at these things very much in a market by market basis. We have spend and our focus to a lot of our internal efforts over the last decade or two at enhancing and increasing our market positions in all of our markets, both acute and behavioral care. Not that we necessarily had a view that this is the way the insurance industry would sort out. But we had a view that look, we would need as much market power as possible to deal with payers of every stripe of government and private payers. And so, I think in general, we're fairly comfortable with the market positions and market share percentages that we have in most of our markets. So in a very specific UHS sense, I don't know that we have any grave concerns about this payer consolidation dynamic. But I think as a provider generally, we think the payer consolidation will provide some limits and some restrictions on consumer choice and consumer costs et cetera. Ana Gupte : That's very helpful. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I think most of the good ones have been taken. You were waiting for some California provider fees, I think, at the last quarter. Any update on those? Steve Filton : Yeah. So those were approved and we did record them in the quarter. Gary, it\u2019s a relatively small number for us, probably $3 million or $4 million in the quarter. And for us, it was really just an acceleration of an item that we had sort of guided to or assume would occur in the second half of the year. So it doesn't really affect our sort of full-year guidance or full year expectations. Gary Lieberman : Got it. And then Alan, maybe I'd be interested in your thoughts on the current GOP field of candidates for President? Alan Miller : Well, we have a very exciting 17 candidates, so you\u2019ve heard about that I\u2019m sure. Gary Lieberman : Yes. Alan Miller : There will be a debate on August 6, let see and it\u2019s too early to really say much of anything. So we\u2019ll see. Gary Lieberman : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dana Nuntin with Deutsche Bank. Dana Nuntin : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. I know you touched on this briefly, but is there any color you could provide on how surgical trends performed in the quarter, maybe inpatient versus out patient? Steve Filton : Sure. Dana, I mean we made the point and I think we\u2019ve made the point and I think we\u2019ve made it actually on the last two quarters that the most interesting development from a surgical trend perspective is that inpatient surgical -- inpatient surgeries are growing faster than outpatient really for the first time in a very long time. And honestly that trend continued into Q2 as well. So that to me is the most interesting trend. And then the only other thing I\u2019d emphasize or point out is what I said to, Ana, that as we look at those surgical procedures, there's not a particular service line or diagnosis that\u2019s really driving the growth. It tends to be fairly widespread both geographically and service line wise. Dana Nuntin : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Whit Mayo : Hey, good morning. Steve, I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but generally you tend to earn about 21% to maybe 23% of your full year acute care EBITDA within the third quarter. And I think sometimes we forget about the seasonal earnings progression. Just any reason as you look at your internal budgets that would be materially different this time around? Steve Filton : No. I think the historical trend of the third quarter being the softest quarter for the hospital industry in general and certainly for us. I don\u2019t think we would see any reason why that wouldn't hold up in 2015 as well. Whit Mayo : Okay. We tend to -- the street sometimes tends to get a little ahead of you sometimes in the third quarter, so just appreciate that. And can you just comment on employment strategy? This hasn't really been a focus I think internally at UHS as perhaps others. And that's perhaps a cultural dynamic in some of your markets. But where do you think you are in the industry as within that particular cycle? Steve Filton : White, I always think -- couple of things. I don\u2019t think UHS sort of emphasizes it, as we talked about the business as much as some of our peers. But it doesn't mean that we have not employed physicians. I think we view, physician employment the way we view a lot of our market strategies and market development and business development strategies and they are very market specific. So, there is some markets in which we have a significant amount of physician employment. McAllen is one, Texoma is another. There are other markets like Las Vegas where in general, the market has not seen a lot of physician employment for a variety of reasons, so we\u2019ll see. We continue to do what we think is the most appropriate competitive thing in every market. We definitely have a view that physician integration is going to be more and more important as time goes on and we certainly are doing what we can in that regard in some cases, employing physicians, in many cases, working with physicians to integrate our information technologies. We think that's a very important strategy. We\u2019ll continue to do that. But we\u2019ll also continue to be judicious about it because at the end of the day, we think that most hospitals lose money on own physician practices. And obviously, that's an end result that if we can avoid, we will prefer to avoid it. Whit Mayo : Okay. And maybe my last one, just to follow-up on Gary's question around the California provider fee. Did you actually receive any payments from the state in the quarter? Can you comment on Texas DSRIP? I can't remember if you have any AR tied up there and whether or not you've received any cash as well? Steve Filton : So as far as California goes Whit, I don\u2019t believe that we received the monies that I referenced in my response to Gary. I think the program has just been approved, and we recognized that although again those are not a big numbers. Texas DSRIP, we definitely have received some Texas DSRIP numbers. And when we file the Q next week, you\u2019ll be able to see that, we\u2019ll spell that out. Whit Mayo : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. John Ransom : It's really hard to be clever after all these good questions. But I was just as one final one. You guys hired John Rizzo recently. I was just curious about the rationale behind that hire? And what different perspectives you may or may not be looking for? Thanks. Steve Filton : He is, we think, an exceptionally fine experienced talent. And we're always looking to improve and add to our talent base our executives and we have high expectation for him. He is a development guy basically, strategy and development. John Ransom : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lynch with BMO Capital Markets. Jennifer Lynch : Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. One quick follow-up on the U.K. Can you guys just give us any color on U.K. rates for the behavioral business and how those are acting directionally? And then maybe what you're including in your outlook for those rates through the back half of the year? Thanks very much. Steve Filton : So Jen, when we bought Cygnet, I think we had a view that as we model that acquisition, that rates from the NHS, which 95% plus of our patients, our NHS patient would be relatively kind of flat to maybe up 1% in for the foreseeable future on an annual basis. I don't think any of our current experience in our nine months of ownership or so has really made us think any differently about that. So I think our actual performance has kind of fit into that. And I think as we continue to think about the next few years, we still think that\u2019s the right way of thinking about the business. And so any growth from that business is much more likely to come from volume growth than it is from rate growth. Jennifer Lynch : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Steve Filton : Okay. We thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everyone again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Good morning. Thank you. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended June 30, 2015. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as well as the other items attributable to last year's third quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 13% to $155.3 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $137.5 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, during the third quarter of last year. On a same facility basis, in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2015 increased 7.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year, and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2015 from 17.1% during the third quarter of 2014. s expected, net revenue growth slowed in the third quarter from the unprecedented levels we have been experiencing in the first half of the year. Surgical volume's moderated a bit, and uncompensated care volumes ticked up as well. At the same time, there was a measurable increase in temporary nursing costs, all contributing to the margin decline. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5% during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014. During this year's third quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year each increased 1.6%. Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day each rose 3.1% during the third quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior-year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.5% and 27.6% during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $796 million over the $690 million generated during the comparable nine-month period of 2014. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015, as compared to 56 days during the third quarter of 2014. At September 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 48.9% at September 30, 2014. We spent $99 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2015 and $270 million during the first nine months of 2015. In connection with our previously announced $400 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased 543,380 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $72 million during the third quarter of this year. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $166 million and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $234 million as of the end of the third quarter. In August 2015, we acquired four behavioral health facilities with 305 beds located in the UK. This acquisition increases our behavioral health presence in the UK to 21 facilities consisting of approximately 1,100 beds. In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network. Through this acquisition, we have added four inpatient facilities consisting of 322 beds, as well as eight outpatient centers. In addition, there are over 140 expansion beds in progress for Foundation as well. Foundation is one of the premier names in addiction treatment, is focused on treating adults with co-occurring addiction and mental health disorders through an evidence-based integrated treatment model in residential and outpatient settings. Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine months of 2015, we're revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.05 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact of the year, maintains the lower end of the previously provided range of $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 1%. Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : Operator : And our first question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, this is Tejus Ujjani joining on for Matthew Borsch. Thanks for taking the question. Was wondering if you could touch a little bit more on the growth in uninsured on the acute care side. I can see that the provision grew faster than the uninsured charges as a whole, and was just curious about that in terms of many differences in collection rates or why that would be the case. Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Sure. So, we did see, as the data that you cited suggests, an increase in uncompensated care in the third quarter. While we saw it throughout the portfolio, I think it was most evident in our Texas and, in specifically, in our South Texas markets. And I think our estimate is that that increase in uncompensated care probably had an impact of maybe 50 basis point reduction in our acute care margins during the quarter. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Antonella Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to touch on acute care margin again and speaking with this conversation. So 50 basis \u2013 excuse me \u2013 50 basis point impact to the uncompensated care, wondering if you could tell us how much of an impact the temporary nursing costs were in the quarter and sort of what's going on there? Is there a higher competition, is it tightness? Do you think that's going to continue into the fourth quarter and into next year; any more color there? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Sure, Paula. So, just from an order of magnitude, I think that the impact of the increase in temporary nurse costs was similar to the uncompensated care impact that is in the neighborhood of 50 basis points. Obviously, it is a trend that has been mentioned by a number of our peers as well, which is not necessarily something we were aware of during the quarter. I think from our perspective, we continue to have and generate very substantial acute care demand as reflected in our growing admissions, very healthily growing admissions. And as a result, that is contributing to a need for more employees, particularly nurses. And honestly, I think we're just not filling those positions as quickly and as efficiently and expeditiously as we would hope. To some degree, I think, we probably underestimated the need for new nurses as demand has remained as strong as it has. As we look forward and project sort of solving this issue or solving the problem, I think we view it as definitely a fixable problem and one that we will address in the fourth quarter and begin to make progress the fourth quarter and certainly begin to really solve the issue by the beginning of next year as we fill those vacant positions. The feedback that I get from our hospitals when we talk to them is that they can fill those positions. They're sort of re-doubling their efforts to do so. And so, we're fairly confident that we will address that issue in the near future. Antonella Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. Great. And one more if I may. Just turning to behavioral quickly and the Foundations acquisition that you did, can you update us maybe on the thoughts on the expansion? I know you said 140 beds, I believe. When should we expect those to come online and are they across all of the four facilities? How fast do you expect the addiction piece of your behavioral business to grow, and maybe if you can help us think about some of the future investments there? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Sure. I mean in the grand scheme, the Foundations acquisition is relatively small but we think a strategically important acquisition. Obviously, we're talking about 330 beds out of a total of 20,000 beds, but I think we think that the Foundation acquisition very nicely complements our existing addiction businesses. We probably have eight or nine dedicated addiction facilities in our portfolio today, as well as the fact that we offer addiction services in many of our other behavioral facilities as well. And we think that the Foundations' model as well as \u2013 the Foundations' model in terms of patient treatment as well as their model for patient capture is one that will have relevance for us throughout our other addiction businesses, and quite frankly in some of our other lines of business as well, things like eating disorders, et cetera. So, the 140 beds that are in the queue for Foundations are both additions to existing facilities as well as some de novo development. I think they're all likely to be completed within the 12-month cycle, and we continue to look for other opportunities as well to expand that business, as well as other elements of our behavioral business. Antonella Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial. Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. This is Frank Lee on for Chris Rigg. Thanks for taking my question. Acute care volumes continue to be strong in the quarter. I was just curious if there are any specific regions that are driving that growth you could call out, and then does the revised guidance reflect a similar pace of volume growth in the fourth quarter? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Yeah. Frank, so I think the acute care volume growth \u2013 and we talked a little bit about this in general in the first half of the year saying that the strongest performing markets were Las Vegas or Nevada and then Southern California. And as I mentioned before, I think our Texas markets, in particular our South Texas markets, have lagged a little bit over the last few quarters. I think all of those same trends were present in Q3 as well. In terms of the revised guidance and how that acute care growth fit into that, again, we revised that guidance at the end of the second quarter, we talked about the fact that the first half of the year acute care revenue growth of 10% was unlikely to be sustainable. It was sort of unprecedented in the history not only of the company but of the acute care industry. And we thought that revenues in the back half of the year and, frankly, going forward would likely moderate to levels more like 6.5%, 7%. And that's certainly what happened in Q3. And I think our revised guidance, taking off the very top end of the guidance, was simply an acknowledgment that those acute care revenues had moderated and would likely continue to do so, and that \u2013 I think we have said that to get to the high end of that range, we'd have to sustain those 10% or so revenue growth levels. And I think the revision at the top end of the range was just an acknowledgment that that was very unlikely. Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thanks. And then, it looks like share repurchases increased pretty meaningfully in the quarter even with the Alpha transaction. Can you help us think about the pace of repurchases going forward and in the fourth quarter given the Foundations acquisition? Thanks a lot. Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Yeah. I don't necessarily think that either of the two recent acquisitions, Alpha in Q3 and Foundations in Q4, will materially affect the way we think about share repurchase. Obviously, we have the view that our share price has seen a dramatic decline in the last month or two and is not necessarily, from our perspective, related to real fundamental changes in the business \u2013 in our business trends or in future prospects of the business. So, I think we view the current share price as an attractive investment and we'll continue to look at share repurchase in the same way that we have historically with other capital deployment opportunities, which we think also exist at this point in time. I think we're ready for the next question. Operator : And your next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. I just want to go back to the discussion around the margins, the acute care segment. So, first of all, in terms of the comments around the temporary staffing, you suggested you feel like you might be able to \u2013 you feel this oppositions 16 :28) in Q4 into beginning of next year, but does it feel like for you that it might be there's something that's more sustaining going on around the industry given that we're hearing viewpoint from other providers talking about similar issues? So any color you might have on in terms of whether you feel this is really fixable in the near term or whether there's something systemic going on around in terms of the labor cost or ability to staff nurses? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Joanna, you know the best that I can offer is that given my tenure in the industry, I can remember some 10 years ago when we \u2013 the industry was experiencing a really severe shortage of nurses and other clinical professionals. And I recall talking to our hospitals at the time and when we talked at that time about hiring and filling vacancies, the feedback you'd get from the hospitals was simply, you just couldn't do it. They're just weren't nurses out there. It didn't matter what we were willing to pay. There was enormous pressure on wages. I will tell you that the current environment just doesn't have the same feel to it. Certainly, this issue an increase use of temporary nurses is not unique to us; other companies have reported it as well. So it seems to be a bit more systemic issue, but it also, based on the feedback that we're getting from our hospitals, is one that remains fixable. I mean they're hiring nurses. They're hiring nurses at sort of within our current wage scales, et cetera. So we do have an impression and a feeling that this is really is an addressable issue and one that can be dealt with in relatively near term. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. And then because also in the past on that same topic, there was a margin pressure other (18:23). In the past, I believe, you talk about there is ability in acute care segment to show margin expansion if revenue grows above 3%, I believe; but clearly, it didn't happen this quarter because margins were down 170 basis points year-over-year on same-store basis. So you said 50 basis points from the temporary staffing and then another 50 basis points from the uncompensated care costs, so what else was driving or putting the margins to be under so much pressure given that top line growth was so strong? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Sure. I think it's worth putting the comparison \u2013 the acute care comparison in context. We ran over 17% margins in the third quarter of 2014, and those margins and the EBITDA that the acute care business generated in the third quarter of 2014 was almost a doubling of what it had run in the previous year. And the 17% margin I think was probably the best margin we've ever run in the third quarter in that division. So the comparison was extremely difficult. And even though I think your point is a valid one and well taken, and that is that under normal circumstances if we generate 7% growth \u2013 revenue growth in the acute division, we would expect to have margin expansion. And I believe that that's what we will expect in the future. In the third quarter there were a couple of extenuating circumstances, which we've discussed already, but I think it is just that, it is extenuating circumstances as opposed to sort of fundamental changes in the model. I think our general sense is that at these very healthy revenue levels \u2013 and that's what I think we take away from the quarter as the most important message \u2013 we believe that in the future we will be able to generate the margin expansion that we've come to expect at those levels. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So then you have suggested that you don't expect, I guess, the volume growth to remain in the 5% range. So, what \u2013 I mean without giving guidance for next year, but what kind of type of volume growth would you expect over the near term or medium term, I guess, in the acute care segment? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Well, as you suggest, I'm not going to give 2016 guidance for \u2013 and we're not going to give it for another several months, but I will just sort of reiterate what we talked about at the end of the second quarter of this year, and that is that we thought that acute care revenue growth would moderate from the 10% unprecedented levels that we were experiencing to something closer to 6.5%, 7%. That is, in fact, what happened. We're very comfortable at those levels. I'm not prepared to say whether those levels are going to be sustainable completely into 2016, but certainly sustainable through the end of the year. And we're very comfortable that, over the long term, we will generate margin expansion at that \u2013 at those revenue growth levels. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. That's all from me. Operator : And your next question is from A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, everybody. Just a couple things, maybe on the payer mix, drilling down a little bit more \u2013 do you have the details on either year-to-year change and some of the key components of that or the percentages, how they change? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: A.J., I think, as we discussed in the first half of the year, we continue to see growth in both our Medicare and Medicaid utilization, and that's total Medicare and Medicaid, meaning both traditional and managed. What was a little bit different in the third quarter was we saw our commercial volume growth slow some. We had been since the beginning of the ACA implementation and in the economic recovery seeing commercial volumes increasing in the high-single and double-digit, low double-digit ranges. I think that the commercial volume increase in the third quarter was only like 3% or 4% \u2013 still good, but a deceleration from where we've seen. And I think, we saw an uptick in uncompensated volumes as well, uninsured volumes. They had been declining, quite frankly, for a number of periods, and in the third quarter of this year uninsured volumes were up, let's call it, 6% or 7%. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And when you \u2013 I know, you said that when you drill down, Texas was especially the, I'd say, border community, or something I guess, where were you saw some of that, that pressure. When you ask your operators what they see is, is there anything to call out there? I know we get questions all the time about energy patch, which I wouldn't necessarily associate with those types of hospitals, but is there any issue there or anything more broadly or is this just the natural ebb and flow you see sometimes in a quarter-to-quarter swing? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Honestly, A.J., hard to say is the best answer I can give you. You're right that the South Texas markets, McAllen, Laredo, are not markets that are heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry. They're not markets where the sort of broader economic metrics like unemployment seem to be deteriorating in any meaningful way. So, the increase in uncompensated care is a bit of head scratcher in those markets. And I think a lot of times it's a mistake to draw broad conclusions from one quarter's worth of results in a particular market. So, I think we'll wait and see and try and evaluate it as it goes forward. But no, I mean, it's not obvious to us what's driving that change. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just lastly on the capital deployment, I mean, I understand the enthusiasm for your stock, given its pulled back like it has in \u2013 on the buybacks. Any commentary on what you're seeing on the acquisition front, either in acute or psych \u2013 obviously, you did two small deals in the quarter \u2013 but it sounded like earlier in the year you actually thought there might be some things on the acute side. Is there still some things out there or where do we stand? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Yeah. So, again, in our second quarter call, we had expressed the view that we thought that the pipeline for potential opportunities was busier than it had been in some time. Subsequent to that, as you suggest, we did two behavioral deals totaling $500 million in total investment. We continue to look at other behavioral opportunities. We continue to look at acute opportunities. We do \u2013 I think we would continue to describe the pipeline, if you will, as more active than it's been in a while. And so, as we always do, I think we kind of look at that landscape, we look at our ability to or opportunity to purchase \u2013 repurchase our own stock as well, and we sort of try and measure each of those opportunities against each other. And obviously, we have an exceptionally strong balance sheet with very low leverage levels which allows us to pursue multiple opportunities at once, and that's going to continue to be our plan. Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : A.J., I'd also point out that in addition to the $500 million we've spent, we're very excited about our hospital under construction in Las Vegas. We have built an acute care hospital a year. We're spending between $155 million and $185 million on those hospitals. So, we are making investments in the acute business, and as opportunities present themselves, we are ready to take advantage of them. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Yeah. I guess, I called it a little psych \u2013 I guess those weren't so little, actually. Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: I wasn't going to correct you, A.J. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Steve, I appreciate those comments around sort of what we saw in the last nursing shortage, and I'm just curious on the overall labor pressures. I guess, volume sequentially or relatively similar, so what's causing that need for temporary labor? Has there just been more turnover and you're not sort of filling those roles? Any sense of where these nurses and clinicians are getting hired? Are they going to non-traditional channels at this point? And then, if you could also comment, any physician compensation or recruitment issues within that labor or is this really all just nursing? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: So, let me address the first one. I think on the \u2013 if we're seeing any pressure on physician staffing, I think it tends to be on the behavioral side. We've mentioned this, I think, once or twice before. At least in some specific markets, it's been difficult for us to hire the appropriate number of psychiatrists. And that's been a bit of a drag, both to the degree that we can \u2013 we don't add a sufficient number of psychiatrists, we will see our volumes pressured a little bit. Behavioral admissions were a little bit soft in Q3, and I think as I look around the portfolio, there are a market or two where I would attribute some of that softness to a shortage of physicians. Also to the degree that we're using temporary physicians, that pushes our operating expense up in the behavioral division, and you'll see that in the Q a little bit and you'll see the specific pressure on our operating expenses in behavioral \u2013 again, around the margins at least. On the acute side, it's a good question. Exactly why this problem is sort of bubbling up at the moment, Josh, my sense is that to some degree there has been a bit of a skepticism out in the field that the really strong volumes that we've been generating were going to continue, and I think there's always a bit of hesitancy to hire nurses when you're not sure if volume strength will continue. So, I think that may have been it. I think there may have been some unnecessary skepticism about the need for those nurses, but I think that's now become clear. Turnover hasn't increase for us. I know some of our peers have mentioned that. We're constantly trying to drive turnover rates down, and I'm not sure that we're terribly successful in driving them down, but I certainly think that they've been stable for us. And then finally, this idea that there's a lot of these sort of alternate care providers, FED providers et cetera. I think in our markets at least the numbers of those sorts of providers and the amount of people they're hiring is relatively immaterial, so it doesn't seem to me to be the item that's really driving this. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just one quick follow up, are you seeing any delays on Medicaid enrollment? Are you seeing anything different at the state level in terms of their ability to process and enroll some of these previously uninsured individuals? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Yeah. I mean, again, I know that was cited by one of our peers. I checked with our folks this morning because I have not heard that, and they sort of reiterated that is not been an issue for us. So, I don't think that's what's driving our uncompensated experience. Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking question. I know you said it wasn't entirely clear what was causing the slowdown in commercial volumes, comparatively anyway. Is there any indication that you're seeing individuals that were previously covered by exchange plans coming off of those plans? Or do you think it's more just seasonal weakness in the third quarter that comes back in the fourth quarter? What were your thoughts there? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Yeah. And again, I know that one of our peers cited that as sort of a dynamic as well. And it's an intellectually, kind of intuitively obvious argument. It seems logical that that could be happening. Other than a couple of anecdotal examples that we've been able to gather, we're really not able to generate sort of any measurable data that would suggest we're seeing that in sort of large volumes. We'll continue to watch that. Again, Gary, I'm going to repeat a comment I made a little bit ago. I think sometimes, it can be a mistake to draw really broad conclusions about one quarter's worth of metrics. We tried, we're exploring and we certainly dive into these numbers when we see them, but none of these other explanations, at least for us, seem to be terribly obvious or explanations that we could really prove out. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then could you give us an update on the UK behavioral market, the acquisition environment, any update on pricing or reimbursement issues there? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: The operational environment has been very good. We've said from the beginning in the Cygnet acquisition \u2013 is just about a year old at this point \u2013 that Cygnet pretty much every single quarter, and the third quarter was no exception, has exceeded our expectations. Their volumes and occupancy rates are extremely high. They continue to pursue opportunities that include building new beds at existing hospitals, doing some de novo development, doing some small acquisition work and looking at acquisitions of various sizes. So, we continue to be very positive about our entry into the UK behavioral market and are working very sort of pointedly with our local management there to continue to grow that platform. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. So I want to again come back to the uncompensated care issue, Steve, if I may. You said it's in South Texas and it's probably not the slow Medicaid application processing. Have you had any kind of anecdotal data at your ED departments or whatever, that some of these people have been in exchanges and are now (33:28-33:33) or is it they just got \u2013 lost their jobs and there's an (33:36-33:37) enroll in Medicaid or exchanges or whatever, and they're not \u2013 they're not insured right now. Did you ever (33:42) get a sense for it and despite that all of you are seeing, how structural is this for 2016 because it meaningfully changes forecast? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Yeah. So, a couple of things. I mean I just wanted to clarify a little bit. I mean, what I said was that the increase in uncompensated care was most evident in the South Texas market and that's true. But I don't want to leave the impression that it was completely limited. We saw an uptick in uncompensated care in some other markets as well. I mean, again, I think you're asking the question that Gary asked, maybe a little bit differently. I mean we're not able to attribute that increase to \u2013 specifically to commercial exchange patients or subscribers not being able to make their premium payments. We're not really able to subscribe \u2013 or ascribe the increase to anything in particular. And I think that our sort of outlook on this is we'll wait and see, we'll try and gather more data as, you know, another month or two passes and do a better job of trying to figure out what's going on. I realize that there's a lot of pressure on folks all over to try and figure this out immediately. I will say this, at the end of the day \u2013 even with the increase in bad debt and uncompensated care pressure, we generated 7.2% acute care revenue growth in the quarter. And if somebody had asked me a year ago whether I would take that, I would have taken that offer in an instant and I'll take it again next quarter if presented to me. So I appreciate the fact that there is a lot of focus on this increase in uncompensated care, but I think sometimes we're looking at the glass in the wrong way. I mean, this glass is half full in my mind when acute care revenues are growing by 7.2% over the prior year. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Fair enough. Your volumes were great in acute, and apologies again if this was asked before; I wasn't (35:52) the call. On Medicare, in the second quarter as well you talked about very strong volumes. How much is Medicare contributing to your acute volume growth? And is (36:02) lapping or is there something structural that we can carry forward in terms of the volume? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Yeah. So the strength in Medicare volumes is something that we've now seen probably for at least three quarters. And I think, as you suggest, probably an explanation for the strength in Medicare volumes is the idea that some of the weakness that we saw a year ago as a result of this shift from inpatients to observation patients has anniversaried a bit. We continue to see observation patients being coded in \u2013 with frequency, but I do think we're lapping some of that. And that makes sense only because all the other explanations that you usually offer for increased volumes -- the ACA impact, or the economic impact -- are generally not relevant to the Medicare population. So I think this idea that we're starting to sort of see some leveling off of some of this pressure on Medicare admissions that we had seen for a few years is a relevant explanation. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And are you (37:13) the managed Medicare relative to traditional? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: No. I mean, I think generally we find that when a population moves from traditional Medicare to managed, it's usually reflected in length of stay pressures rather than in actual admission rate pressures. So no, I don't think we're seeing a big change between the two populations. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : All right. And then finally, on the budget, do you have any thoughts on that, assuming nobody else asked. Because if they did, then no need to go back into it. Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: No. I mean, I think that there's still some clarification that we as an industry are looking for, but I think with the major change being to alternate site payments and the idea that I think hospitals are not going to be able to use hospital rates for some alternate site payments. I think we may see a slowdown in the way hospitals in general approach some of those off-campus strategies. I would say that this has not been a huge part of the UHS model and, obviously, whatever we have is grandfathered anyway according to the deal as I understand it. So, I don't view it as a real significant change to our operating outlook at the moment. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Apologies if this was asked, I hopped on a little late. But did you give the exchange volume in the quarter, Steve, and how that has tracked over the last couple of quarters? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Ralph, not specifically exchange volume. I talked a little bit about commercial volume in general. I think, we, as a company, sort of said at the beginning \u2013 with the beginning of this year that we really weren't \u2013 were no longer trying to separate out discreetly the impact of the ACA or exchanges, et cetera, and really haven't done so all year and certainly are not going to do so this quarter. But I did talk about the fact that commercial exchange volume growth slowed some in the third quarter \u2013 not commercial exchange, just commercial volume in general slowed some in the third quarter. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, what about acuity mix in the quarter? Did you give that and was that a favorable impact? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: I didn't give it. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that surgical volumes slowed a little bit. One of the comments that I had made in the first two quarters of this year was that for the first time in a long time, inpatient surgeries and the growth in inpatient surgeries were outpacing the growth in outpatient surgeries. In the third quarter, we sort of returned back to where we had been in the last few years, where outpatient surgeries were growing faster than inpatient. Although both continue to grow at a decent pace, but that's I think an indication of a small decline in acuity and contributed a little bit to that \u2013 again, the slowdown in overall revenue growth. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, just on the \u2013 I guess on the behavioral side with the regs out, sort of the IMD exclusion. To the extent that it does hold, do you see this as sort of an immediate benefit as we head into 2016 or is there something you need to do in terms of outreaching and education that would suggest that any benefit would be kind of later in the year as opposed to early in the year? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Well, I think there is a couple of issues. I mean, one is the rule has yet to be published in final form, and we certainly don't know exactly when that's going to happen. I'm actually told that CMS has a number of sort of pending rules in their queue. And I think there is some speculation they may not get to this one until early in 2016, and we're not sure at that point when the effective date would be. So, that's an issue right away. I mean we just don't know when the rule and the effective date is going to be. But when the rule is issued, there is some amount of that work to be done. These patients are being treated for the most part in existing acute care facilities today, and we have work to do to, I think, communicate with those acute care facilities and see if there is an opportunity \u2013 and this is really a market-by-market effort to cooperate with them and \u2013 and see if those patients can't be treated in sort of a more efficient way and mutually efficient way for both the acute care hospital and for us. We also have to work with the managed Medicaid companies to negotiate rates. I don't view that as a big hurdle, but something that has to be done. So, there are a few steps that have to be taken once the rule does become effective. So, at the moment, it's certainly impossible to predict what the impact on 2016 might be at this point. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. And then just a last one, I don't know if you have the stats with you, Steve, or not, but uninsured admissions relative to uninsured adjusted admissions, did one sort of outpace the other? Is there any way to put some context around whether the admissions was growing sort of at a faster pace than the adjusted admission simply \u2013 or specifically for the uninsured? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Yeah. I mean, uninsured admissions, I did say earlier, were probably up 6% or 7% in the quarter. I don't really know what the adjusted admission number is for uninsureds. I would say that generally the adjusted admission number for uninsureds doesn't vary greatly from the admission number, just because we don't have the large component outpatient revenue that we have for our regular admissions. It's basically ER revenue is the bulk of the outpatient revenue that we have. So, there's usually not a huge difference. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. That's fine. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Steve, do you feel like the acute care business has just gotten to be much more seasonal over the years? For years you've been earning less in the third quarter, more in the fourth quarter; anything just about physician behavior, vacation, employment benefits? I just don't know why we sit here and conclude that flat growth off of a year where your EBITDA expanded 85% is really a problem especially with this volume. So I feel like a lot of this is an overreaction, but I don't know. I'm just kind of curious as you scan the landscape and see what's going on, everyone's missing for different reasons right now. Just curious if you have any sort of perspective on what you think is occurring? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Well, thanks for the question, Whit. I think that the traditional seasonality of the business has been distorted over the last couple of years with the implementation of ACA, with Medicaid expansion in some of our big states, with commercial enrollment, commercial exchange enrollment, with the I think the dynamic in the fourth quarter \u2013 people exhausting co-pays and deductibles and having elective procedures done in the fourth quarter and that becoming more of an issue as co-pays and deductibles become a bigger part of the overall landscape. But I think the one sort of constant in all that is the third quarter has sort of traditionally been the weakest quarter. Honestly, when I saw our third quarter results a few weeks ago before anyone also commented on theirs, I generally thought they were kind of a slight miss that I attributed mostly to seasonality. I'm not actually sure that, having seen what other people have said, I really feel like that's wholly different. I mean again, I think we're \u2013 I'm back to the idea of feeling pretty good about a quarter in which lots of our surgeons and physicians are on vacation, lots of our patients are on vacation, elective procedures are usually down pretty significantly in the quarter, and we still grew our revenue by over 7%. I'm still feeling pretty good about the fundamental performance of that acute division. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): No, that's helpful. And just to be clear there, there wasn't any change in your charity care policy within the quarter, correct? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: That's correct. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And just one last one, just any update on the investigation? Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: No, not really. I think it \u2013 as we've sort of said, at some point we'll begin probably a more serious conversation with the government, but that has not occurred yet. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we have no further questions. Thank you at this time. Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP: Okay. Thanks to everybody and we'll talk to everybody at the end of the year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UHS Fourth Quarter 2015 and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Brent. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $6.76 for the year and $1.74 for the quarter. After adjusting for the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications in our acute care hospitals, as well as the other items attributable to last year's fourth quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 12% to $170.7 million or $1.71 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $152 million or $1.51 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2014. On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.6% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015, over the comparable prior year quarter. We define operating margins as operating income or net revenues less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses and supplies expense divided by net revenues. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.1% and 27.9% during the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 7.3% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions increased 4.8%, while revenue per adjusted admission increased 3.3%. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 17.2% during the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to 16.8% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.021 billion during 2015, as compared to $1.036 billion during 2014. The small decrease is primarily attributable to $199 million unfavorable change in working capital accounts experienced during 2015 as compared to 2014, resulting mainly from the timing of disbursements. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 52 days during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 54 days during the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 45%. We spent $110 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $379 million during the full year of 2015. During 2016, we expect to spend approximately $400 million to $425 million on capital expenditures, which include expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities. In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 478,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $58 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we purchased an additional 887,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $99 million. $77 million remains on the previous authorization, and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an additional $400 million in share repurchases. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016 is $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.17 per diluted share of EHR impact expected during 2016, as described in our press release. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 4% to 10% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $6.87 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, as calculated on the Supplemental Schedule included in last night's press release. During 2016, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $9.75 billion to $9.85 billion, representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over 2015 net revenues. We are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, everybody. Maybe just to drill down a little further on the components of the 2016 guidance, Steve, possibly can you give us any commentary around your thoughts on revenue or EBITDAR growth by segment? And are there any other items in there that impact the guidance, like acquisitions, further share buybacks, or new development that we should think about? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay, A.J. So, I think we've been fairly transparent over the course of the last few months in talking about our outlook for next year. In terms of the two segments, I think on the acute side, we see revenue growth of about 6% next year in the acute division same store. On the behavioral side, probably a little bit lower, maybe 5%. I think the acute care 6% is split fairly evenly between price and volume, and I think the behavioral 5% is probably weighted a little more towards volume rather than to price. And I think in both divisions, we expect margins to increase slightly if we can achieve those revenue growth levels. In terms of unusual items or other things that are not included in what I just went through, we have talked for many quarters now that we will be opening a new sixth acute care hospital in Las Vegas. We estimate that to occur in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. That's probably a $5 million to $10 million EBITDA drag on the back half of next year as we have pre-opening and then \u2013 pre-opening cost and startup losses. And it's probably a bit more of a drag at the net income line as the depreciation and interest associated with that facility comes online. We probably lose a few million dollars next year on foreign exchange impact in the UK. We probably lose a few million dollars on a decline in, what we call, special Medicaid reimbursement monies which would be UPL and disproportionate share and provider taxes. And I think the only other probably noteworthy item about our guidance is that as has always been our historical practice, we assume that our free cash flow is dedicated to the repayment of debt and all \u2013 the only share repurchase or other deployment of capital that we build into our guidance and build into our model is that which has already occurred. And so, I think it's a fairly conservative way of thinking about 2016 capital deployment because repayment of debt at the moment is the least accretive of all of our capital deployment options. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : And on that last point, I would assume you're including the $99 million you've purchased to date or is that not included in guidance, year-to-date this year? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : That is included. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Maybe my follow-up would be just \u2013 so you're assuming that you get a rebound in the psych revenues to your long-term target of at least 5%. Obviously, the last two quarters you've been a little bit below that. Can you comment on a little more? I know you've talked about some shortage of clinicians. Is that still the primary driver and how quick can that be addressed? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I mean I would point out, A.J., that I think one of the drivers of the somewhat softer behavioral revenues in Q4 was a pretty difficult comparison to last year, particularly on the volume side. I think same-store admissions, behavioral admissions in the fourth quarter of last year were up 6.8%. And so I think we always knew that was going to be a tough nut to compare to in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, as you alluded to, we have talked in the last quarter or two about the fact that in some of our markets and I think the national data is supportive of this as well, we're facing a shortage to some degree of psychiatrists, in many cases and in some cases, nursing and other clinical professionals and again in some markets that's causing us to not be able to treat all the patients who present themselves for admission and it mutes our volume and ultimately our revenue numbers in some of those markets. We feel like the 5% number that I have identified as being embedded in our revenue guidance for next year is absolutely achievable. We are working our way through the shortages in many of these markets. The comparisons certainly become easier as the year goes on. Next year, I would suggest that, that 5% may be a little bit back-end loaded as we work through the comparisons and work through some of the clinical shortages. But I think we feel like the number is eminently achievable. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : A.J., Steve talked about how we put together the guidance, et cetera, and all of the charges we have as we go through it, I want to point out that Henderson Hospital, which will open as you mentioned in the fourth quarter, will cost us in the short run obviously, but Temecula Hospital, which we opened a couple of years ago, has been running well, well ahead of budget. So, we made some pretty good investments. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I mean Las Vegas is a market that keeps on giving, I guess, for you guys in Southern California, too, to some degree. Thanks a lot. Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Great, thanks. Just want to go into the acute care side of things and the margins and I guess, this is the second quarter of 7% type growth and margin contraction. Just want to see if you go through some of the issues, is it the same issues that were impacting Q3 margins that were impacting Q4, and why do you feel comfortable that margins are going to be up next year or this year? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, I'm not sure where the commentary on margin contraction comes from, Kevin. I mean in my remarks, I pointed out that on a same facility basis, acute care margins were 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014. So... Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I'm sorry. Then I guess the issues that you talked about in Q3 then, have they been addressed in Q4? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I think that we had clinical shortages, personnel shortages on the acute side in Q3 as did some of our peers. And what we said at that time was that we thought we could hire enough permanent nurses to generally overcome most of the problem. We thought that we'd make progress in the fourth quarter and continue to make progress into the first part of 2016. And I think that's the way it shaped up. We definitely made progress in Q4, and I think we'll make some further progress in the first half of 2016. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then I guess the bad debt spiked in Q3, I guess, it was up year-over-year in Q4 but down sequentially from where you were. Can you talk a little bit about the trends there? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I mean \u2013 so I think when you know \u2013 you're looking at the uncompensated care numbers and they are certainly up in Q4. That's almost always going to be the case simply as a function of pricing because of the way we calculate that. Our uninsured admission growth in Q4 actually slowed a little bit. In Q3, our uninsured admission growth was tracking ahead of our overall admission growth, and that trend reversed itself in Q4 while our overall uninsured admissions were up. They were up slightly slower than our overall admissions. So, I think our payer mix seems to be settling in to a bit more of a stable environment in Q4. And again, I think we're just extremely pleased at the overall even after uncompensated care is included, 7% plus growth in acute care revenues in Q4. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And do you expect payer mix to be stable into 2016? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think that's generally our expectation, to be fair. Payer mix is probably the most difficult of \u2013 sort of all the assumptions and all the metrics to predict. But our general sense is that the two items that have affected payer mix over the last few years have been the ACA and its favorable impact on improving payer mix. And we think that that has been moderating over the last few years and will continue to moderate next year and it's part of the reason why we think our acute care revenue growth moderates from the 8% or so in 2015 to more like 6% in 2016. And then the improving economies, I don't think we necessarily feel like our local market economies are improving as rapidly as they were in 2014 and 2015, but I think we feel like they certainly will remain stable in 2016. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I think you might have alluded to this a little bit, but just a question broadly on labor cost. I think you mentioned on the psych side still seeing more, I guess, on the physician and I guess a little bit in nursing. But anything more broadly in terms of labor cost and more specifically on the acute care side? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I mean, I think what we said in Q3 vis-\u00e0-vis the acute care labor sort of situation was that we felt like our use of temporary nurses or registry nurses was greater than it should be, that's a function, I think, of a number of things including turnover rates that we'd like to drive somewhat lower, decisions that are made exactly when and how to hire permanent nurses, et cetera. And I think we generally attributed the increase in salary expense and the pressure on salary expense in Q3 to some inefficiencies in terms of not hiring as many permanent nurses as we needed to in Q3. And again, I think we felt like that was a transient problem that we can address. And as I was commenting to Kevin, I think we felt like we did address it in Q4. Clearly, the numbers got better. And I think our expectation is frankly they'll continue to improve into 2016. Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And you put contract labor and other expense, right? It's not in the SWB line, is that right? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, contract nurses are in the salary line. Contract physicians are in the other operating expense line. Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just a second question, just on the buybacks. You guys have been a little bit more active to start the year. Should we read into that in terms of anything around the M&A landscape or other uses? I mean, you guys obviously don't have a leverage issue, in my opinion, so I'm sure you can do both. But I just want to make sure we shouldn't be reading into the environment or something like that. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, I think, Josh, we share your view that our leverage levels are such that we are flexible enough to do any number of things to respond to M&A opportunities as well as to be a share repurchaser if the market dictates that. Our commentary in the last few quarters and I would repeat it, I don't think it has changed in Q4 is that we think the M&A landscape is still active for us on both sides of the business. We completed two reasonably sized behavioral deals in the back half of last year and continue to look at others into 2016. We've commented that the landscape and the market for acute care deals that are, I think, more suitable in our minds for what has been historically our market profile of more suburban, midsize, urban markets, larger hospitals, larger hospital systems seems more active. It's always difficult to predict which of those deals or how many of those deals might ultimately prove to be actionable or executable. But we certainly feel like it is more active. But also, like many of you, I think we have viewed the decline in our stock over the last couple of quarters as really not something that has been justified by the underlying fundamentals of the business, which we don't feel have changed very much over the last six months. And as a consequence, we feel that their degree of confidence in our underlying business and feel like the current valuations of our stock are a compelling opportunity as well. And that's why we've become a more active acquirer of shares as well. So, I think as you suggest and I think, given our balance sheet and our flexibility, we're going to pursue any and all of these opportunities that continue to make economic sense for us. Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Hi. Sorry. Just first, a soapbox comment, which I guess, you've gotten before, that we appreciate the fact that you don't waste 20, 25 minutes of your time and our time reading through the press release and go right to questions. So, thank you very much for that. Let me ask about the bad debt trend, recognizing that the strong acute revenue growth was more important than that. Can you give us any granularity? I know last quarter, you talked about the South Texas market being an area where you saw an uptick in uncompensated care. Is that continuing or is there anything to spike out from there? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, Matt, I think from a geographic perspective, we have said now, frankly, for several quarters that if you look at our acute care results overall, the Las Vegas market, the Southern California market has generally been tracking above the average acute care result. And I think that's true across the board in terms of volumes and revenue and payer mix and bad debt. And we've said that the Texas market and markets, because we have multiple markets in Texas, have generally been lagging the average. And I think that was true in Q4. I'm not exactly sure why that is. Obviously, there is a great deal of focus and speculation that that's oil and gas-related and driven. We tend not to be in markets that are directly impacted by the oil and gas business. So, I'm not certain that that's the main driver or the only driver for sure. But certainly, our Texas markets for the last several quarters have been underperforming the acute care average. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for that. And one more question, if I could, on a different topic. Amidst all the pressure on insurers, on the ACA exchange business, what are you generally seeing in terms of the dynamic for commercial rate negotiations, both as it relates to that business and generally, the larger core group business as well? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So, let me address that, I think, both in terms of volume and price. And I'll make the comment, and I think we've been making this comment and expressing this view longer and probably more adamantly than some of our peers and that is, we've always found it difficult to precisely carve out our ACA experience and separate out exactly what our ACA commercial experience and rates are versus our overall commercial experience. And I would say, we continue \u2013 and honestly, as the ACA has progressed and we're now well into our third year \u2013 actually into our fourth year of it, I think that we find that even more difficult. So, my commentary is probably more about commercial rates just generally than about ACA rates, specifically, and that is we don't see tremendous changes either in our rate of increase. I think our commercial rates have increased still average in the 6%, 6.5% range. It varies to some degree by contract, by market. But I think that's still our average. And I don't think we're really seeing significant changes in other terms. In benefit plan design, we're not seeing an emphasis on narrow networks that I think we actually expected we would see more of, et cetera. So, I think as we enter 2016 and as we think about creating our model for 2016, it is more of the same, as much as anything. Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. That's it. Sorry. Go ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to the staffing shortages and maybe, more particularly, I think you mentioned psychiatrists. That doesn't sound overly transient. But maybe you could talk through the dynamics there, how you can sort of fix that and whether this is also an area of higher wage pressure that we should expect on the behavioral side of the business going forward. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So, look, I think that your comment, Ralph, in the sense that I believe we're facing psychiatrist shortages in specific markets because I think, nationally, the data suggests that the number of new psychiatrists over the last decade have not kept up or have lagged the overall number of new doctors, so the percentage of psychiatrists is actually declining. And I agree with you. That is a kind of more structural issue. I believe the market tends to correct for that, in that as the demand for psychiatrists increases, as psychiatrists' earnings increase, more and more people get attracted to the field, more and more practicing psychiatrists will choose to devote at least some of their hours to clinical activities, rather than to academic or other activities. So, I do think there is some market correction that goes on for all this. In addition, I think \u2013 and the trend, what my commentary about this being a transient problem is really meant to imply that I believe we can pull levers in our markets to address the issue. We can more aggressively recruit for psychiatrists. We can bring psychiatrists into a market that has a shortage. Your comment that that may cost us more money and, in fact, I think does cost us more money if you look at, one of the reasons I think that our behavioral margins have come under pressure is because the cost of acquiring psychiatrists has also gone up in addition to there being some pressure on our volumes. And the other thing that I think we do in markets where the regulatory environment allows us to is we create physician extenders, nurses and other clinicians who can do some of the tasks that psychiatrists are sometimes asked to do. And that helps us as well in terms of not having enough psychiatrists. So, we're doing all those things, and pulling all those levers and aggressively focus on the issue. And to some degree, I think, our confidence that we're going to do those things better than some of our peers in our markets causes me to comment or to believe that this is a transient sort of issue that we can overcome. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. But the behavioral revenue up 5%, we should think of an ability to still get to sort of EBITDA growth on a same-store basis of at least that 5% versus maybe a little bit below? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : That's certainly what we have embedded in our guidance. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, all right. Fair enough. And then just quickly on the acute side, you posted volume trends well in excess of peers for several quarters now. I know you are in a smaller subset of markets and have a little bit of a smaller hospital base. But any sense of dynamics within your specific markets about whether you think all hospitals within your areas are seeing similar trends? Do you think you are taking market share? Have you seen hospital closures? Just anything that stands out around the disproportionately better volume trends you're seeing? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think as your question suggests, Ralph, it's a combination of factors. We tended to be in markets that were disproportionately hurt by the recession and had higher unemployment rates. I think that a number of sell-side folks did analysis during the recession of where unemployment was the highest. And when they compare the public companies, I think we often fared the worst during the height of the recession in places like Las Vegas, and Southern California, South Florida, South Texas. But what we suggested at the time and we believed was that when the economy recovered and when those local market economies recovered, we would benefit disproportionately from those recoveries. And I think that has certainly been an element of what has happened over the course of the last few years. As Las Vegas has come, I would suggest, roaring back, we've really benefited from that, for example. But I think we also believe that in many of our markets, we are aggressively increasing our market share. Both Alan and I mentioned the fact that in our big California market, which is Riverside County, we built a new hospital several years ago. In the Las Vegas market, we're building a new hospital to open later this year. We continue to take those very obvious actions and other not-so-obvious actions to cement, enhance and increase our market share in most of our acute care markets, and I think we have done that fairly successfully over the last few years as well. So, I think both of those dynamics are at play when you see the really robust and industry-leading acute care revenue growth that we've been putting up. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Ryan Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. This is Ryan Halsted on for Gary. I was hoping you could drill more into your behavior revenue growth guidance. The 5% is towards the low end, I guess, of your \u2013 of past ranges and certainly below where you have grown in the recent past. So I was hoping maybe you could just provide a little more color on the reimbursement environment and what makes you a little cautious on that outlook. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Ryan. So, actually, I think as the conversation and commentary has been so far in the call, the issue for us is not so much caution about the pricing environment which I think, actually, has been fairly healthy, and I think even if you look at Q4, the 2.5% pricing growth on our revenue per day in behavioral is, quite frankly, as good as and a little better than we expected. So that I don't think is the concern going into or the caution \u2013 I should say the caution going into 2016. I think the caution is some of the volume pressures that we've seen over the last few quarters, and I think those volume pressures are manifested in a few different areas. The area that we talked about the most historically and certainly over the last few quarters has been length-of-stay compression that even when we were posting really strong admission growth, length-of-stay compression was muting or diminishing that growth to a degree. I think the length-of-stay pressure is starting to alleviate some and so we're hopeful that will continue, but the admission softness that we've seen as a result of \u2013 again two things. Very difficult comparisons in the beginning of 2016 that I think clouds some of our guidance for the year, and then some of the issues we've had over the clinician shortages that we've been talking about and while, as I've said in my previous commentary, I think we can address those. It may take a quarter or two. So, I think that's really what has caused us to be a little more muted about our behavioral revenue growth. And obviously, in the long-term, we think that the tailwinds for behavioral revenue growth have a lot of potential. We haven't really talked in this call about the potential for the IMD exclusion being partially or fully lifted. But we believe that will occur and when it does, that will provide an opportunity for another step-up in behavioral volumes that we're likely to see not so much in 2016, but in 2017 and thereafter. Ryan Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, that's very helpful. And then my second question. If you take a look at your segment EBITDAR on a same-store basis, I realize there was some margin pressure on the behavioral side. But just even on a year-over-year EBITDAR growth basis, it looked like, combined, the segments were up nicely. But then comparing that with the consolidated EBITDAR, the growth year-over-year wasn't as much. So, I was just wondering if there was anything on a non-same-store basis or on a corporate overhead basis that I should be thinking about, or am I not thinking about this correctly? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I mean there's nothing that really stands out, Ryan. I will make the comment that we did have a favorable malpractice adjustment last year, and I know just from talking to some analysts last night that not everybody was taking that into account. So, I would just ask people to go back and make sure they've \u2013 we, if you will, equalize that adjustment in our supplemental schedule. So, I would just sort of ask everybody to focus on making sure they've done that. I think other than that, I can't think of any really significant changes other than as we disclosed. Last year, we acquired an insurance company, insurance product in our acute care division last year. That's been a little bit of a drag, although I don't think it's a huge needle mover. Ryan Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Hi, Steve. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Ana. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Again, coming back to bad debt, you had improved your bad debt pretty nicely, I think, sequentially. And in the third quarter, a lot of the companies had issues. For the most part, there has been some improvement into the fourth quarter. There was speculation around exchanges. The, I think, ACA talked about Medicaid application processing in communities taking that write-down on collectability of the consumer cost sharing piece of it. Was this just a spike and a blip in the third quarter? And do you feel out of the woods and so we should look at your bad debt slap now into 2016 taking the baseline from 4Q? Or are there any uncertainties as you look at your revenue cycle management and you're trying to drill down into what happened there? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Sure. So, to be perfectly candid, I think we struggled in Q3 with explaining the increase in uncompensated volumes. As you suggest, some of our peers offered explanations that included some level of disenrollment in the exchanges as exchange participants found their premiums going up where they suggested that maybe some exchange participants had game the system and enrolled to get certain care but then disenrolled when they got that care. Those explanations seemed reasonable, and we can sort of find anecdotal examples within our own experience to support those explanations. But don't really have the vast database to really be able to validate them in any pervasive or comprehensive way. And I think our fourth quarter experience would suggest that even if those explanations were valid in Q3, they didn't necessarily extend into Q4. The other question you asked about, which I think, we certainly would concur with the experience. I mean we have seen that as the ACA has been implemented and as exchange plans have become more prevalent and many of them have high deductable, high co-insurance components to them that the level of \u2013 or the amount of the bill due from the patient has gone up, and as a consequence, the level of bad debt on that portion of the bill has also gone up. We believe that our accounting for that change has been real time and current all along and has been reflected over the course of the last several years in our current results. So, I don't feel like \u2013 we feel like there's any catch-up required in the way that we're recognizing that phenomena for financial statement purposes. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Steve. And on the volumes, just coming back to the acute care volumes, I think it sounds like you're saying to an earlier question that it was more secular growth than share shifting from other players in the markets that you are in. As you saw the 4Q trends on both volumes and on acuity and then coming into the first quarter, anything you are seeing in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter from a seasonality perspective or the acuity or types of decisions that would tell us what the drivers of that volume growth is? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So just to go back, and I would say that what \u2013 my answer before was really meant to say that I think our acute care revenues in general are benefiting from both the improvement in our end market economies, as well as the ACA benefit. And honestly, I think, sometimes, it's difficult for us to distinguish precisely between the two and market share gains as well. So, again, I think all those dynamics are contributing. In terms of, I think, forward-looking into just the early part of 2016, I think \u2013 and I think most of the surveys have suggested this that the end of 2015 and the beginning of January were slow from a volume perspective on the acute side. I think that may be attributable to the fact that it was a late starting and relatively slow flu season. But I would say over the course of the last six weeks from the middle of January to the end of February, acute care activity, at least at our hospitals, seems to be pretty robust and certainly doesn't give us any pause about being able to continue to achieve the numbers that we identified before. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And one final question on the IMD exclusion. There was a very recent news flow, I think, last week that CMS sent this to the Office of Management and Budget. Were there any changes or markups from the behavioral hospital industry and/or managed Medicaid in the version that has gone there relative to what we saw last May? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We believe that the version, particularly in terms of the provisions that are most relevant to us, remains intact and viewed the news item that you point out as a good one or a positive one in the sense that, even though the process is moving albeit a little bit slower than we would like, it is moving. And as I was saying before, I think we expect the pending CMS rule to be issued sometime this year. And we would hope that the effective date would be no later than the beginning of next year and that would provide a tailwind for our behavioral business and our behavioral volumes going into next year. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks, Steve, very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for the question. Steve, I apologize if I missed this, but did you provide an update on how your UK operations are performing? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We didn't. We didn't get that specific question. The UK commentary over the last few quarters has been that both our original Cygnet acquisition as well as our subsequent Alpha acquisition and our smaller one-offs and new beds are really generally doing quite well. Occupancy rates for our UK behavioral hospitals, on average, are in the low-90s. And we continue to look for further expansion opportunities and the ability to grow that platform in the UK, which we continue to remain very enthusiastic about. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Do you think the review of the Priory transaction, Acadia's transaction with the Priory Group, do you think that would provide some opportunities for one-off facility pickups? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Obviously, hard for me to answer that question because I think it's a function of : A, what the trade commission in the UK decides to do, if anything, when they review the transaction; and, obviously, B, what Acadia decides to do with their portfolio of hospitals, either in response to the trade commission action or in response to other priorities that they may have. So, again, I think we're looking at all opportunities in the UK. And we'll respond to any and all opportunities that arise, whether they're from that transaction or from, I think, a host of other sources that we're obviously exploring at the same time. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And lastly, in April, the comprehensive joint replacement bundling initiative begins. I'm sure you've made arrangements to prepare for that. Maybe if you could discuss that a little bit. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So, all of our acute care hospitals have participated in Medicare's bundled payment demonstration project so far. I think and, again, I don't believe our experience is in any way unique. I think we're finding the data that Medicare is providing, both in terms of the amount and level and timeliness of that data, to be somewhat insufficient for us to be able to really participate in this in a meaningful way and make meaningful changes. So, I think we're probably likely to actually step back our level of activity and step back in when I think the program is working more efficiently and I think some of the kinks are worked out. But to your point, I mean, I think we've on, from an infrastructure perspective, prepared and feel very prepared for what we think is going to be the long-term trend in this industry, which are more coordinated, more collaborative payments, more risk-based payments. We've done a lot of work over the last several years to be prepared for that and I think feel like we are. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Just curious, any commentary around surgical volumes and ED volumes, what were they and how does that compare to recent trends? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So, Frank, I think surgical volumes, as has been the trend for the last few years, continue to outpace even our admissions growth. And I think on the surgical side, surgical volumes are up overall. In Q4, we returned a little bit more to what we've been seeing, the historical pattern where, I think, outpatient volumes are up like 4% and inpatient volumes are up 2%. We went through a few quarters where inpatient was actually outpacing outpatient and that was really contributing to some very strong revenue and revenue acuity. This is a bit more normalized, but, again, in the end, still helping us put up 7% acute care revenue growth, which we're quite pleased with. Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Got you. And just curious, you announced an acquisition back in the fall. I haven't heard you really talk much about it, in the addiction treatment area, the Foundations acquisition. I just wonder if you could give us an update there on how that transaction has been working and from our perspective, we thought it had a chance of being relatively accretive and just any color there? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And I'm sorry, Frank. You faded in the very beginning at least for me. Were you asking about Foundations? Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes, yes. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. I'm sorry. I thought you were. Yeah. So Foundations, which was a behavioral acquisition that we did in October of last year, really, from our perspective, was intended to enhance our presence in the addiction recovery business. UHS has been in the addiction recovery business for as long as we've been in the behavioral business, for 30-plus years. But the Foundations' model, business model, is a bit different. It's a bit more of an out-of-network model, although it's a fairly balanced in and out of network source of patients. And it's much more of a direct-to-consumer marketing model than our traditional referral-based model. And what we thought is that the Foundations' approach and the Foundations' infrastructure and their very nuanced patient capture system and technology that they have would be a nice complement both to our existing addiction treatment businesses, as well as to other like-diagnoses businesses, things like autism and eating disorders. And I think that's really the way it's shaping up. So I think that the early results from Foundations are good and they're encouraging. But I think what we're really most excited about is really taking the best of both of our models, if you will, and combining them, not only in the addiction business, but in some of these other similar diagnoses and service line businesses. And we think the real payoff is further down the road. Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Just one final one, if I can, a clarification on your discussion around CapEx, including construction of the hospital. I'm assuming that's just the one in the Vegas area. Or was there another one that you are contemplating that you are allocating some capital for? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : That's the only acute care hospital. We have a couple of de novo projects that are on the \u2013 in some stage of development on the behavioral side as well. Obviously, those are smaller dollars. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Hi, good morning. Most of my stuff has been answered. But I'm curious about a couple of things. So, you guys can put capital in broadly three different buckets. You can continue to add on in the UK, you can do American behavioral, American \u2013 or American addiction assets or you can look at large U.S. acute assets. Do you have any preference or is it all case by case? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And, John, I would add to that which I know you didn't purposely leave out, the opportunity to repurchase our own shares which we've been doing as well. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure, sure. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Look, I think we have always made the argument and I think we make the argument because we really believe it that we are relatively ambivalent about where we invest our next dollar of capital. And I say \u2013 I use the term ambivalent to mean that we would like to invest our next dollar of capital wherever it is going to earn the best return or certainly earn over our hurdle rate of return. And if there are opportunities in each of those buckets that you described, I think we feel like we have the opportunity and the financial and capital flexibility to do that. On the other hand, I think one of the hallmarks of UHS as a disciplined investor over the years is that if those opportunities are not compelling and they don't meet our return hurdles, we're okay with waiting until we find some that do. And I think that's going to be our approach going forward. It's been our historical approach. And I think the only comment that we've made in the last few quarters is we think that pipeline is fairly active, and we would hope that we'll be able to find some actionable deals out of that pipeline. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And I guess as a follow-on to that, did you guys look at any intensity in the \u2013 at the Priory deal? And was there anything about that that you didn't like, either the price or the mix of assets or just doubling down in the UK? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I mean I'm not \u2013 we're not going to comment on any specific transaction. But I think that most of the transactions that get announced in the public space are transactions that are made available to most of the public players. And on those transactions, we certainly do our due diligence and do our work. And I think we look at the opportunity just as I described, what's the historical growth rate of the assets that are being sold, what's the likely future growth rate, what's the price. And as a consequence, what's the likely return. And there are deals that we either choose not to participate in, or somebody chooses to pay more for. And that's okay with us. I think we historically have gotten most of the deals that we thought really made compelling sense. We don't get them all, but I think we have found that our relatively judicious and deliberative approach to capital deployment has served us well over the years and continue to believe that's the case. Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : John... John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Yeah. Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Steve had covered it very, very adequately. But as you pointed out, we have a number of areas that we can invest. I think we are a prudent investor and it's a question of which appears to have growth possibilities, what's the price and we're indifferent with regard to which area we put it into. But we are certainly concerned about the level of debt of the corporation and the equity and you know that. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So would you \u2013 as the world moves more to outpatient, you have got this impressive fleet of inpatient assets. But are you thinking \u2013 is there any thought in the board level down the road that maybe we need to make a bigger step in an outpatient basis? Or do you think you are adequately covered just blocking and tackling market by market? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I mean, John, we don't talk about outpatient as a discrete business strategy because I think we believe that there's an integrated outpatient strategy in every single one of our acute care markets. We certainly acknowledge the trend that everybody has seen over the last few years of a shift of traditionally inpatient procedures to outpatient and I think in virtually all of our markets, we could discuss in some detail how we've tried to take advantage of that, the facilities that we have either built on our own or acquired, the specific marketing emphasis that we've taken on. But again, I think we have not embarked on a sort of a discrete outpatient strategy, meaning that we've not necessarily been interested in obtaining or embarking on outpatient revenue growth outside of our markets. But we're very aggressively pursuing the strategy within our existing markets. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just lastly, what is spurring \u2013 a couple of you, you and your peer group, there seems to be just a little bit more at the conversation level for acute care assets. And I'm talking about the type of acute care assets that you're screening, not rural or small market. What do you think is driving that? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : I think, John, that as acute care hospitals, in general, think about the changing healthcare landscape. They see, as a question before suggested, a move \u2013 a long-term move from fee-for-service reimbursement to some sort of risk-based reimbursement whether that's bundled payments as we were talking about before or ACO-type payments or capitated payments. That's a huge change and a huge change in the requirements and the expertise of running acute care hospitals and I think a lot of the hospitals that we've talked to worry about their ability to compete in that new landscape, either from a physical facility perspective and information technology perspective, a relationship with physician perspective. I think there are a whole host of changes that hospitals will have to make. And some hospitals, certainly not all, but some hospitals, I think, are deciding that they prefer to have help either greater expertise or greater capital infusion or some combination of both as they embark on those challenges. And in my mind, that's probably what's driving this increased level of interest and activity. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Well, I've taken more than enough time. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Good morning. I just have one question on the acute care business. You mentioned the gain in market share as well as seeing benefits from end market economies and the ACA. And just wondering on the market share side if you can remind us what kind of investments you are making there to keep that edge and to grow your market share. And do you think that that's a piece that could continue on into 2017 and beyond? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. That's a difficult question to answer in a short way, Paula. Because again, I think it is largely a market-by-market discussion, because I think that the strategies in each market are not necessarily the same. But we certainly have talked over the years about investing in physician ownership and physician practices. We've invested in information technology so that we have a more integrated approach with our physicians. We've invested in physical facilities and continuing on to what I was saying to John, and upgrading our outpatient capabilities in particular. We've acquired a number of outpatient facilities in our markets over the last few years. So, again, in the context of having a few more minutes to talk about it, I'd love to talk about maybe some of the individual strategies and individual markets. But suffice it to say at this point that I think it's a multi-pronged approach in each of our markets. Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. That's fair. And just maybe if I could just follow up, you talk about the secular improvement and how much room do you see for economic improvement in some of your markets? Are we full here or do you think there is still some room like in areas like Texas, for example? Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Look, I'm not a macro economist by any means, Paula. So, I answer questions like this with a lot of trepidation. But I will say that during the recession, we saw the negative impacts of this long and profound recession over the course, I would argue of, in some cases, four years or five years in some of our markets, beginning as early as 2009 and continuing in many of these markets through 2013. And so, it would not be surprising to me if the recovery in those same markets was over a similar period. And we're probably three years or so in most of these markets into the recovery. So, while I think the impact is probably starting to diminish, I would still think we have another year or two of positive runway in a lot of these markets. Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : And sir, we have no further questions at this time. Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody's time and patience this morning and look forward to talking with everybody again in a couple of months after the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services First Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.93 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.98 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. On a same facility basis in our acute division, revenues increased 12% during the first quarter of 2016. The increase resulted primarily from a 7.8% increase in adjusted admissions and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.1% during first quarter of 2016 from 20.5% during the first quarter of 2015. On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.5% during the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.4% and adjusted patient days increased 1.0% over the prior-year first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.2% during the first quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior-year quarter. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division decreased to 27.8% during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, as compared to 28.4% during the comparable prior-year period. Our cash provided by operating activities increased 71% to approximately $464 million during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $271 million in the first quarter of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined to 51 days during the first quarter of 2016, and our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 43.3% at March 31, 2016 as compared to 44.6% at March 31, 2015. We spent $127 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. During the first quarter, we opened a total of 182 new behavioral health beds, including 57 beds opened at a new de novo hospital located in Oklahoma and 125 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. Many behavioral health construction projects are underway, including six new de novo hospitals totaling 562 beds. In February of 2016, our board of directors authorized a $400 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which increased the aggregate authorization to $800 million. In conjunction with this program, during the first quarter of 2016 we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $152 million or approximately $113 per share. Since inception of the program through March 31, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $377 million or approximately $117 per share. Alan and I will be pleased to answer questions at this time. [Operator Instructions] Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Tejus Ujjani : Hi. This is Tejus here joining on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. Regarding behavioral, you'd mentioned a shortage of psychiatrists last quarter that led you to turn away patients. Can you provide any update on that? As well as any increase in expense to attract and retain these doctors? Steve Filton : Sure. So, if you look at the behavioral revenue growth for the quarter of about 3.5%, it's pretty consistent of what we were running in the back half of 2015. And I think many of the same dynamics are in place. We had a pretty tough comparison in the first quarter of 2016. So we were not really disappointed with those numbers. They met our expectations, and our behavioral results in general were very much in line with our budget for the quarter. But we continue to face both psychiatrist, nursing and other clinician shortages in some of our markets. And in some cases, that is muting or depressing what would otherwise, we think, be higher demand and higher volumes. We have a number of initiatives in place to try and rectify those dynamics in those situations. And we believe, as we said at the end of the year that our behavioral revenue growth should increase as the year goes on, as those comparisons become easier and as some of those initiatives begin to get more traction. Tejus Ujjani : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial. Frank Lee : Hi. This is Frank Lee on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question. Same-store revenue in the acute care business was very strong in the quarter. Do you have a sense for how much of the growth was attributable to economic improvements in your market or increasing market share? And then are you able to size the impact of the leap year for the quarter? Steve Filton : Yeah. Look, I think it's always difficult to precisely size the impact of leap year. I think on an admissions basis, the extra day just mathematically gives you about 3% more admissions. But in terms of overall revenue, it's a little bit harder to do. Obviously, however you slice it, the revenue growth in the acute care division for the quarter was extremely strong and well in excess of the 6% revenue growth that we anticipated in our guidance and in our budget for the year. Again, I think it's difficult to parse that growth out into individual pieces. We still continue to get some benefit from the ACA and expanded Medicaid enrollment and new commercial exchange enrollment, although certainly that benefit is diminishing now that we're into its third year. We continue to benefit as our markets improve economically, and that certainly continues as well. But I think one of the most encouraging aspects of the quarter from our perspective is the single biggest admission growth for us was in our Medicare payer class. And in theory, Medicare patients are probably largely unimpacted by both the ACA dynamics and by an improving economy. And so I think what that's reflective of is just general strength of the franchises that we're operating in our local markets and the initiatives that our operators have put in place for some time now to create more and more physician integration in our markets, to focus on really important service lines to us like orthopedics and cardiology, and to really just focus on business development. I think that we have had for four or five quarters among the industry-leading admissions from an acute care perspective. And while I know the other companies have yet to report, my guess is we'll certainly be in that position again this quarter. Frank Lee : Okay. Thanks. And then the bad debt bed ratio was pretty flat year-over-year after a few quarters of volatility. Do you think that the bad debt has stabilized at this point? And do you have a view on where that will go for the rest of the year? Steve Filton : Always difficult, as Yogi Bear would say, to predict the future. But for us I think, again, very strong payer mix in the first quarter, Medicare admission growth growing faster than our overall admissions, Medicaid growing at about the same pace as our overall admissions, commercial admissions growing slightly lower, but uninsured admissions flat to actually slightly down and obviously that is an extremely favorable payer mix. Again, hard to say exactly how sustainable that is, but I think we generally feel like the acute care business is running very strongly at the moment, and certainly makes our sense of what was possible in our guidance and in our budget seem extremely achievable at this point. Frank Lee : Okay. Thanks on lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joanna Gajuk : Hey. Good morning. This is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just coming back to the previous commentary around strengthening the volumes in acute care business, so that was really helpful. But also, can you talk about the markets because, I guess, seems like Vegas, I guess, was indicated that things are going well there. So anything that changed maybe in other markets or should we just think about all the trends in 2016 in terms of strong Nevada and California and Texas not that strong, and any color in terms of market performance on acute care pricing? Steve Filton : Sure, Joanna. I mean I think that the practical reality is when you post revenue numbers as strong as we did in Q1, the strength by definition has to be pretty pervasive. It's almost impossible for a single market to drive those kinds of overall strong numbers. Generally, however, I would just sort of comment that many of the trends that we've remarked on in recent quarters have remained in place. You alluded to the fact that our Vegas market has been performing quite well, and that continued into Q1. Our Southern California market has also performed very well. Our Temecula Hospital, which is now in its third year of operation, is performing particularly well, and that's driving some very strong numbers out of Riverside County, California. Washington, DC, has been a strong market for us and was in Q1. We see some weakness in the South Texas markets, which we've remarked on previously, although even their volume numbers were certainly improved in Q1 as well. Joanna Gajuk : Great. And then, turning the topic a little bit on the behavioral side, I guess in terms of the recent circulation or rather the final regs from CMS regarding managed Medicaid and allowing plans to pay for behavioral health in freestanding facilities. So, when we think about it, how are you going to think about these changes taking effect in reality for you specifically? How long, I guess, it would take for the full patterns really to change? Should we think that this would take a year or longer in terms of how it would actually be reflective in your operations? Steve Filton : Well, again I think, Joanna, our commentary on the lifting of the IMD exclusion has been I think reasonably consistent over time and that is we, I think, like others in the freestanding behavioral industry, view the lifting of the IMD exclusion certainly as a positive development, albeit one that will show its impact or reflect its impact gradually over time. It will require some effort to get access to this patient population. And I think we've always said, it's difficult to quantify what the potential benefit will be at the outset. But we I think share what is generally a consensus view that the benefit and the potential benefit is significant. I'll also make the point, and I know we've talked about this a number of times previously, that we view the lifting of the IMD exclusion and our ability to take these patients that have previously been seen in acute care hospitals with behavioral units in a broader context of trying to integrate with the behavioral units in acute care hospitals in our markets for all their patients. We have opened over the course of the last few years a number of leased units that we are \u2013 leased behavioral units that we are leasing from some big not-for-profit acute care hospital systems around the country. We have a number of other similar conversations underway to accomplish the same thing. And while the lifting of the IMD exclusion might help accelerate and expedite those conversations because now we can treat adult Medicaid patients as well, most of those conversations are even broader than that and include Medicare patients, they include commercial patients. And frankly, we view that overall as one of the most significant business development opportunities for our behavioral hospitals over the course of the next few years. So it's an important development, but I think one that fits into really kind of an overall strategy that we're extremely enthusiastic about. Joanna Gajuk : Right now, we agree that those changes will take time till it'll be very positive. But then I guess on the flip side, the commentary around the continued shortage of clinicians on the behavioral side, I guess, with those changes and potential I guess for additional volumes coming your way, would I guess the shortage make things I guess more difficult when this is really happening where you have the IMD exclusion. But then this would actually create more pressure on labor. Is that the way you think about it? Or do you kind of think that there are some [indiscernible] in terms of the shortage to kind of moderate or rather be able to offset that? Steve Filton : Yeah. I'm going to answer the question quickly, because I want to give others on the call a chance to ask their questions as well. But I think the issue to keep in mind is that this adult Medicaid population that's affected by the IMD for the most part is currently being treated. They're being treated in acute care hospitals with behavioral units, and there is staff, there are nurses, there are psychiatrists in place today treating those patients. So we can reach agreement with acute care hospitals in our markets to get access to those patients, whether we lease the beds or manage the units, or joint venture the units, or they close their units. The presumption, I think on our part and what has played out at least in our initial conversations, is we will have access not only to the patients, but also to the clinicians who are treating those patients. So it's not as if we will have an incremental need to hire staff to treat those patients. So, can we move on to the next... Joanna Gajuk : Great. Thanks a lot. Steve Filton : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Paula Torch : Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to start my first question on the strong acute care metrics. I wonder, Steve, can you talk about the pace of volumes throughout the quarter and maybe if we saw a pickup through to March and has that momentum continued into 2Q? Steve Filton : Yeah. I think, Paula, our experience, what seems to me was the shared sort of industry experience based on commentary I've heard from others and some of the surveys that I saw during the quarter, the quarter got off to a relatively slow start I think probably as a result of a very late flu season. Volumes picked up in maybe later January and then February. And then at least for us, March was a very strong month. Again, we do get the benefit of the leap year day and some of the calendar timing with Easter and Good Friday, et cetera. But also, I think it's early in the second quarter but most of the trends seem to be holding up reasonably well. Again, I'm not about to predict that we can sustain that sort of really remarkable acute care growth we saw in Q1, but we feel just good generally about how things are going in our markets and how strong the underlying business is. Paula Torch : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then on behavioral, certainly a nice uptick year-over-year in the net revenue per patient or adjusted admission, but maybe not as much as we were expecting given the easier compare. So can you maybe give us some color on what drove that? It seems like the results met your expectations, but just wondering what gives you the confidence to be able to reach sort of your 5% same-store revenue growth in 2016, which would certainly imply a ramp up from here. Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure. So you're absolutely right, Paula. It implies a ramp, and for those who remember, I think we specifically talked about that in our year-end call, saying that we believe that the 5% behavioral growth was achievable, but would likely be somewhat lower in the first half of the year when comparisons were more difficult than while we were implementing and trying to gain tractions on some of our recruitment strategies and strategies to fill those nurse and psychiatrist vacancies. And then the second half of the year would become easier to achieve the 5% and probably exceed it, as the comparisons became easier and those initiatives got traction. So, again, from our own perspective, the Q1 behavioral performance was almost precisely in line. And obviously that provides us with a challenge to improve as the year goes on, but that's the way \u2013 that was our expectation of the way the year would play out. Paula Torch : Okay. Thanks. Can I squeeze one more in? If not, I'll move on. Steve Filton : Quickly, quickly. Paula Torch : Okay. Sure. So, just your occupancy in behavioral, I think it was about 76%. So this still shows some room there with the beds you currently have and you're adding another 500 beds throughout the rest of the year. So, wondering how we should think about filling those beds? Is there a potential to fill them with Medicaid Advantage (sic) [Medicare Advantage] lives or is the mix really going to be more towards doing some of these JV partnerships with not-for-profits? I'm just wondering how you can leverage your current bed occupancy versus having to add new beds for this new volume that's going to be coming into the system. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, I mean, if you go back and look, you will see that our occupancy percentage in the behavioral business in that sort of high-70%, 76%, 77% range, has really been very consistent, I would say, for the last seven years or eight years. And what that means is that during that period, we've been adding beds fairly aggressively. And, obviously, the implication is we are filling those beds as quickly as we're adding them and maintaining our occupancy percentage. The reason we're adding beds with a 76% occupancy level is because in markets and in situations, we're clearly turning away patients because of volume constraints. And the economics of it are such that after you turn away more than just a handful of patients, it almost always makes sense to add beds. And so we continue to do that. Now, I will say that in my remarks where I talked about, for instance, the de novo development projects, those projects were undertaken really without regard to the IMD exclusion. Obviously, these have been under development for some time. And so those projects are all in our minds justified by the demand in those markets regardless of whether or not there is sort of incremental demand associated with the IMD. So, as I said, I mean, in some ways, I think those are sort of discrete kind of activities. I think we think that the overall demand for behavioral has been strong, continues to be strong. We're going to add beds to meet that. And at the same time, we're going to continue these conversations with acute care hospitals in our market to get access to their behavioral patients and all their behavioral patients, not just their adult Medicaid patients, but their commercial and their Medicare and any other patients as well. Paula Torch : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Steve, is it your sense that market growth within your geographic regions are just experiencing sort of similar levels of growth or can you share any sort of market dynamics you can point to on why you may be growing disproportionately faster than others, whether it be struggles of other maybe not-for-profits, maybe hospital closures? Anything along those lines that you can kind of point to above and beyond obviously your own initiatives? Steve Filton : Sure, Ralph. Look, I think, it's a combination of both. I mean, we've talked about this certainly before that. Obviously, we are in some markets that were hit fairly hard during the recession three years or four years ago. Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida had disproportionately higher unemployment rates in those markets than the national average, et cetera. And so, as those markets have recovered, I think we have benefited economically disproportionately perhaps than some of our peers. But I think, at the same time, and I think the strong start to 2016 really belies this idea that as the ACA benefit has really sort of largely anniversaried itself, as the economic improvement has largely anniversaried itself, I think what you're seeing in the beginning of 2016 is the strengthening of our franchises in those now very healthy markets, et cetera. We've been working a lot over the last few years to shore up our physician relationships and our physician integration arrangements, acquiring practices and integrating in other ways, focusing on certain service lines. And I think that's all really starting to pay dividends. And, again, I'll highlight what I did earlier in an earlier response, which is when that growth is in Medicare, I think it's a reflection of the fact that we're probably gaining market share, since that's not a patient population that is inherently growing or seeing more demand, et cetera. So we have not historically sort of really tried to parse out market-by-market market share data. But I think we generally feel that in most of these markets that are performing well, not only are the markets doing well, but that we're gaining market share in those markets as well. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. That's fair. And then, I mean I guess that brings up sort of the \u2013 what you see on sort of the acquisition opportunity side? I mean, to the extent that you are seeing struggles, yet you haven't done an acute care acquisition in a while. I mean do you think those opportunities are going to present? Or do you think that maybe people aren't growing as much as you may or others maybe not be growing as much as you are now, but they're still showing healthy growth and so you think there's still a reluctance to have sort of willing sellers out there? Steve Filton : Look, I think we've said and you have heard me say for the last several quarters that the pace of activity, particularly on the acute care M&A side, has picked up. Now that means conversations and processes, et cetera. And our experience is, on the acute side that takes some time. These are largely not-for-profits that are being sold and their decision-making process tends to be somewhat elongated. But we've said for some time we're confident that there will be opportunities. There'll be compelling opportunities. And as I sit here today, I'll say with even greater confidence that I think we will definitely have opportunities in 2016 to deploy capital in the acute care space that we will find compelling, and I believe others will as well. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. That's helpful. Last quick one, just to clarify. Did you mention \u2013 did you say that you thought the leap day impact was a 3% benefit to volume or was there other factors that maybe drove 3% growth? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, I mean, basically all I'm saying is, if you have 90 days in the quarter and there's an extra day, it's a little over 3% just natural admission growth that you're likely to see. But it's also a little bit hard to then sort of parse that into a revenue piece because obviously not all of our revenue reimbursement is on a per-day basis. So the comment that I was making before was mostly about admission growth and the metrics, the cosmetics of those metrics. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. And maybe we could follow up offline. I just \u2013 I mean I think we typically take a bit as just 1 day over 90 days sort of just 1%, maybe 2%. So it just seemed a little bit high. But we can maybe follow up offline. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Whit Mayo : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Steve, can you talk a little bit about surgery and any particular strength in any service lines in the quarter, including ER? And then maybe just touch on behavioral and health, your acute psych versus RTC volumes that are trending? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, on the acute side, generally I would say that besides that sort of payer mix commentary that I've offered before, we've seen extreme strength in our surgical volumes. I think that in-patient surgeries were up something like 4% in the quarter. Out-patient surgeries were up like 7%, which was again some of the strongest surgical growth we've seen. Our Medicare case mix index was among the highest we've ever seen. I think that's reflective obviously of the surgical volume and continued a trend that we saw in Q4. So, obviously, I think beyond the volume strength which we've already commented on, we're seeing a lot of sort of high quality revenue and high acuity revenue strength as well. On the behavioral side, I will say, I mean the one sort of issue between the acute and the residential business is the residential business is not subject I think nearly as much to this whole psychiatrist shortage issue. So the residential admissions have probably held in a little bit stronger than the acute admissions. And frankly, I think, at least from a cosmetic perspective that tends to hurt us, because at least of the public companies we tend to have a behavioral revenue sort of profile that is weighted more to the acute rather than to the residential business. Whit Mayo : And sort of ER trends in the quarter? Steve Filton : Yeah. I think ER trends, I'm sorry, Whit, are pretty consistent with the overall volume trends. In the markets where we're seeing significant admission growth, we're seeing generally some fairly high ER growth. I will say that in a couple of markets where we are seeing more of a proliferation of urgent care and FED-type development, freestanding ED development, we've seen our ED visits go down a little bit, but honestly our admissions in most of those markets are un-impacted as we continue to get those admissions through our hospitals. Whit Mayo : And maybe just on medical admission, short stay, observational, any change in the trend line there? Steve Filton : I think those trends have remained fairly constant. Whit Mayo : Got it. And my last question is just back on the IMD. And my understanding is that the rule is effective this July allowing health plans to contract with providers. Is that your understanding as well? And from a practical standpoint, when do you think you could actually take admissions of this patient population? Steve Filton : I think your interpretation is correct, Whit, in the sense that I believe what the rule provides for is that states have the option of lifting the IMD exclusion and effectively allowing freestanding facilities to begin to take these patients as early as July. Again, it's at the state's option and we're not sure exactly what each state will do. But we are anticipating that at least in some geographies we'll be able to begin to have access to those patients as early as July. Whit Mayo : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A. J. Rice with UBS. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. First of all, I guess I'll ask on the cost trends on the acute side. So I know sometimes when you have strong volume, you get the leverage of your existing SWB base as well as supplies, et cetera, flowing through the margin side. And then sometimes the growth in volume is strong for an extended period and you start having to add staff or scramble even to get staff. Where are you at on that spectrum? I mean, how would you put that other quarter in context for that maybe a little bit? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, in the back half of 2015, A. J., we talked about the idea that there was certainly some pressure on salary and wages within the acute division, not so much in terms of head count or numbers of employees, but in what we describe as premium pay, which would include things like the use of temporary nurses and over time for our own staff, et cetera. I think while we've made some improvement in that regard, we continue with the revenue growth that we saw in Q1 and with the admission growth and demand, we've continued to see pressure on those wage rates and on that premium pay. And as a consequence, I think that when we file the Q and you'll be able to drill down and you can see it in our consolidated results that most of the leverage we're getting on this strong revenue growth is on the supply and other operating expense line and less of it is on the salary wage line, because we're still seeing a fair amount of pricing pressure, if you will, on that line. Rice: Okay. All right. And then you guys nicely upgraded the buyback authorization, doubled it. I know, if I remember right, and maybe my memory's not serving me well, but typically UHS waits till you're closer to running through your prior authorization to adding another one of the order of magnitude. Are you indicating anything there about maybe being more active on the buyback front? You've been pretty steady the last year. Give us some thoughts on that. Steve Filton : Well, just to be clear, I mean, the board increased the authorization back in February and in large part did so because we were on the verge of exhausting our previous authorization. So I think what you described as our historical practice is exactly what we did back in February. Rice: Okay. All right. I'm sorry about that. Maybe one last question on the IMD you haven't been asked yet. Do you have contracts in place with the managed care guys or is that something that will take some time to put in place, or how quick can you put those in place? Steve Filton : I think, in some cases, we already have contracts in place. We have been taking adolescent Medicaid patients for many years. And so, in a number of geographies and a number of instances, we already have existing managed care contracts for the adolescent Medicaid population. And we can either extend those contracts to the adult population or just modify them, et cetera. It varies a little bit I think in every geography, but I actually do not believe that the contracting piece of this whole IMD exercise is really the more difficult piece. I think, again, it's those conversations and hopefully those collaborative agreements with the acute care hospitals that are really at the crux of this. Rice: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. My question was about just to go a little deeper into the sources and the drivers of this Medicare-based volume that you're seeing on the acute side, trying to understand if you can see from your payer mix or any anecdotal evidence that this is just new members that are aging into Medicare that perhaps were under-insured or uninsured during their pre-Medicare days. Or is it existing patients and you're marketing more aggressively to them as a hospital chain? And is there any difference between fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare Advantage? Steve Filton : So maybe a few different comments I'll make. I mean, we continue to see over time a shift out of traditional Medicare into Medicare Advantage, and that continues, and I expect will continue for some time. What I was trying to allude to before, and maybe I was too nuanced, is I think the idea that our Medicare population and admission is growing as quickly as it is almost by definition has to mean that we're taking market share. Because while I think the overall Medicare population could be expanding somewhat, it is certainly not expanding at the pace that our admissions are expanding. So I think almost by definition, the fact that our Medicare population is growing as much as it is suggesting that in many of our markets we are taking market share from our competitors. And I think it's because of all the real focus, et cetera, that our operators are bringing to service lines and to physician relationships, and I think all of that is paying dividends. Ana Gupte : Okay. So it's about market share. Then the two changes that \u2013 and these things take forever sometimes, we had the Two-Midnight rule lapse, and then recently I think CMS is backing off of that rule altogether. Simultaneously, there are these value-based withholding of 25,000 primary care physician pilots that they've put in place. So one's sort of a positive and a tailwind and it feels like one's a bit of a headwind, but maybe more long term I think. How is this going to play out through 2016 and then into 2017 in terms of the timing that you anticipate, either positive or negative on a net basis? Steve Filton : Yeah. Look, I think, Ana, as your questions suggest, I think it's difficult to predict for some of these things how they're going to affect macro trends. And I think to the degree that they affect macro trends, it will be over a longer period of time. So I think, from our perspective, it is not likely to have significant short-term or even intermediate-term impacts. Over the longer-term, we'll see. Ana Gupte : Okay. Not even on the Two Midnight rule? I mean, it's just get out altogether... Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean I think that the effect of the Two Midnight rule probably lapped or anniversaried several quarters ago. So I don't think that's having a big impact. My response to Whit's question earlier about changes in sort of observation days or short stays, et cetera, was that we're really not seeing big changes in those dynamics. I think, again, that impact was probably several quarters ago. Ana Gupte : Okay. Then separate question on the bad debt, which continues to trend favorably and now you're back to what you had about a year ago I think in the second quarter. Would this adjacent category live up in the third quarter as you continue to see more data with your revenue cycle management practices and all? Any more color on the driver? Steve Filton : Look, Ana, we've conceded on several occasions that the increase in uncompensated volumes back in the third quarter of 2015, which we experienced and quite frankly many of our peers seemed to experience as well, was something that we really couldn't explain with I think great confidence. People suggested at the time that maybe it was some level of dis-enrollment in commercial exchanges, as premiums were going up or as people had gotten the care that they were seeking. We can never sort of prove that in any kind of pervasive way. But I think what our experience in Q4 and Q1 would suggest to us is that it was a bit of an anomaly and a bit of a blip in that the uncompensated trends which had been more stable in the last couple of quarters, seem to be more reflective of the environment that we're really in. Ana Gupte : Got it. Thanks, Steve, for the color. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe some comments on your priorities for use of capital at this point. It seems like the average repurchase price for your shares is a little bit south of where the stock is now, which I guess is a good thing. And then how do you feel about the opportunities on behavioral in the UK at this point? Steve Filton : Gary, I think we always say and we say it because I think we mean it that we are relatively agnostic about where we deploy our capital, meaning that we will likely deploy our capital wherever we think we can earn the best returns. And I think that we were an active share repurchase in the first quarter and continued to some degree into the second quarter because we thought our shares, particularly given the strength of our business, were an attractive investment. I think we'll continue to consider that as we move forward. But I think we've also said that we see a number of compelling M&A opportunities in both the behavioral and acute space, and we have the financial flexibility to pursue those and we will. I think we have a longstanding and well-earned reputation, however, as a judicious acquirer and a judicious evaluator of these opportunities and a judicious steward of capital. And I think we'll continue to uphold that reputation in the future. So we're going to look at all these opportunities. We never really prioritize because, in our minds, the priorities are as we see these specific opportunities and as we evaluate these specific opportunities. Gary Lieberman : And what about in the U.S. on acute care side? I think you might have said at some point that you think you were seeing more not-for-profit or potential not-for-profit deals around there? Steve Filton : I think we are. And I think I said before, we continue to be actively involved in a number of conversations in that regard. We just find that those processes and those conversations tend to be a bit elongated and they take some time. But we believe, as I said before, that with some high degree of confidence that we will deploy capital into the acute care business in 2016 at levels that we probably have not in a while. Gary Lieberman : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities. Sarah James : Thank you. Can you talk about the growth that you're seeing so far this year on your UK behavioral health business? And then, in the past, you've talked about occupancy rates in the 90% range. So maybe you could update us on any near-term plans to add beds in that market? Steve Filton : Sure. So I think everything you said remains true. We are running occupancy rates in the UK both in \u2013 it's still a relatively new business for us, but in the Cygnet business that we bought at this point a-year-and-a-half ago and then the Alpha business that we bought maybe six months ago, we're seeing those very high occupancy rates. And as a result, we're really taking all the actions in the UK that we've been taking in the U.S. for many years and that is, we're adding beds to existing facilities where the demand justifies that. We are building some de novo facilities in UK where the demand justifies that. We've done some tuck-in acquisitions in the U.K. We did a larger acquisition with the Alpha deal six months ago, as I said. And we continue to look at all those kinds of future opportunities in the UK as well with all the same sort of caveats and dynamics that I described here in the U.S. So we'll deploy capital in the UK behavioral space if it makes compelling sense to us and we're looking aggressively to do that. Sarah James : Got it. And could you size for us how many beds that you know that you're adding so far just with the growth within existing facilities and the de novo start-up plans for this year? What is the overall bed growth in the UK going to look like? Steve Filton : I mean, I actually do not have the UK numbers in front of me. I mean, we have talked broadly about 600 to 800 new beds in our behavioral division overall, and those would include new UK beds. Sarah James : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Gary Taylor : Hey. Good morning. Sorry I jumped on a little late. So, if I ask something that's been asked, just tell me to read the transcript and I will. First of all, Steve, did you comment specifically on emergency room volumes? I know you'd talked a little earlier about geographically some of the volumes strengthened by payer, but on ER? Steve Filton : We did. Gary Taylor : Okay. Steve Filton : So I will suggest to go back and read the transcript. Gary Taylor : Okay. Let me do that. And then my last one on the \u2013 just going through the concept of the new IMD regulation, do you have a sense of where your presumably newly negotiated Medicaid adult per diem might shake out versus general acute care hospitals or maybe where your current child and adolescent Medicaid per diems kind of shake out versus hospitals? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, do we think, given presumably a lower cost structure in freestanding, that from a rate perspective we might get to the point where Medicaid HMOs have a compelling financial incentive to attempt to steer volume in your direction as opposed to just picking up initially probably the ER diverted patients that they can't find a bed for? Steve Filton : Yeah. Look, it's really I think a thoughtful question, Gary. And again, I think we're sort of approaching this in kind of a two-phase sort of process. I mean, the one, as I stressed, is we would like to reach collaborative agreements with many of the acute care hospitals in our markets that are providing in-patient behavioral services. We think, generally, and this is certainly not true of every single acute care hospital, but we think generally acute care hospitals are not very good providers. They're not efficient providers of behavioral services. They have so many other things that they're doing that it's just not a top priority of theirs, and we generally feel we can do it better, we can do with higher quality, we can do with better efficiency. And we're trying to make that argument to our acute care colleagues, if you will, in our markets around the country. And I think, in our minds, that's sort of the first step in getting access to these adult Medicaid patients. The second is more I think along the lines of what you are suggesting, which is as a freestanding industry, and certainly UHS I think has a reputation of being able to provide these services more efficiently and at both high quality and lower cost, then we're certainly prepared to make those arguments to our managed care payers. But, quite frankly, I think ours are aware of that dynamic as we are with the rest of their patient population. So, that to us I think is more of a secondary argument. We'd like to get the acute hospitals sort of to partner with us first and then we'll kind of make our pitch to the MCOs. Gary Taylor : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue at this time. Steve Filton : Okay. We'd like to thank everybody and look forward to talking with everybody next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services second quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you. And, Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" and similar words that represent forecasts, projections, and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to your questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.89 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarters' reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $191.1 million or $1.94 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year. On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2016 increased 7.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.9% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 1.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care division decreased to 17.7% during the second quarter of 2016 from 19.1% during the second quarter of 2015. On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.0% during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year decreased 0.3%, and adjusted patient days increased 0.2%. Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day rose 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior-year quarter. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division were 28.1% and 28.7% during the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 50% to $801 million over the $532 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 50 days during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2016, our ratio of debt to total capitalization increased to 45.5%, as compared to 42.6% at June 30, 2015. We spent $120 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2016 and $248 million during the first six months of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. Also included were the construction costs related to a new four-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was recently completed and opened. In addition, early in the second quarter, we opened Skywood Recovery, a new 100-bed substance-abuse treatment center located in August (sic) [Augusta] (4:56), Michigan. Skywood is part of our expanding Foundations Recovery Network and provides integrated treatment for substance abuse and co-occurring mental health disorders. Last month we completed the refinancing of certain components of our debt, including 1) the issuance of an additional $400 million of our 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022, which were issued at a yield of 4.35%; 2) the issuance of $400 million of 5.0% senior secured notes due in 2026, and 3) a $200 million increase in borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan A facility of our credit agreement. These financings generated aggregate debt proceeds of approximately $1 billion, of which $400 million was utilized to repay the 7.125% senior secured notes that matured in June 30, 2016. $445 million was spent in connection with our previously disclosed May 2016 purchase of third-party minority ownership interest in our six acute-care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada. And the remainder was utilized to repay other floating-rate debt. In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 235,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $29 million or approximately $123 million (sic) [$123] (6:25) per share. Since inception of the program through June 30, 2016, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $406 million or approximately $117 per share. Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning. So, Steve, I wanted to start off maybe in asking about the behavioral volumes. They were a little bit weaker than we were expecting, and wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color around the drivers of that weakness. I realize that compares were more difficult last year and that you're still working through some of the labor shortages, but how is that going forward, and what are you thinking about those volumes in the second half of the year? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Paula. So I think, as you suggest, we've really, I think, been talking about the pressures on our behavioral volumes for almost a year now. I think beginning in the third quarter of last year, we began to clearly see the shortage of clinicians, psychiatrists, and nurses, and to a lesser degree other mental health technicians, as hampering our ability in certain facilities \u2013 in a relatively small number of markets and a small number of facilities \u2013 hampering our ability in some cases to admit all the patients who were being presented to us for admission. I think those dynamics \u2013 and we said this when we gave our guidance for 2016, we thought that those dynamics would persist through the second quarter of this year. We also suggested that they would improve in the back half of this year, in large part because, number one, the comparisons would become much easier, as they will, and also because a number of the initiatives that we've been working on and putting in place to mitigate this problem would also begin to gain some traction. So I think that the softer volumes in Q2 were somewhat disappointing to us as well, but largely expected. And I think our sense continues to be that they will improve in the back half of this year. Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Is it possible to parse out how much of the softer volumes were because of this dynamic with the labor versus just overall weakness in general? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure. So our general sense, Paula, is that our original guidance for the year contemplated about a 5% increase in behavioral same-store revenue. And that was really broken down into a 3% to 4% anticipated increase in volumes, in patient days, and a 1% to 2% increase in price. On the pricing side, I think we're absolutely where we expected to be. And so we're basically showing flattish volumes as compared to that 3% or 4% increase that we were anticipating. And I think we believe that that entire gap and that entire difference can be attributed to the shortage of clinicians and that if we're able to solve and resolve that problem, we should be able to get back to that sort of 5% overall revenue growth level and that 3% to 4% volume growth level that we anticipated originally. Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up to that. I'm curious if you could share with us some of the initiatives that you have in place to mitigate this. Is it paying out higher wages, training programs, maybe more effective recruiting? I mean, anything that you can kind of tell us there that you've been doing that you feel will really drive this home in the second half? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure. Well, I think, frankly, Paula, it's all those things and more. Obviously, in a tight labor market, wage rates matter. And so, in markets in which we are experiencing shortages, we've conducted extensive compensation surveys and have modified our wage rates to make sure that we're competitive with the marketplace. And every marketplace is different. We have also hired more people and dedicated more people to both the physician and nursing recruiting processes. And, finally I think we're very focused on the retention aspect and not just the recruiting aspect, because \u2013 for two reasons. I mean, obviously, to the degree that we're able to retain our nurses, we don't have to, by definition, recruit for their replacements. And to the degree that we recruit replacements, we want to make sure that they stay with us as long as they possibly can. And so our chief nursing officer in the behavioral division has focused a lot of her attention on a new and sort of reinvigorated onboarding process in which we're making sure that nurses are properly trained and have a clear career path and have the appropriate sort of mentoring resources dedicated to them, et cetera. So, as I said, in every market the approach is somewhat different, and it's tailored to the market. But it is by far sort of the number one focus of the operators in the behavioral division at this point. Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you, Steve, for the color there. Operator : And your next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial. Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi, this is Frank Lee on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question. The same-store revenue in the acute care business remained high in the quarter relative to the full-year outlook. Could you just provide a sense for how much of the volume growth was attributable to economic improvements in your markets versus increasing market share, or if there was any other unusual activity to call out there? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Frank. I mean, I think we have said, quite frankly, for the last few years that it's difficult to parse out acute care revenue improvement. Obviously a couple years ago, the real focus was on parsing out the ACA impact versus the economy, and I think clearly the ACA impact has shown diminishing returns for the last few years. We're still posting strong acute care volume numbers. Obviously, because we're the first report this quarter, I don't know how we'll compare with others, but my sense is these are still going to be fairly robust volumes, and I think what we've said all along is I think that we largely feel it's a function of the just strong local franchises that we have in markets like Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida, and the economic improvement in those markets, but also our market position and our ability to take market share in those markets. I think it's very difficult to sort of parse the 4% improvement in same-store adjusted admissions among those various factors. Suffice it to say that we still think that's a pretty good number and well within our expectations. Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, thanks. And then the same-store operating margin in the acute care business was down year over year by a decent amount. Is that primarily related to some of the staffing shortage issues that you had discussed in the acute care side? And then can you talk about the progress that you've made on the initiatives that you've put in place to rectify those shortages? Thanks a lot. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, so I think \u2013 and we talked about this certainly last quarter and I think for several quarters really, again, beginning in the second half of last year. Look, I think that as a result of the improving U.S. economy and the improving economy in our local markets, we have seen a tightening of the available labor force in all or most of our markets. That tightening, I think, is manifested somewhat differently in the two divisions that we have. We just talked about on the behavioral side, quite frankly, we're just not able in some markets to find sufficient nurses and physicians. And as a consequence, we're forced to turn patients away. On the acute side, I think, it's manifested more prevalently in higher use of what we describe as premium pay, which would be overtime or shift differential payments that we make to our current employees or the use of temporary or agency nurses, where current employees are not available. And certainly that use of premium pay on the acute side has contributed to the margin pressure in Q2, as it did back in Q3 of last year. But I think we continue to sort of focus on that, and it got better in Q4 and Q1 of this year, and I think our sense is that we'll continue to focus on it and it is a solvable problem on the acute side. The one other comment I'll make on the acute side vis-\u00e0-vis margins is, while I think the volumes on the acute side were well within our expectations, the revenue per admission growth of 1.3% is probably 50, 75 basis points short of where we thought we'd be. I think that's a bit of a weaker patient mix, and that's mostly maybe a growth in uncompensated patients in the quarter, not by a material amount. But I think mostly the big change from Q1 is, in Q1, our other non-uncompensated volumes were just so strong, particularly our Medicare volumes were so strong, that they offset a bit of the uncompensated tick up in volumes. In Q2, as Medicare and other commercial volumes moderated some, the uncompensated rise had a bit more of an effect. So I think the staffing pressure or the premium pay pressure, along with the slight payer mix deterioration, probably explain the bulk of the pressure on acute care margins. Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And your next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Tejus on for Matt. Thanks taking the question. Just to follow on acute care volumes. We were expecting them to moderate in 2Q, but was this in line with your expectations? Any additional weakness to call out? And then also anything you can talk about in terms of regional differences between, call it, Nevada and then more the Texas, Florida, California markets would be helpful. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Tejus. So our original guidance for the year was something like 6% acute care same-store revenue growth, and we broke that into components \u2013 pretty evenly broke that into pricing and volume. So the 4% same-store adjusted admission volume growth we saw in Q2 was, as I said, well within and frankly ahead of our expectations, while the pricing was slightly lower. But overall acute care revenues were pretty close to what we expected. In terms of regional differences, I think, most of \u2013 we clearly saw an overall moderation in acute care revenues in Q2 from the really extraordinary levels of Q1. We absolutely have said all along that's what we expected would happen. And obviously the Q2 performance is much closer to our original guidance. I think the regional commentary that we've given for probably a year now still holds in Q2 of this year, which is that markets like Vegas and California and Florida have been sort of overperformers, and the Texas markets, namely the South Texas markets and Amarillo, probably have been the weaker performers. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks very much. And can you touch on the other operating expenses; that looked like it increased this quarter. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think those other operating expenses are distorted a little bit by the impact of our insurance company. We had about a $25 million to $30 million increase in both premium, revenue and in claims expense in the insurance company in this quarter. We record that in our acute care division, and we record the expenses specifically in other operating expenses. So I think if you adjust that $25 million to $30 million out of both revenue and other operating expenses, those numbers, at least for us, will certainly look like much more in line with expectations. Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with BoA. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question. So I just want to come back to the discussion about acute care volumes, which \u2013 to your point, it wasn't really surprising to see deceleration but actually deceleration from these very elevated numbers in Q1 was (19:51) deceleration might have been surprising to some. So can you just parse it out a little bit more in terms of the different sort of parts of your business? And specifically maybe talk about the surgery performance in Q2? Because I guess we're hearing from some of the medical device companies that the volumes decelerated in terms of surgeries, but the deceleration was not as dramatic. So just can you touch base or could we just talk a little bit about the surgeries, inpatient versus outpatient performance in the quarter? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Joanna. So our inpatient surgeries increased by about 2% in Q2 versus a 4% increase in Q1. And, again, I think we thought that 4% increase for inpatient surgeries was above what we thought we could sustain. The outpatient surgeries rose by about 7% in Q2, and that was pretty similar to the Q1 performance. So again, from my perspective, our surgical volumes in Q2 were very much in line with our expectations. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Great. And just touching based on the Vegas minority interest purchase and the impact specifically for the company. So Community kind of talked about maybe the annual impact of $60 million. So is it fair to kind of assume there's maybe $36 million impact for your interest on the minority interest since it's after taxes, is it roughly in the ballpark number annually? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So let me just remind to everyone that, first of all, the transaction was not completed until the beginning of May. So we only have two months of the transaction's impact in the quarter, and we've estimated that the positive impact for us would be somewhere between $0.015 and $0.02 a month. And so we've got $0.03 to $0.04 in Q2 and $0.12 to $0.16 or so for the year, or for the eight months, that should be our favorable impact for the year. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : So that's net of the higher interest expense? Because I guess there was also (22:04) debt, but you raised additional debt to fund the purchase of $400 million-plus \u2013 purchase. So is the $0.01 to $0.02 per month, is that net of that higher interest expense, or it's just -? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yes. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Okay. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yes. So it's the increase in earnings as a result of having the full impact of the Vegas earnings, less the interest expense on the $445 million to fund that buyout, and obviously also less the tax impact of the additional earnings. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Great. That's helpful. And on the last topic in terms of your UK business and the Brexit and your outlook there going forward for that part of the segment in terms of any currency things or impact on the actual business in terms of maybe any pressure on staffing there, or the government funding, so any color you might have on the UK business, that would be helpful. Thank you. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, yeah, I mean, first of all, let me just kind of set the sort of relative importance of the UK to our consolidated results. As opposed to some of our peers, it's a relatively small footprint in the UK. About 2% to 3% of our consolidated revenues this year will come from the UK. We have said from the outset that our original investment in the UK, which is equal to roughly about $500 million or so, has been hedged, so from a currency risk perspective we are protected on currency fluctuations. Finally, I think, while obviously Brexit made a lot of headlines, I think in terms of its impact on the fundamentals of the behavioral business in the UK, it's had virtually none in the short run. In the longer term, we'll see. I think obviously, as you know, many, many details of the Brexit process have to be worked out involving labor \u2013 folks in the labor force, et cetera, so we'll see how that all plays out. But again, at the moment, no impact, and I think just keep in mind that it is a relatively immaterial part of our business. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: We've done very well with regard to our acquisition. We paid reasonable prices for the acquisition both in Cygnet and Alpha, and we're very pleased with them. But it relates to how much you pay and how good is the management, and we've been pleased with what we have. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Great. And just very quickly on that point. It sounds like there could be some assets for sale in the UK, so would you be still interested to grow that business given the maybe special uncertainty around Brexit and whatnot that might happen? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think it's premature to speculate, obviously. We don't know what assets might be for sale. I think it's always sort of a given that when assets are for sale, whether in the UK or in the U.S., and they're of a high quality, we're certainly interested in taking a look. But we don't even know what the specifics may be in the UK, so it's probably too early to comment. Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America : Great. Thank you. That's all for me for now. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned a weaker payer mix on the acute care side. Are there any numbers that you could share with us, Steve? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, uncompensated volumes were up probably kind of 2%, 2.5% in the quarter. Honestly, I think they were up by a similar amount in Q1. As I think I said earlier, I think the difference was in Q1 other volumes were just so strong that they tended to really offset any impact of that increase. I think the other sort of commentary I'd make about uncompensated care in general is we take our total uncompensated care \u2013 all of which we disclosed in the press release, the bad debt, the charity care, the uninsured discount \u2013 and we take that total number and compare it to our gross revenue, which I know is generally not a metric most people use very much. But I think from our perspective it takes into account the gross pricing impact that runs through those numbers. And while our second quarter uncompensated care experience was measurably higher than last year's second quarter, it's still lower than it was in the back half of last year. And so I think our general notion is that we're seeing kind of a slight uptick in uncompensated care, but it's reasonably steady over the last three or four quarters. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Any reason to think that the trend in the second half of the year will be different? Do you feel like you're seeing pressure earlier this year and that it's going to continue, or that this is just sort of an anomaly? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. Look, as Yogi Berra always said, it's hard to predict the future. But, look, I think our general sense is that we may see a continued uptick incrementally in uncompensated care. It doesn't have the feel to us of a big measurable change. But payer mix is probably the element of our business that's most difficult to project. So I don't want to make too many really definitive statements in that regard. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the IMD exclusion. Are you seeing anything yet? I realize it's still pretty early. And then maybe just comment on that in light of the comments or the issues with hiring psychiatrists. Do you think that that is going to prevent you from seeing any benefit with regards to that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I mean, I think we've consistently said, Gary, that we view the IMD benefit as a meaningful one but also one that will be impactful and have an impact on us over time and also will be part of kind of our broader efforts to penetrate the acute care hospital segment of the behavioral industry \u2013 that is, acute care hospitals who have their own behavioral units. I think your first comment is absolutely right. I mean, we're sort of two or three weeks into the effective date of the new IMD managed Medicaid rule, and I think any commentary or any reaction we'd have at this point would be purely anecdotal. I think honestly we've always had the view that probably the biggest impact doesn't start to occur even until the beginning of next year, when managed care plans have all their new plans in place and start to direct and redirect business in different ways. But I think, finally, I think the other comment that we've made on previous calls and I think we're still very much believers in, is that I think we believe that the IMD or we view the lifting of the IMD exclusion in the broader context of our very pervasive and very aggressive program to try and collaborate with acute care hospitals around the country and to help gain access to their behavioral units. And obviously the lifting of the IMD exclusion removes one of the hurdles that I think has always prevented that from happening in a pervasive way. But, again, I think that whole process is one that will continue to take place and continue to have an impact for many years to come. Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. Just have a couple quick ones. Steve, I don't know if you gave any comments around just surgery trends, ED trends, and outpatient visits in the quarter. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So I did comment on the surgery trends, Whit; you can just go back and look at that. On the ED side, I think our ED visits were up 1% or 2%, which is a kind of moderation from where we were in the first quarter but pretty consistent with our overall sort of admission number moderation, and outpatient visits were up in the 5% to 7% range. Again, that's fairly consistent with our first quarter results. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And any update on Henderson and just the timing of the opening? I heard you say the fourth quarter, but should we expect any start-up, or pre-opening expenses this year, or \u2013 ? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Whit, Whit - Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Speak up. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Can I ask you to repeat that? I didn't hear you. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Please speak up. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sorry about that, Alan. Just wanted an update on Henderson, the timing of the opening. I heard you say that it'll be in the fourth quarter but didn't know if we should anticipate any pre-opening expenses this year or if that will be more 2017. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: The opening ceremony is October 6, and we'll be taking patients shortly thereafter. We are very excited about it. We've been very good in that area. One of the good areas \u2013 Temecula, which we opened a couple of years ago, has just been \u2013 exceeded all of our expectations. Henderson completes our coverage of the market. We're very excited about that. And we opened a Spring Valley tower, and that's now in operation, so we're really looking forward to success in Las Vegas in addition to what we have currently. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: And, Whit, just to answer your specific pre-opening questions, so as part of our 2016 guidance we said that there'd be a $10 million EBITDA drag from Henderson in the back half of the year, both in Q3 pre-opening costs and then in Q4 opening losses. That number frankly just mechanically will be a little bit larger because it didn't originally contemplate the fact that we buy out the Community interest, so it's probably $2 million or $3 million higher than that, but that hasn't changed, and that was in our original guidance. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just last one. I know you don't provide quarterly guidance, but the Street has had a historical tendency to get ahead of your internal budgets in the second half and prior year, so just any comments or observations would be helpful. Thanks, Steve. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, I'll just talk about the trajectory of the year from our perspective. We talked in the first quarter about the fact that we were ahead of our own internal budget, but I think that we also conceded that the results in Q1 were further ahead of consensus than they were of our own internal budget. I think in Q2 we were pretty close to the Street consensus. So I think our view is if we continue to meet our own internal modeling and expectations in the back half of the year, with the benefit of the Community buyout impact, which was not contemplated in our original guidance, we should still be very comfortably in our guidance range, probably close to the upper half of that guidance. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just taking a step back on the psych business, the trends have looked relatively similar to acute the last several quarters, and I think the historical perspective is the psych business has been a better growth business and more opportunity. And I'm curious if you feel like we've seen sort of more of a maturation of that business. And I guess as you guys think about your valuations when you're looking at assets, what do you think in terms of valuations for psych assets versus acute care assets, and do you still think the growth dynamics in psych are noticeably different than acute care going forward? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I'd answer the question, Josh, in a couple of different ways. I mean, one is, in terms of the growth prospects of this business \u2013 the behavioral business, that is \u2013 we remain fairly bullish, and that is because, as I indicated in earlier remarks, we believe that there's demonstrated demand for this business. And quite frankly I think there are a number of dynamics that would suggest that that demand does nothing but increase. We could have a whole long conversation about that, but things like the incidence of addiction illness and the need for addiction treatment and the opioid epidemic in the U.S. and the continued incidence of mental health issues in the elderly population, there's just a whole host of reasons to believe that, I think, the demand for mental health services is going to increase. And in fact we believe we demonstrate that in our hospitals. We've been unable to demonstrate it in our financial results because of this clinician shortage. I think we have the view that in the short run we will make inroads and significant inroads in that clinician shortage in the short run. And in the long run, the market itself will correct for this, as it has when the acute business suffered through a nursing shortage some 10 years ago. And just nurse salaries went up and more people enrolled in nursing schools, and the supply and demand balance sort of was restored. And I think the same thing will happen here, both with psychiatrists and with nurses on the behavioral side. In terms of commenting on valuations of the two businesses, I think it's difficult for us to do. We clearly look at individual acquisition opportunities on a standalone, discrete basis and the growth potential in an individual behavioral facility or individual behavioral company versus an acute is really dependent on the markets they're in, what their specific market position is, what the strategies are for growth, et cetera. So we certainly don't go into any acquisition, either acute or behavioral, with a notion of kind of there's a fixed sort of a valuation that make sense. I do think UHS has a reputation for being fairly judicious in its acquisitions and its deployment of capital. I don't see that judiciousness changing, but I think it's a market-by-market issue. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then so, Steve, one of the health plans yesterday made comments around some higher-than-expected costs in substance abuse. They were talking about I think mostly exchange patients and individual patients. I think there was a lot more focus on the West Coast with some of that. Are you guys seeing anything in terms of substance abuse upticks or anything in the exchange membership where you guys think you're seeing a little bit better volumes? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I mean, as I said, Josh, I think that there's all sorts of data out there that suggests that both the incidence of addiction illness and obviously the corresponding demand for addiction treatment is growing. I think when that happens \u2013 when there's a growing demand for a particular service, the payers start to focus on it more. I think one way that we're seeing that manifested is I think the payers are more focused on this whole out-of-network segment of the addiction treatment business. I think a bunch of companies have grown up around that model. We were very targeted, or we made a very targeted decision, when we bought Foundations, that they were a company that had both out-of-network and in-network business, split pretty evenly, and that they in our minds and I think we've seen them in the short time we've owned them navigate very freely between sort of the two segments. So if this business shifts to more of an in-network model, we think we'll be prepared to make that transition more easily than a number of these other companies that have focused almost exclusively on that out-of-network model. Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Kind of going back to a topic. Obviously, there was a big difference in your bad debt expense in 1Q and 2Q. I know you called out the higher uninsured. Your internal model for the back half of the year, how should we think about the bad debt number relative to what you experienced in 1Q and 2Q? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So what I was saying before, John, is that I think our uncompensated volumes have been growing in the first half of the year by \u2013 in that kind of 2%, 2.5% range, and I think that's consistent with what our model for the year is, and that's I think we would, if pressed, suggest is what we would expect in the back of the year. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So does that mean a high 8%'s or a low 7%'s (39:52) bad debt? That's what I was trying to figure out. I was looking at the percentage number, and it was obviously a lot higher in the second quarter than the first quarter. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, so two things. I mean, one is, as I suggested in some comments earlier, we really don't look at bad debt on its own. I think you have to look at it in combination with charity care and uninsured discount. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: And again, I mean, I think the way that I sort of think about it, John, is I'm back to we talked about acute care revenue growth, net revenue growth, which is after bad debt and after charity care and uninsured discount, of about 3% for the year. And I think that's what I would guide people to think about for the back half of the year. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: And that would take into account the growth in uncompensated volumes. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And then just to go back to the \u2013 I mean, congrats on the Community deal, obviously accretive. How do you think about the \u2013 I was a little curious about the cash flow impact of that deal. Was Community just getting a chunk of the earnings and you had all the CapEx, or is there a cash flow obligation that you pick up moving to 100% ownership? I just wasn't exactly sure how the cash flows worked in that deal. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So it was mostly, John, a cash flow deal. That is, Community's 27 roughly percent interest was in the cash flow of the joint venture, both the earnings and the capital expenditures. So you are correct that, as we move forward, we'll have a larger share of the CapEx there. Now, obviously we've just finished up a significant \u2013 and Alan commented on a couple of very large projects that are just finishing up. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So I think we're going to return to, at least in the short run, a bit more of a normalized CapEx spend in that market. But, yes, we'll now have 100% of it. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So when we think about your purchase multiple, it's really an EBITDA kind of purchase multiple, not a pre-tax earnings purchase multiple or something like that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think that's right. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, everybody. First of all, maybe just quickly on the \u2013 your cash flow number was good, your debt-to-EBITDA is down at 2.2 times, which I think is sort of below the low end of your target. Any thoughts on capital deployment from here? I know you got asked about the Acadia potential divestures, but more broadly, acquisition pipeline versus opportunities for share repurchase, given where you're at and the capital base? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, A.J. I mean, look, you've heard me say this before, and I'll repeat it just because it's true, and that is acquisition spending is probably the most difficult aspect of our business to predict. So as we sort of try and measure what sort of opportunities we have, that's sometimes difficult to do, but we've been an aggressive acquirer of our shares over the last, I would say, six or nine months. We have tried to be an opportunistic acquirer, and I think we'll continue to do that in the future and take advantages when we think the stock is at a particularly valuable level. So, as you suggest, we certainly have the financial flexibility to do all that, to respond to opportunities as they arise but also to continue to be an aggressive acquirer of our own shares. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And I thought I'd just ask maybe on the payer side, both from the managed care and the government side. On the managed care side, any update on how contracting's going for 2017 at this point? I know it's early, but typically you have a fair number of contracts reworked. Any change in approach you're seeing from pricing or terms that they're asking for? And then I would probably also ask you, on the Medicare side, there seems to be this push toward bundled payments. Have you had any experience so far? I know they rolled out the joint replacement bundle payment in April. So it's still fairly early, but just any early experience on that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So I think we feel, A.J., that we're prepared for what I think we view as sort of the inexorable move to more risk shifting, which would include more bundled payment \u2013 methodology payments. We were volunteers in some of the early Medicare demonstration programs. We can remain in some of those. We've exited some. I think it's a developing and a continually evolving area. But I think we have worked now for probably the last two or three years to make sure that we're prepared for it. And so I think we remain prepared. Obviously, Medicare announced just within the last couple of days an expansion of their bundled payment program, but a number of the details, I think, are still somewhat fuzzy. So it's difficult to, again, make any precise predictions. As far as managed care contracting, I think we're probably still 45, 60 days away from the real sort of height of the 2017 renegotiation process. But I would suggest that we're not seeing huge changes, either in our rates or in the structure of those contracts from what we've been experiencing over the last few years. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Hi, Steve. Good morning. The question I had \u2013 and I wonder if anybody explored this; I'm just a little late to the call \u2013 is on connecting the dots between your deterioration in bad debt from 1Q to 2Q, and again the same thing on your acute volumes. Does that give you pause around what the driver of the volumes is? Are you still thinking this is economic rebound rather than exchanges? Which seems like the more obvious thing given the tick up in membership in the first quarter, and it's consistent with what the managed care companies are complaining about and where the claims costs are being incurred. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, Ana, I think we have touched on it. I'll just reiterate a little bit of what I've said before. I mean I think we're running about 2% to 2.5% increase in uninsured volumes. I think that's consistent with what our original guidance and original model was. So, no, I mean, I think \u2013 and we talked at great length in Q1, when we really had extraordinary acute care volumes \u2013 that those were largely driven by Medicare volumes. And I think that was reflected in our very strong pricing. The moderation in our Medicare volumes in Q2 has caused the pricing to again step back some. But I think we're largely in line in Q2 with what we expected to be our overall same-store acute care pricing. So from my perspective, I'm not sure that there are any sort of sinister dots to connect, but we'll certainly see how this continues to play out. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. But did you see anything specific in terms of geographies? You had pretty solid year-over-year growth. Now I'm just trying to compare to the baseline in 2015 and 1Q relative to 2Q. So was it just about comps, or was it something else? I guess that it's tough to look at the actual (47:42) numbers, but - Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Well, again, I mean, I'll just remind people that in first quarter our acute care same-store revenue grew by 12%. That's about as an extraordinary number as you're going to find, and I think anybody who had the expectation that we could sustain a number like that was simply kidding themselves, and we certainly didn't encourage people to think that way. So when we moderate to something closer to 7% in Q2, again, I think that's going to wind up being a number that's going to be pretty competitive amongst our peers \u2013 we'll see \u2013 but doesn't reflect any significant or unexpected changes in payer mix. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And then on the outpatient side, just a final question on this. The theme again has always been from the insurers that this mix shifting is to outpatient. It feels like there's a accelerated mix shift to outpatient surgery, or even ambulatory surgery as ortho procedures and cardio and all are just seeing more convenience and ease in an ambulatory setting. Are you seeing something that points to something structural in this arena and going forward that might actually really put pressure on the inpatient side? And then connecting it to the value-based care question earlier that the incentives will be far more to try to mitigate costs with a risk-sharing reimbursement mechanism over time in acute. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Jesus. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: We certainly have seen the continued shift to outpatient that, as you suggest, I think, virtually every provider in America has recognized. Again, I'm just going to go back and say that even with that continued shift, which has been underway for years now, the 4% same-store adjusted admission growth in Q2 is certainly well within our expectations and I think is a reflection of even with that shift to outpatient that we're still seeing growth on the inpatient side for all the reasons that I described before : strong franchises, taking market share from competitors, recovering economies, et cetera. So, yeah, I mean, we see that same dynamic that everybody else sees, but we're still posting pretty good inpatient numbers at the same time. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. Thanks for the perspective. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Steve, just want to go back to uncompensated care and bad debt. I mean, is it all uninsured, or are you seeing any sort of bad debt creep in the uncollectible from out-of-pocket that might be having an impact versus just the uninsured and any changes to your collection percentages that you've seen? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Ralph, and again, this is a trend, I think, that has now been underway for a while now. There's no question that over the last few years, the amount of the hospital bill that is due from the patient because of copays and deductibles has grown, and as a consequence the amount we collect on that portion of the bill has declined. So 10 years ago, we collected 55% to 60% of the patient portion of the bill, and today that number's probably dropped to 45%. That's been a gradual change; we've accounted for it. It has contributed to some degree to the rise in uncompensated care, but I think we've also always said that two-thirds of our overall uncompensated care numbers are the result of those who purely have no insurance, and I think that remains largely the case. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then I joined the call a little late; I'm not sure if you had mentioned this. Did you give exchange volume in the quarter or growth you think that the exchanges had? I know it's a small number, but just if you had that. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. We didn't, and I don't think we ever have, in large part, because in contrast with some of our peers I think we have always viewed it as a relatively difficult thing to do with precision, to identify patients who have exchange coverage versus those who might have just regular commercial coverage. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right, fair enough. And then just last one, your other revenue within acute seems to be sort of ramping. I know it's a small piece, but I think that's the health plan business. So can you maybe just talk about the growth there in terms of capturing lives, I guess, and maybe refresh us on the strategy there? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So we acquired a health plan, a provider-based health plan in the Reno market, just about two years ago at this point. I did comment before that we had about a $25 million to $30 million increase in the quarter in both premium revenues and other operating expenses. The rationale for acquiring that business, which we have talked about on previous calls, more so at the time that we made the acquisition, is really to prepare for this risk shifting that several of the last questions have focused on. But as more of the risk shifts to the provider, we will have to shift our focus to more of sort of an underwriting exercise, and we think that having that insurance infrastructure and that insurance expertise is helpful when you're doing that sort of analysis, and that continues to be our belief. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we have no other questions in queue at this time. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Okay. Well, we thank everybody for their time this morning and look forward to speaking with everyone next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.",

Rice - UBS Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets Josh Raskin - Barclays Ana Gupte - Leerink Whit Mayo - Robert Baird Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Operator : Good morning. My name is Sia, and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Steve Filton. Please go ahead sir. Steve Filton : Thank you. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements.  For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.54 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2016. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $157.2 million or $1.60 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to $155.3 million or $1.53 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2015. On a same facility basis in our acute care division, net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 increased 9.0% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 4.6% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 14.7% during the third quarter of 2016 from 15.3% during the third quarter of 2015. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.7% during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. During this year's third quarter, adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities increased 1.1%, and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 1.5% as compared to last year's third quarter.  Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 26.0% and 27.4% during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 38% to $1.1 billion over the $796 million generated during the comparable nine-month period of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, 2016, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 45.3%. We spent $148 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2016 and $396 million during the first nine months of 2016.  Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the newly built Henderson Hospital, a 142-bed acute care facility located in Henderson, Nevada, which has been completed and is scheduled to open next week. We have also completed construction on a new 55-bed, 4-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was opened during the third quarter of this year. As previously announced in August of this year, we purchased Desert View Hospital, a 25-bed facility located in Pahrump, Nevada. Together with our 5 existing acute care facilities in the market, Henderson Hospital and Desert View Hospital further complement our ability to provide a wide array of comprehensive medical services to patients in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. Within our behavioral health division, we have opened a total of 373 new beds at some of our busiest facilities during the first nine-months of 2016.  In addition, we have been working on joint venture behavioral health integration projects with industry leaders throughout the country. We're excited about these partnerships that help address the growing demand for inpatient and outpatient mental health services. We are proud to be partnering with Lancaster General Health and Penn Medicine to build and operate a 126-bed behavioral health hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Groundbreaking of this facility is slated for the spring of 2017, and the hospital is projected to open during the summer of 2018. In addition, we have formed a joint venture with Providence Health Care to build a 100-bed freestanding behavioral health hospital in Spokane, Washington. In connection with our previously announced $800 million stock repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 458,000 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $58 million during the third quarter of this year. Since the inception of the program through September 30, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $462 million, and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $338 million as of the end of the third quarter. Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine-months of 2016, we're narrowing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $7.16 to $7.43 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This narrowed guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year increases the lower end of the previously provided range by approximately 1%, and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 2%. We'll be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Tejus Ujjani : Hi. This is Tejus Ujjani on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. Can you touch on any regional differences in the volume strength on the acute care side? Really solid numbers there. Any way to parse out in terms of Nevada strength versus broader market? Steve Filton : Sure. I think probably the geographic comments and patterns that we\u2019ve been articulating I would say for the last five or six quarters continued to be true in third quarter of this year. And that is, among our strongest markets have been, as you have highlighted, Las Vegas, Southern California, the District of Columbia. On the other end of the spectrum, we\u2019ve seen some weakness in South Texas and Amarillo. All those trends have, quite frankly, been present for a while now, I would say at least a year and a half, and didn't really change in any measurable way in this current quarter. Tejus Ujjani : Okay, thanks, and a quick follow-up there. Can you share operating metrics for inpatient and outpatient same store surgeries? Steve Filton : Yes. So just in terms of the most critical metrics in the quarter on the acute side, emergency room visits were up 4% to 5%. Inpatient surgeries were up 3% or so, outpatient were up 4%. All those, I think, relatively strong metrics were consistent with the overall admission strengthen and revenue strength in the acute business for the quarter. Tejus Ujjani : Thanks very much. Operator : The next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. Couple questions on behavioral. First, just Steve, can you give us your view on the third quarter in terms of the trajectory here? Volumes improved a little bit. Obviously, you're spending to staff the hospitals. But maybe spike out the 10% of facilities and what you're seeing there. It seems they were down 20%, 30% previously. Are you seeing some improvement there, and what's going on with the rest of the core business, the other 90%? Steve Filton : Sure. I think from the beginning, Justin, and the beginning I think in my mind was the third quarter of last year, so we've been talking about muted volumes in the behavioral business for about a year now, largely driven by staffing shortages, shortages of psychiatrists and nurses. I think it started out as more of a psychiatrist-centered problem and has evolved into more of a nursing shortage problem. I think what we have highlighted, and there's no perfect way to parse this issue, but we identified four or five or six markets that were most problematic in terms of having vacancies for these clinical positions and having to turn away patients, and as a consequence, have significantly and measurably muted volumes in those markets because we simply didn't have enough qualified clinical professionals to treat those patients. Over the course of the year, I think the markets have largely remained the same. We think those markets probably encompass, depending on how you count them, some 20-odd facilities, and again, during the 12 months, maybe a facility entered the list or came off the list, but I think for the most part, the list remained the same. I think we\u2019ve seen some improvement in those markets. By definition, I think our overall volumes are increasing a little bit. I think we see pockets of weakness in some of the other markets, but I think for the most part, we continue to believe that if we focus on the four or five most problematic markets, as we have been that we will continue to make progress. I think, and you alluded to this a little bit in your question, I think the third quarter was a bit of a whipsaw for us in the sense that as we are hiring new nurses, as we're paying sign-on, bonuses as we are investing in the recruitment and retention of nurses, our labor costs are going up. We clearly saw that in Q3, and honestly, our volumes are going up a little bit, but they are not responding as quickly. Part of this is just a mechanical processes. As we hire nurses, they have to give notice at their old jobs if they are coming from another employer. Then they join us, and they go through an orientation or a training. And so we are paying them and we're incurring costs, but we are not necessarily able to increase volumes immediately. And I think what you saw in Q3 was a little bit of that dynamic of increased cost without the complete benefit of the commensurate increase in volumes. We think that's a relatively temporary situation that should continue to improve pretty measurably over the next quarter or two. Justin Lake : So that was my second question, Steve is just the trajectory here. It sounds like you think it's going to improve, and it should improve given the spending you're making here. Can you talk about the pace of improvement and when you think it gets back to that target 4% to 5%, 6% same store revenue growth range? And then given the level of spending, can you walk us through what you would think would be a reasonable equation, let's just say, for 2017 in terms of - if same store growth is 4% or 5%, what does that equate to in terms of EBITDA growth if you get there? Steve Filton : So, our original guidance for 2016 for our behavioral business, same store behavioral business was 5% revenue growth, which was - the implied metrics for that was 3% to 4% volume growth and 1% to 2% pricing. I think for the most part, we\u2019ve been hitting those pricing targets, so this really is a volume issue. And so when you parse those numbers, we are somewhere 200, 250 basis points short of volumes from where we thought we would be. We also thought that if we could get to that 5% volume growth, we would get to something like a 6% to 7% expansion of EBITDA, or growth in EBITDA. I think that assumption and that EBITDA growth already presumed, because when we gave our guidance for the year, we were certainly well aware of the labor shortage already at that time. So, I think it presumes we would be raising salaries, we would be spending and investing more money in recruitment and retention. And so that EBITDA growth in comparison to the revenue growth was already factoring in some amount of labor pressure. So really, the question you are asking, which is a perfectly reasonable one, is when do we get this additional 200, 250 basis points in volume? I think we feel like we are doing most of the right things. I think we feel like we are making progress. I think we feel like at some point next year, in 2017, we will get there. Exactly how quickly we get there, exactly when that improvement comes, and how quickly that improvement comes is difficult to say. Obviously, the next time we speak to this group will be in late February when we give our 2017 guidance. I think we will be in a much better position to be more precise at that time. But we certainly feel that the metrics that we laid out for this year are well within reach and certainly achievable at some point during 2017. Justin Lake : Great, thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to stick to the labor side, can you give us a sense, Steve, at this point, what the average wage rate increases are today versus, say, a year or two years ago, maybe both across acute and psych and how you think about that on a go-forward basis, even if you do get volume back from the ability to grow EBITDA or the level of EBITDA growth? And then if you could also comment on what was contract labor in the quarter and maybe versus a year ago just to give us some sense of what the magnitude there is of that correction? Steve Filton : So, I think that the challenge in both of these businesses has not really been underlying wage rates. I think on the acute side, I think the challenge has mostly been the use of what we describe as premium pay, and that is paying either our own nurses overtime or shift differentials or whatever to work additional or incremental shifts, or paying temporary or registry nurses, generally a fairly significant premium over what would be our normal rate of pay. And that's really what's driving up our average wage rates. I don't think our underlying, I'll call them normalized wage rates, let's say, in the acute division, are going up much more than 3%, 3.5%. Maybe that's 50 basis points higher than what we might have thought a year ago, but not a huge needle mover. Just as a - to put it in context, I think in a normal environment, we would expect the use of temporary nurses to represent something in any given quarter around 2% of our overall labor force. I think in this quarter, that number was between two and three times that. And even that doesn't - it seems like some relatively small numbers. Because you are paying those temporary nurses in many cases twice what you're paying a regular nurse, the impact starts to add up relatively quickly. The same thing I think is true on the behavioral side. The real issue - and if you've looked at our segment data for the last four quarters or so you, don't see a lot of pressure on our wage line in behavioral, and that's because, quite frankly, we\u2019ve just been unable to find sufficient number of nurses. It's really not been a question of willingness to pay them more to use temporary nurses or whatever. It's just been an absolute inability to find them at all, especially in these markets that I alluded to before. So, I'm going to say the same thing. I think the underlying wage rates in the behavioral division are maybe going up at this point 2.5% or 3%, and maybe that's 50 basis points higher than what we thought. But I don't think it's driving the numbers measurably, other than what I said before. I think already, our EBITDA growth targets that we already had talked about for 2016 for both divisions, I think already incorporated some amount of this labor pressure that we\u2019ve been talking about. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. That's helpful. And then can you give us a sense of payer mix in the quarter? Steve Filton : The payer mix, which I think is largely reflected in - I'm only going to talk on the acute business - in the 3% revenue-per-day increase roughly. I think it reflects our government business, Medicare, Medicaid being up. Our adjusted admissions for the quarter were up 4.5%. I think our government admissions were up in that neighborhood. Commercial admissions, while up, were up slightly less than that, maybe 1%, 1.5%. And then I think on insured admissions, we\u2019re up a little bit more than the average, probably in the 6%, 7% range. And again, these are all trends that I think we have talked about for, I would say, since the middle of last year. As the benefits of the ACA have started to anniversary, we are not continuing to get the benefit from increased Medicaid expansion. Continued commercial enrollment, as a matter of fact, I think we are seeing some level of disenrollment as premiums rise and other factors occur. I think all that payer mix trending has been ongoing for about a year now. We see some volatility between quarters, but if you look at the four-or-five month trend, I think you'll see that we've been hitting that 3% revenue-per-admission growth rate pretty consistently over that period of time. Ralph Giacobbe : That's helpful. If I could squeeze one more in, Steve, can you give us a sense of some of the progress of these JVs and partnerships that you've talked about or any other arrangements you have with hospitals around trying to ultimately capture the IMD benefit as we think about next year? When will this get turned on, if you will, and run through the P&L? Can you give us a sense of whether the magnitude to some of these relationships have the ability to move the needle, or are you in the process of still signing these up where it's just not anything we should be expecting to come through the P&L anytime soon? Steve Filton : So, I think it's worth noting that these conversations with acute care hospitals on the behavioral side of the business have been ongoing now for probably a couple of years, and a number of these arrangements have already been entered into, and some of them are already in operation. I think that the first few of the arrangements we entered into were just these lease arrangements where we would joint venture with large not-for-profit healthcare systems. I mentioned in my opening remarks a deal to build a new hospital with Providence in the Washington State market. We already have two other arrangements where we just occupied existing units, which we leased from Providence and run behavioral units there, and both of them ongoing for some time and have been incorporated in our results for some time. Overall, it is a significant focus, probably, from a business development perspective, the single biggest focus in the behavioral division, what we described as acute care integration efforts. And so I think that they will continue, and will continue to enter into new ones. Exactly how significant they\u2019ll be, I think remains to be seen. Some of them will take some time to develop. I mentioned Lancaster General joint venture in my remarks, but that new hospital will not open until 2018. I think when we give our guidance for 2017, we will probably frame it as here is our same store expectations in terms of volume and revenue growth, and then we will probably separately spike out what the impact of these new ventures will be, and I think we\u2019ll probably do that, frankly, on a continuing basis after that. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Paula Torch : Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I guess I wanted to start up with the behavioral business. I had a question on the list of the 20 or for facilities, and maybe you could share with us what the occupancy looks like in those markets currently and maybe how quickly you can ramp up those facilities when you do add on those nurses or potentially a psychiatrist in order, I mean, I realized that you talked about getting that volume and that we're not really sure how much longer it's going to take, but I'm just curious, from that standpoint, in terms of occupancy, what do you see when you add a nurse, and how does that impact your effective beds? Steve Filton : So, I think - and I probably could have been clearer about this. I mean we identified those four, five, six markets in the 20 or so hospitals. The way that we identified them or the criteria we used was that in those hospitals, we had actually closed the unit or closed the number of beds or we capped our census so that in a 80-bed hospital, we were capping or limiting our census to, let's say, 40 patients or whatever the amount of qualified nurses we had would limit us to. Certainly, elsewhere in the portfolio, we were facing some pressures of turning away a patient on this day or not having enough nurses on a particular day. But these were hospitals where, again, we had closed the unit or we had capped our census for an extended period of time, and that's how we were categorizing them. I think at those hospitals - and I don't have the occupancy data in front of me, Paula, but I will say that at those hospitals, on average, I think their patient days or their volumes were down during this period, I would say 10% to 15%. And again, I think that the bulk of the effort to get the division back to the 200 basis points, 250 basis-point shortage in volumes that we\u2019re really facing from our original guidance is getting those hospitals back to the 3% to 4% volume growth that we think most of the rest of the portfolio is posting. Obviously, if we can't get those hospitals back to that level, and we can get the remaining 180 hospitals or whatever the exact number is, to increase their volumes by 25 basis points or 50 basis points, I mean that will get us to the same place. But I think we just tried to frame it that way because I think it, frankly, it helped us as we tried to focus on addressing this problem, and we thought it would help people understand that as with many things, this was really an 80/20 issue, and the bulk of our focus was on a relatively small number of markets and facilities that were facing the most dramatic shortages. Paula Torch : Okay. Thank you. Maybe just as a follow-up, does this - trying to improve the 20% of these hospitals, let's just say, does that impact your ability or your thoughts about growth for next year? You opened, I think you said, 373 beds in the first nine months. I would assume that you're going to close the year with more than that, so does that impact how you are thinking about that growth and bed expansions, or do you feel like the 80% of the market that's left still has a lot of room to grow? And have you really seen any changes or shifts in the demand for your services in the U.S.? From everything that we read, there continues to be a supply-demand disconnect. I would like to know if you would continue to agree with that? Steve Filton : I think, Paula, we share that view, and I think we have said, again, for the last year that this is not a problem of diminishing demand in the underlying fundamentals of this business. As a matter of fact, I think if anything, we believe that, again, the underlying demand has done nothing, but increase and continues to increase. And our view of both the intermediate and long-term prospects from a demand perspective in this business remain extremely robust, and we are very enthusiastic about it. Instead, we are focused on what we believe is a much more near-term issue of making sure that we have, again, enough qualified staff in all of our facilities to satisfy that demand. I think that, obviously, as you pointed, I mean the fact that we are adding beds - and obviously, we're adding beds in markets where we do have enough qualified staff and we can accommodate those patients, and we\u2019re not necessarily adding beds in those markets where we don't have enough staff now. At some point, we may add beds in those markets as we resolve the problem. But our continued investment in capacity in the business is a reflection of the fact that we expect it to grow at fairly robust rates. I'm not going to tell you we are not prepared to give 2017 guidance today, but I think when we give our guidance in 2017, it will reflect the fact that we believe, A, that the businesses going to continue to grow, and, B, that we'll continue to find new ways to enter markets, particularly acute care hospital market, and help to penetrate their behavioral services, which will also help the business grow. Paula Torch : Okay, great. Thank you for the color. Operator : The next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with BoA. Kevin, your line is open. Okay, he has withdrawn his question. The next question will come from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, can you talk a little about the IMD exclusion benefit? Is the expectation that it's still going to take place primarily in 2017 as you enter networks where it's available, and are you on track to achieve that? Steve Filton : Yes, so the listing of the IMD exclusion for the managed Medicaid population could occur as early as July of 2016 if the states approved that. And I think some of our states have done so.  I think we always had the view that the immediate impact of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, particularly in a mid-year, cycle was going to be fairly minimal because networks were already established and benefit plan design was already established, and to have, effectively, new hospitals join the network midyear and to really redirect a substantial number of patients was not a terribly practical matter in the middle of a year. So, I think in that sense, we always had the view that beginning with a new plan year in January of 2017, we would get more of a measurable impact. And the reality is some states will not approve the lifting until July of 2017, so some of this may be delayed even till 2018. I think, however, our view of this has also evolved, too - and this really encompasses my previous remarks to believe that, really the greatest opportunity we have here to take advantage of that adult Medicaid population are these arrangements that we will reach collaboratively with acute care hospitals to joint venture with them, to lease beds from them, to help them manage units because those opportunities will give us access, not only to their adult Medicaid patient population, but also to their commercial population, to their Medicare population. And so in some respects, the opportunity that we\u2019re pursuing through that avenue is even greater than the IMD opportunity, although in fairness, it will take some time to realize as we have to negotiate these arrangements and implement them, and in some cases, build new capacity, or in some cases, renovate existing capacity, so there's some time lags in all this, but ultimately, given the fact that half of all the behavioral beds in the U.S. reside in acute care hospitals, we think that this opportunity to penetrate those beds is a tremendous, and as I remarked before, probably the single biggest business development opportunity we have domestically over the next five years or so. Gary Lieberman : Great. That's very helpful. And you talk about - there's been a fair amount in the news over the past week or so about premium increases on exchange products and different players potentially leaving markets and decreasing choice. Can you talk about maybe what you expect to see in your markets next year and what impact, if any, that might have on the acute care business? Steve Filton : Yes, so look, I think the reality is I don't know that we have a terribly insightful view of how this is all going to play out. I will make just some preliminary comments that we have said from the very beginning of the Affordable Care Act that the bulk of the benefit that we realize from the Affordable Care Act tended to be on the Medicaid expansion side of the ACA. I think on a percentage basis, we had more hospital beds in expansion states than any of our peers, mostly because of our significant oversized presence in Nevada, but obviously, we benefited in California, we benefited in the District of Columbia. The amount of benefit that we got from commercial exchange enrollment was always more limited, and so to the degree that there is some level of disenrollment, which I think there is and probably will continue to be, I think will impact us, but will not impact us in a terribly material and measurable way. And I think it's also worth noting that we\u2019ve said from the outset that I think that ACA has had a relatively minor impact on the behavioral business. And so again, I think to the degree that there is disruption in the markets, that there is disenrollment, that there is a limiting number of payers remaining, I don't think that's going to have a measurable impact on us. I will say that in most of our markets, there still are multiple exchange providers in business, and a Blue Cross plan almost inevitably is one of them. But even though we have seen some players leave the market, I think in most of our markets, there remains some level of choice and competition, so I think that is helpful. Gary Lieberman : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question will come from A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. A couple quick ones hopefully. Just to think about the margin trend on the acute side with those volumes that were, frankly, stronger than we thought they would be. I'm know you're pointing to overtime usage and contract labor, but is the right way to think about it, is that the way it's going to be now, even if you have strong volumes, you are not going to be able to get the margin leverage? Or can we assume that somehow the volumes came in stronger than you were expected, and you were scrambling somewhat to keep staffing in line, and if those volumes continue to be strong, you will get margin leverage? Steve Filton : So, A.J., I'm going to go back again. I talked about our original presumptions for behavioral margins for the year and behavioral business. I'm going to do it on the acute as well. Our 2016 acute care guidance presumed 6% revenue growth and 7% or 8% EBITDA growth. And again, I think those projections and that EBITDA growth already presume that there would be some level of labor inflation because of pressure on wage rates and pressure on increased use of premium pay, et cetera. The acute results have been choppier and a little bit more volatile than the behavioral results I think, and I\u2019ve encouraged people not to look at a particular quarter as reflective or emblematic of the trajectory, but to look at the last four or five quarters combined. And I think if you look at the business that way, we have been pretty routinely hitting at least that 6% revenue growth target, and I think during that period, we also have margin expansion. Again, I don't think we are going to have it every single quarter. I think there will be some quarters that\u2019ll be tighter than others. But I think over time, those metrics that I laid out are still very sustainable from our point of view. A.J. Rice: Okay. You mentioned the two deals that you\u2019re working on the behavioral side in collaboration, are those traditional joint ventures? Can you give us a little more flavor? Are you taking on the bulk of the capital commitment there, or are they participating - your partners participating with you on that? Steve Filton : So, I think it's difficult to describe the model deal here. Everyone is different. I described a number of arrangements we have where we simply lease beds from an acute care hospital and run a behavioral unit effectively in their building or on their campus. And in those cases, we take on all the economics other than paying them a lease payment. In the deals I described in my remarks, we are building new facilities, and in each of those cases, I think the acute care partner will contribute their percentage of the capital investment. And the partnership percentages vary. Some of these are 50/50 deals; some of them are 80/20 deals, where we're the 80% partner. Again, I think one of the things that we\u2019re willing to do is provide these acute care hospitals with a lot of optionality as to how we can proceed. And we\u2019d love to have all the economics where - but if we have an acute care partner who wants to retain a significant amount of economics and we can reach an agreement on that, I think we are happy to do that. So, I think you are going to see these deals take a lot of different forms. In the end, I think they all provide us an opportunity to broach a patient population that we've just never been able to really penetrate before in a meaningful way. Alan Miller : A moderate position with regard to that on the corporate level is attractive because people that are dealing with us realize if it works out properly, we have the capital to invest. So it makes us more attractive than others who are overleveraged. A.J. Rice: Yes, yes, I understand that. That was my last question on the capital deployment from here. I didn't know you were active on the buyback front in the quarter. I know you have said there are deals out there you are talking to, both on the behavioral and acute side. Any update on where you think the capital is going? Are these projects going to take on more capital you think, or is it more of those other two? Steve Filton : I think, A.J. we always describe ourselves as opportunistic, and that's not a throwaway term from our perspective. We believe that we\u2019re going to try and respond to opportunities on both the acute and behavioral side that make economic sense and that earn a reasonable return, whether those opportunities are organic and building new facilities as we\u2019ve done in Las Vegas, or inorganic through acquisitions on the behavioral side, or inorganic through these investments in new partnerships with acute hospitals. As you point out, we've also been an active acquirer of our own shares. We\u2019re bullish on intermediate and long-term prospects of both our business segments and feel like our current valuations are reasonable, and investing in our own EBITDA stream is a good investment as well. So, I think you're going to continue to see us do all these things, continue to invest capital in our existing franchises that are growing and are strengthening or being strengthened in these new arrangements with acute hospitals on the behavioral side, and we're going to continue to look at M&A on both sides of the business as well, and be an active acquire of our own shares. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question will come from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Frank Morgan : Good morning. Steve, I was hoping you could give us a little color on the sequential - or I'm sorry - the progression through the months of the quarter maybe on the two lines of business. And then secondly, looking at your updated guidance it implies at the mid-point that your adjustment is really less than the amount of the shortfall of this quarter. So, I am curious, what do you see so far maybe in October that gives us confidence over the balance of the year? Thanks. Steve Filton : So, I will just remind people, everything - a week in healthcare seems like a lifetime, but back in July, there were a number of these sell-side surveys that were suggesting volumes are very weak, and there was a lot of concern and even panic over that. I think providers pointed out the fact that the calendar was working against us and that August would look better. In fact, I think we said at our September conferences that July and August volumes combined looked where we expected they\u2019d be. So, I think other than that dynamic, there was nothing about the progression or trajectory of the quarter that was terribly noteworthy. Look, the take on our guidance from my perspective was we were a little bit short of our own internal projections for the quarter. I think, the midpoint of the revised guidance presumes that the trends for Q3 just continue into Q4, and we'd probably be a little bit short again in Q4. If things improve and we're able to make some more immediate improvements in both the businesses, we should be able to gravitate towards the higher end of the range. And if things worsen, which is not really our expectation at this point, but if they did, we would gravitate more to the lower end of the range. Frank Morgan : Just one follow-up to be clear, between the two lines, both behavioral and acute, the trends were similar for both, or did you see any differences across the quarter in the two businesses? Thanks. Steve Filton : No, I don't think we saw any significant differences between the two businesses. Operator : The next question will come from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question just on behavioral, and I heard some of the comments, Steve, and I apologize if I missed others on the underlying demand for behavioral health services. Do you think there's any potential that we are seeing in the marketplace just better treatment options, better pharmaceuticals, et cetera? Is it possible that's cycling through and that maybe we are seeing a temporary reduction in demand for the services? Steve Filton : Look, I think that there's no question, and there has been an effort, and look, this is not exclusive to the behavioral business, but certainly in the behavioral business, on the part of payers to move patients to lower-cost settings of care. And so we've been under pressure - and none of this is new - to discharge patients as soon as is clinically appropriate, and I think we would argue in some cases even before it's clinically appropriate to move patients into outpatient settings or group homes or whatever it may be. But again, when I say that the underlying demand remains strong, Josh, I think we measure it by - we've talked a little about this concept on previous calls - we measure something we call deflections, which is when a patient is presented to us and they meet clinical criteria and they have some appropriate level of payment and effectively are eligible for admissions, and we are unable to admit them either because - historically the main reason we couldn't admit them is we didn't have a bed available in certain markets, in certain hospitals, and more recently, in the last or so, because we didn't have sufficient number of staff. But the number of deflections remain high. The number of patients who are being presented to us and meet the criteria to be admitted remains quite high, and those patients are being, again, deflected or turned away, and I think in a lot of these markets where a labor shortage is the issue, we think they are being turned away from multiples facilities. In other words, they are not finding treatment anywhere. And so again, I think the scenario you present is perfectly legitimate, and it has been occurring, and frankly, it's been occurring for a long time. I don't think it's necessarily accelerated or is terribly new in its form. But my view would be, the underlying demand remains quite strong despite those efforts. Joshua Raskin : Okay. That makes sense. And just a quick follow-up on CapEx. I know you had some big projects come online in Las Vegas, et cetera, and I know you've got a moderated view of CapEx next year, but are there any big projects you guys are contemplating where CapEx could be similar to 2016, or would that be highly unlikely at this point of the planning? Steve Filton : There is certainly no whole hospital acute care build projects that I think are on the drawing board for 2017, which I think is why we expect some moderation in the overall level of CapEx spend in 2017. But as I was responding to A.J.'s question before, I do think we see lots of other opportunities to expand services, to build new behavioral beds, et cetera. So again, I think we believe that CapEx will moderate some in 2017, but we\u2019re not going to see a dramatic decline because we think that there are still a lot of good opportunities out there to build revenue and EBITDA producing capacity. Obviously, again, when we give our guidance in February, we\u2019ll have a much more precise number to provide to everybody. But I think at least order of magnitude that shows you where we are headed. Joshua Raskin : Okay. That's perfect. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Ana Gupte with Leerink. Ana Gupte : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Hi, Steve. The first question I had - and I just got in a late, but on the acute side, how confident are you that the strength you are seeing will continue? And is there still more Medicare? That was what you had alluded to in previous quarters. Steve Filton : Yes, look, Ana, and I never like to boldly say we\u2019re 100% confident of anything, but if you look, as I have suggested before at the last four or five acute care quarters, even in what I think about, is I think about the third quarter of 2015 really being the beginning of, I'll call it, the post-ACA era where the bulk of the ACA impact had already been realized, et cetera. If you look at our acute care revenue growth in those four or five quarters subsequent to that, we\u2019ve been pretty consistently posting, again, at least that 6% revenue growth, which has been split pretty evenly between volume and price, and in fact, in many quarters, including this most recent quarter, we\u2019ve been exceeding that. So, yes I think our confidence level that we can continue, that that level of growth for our facilities and our markets is sustainable is a reasonable one. It's not pie in the sky. We have been posting those numbers, and we don't see anything on the horizon that really threatens that. The comments that I was making about payer mix was that the government payer mix seems to be moving in lock step with our overall growth. Commercial growth has slowed some; uninsured growth has increased some.  I think that's a reflection of some of the premium increases and exchange disenrollment that others have mentioned and people have been talking about. That's been factored into our numbers, and again, I think that's already reflected in the growth that we\u2019ve been able to achieve. So, again, I wouldn't say we have a 100% confidence level, but we\u2019re pretty confident in the sustainable level of our acute care revenue growth. Ana Gupte : And then on the pricing side, the volumes were strong. You alluded to the 6%. With the mix shifting, it seems like a little bit at least from commercial to Medicare and the shift in the commercial itself to lower-price sites of service, is that pricing growth as well sustainable? I know it is the outlook, finally, on your managed care contracts, and all of that put together on pricing. Steve Filton : Right, so just to be clear, the 6% was overall revenue growth, and that was split pretty evenly between volume and price. If you look it, revenue per admission in the third quarter per adjusted admission increased by 3%. Yes, I think that is based on acute care commercial pricing growth in the 4% to 6% range. I think we have been hitting those numbers pretty comfortably and don't see that changing dramatically anytime soon. Ana Gupte : And then finally, since acute is doing so well at this point, you had said I think at some point that you were at the table on discussions of smaller hospital chains and so on going - coming up for sale. Are you making more aggressive attempts to grow on the acute side given your strength? Steve Filton : I think our development folks would say they are already making a lot of aggressive attempts. I think we have been anxious and have been looking for opportunities to grow the acute care business and find well-positioned not-for-profit hospitals particularly that are for sale. Again, I mentioned in my remarks, it was a relatively small acquisition, but we did the Desert View acquisition in the greater Las Vegas market this quarter. And even though it's small, we feel like it was an important component of our overall strategy in Las Vegas, so we continue to look for those opportunities. So yes, we remain bullish on both of these businesses and their long-term prospects. And as I was saying, again, I think in my remarks to A.J. about capital deployment, we will continue to deploy capital in both businesses where it makes sense and where we can convince ourselves that an adequate return can be earned. Ana Gupte : Thanks so much. Appreciate the color. Steve Filton : Thanks Ana. Operator : The next question will come from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Whit Mayo : Hi, thanks. Steve, if memory serves me, you have a behavioral contract management business buried inside\u2026 Alan Miller : Please speak up. Whit Mayo : Sorry. Steve, was just asking about Horizon Health behavioral contract management business that you have. That was an organization that had a lot of pricing pressure over the years. Just wondering if you are trying to leverage the infrastructure with Horizon as you pursued joint ventures and other transactions with hospitals and what the pricing has been within that industry, and is that business really helpful as you pursue these conversations? Steve Filton : Sure, so just a tiny bit of context here. Horizon was a stand-alone public company that was in the business of managing behavioral units for acute care hospitals. They were acquired a number of years ago by PSI, and then obviously, we acquired Horizon as part of the PSI acquisition. We continue to run that Horizon business, and they continue to have - I'm doing this off the top of my head, but it was something like 100 of these contracts around the country where they are managing behavioral units for acute care hospitals. The upside of that business is somewhat limited because basically, for the most part, they are just earning a management fee and they're really not able to generally share in the economics of the units that they are running. We certainly are using that Horizon foundation, if you will, as a base to talk to both their existing clients, as well as their prospects. They certainly have had a robust business development function for years that is very helpful because they really - what they have focused on are these acute care hospital behavioral units, and so our focus expands to those businesses, the Horizon knowledge and database is quite useful. So yes, we\u2019re leveraging that platform to effectively, I think, create a newer business model that allows us to participate in more of the economics of those acute care behavioral businesses. But yes, having Horizon is certainly a helpful dynamic. Whit Mayo : Got it. And maybe one last one, just remind us the startup cost that you anticipate with the opening of Henderson and the timeframe to break even. Steve Filton : Sure. We talked about at the beginning of the year and embedded in our guidance was the fact that there would probably be a $10 million EBITDA drag in the back half of the year from both the pre-opening and a startup lost perspective at Henderson. We had a $2 million or $3 million drag in the third quarter, which implies a $7 million or $8 million drag in the fourth quarter, and I think those numbers are still largely good. Again, we will be more precise when we give our 2017 guidance, but we certainly think that Henderson will become EBITDA positive for the full year of 2017. We will give more details of that at the end of the fourth quarter. Whit Mayo : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. So going back to another question, I guess you said you feel comfortable about the growth rate being sustainable on the acute care side of the business. How do you feel about margins? Because I was a little bit surprised by the margin pressure that we have seen, is this the right way to think about margins over the long term, or do you see upside or downside to that to get - what's the normal margin to think about over time? Steve Filton : So, I think, Kevin, what I said was that our original guidance for 2016 was that acute care revenue would grow by about 6% same store, and that margins or EBITDA would grow by 7% to 8% margins, which means that margins would expand at least somewhat. I think if you go back and you look, not just at this quarter, but at the last four or five quarters, you will see that we\u2019re doing both of those things. We are growing revenue by at least 6%, and we are expanding margins. I can see this; it is somewhat choppy. It\u2019s somewhat volatile. There are some quarters where there's margin contraction, et cetera, but I think over that period of time, we have been able to achieve those metrics, and I think our point of view is going forward, we'll continue to be able to achieve those metrics. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, so you think that over the next several years, margins should be, on average, higher than where they are today in the acute care business? Steve Filton : Certainly, as long as revenue growth continues at a level of 6% or so, I think we believe that over time, margins will continue to expand. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then moving to the IMD, when we think about the opportunity, obviously, there's an opportunity to talk to the 1,200 hospitals - well, when you talk about JVs, are you talking about doing a JV with one of the 1,200 hospitals that has a unit already and moving it out, or are you talking to the 3,800 hospitals that don't even have a capability and building something from scratch. Because it seems the 3,800 is the bigger opportunity, trying to collect that volume. How do you think about that? Steve Filton : Well, I think the way to think about it is, the 3,800 acute care hospitals that don't have a behavioral unit have some relationship today where they are sending their adult Medicaid patients, and quite frankly, any of their psych patients, generally to another acute care hospital, certainly the adult Medicaid patients. We may be getting some of their other patients. And so yes, I think our point of view is that the way to penetrate that adult Medicaid business is to go where those patients are being treated today, and that is in the 1,200 or so acute hospitals that have a behavioral unit. We certainly are having conversations with those other hospitals, and honestly, I think we have been having conversations with them all along about referring patients from their EDs to our behavioral units where we live in a market with them. Kevin Fischbeck : Do you see any potential threat to your ED, acute care ED volume that comes with psych if those patients now can go to a freestanding facility? Do you think that your acute care hospital volumes could be redirected to a freestanding facility now? Is that an offset, or how do you think about that as a potential offset to IMD? Steve Filton : No, look, I think, first of all, we only have a relatively small number of our acute hospitals that have an existing behavioral unit. I think for the most part, again, acute hospitals control where their patients go, and so I don't think freestanding hospitals can just snap their fingers and redirect patients. I think the acute hospital is still in the position of being able to control their own patients, which is why we're most focused on this collaborative effort to work with acute care hospitals to penetrate that behavioral business. So, no, I don't think we see an offset from the loss of IMD business on our acute side of the business. Kevin Fischbeck : It just seems to me that they can steer where those volumes go. They might not want to send it to a competitor on their acute care business. They had to before because they had no other option, but now, they might say, okay, we now have another option, and that they would steer it away. But you are not hearing that or seeing that yet? Steve Filton : No. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions. Steve Filton : Okay, we thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody at the end of the fourth quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Rice - UBS Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital Paula Torch - Avondale Partners Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird Operator : Good morning. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to today's fourth quarter earnings call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Filton. Sir, you may begin. Steve Filton : Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the full year and fourth quarter ending December 31, 2016. During the call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the Company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $7.14 for the year and $1.78 for the quarter. After adjusting each period for the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health report applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $176 million or $1.80 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $170.7 million or $1.71 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2015. On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues decreased 9.3% during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions increased 4.7% while revenue per adjusted admission increased 2.6%. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 16.5% during the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to 17.2% during the fourth quarter of 2015. On a same-facility basis revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.2% during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.1% and 1.4%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 0.5% during the fourth quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior-year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 26.0% and 26.8% during the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.288 billion during 2016 as compared to $1.021 billion during 2015. Contributing to the increase is a $200 million favorable change in working capital accounts experienced during 2016 as compared to 2015 resulting from the timing of disbursements. Our accounts receivable days outstanding remained unchanged at 52 days during each of the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015. At December 31, 2016 our ratio of debt to total capitalization was approximately 48%. We spent $124 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2016 and $520 million during the full year of 2016. In 2016 we completed and opened 221 new acute care beds including 130 beds at our newest acute care facility, Henderson Hospital in Henderson, Nevada and 437 new behavioral health beds, including two de novo facilities. During 2016 we expect to spend approximately $475 million to $500 million on capital expenditures which includes expenditures to capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities. As previously announced, at the end of 2016 we completed the acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC's adult services division consisting of 79 inpatient and 2 outpatient behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom. Working in conjunction with our existing behavioral facilities located in the UK we believe these newly acquired facilities will ensure that we're well positioned to serve patients, customers and communities with a broad range of innovative treatment services and products. In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014 during the fourth quarter of 2016 we repurchased 475,000 shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $52 million or $109 per share. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2016 we have repurchased approximately 4.39 million shares at an aggregate price of approximately $514 million or $117 per share. $286 million remained on this previous share repurchase authorization at the end of 2016. Our estimated range of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 is $1.746 billion to $1.821 billion, representing an increase of approximately 5% to 10% over the $1.653 billion of EBITDA generated during 2016. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2017 is $7.70 to $8.20 per diluted share. This guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.15 per diluted share of EHR impact expected during 2017 as well as the impact on our provision for income taxes and net income attributable to UHS resulting from our January 1 adoption of ASU 2016-09, as mentioned in our press release. This adjusted EPS guidance range represents an increase of approximately 5% to 12% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $7.32 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 as calculated on the supplemental schedule included in last night's press release. During 2017 our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $10.62 billion to $10.76 billion, representing an increase of approximately 9% to 10% over our 2016 net revenues. Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : First question just in terms of the behavioral business, I wanted to see if you can talk about whether there's been any impact to behavioral operations post the BuzzFeed article. And if you could talk to - I know it came out in December - potentially even January and February and what you have seen year to date here, Steve, that would be great. And also any change in the level of activity on the investigation post that article, as well. Steve Filton : Sure. When the BuzzFeed article came out which was in early December, we obviously speculated at the time and anticipated that we did not believe the article would have much, if any, impact on our underlying behavioral operations, on demand, on our referral sources, on the behavior of our clinicians, et cetera. Unfortunately we went into our quiet period about a week after the article so we didn't really comment with any great specificity after that. So, it's with a measure of relief that I'm happy to say that with the passage now of several months that all that we represented at the time really seems to be valid and verifiable, that there's been little impact on our underlying business. I think you see that in our Q4 volumes which incrementally improved during the quarter and continued to get a little bit better with each passing quarter. And I think we can say that in January and February that improvement continued. So, again, from an underlying operational perspective, we see no material evidence that the BuzzFeed article has had an impact on us. In terms of the investigation, we filed our 100K last night and if you read the legal disclosure section you'll see that there's really no change to the disclosure there which I think is an indication that our conversations with the government and the activity with the government has also not changed, at least in any way that's apparent to us, in any measurable way since the BuzzFeed article came out. Justin Lake : And if I could just ask a follow up on behavioral, the EBITDA guidance that you've given for the year, can you talk about what you'd expect in terms of - I know you don't give quarterly guidance - but how you see the ramp in both behavioral volumes for the year and behavioral EBITDA growth for the year and what you think EBITDA growth in total would be for behavioral organically and M&A? Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure. What we have talked about, quite frankly, for some time now is that beginning in the middle of 2015, really with the third quarter of 2015, our behavioral revenues and volumes became more muted and we largely attributed that moderation to difficulties in finding an adequate number of clinicians, mostly nurses but to some degrees psychiatrists and mental health technicians, in certain markets to service the demand and the patients who were requesting services at our facilities. We've been working on that issue ever since and have and have said that we believe in the back half of 2016 that we're beginning to make some incremental progress and that our expectation was that by the time we got to the end of 2017, we would be back to what we consider a normalized run rate which would be something like 5% or 5.5% revenue growth and 6% or 7% EBITDA growth. I think if you look at the cadence of how we expect that recovery to continue, I think it's what creates, in large part, the range of our guidance for next year. So, I would say the midpoint of our range for next year assumes that that recovery in our behavioral revenues and volumes takes place rather ratably over the course of the year. The low end of the range would suggest it takes place a little more slowly and I think the high end of the range would suggest it takes place a little more quickly than that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of A.J, Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: Just maybe to follow up on the guidance a little further, can you just maybe give us some flavor for how your assumptions relate on the acute care side and also any commentary on your capital deployment assumptions? I know you were buying back stock in the fourth quarter. Are you assuming that continues this year? Steve Filton : Again, I think that our acute care guidance for next year is really something we've been talking about for some time and that is, while we're extremely pleased with our robust acute care volumes and revenue care growth in 2016, we acknowledge that they are industry-leading numbers and, frankly, industry-leading numbers by quite a large margin. And obviously certainly we're going to try and stem those numbers as much as we can but, realistically, feel like some moderation is likely. The guidance for next year presumes that acute care same-store revenue growth moderates to something in the neighborhood of 6% next year and that that would translate to 7% or 8% EBITDA growth. And while you didn't ask this and while we don't normally give quarterly guidance, I will mention that, as people look at their quarterly models, they should just keep in mind that, particularly in Q1, our comparisons for 2016 are very difficult on the acute care side. So, I would, again, suggest to people that that's something you keep in mind as you think about the cadence for next year. As far as capital deployment goes, historically, our convention has been to simply reflect in our guidance the share repurchases we've made already at the time of our guidance but then not assume any further share repurchases and a just really assume that all of our free cash flow goes toward the repayment of debt which, in our case, would be the repayment of relatively low-cost debt. So, from a guidance perspective, it's a fairly conservative position to take, but consistent with what we've historically done. A.J. Rice: And just maybe a follow-up - I know the last two quarters you talked about the fact that the IMD exclusion has given rise to a number of discussions with acute care guys that have units and are either looking to potentially have you managed, outsource, even acquire assets. Can you just comment on what that looks like? Is the acquisition pipeline in behavioral in particular stepped up in any way? Maybe some flavor on that. Steve Filton : Sure. So, I would note this - in the fourth quarter of 2016, our overall Medicaid volumes have grown by about 3.5%, our overall rotation days, compared to the 1.5% divisional-wide growth. So, our Medicaid volumes are growing faster than our overall volumes. It is impossible for us to attribute that directly to the impacts of the IMD exclusion being lifted, et cetera, but it seems to be consistent with the idea that we'd be getting some benefit from that. At the same time, and I don't think the two are absolutely directly related, but, as you suggest, we have talked a great deal of the last few quarters about the fact that we are having much more frequent conversations with acute care hospitals about, in some way, penetrating and sharing in the economics of their behavioral health facilities. And we probably have about a half a dozen arrangements that we've had a place for some time representing executed transactions already reflecting that. Those numbers are already embedded in our same-store results. I think we concluded that there was no point in trying to extract them or really call them out separately. As we move forward, I think we will identify these new arrangements separately and talk about EBITDA impact, et cetera. We announced in the third quarter, for instance, two joint ventures to build new behavioral freestanding facilities with acute care hospitals, one in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and one in Spokane, Washington. Neither of those will have an impact in 2017. They will both open in 2018 so they don't really have an impact on guidance but it's something we continue to work on. And then we probably have about a dozen other conversations that I would describe as likely resulting in some sort of arrangement but still a little too early to discuss them with any level of specificity. And then, quite frankly, a number of other conversations that are at much more preliminary levels or preliminary stages. So, we continue to view the opportunity to penetrate or integrate the behavioral units within these acute care hospitals as a tremendous development opportunity for us, not just in the next year or two but, frankly, for the intermediate and long term. And we will continue to report on those as we do then. But other than the about half a dozen that, I think, as I said, are already embedded in our same-store numbers, I don't think those conversations and those new arrangements are likely to have a material impact in 2017. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Josh Raskin : First question, Steve, for you, just on the outpatient environment, the competitive environment, and what you're seeing in your markets. Are you seeing any additional competition from freestanding EDs or surgery centers or even urgent care centers? I'm just curious what your reaction is on the acute care side? Steve Filton : I know that a number of our acute care peers have talked about that dynamic of increased outpatient competition from all the sources that you mentioned - freestanding EDs, ambulatory surgery centers, et cetera. And certainly we have noticed and continue to feel the same dynamics. Now, I will say that it appears, if you look just look at the relationship between our admissions and adjusted admissions, that we haven't had the negative impact on our outpatient revenue that at least some of our peers have had. I don't necessarily have any real explanation for that other than it may well be that in some of our more mid-sized urban or suburban markets that outpatient pressure is not quite as severe as it is in some of these really large urban markets. That's really mostly speculation on my part. It does look, as you compare our outpatient numbers to our peers, that our outpatient volumes are holding up a little bit better, although certainly we feel the same pressures from these niche outpatient providers that our peers report, as well. Josh Raskin : And do you see that, Steve, in, think of, bigger market - Vegas or DC - versus McAllen, or something like that? Are you seeing that urban versus suburban differential? Steve Filton : Honestly, Josh, I almost have the view that in markets like McAllen and Las Vegas, that outpatient push occurred even earlier. Those happen to be two very, what I would describe as entrepreneurial from a physician perspective, market. So, while something like freestanding EDs are a relatively new development and concept, things like physician-owned surgery centers and even a physician-owned hospital, when it comes to the McAllen market, are things that we have been dealing with for years and years. So, I also think that maybe one of the issues is that, again, in some of our larger markets, we are maybe a little bit further along on that outpatient competition curve and so the comparisons don't look as difficult for us. Josh Raskin : And then just a quick question on the guidance, you guys added EBITDA this year, and I'm just curious - was that more just helpful for modeling purposes or are you guys thinking about management from a different perspective, EBITDA more of an emphasis than EPS, or any internal management change around metrics? Steve Filton : No, it's really just a function of giving people what they want. I've been asked by investors for a couple of years to include more detailed information, particularly about EBITDA, in the guidance. So, we thought it would just be useful progress. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners. Paula Torch : I wanted to start my first question with maybe the ACA and talking about behavioral volumes. I know that you said it's hard to parse it out. It's certainly hard for the Street to parse it out. So, I was just wondering, do you have any systems in place to help you track where admissions are coming from? How much of a benefit do you think that the ACA has actually been to your behavioral business? And in your opinion, do you think repeal-replace would do away with essential health benefits for mental health or substance abuse? And anything that you're hearing out of Washington? Our feeling is that this space is pretty immune. I just want to know from your perspective how immune do you think this segment really is? Steve Filton : Paula, I think what we have said up to now is that our view is that the Affordable Care Act has had relatively minimal impact on our behavioral business. The biggest impact we think it's had on our acute business has been on the Medicaid expansion side of it. And on the behavioral side, because most of those new Medicaid expansion patients are adult patients, and because the IMD exclusion has precluded those people from being treated in most freestanding behavioral facilities, that really wasn't a benefit for us. And on the commercial exchange side, because so many of those plans were high deductible plans, and because behavioral bills tend to be much smaller, we felt that, besides the anecdotal patient here or there or the incidental patient here or there, there really has not been a pervasive positive impact on our behavioral facilities that there has been on the acute facilities. As far as what the prospects are going forward, as you suggest, speculating how modifications to the ACA are going to deal with the essential health benefit piece of it is very hard to say at this point. While there's been tons of talk about repeal and replace, or repeal and repair, or whatever, there's very little agreement on any details because. The President suggested just a couple of days ago, this is a very complicated subject, and I think everybody's realizing that. So, I think it would be difficult to speculate how we'd be impacted, although I think we share the view that you articulated, Paula, which is that we believe that behavioral care and behavioral treatment in general is viewed positively at both the federal and state levels at the moment, and that it is not a segment or space that is under a lot of scrutiny or pressure. So, just our general expectations are that it will be treated favorably however the details are worked out progress Paula Torch : And then if I could just move quickly to the UK, I know the CMA is conducting a phase 1 investigation of your Cambian acquisition. I know that this is small in terms of your total business as well as your behavioral business, but I just wonder how those discussions with the CMA are going, if you started to identify any assets that you might possibly need to divest in order to satisfy their findings. And maybe it's too early but could you give us a sense of timing there and what kind of synergies you might be able to get from this acquisition? Steve Filton : Starting backwards, we never imagined that there would be significant synergies from this transaction. As you articulated, Paula, our existing footprint pre-Cambian in the UK was relatively small. So, there was not a great deal of overhead to be ultimately synergized, if you will, between the new Cambian business and our existing business, maybe ultimately $1 million or $2 million of ultimate savings. And we certainly haven't even included that in our guidance, or the assumption of that in our guidance. We certainly did our own due diligence before the transaction with trade restraint attorneys in the UK and had them look at the geographic overlap of the businesses we were acquiring and those that we already had, and generally concluded that we thought there was relatively minimal overlap and risk of CMA issues. But of course we won't know that until the CMA does there work. We have been providing information to the CMA almost from, I think even the time that we announced the transaction. They, of course, just announced this past week or last week that they were beginning their formal process. We don't really have a lot of feedback from them. We view this at the moment as just part of their routine exercise. As they communicate with us, we'll keep folks updated, but at the moment it's really impossible for us to know what direction and with what rigor and scrutiny they're going to approach this. Paula Torch : Okay And then I just have one more follow-up, if I could. On the behavioral pricing, it was a little bit weaker, certainly sequentially. Was that just a function of tougher comps? Or maybe there's any color you can give us on pricing? Steve Filton : I think the one nuance is that our year-over-year UK pricing, even though as you again articulated is a relatively small component of our business, the pound declined in value about 22% from the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2016. And that dramatic decline, even on our relatively small UK business, was enough to drive that same-store pricing metric down about 100 basis points. So, when you adjust for the currency fluctuation, we're at about 1.5% price increase, which is pretty consistent with what we've been running, and pretty consistent with what we, frankly, expect is a sustainable number. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin Fischbeck : I just wanted to go back to the improvement that you expect in the behavioral business because, as you mentioned, this has been going on since Q3 of 2015. I think at that time the initial thought was that once we comp against that in the back half of 2016 we'd be seeing acceleration, and it hasn't come back as quickly as we would have thought. Do you have any data around what's driving the sequential improvement as time goes on? Is there something that you're looking at from a workforce addition perspective, that you're onboarding nurses at some pace over the next few quarters that gives you visibility that this is going to happen? Or is it more about comp against easy numbers? Can you just provide a little more color as to why you're confident? Steve Filton : Sure. I think from the outset, based on our previous experience, I can think in my 30-plus years with the Company of maybe two or three other nursing shortages, relatively severe nursing shortages, that I have been through, mostly, honestly, on the acute side. They tend to, I think, have a life cycle to them because I think the market, as markets generally do, tend to correct themselves. So, as a nurse shortage becomes apparent and nurse wages and demand for nursing hours increases, the market responds in a macro way by more and more people enrolling in nursing school, by part-time nurses working extra shifts, by retired nurses coming out of retirement and working an extra shift here or there. There's a natural increase in the supply of nursing hours. Now, that takes some time, and I think historically has taken 18 to 24 months. So, if you peg the beginning of this shortage as right around the middle of 2015, we're just about at the 18-month mark with the end of 2016. So from a macro perspective, there's some of that, just expectation that the market itself and the macro environment will begin to improve beginning in 2017. Certainly as a Company, we have not been just sitting on our hands waiting for that to happen and we've been aggressively implementing our own initiatives to increase our recruitment activities and our recruitment focus and our recruitment infrastructure and our internet application process, and a million other things, as well as trying to focus on better retention policies for the nurses we do hire. That's been an enormous focus of ours, as well, so that once we hire nurses, making sure that we have mentoring programs and educational opportunities and career advancement incentives all in place so that we keep the nurses who we to hire. Now, all that, to be fair, is relatively generic, et cetera. I think what ultimately gives us confidence is that over the last couple of quarters, we clearly see the amount of nurse vacancies being reduced and a lot of those vacancies being filled. We see a number of the units that we have closed or in facilities where we've capped the census or limited the census. We've seen those caps either reduced or lifted. Now, what we do think Q3, and what we said we expect it to continue into Q4, is that there is this transition period, that as we hire new nurses there is some increased expense as we begin to pay them their salaries, but they are going through orientation, they're going through training. Frankly, one of the tactics that we've had to adopt in some cases is hiring less experienced nurses, more nurses who are directly out of nursing school so they require, frankly, more training, more orientation, which just elongates the period of time it takes. But it's really that visibility that we have, Kevin, into how many vacancies are open, how many beds we been able to re-open they gives us the confidence that, as we've been talking all along, will really begin to make some traction in 2017 in building those volumes back up to the pre-Q3 2015 levels. Kevin Fischbeck : Based upon that last comment, though, about the timing of costs and everything, does that mean that from an EBITDA growth perspective you would expect EBITDA growth to obviously follow a similar pattern but maybe even more so because at the beginning you're going to have more costs and less revenue, and then by the end the costs stay the same but the revenue accelerates? Or, how do you think about the margin improvement as the year goes on? Steve Filton : I think about it in a couple ways. I think that what we experienced in Q3 and, to some degree, continue to experience in Q4 is some, what I would describe as, duplicate costs, meaning we're paying these nurses, and we have that expense but they're not yet really productive. That is, they're not on the floors treating patients or they're not on the floors treating what we would describe as a normal or average workload of patients as we bring them incrementally into the system. Obviously at some point we will get past that incremental investment and this new expense, et cetera, and I think that will begin to occur in the first quarter of 2017. I DO think there is an ongoing level of increased expense. We've had to raise wage rates in a number of markets. We're using temporary nurses in markets at an added cost. And we've added temporary psychiatrists, quite frankly, in some markets that we haven't had to do in a long time. And I think the way we've reflected that is, we've talked about exiting 2017 with something like 5% behavioral revenue growth and 6% or 7% EBITDA growth. If we were having this conversation two years ago, I would have probably suggested at that time that 5% revenue growth translates to maybe 8% or 9% EBITDA growth. The moderation, I think, in the EBITDA growth assumptions is a reflection that some of this wage pressure and wage increase is more permanent in nature and something that we're going to have to deal with on a more permanent basis. So, I think about it, again, in some ways, as some of these costs are temporary, some are more permanent. But I think we've reflected all that in our guidance for next year and in the assumed and projected ramp-up in our earnings and revenue growth for next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte : I wanted to go back to the acute side. Can you just remind me, firstly, why the margins compressed again by 80 basis points year over year in 2016 relative to 2015? And how should we think about the puts and takes around wages and staffing and pricing and contracting and just normalized margins into 2017 and beyond? Steve Filton : Again, I don't think there is anything terribly new in Q4 in terms of the dynamics we've been discussing. Obviously, our volume and revenue growth on the acute side has been rather robust for a while now. But we've seen choppy performance in the resulting EBITDA, and not necessarily the pull-through on margins that we would normally expect. I think the biggest reason for that is, again, the labor shortage and the pressure on nurse wage rates that we've experienced on the acute side. We've said all along that I think the labor shortage has manifested itself in the two divisions in different ways. On the acute side, I think the labor shortage has manifested itself mostly through higher use of premium pay, overtime for our own nurses, and the use of temporary or registry nurses. And, by the way, I think it's related to our strong top line. One of the reasons why I think we're experiencing more labor pressure than some of our peers is because our end-market economies are improving faster, unemployment is dropping quickly. There are more labor shortages in our markets, I think, than in some of our peers' markets. That's why, quite frankly, our demand is growing so much. But at the same time there is this offsetting dynamic of higher pressure on wages. I think our expectation next year is that we will see some stabilization both, again, at a macro level and also we'll see some improvements from some of our own initiatives. And, as a result, I think we're expecting the acute care model to show somewhat moderating revenue trends next year but a return to what we would describe as a more normalized pull-through of EBITDA. So, with revenues growing by 6%, we would expect EBITDA to grow by 7% or 8%, and margins to expand. Now, again, I will make the same comment I made to Kevin - if you had asked me this question two years I would have said that maybe with 6% acute care revenue growth, EBITDA margins would expand 8% or 9%. And I think the fact that we've moderated that view is a reflection that we think that some of these wage increases are more permanent in nature. Ana Gupte : Then on the bad debt side, again, you did well this quarter. Your AR receivables you said were trending well. One of your peers has had issues on AR receivables and collectibility from commercial peers. I was just wondering if you were seeing anything. It is related to exchanges or any other businesses that maybe put some pressure going forward? Steve Filton : I think those who listen to our calls and commentary will know that we tend not to really focus on bad debt as a distinctive line. But we tend to focus much more on our overall net revenue growth and net revenue per admission growth on the acute side net of bad debt expense. Our net revenue growth per admission was about 2.5% in the quarter. That's really largely within our expectations, and I think continues to be so. Now, look, much like I was saying about outpatient competition before, I think we feel like some of the dynamics our peers have talked about we certainly have experienced, as well. There's no question that over the last few years payers have shifted more of the ultimate payment burden to the consumer and to the patient, and we are collecting, we're being asked to collect more, on co-pays and deductibles from the patients themselves than we have been asked to collect from insurance companies historically. And that is certainly a tougher exercise and we certainly are making changes in our approach, in our systems, et cetera, to do that more effectively. think we feel it has certainly having an impact and has somewhat pressured our overall net revenue yield over the last couple of years, but I don't think we feel like that's accelerated in any material way in the last quarter or two. And I think we just feel like that's a trend that, again, is now just a part of the business and something that we've kept in mind as we've created our 2017 guidance. Ana Gupte : Okay. And if I could squeeze one last one - that was very helpful, Steve - on the acute volumes, you talked a lot about the economy in your specific markets, some of your visibility into peer mix. At earlier times, I think maybe a year ago you used to talk more about Medicare and perhaps driving more volumes through whatever clinical practices and treatment guidelines and the like. Is anything coming from there at all? And then, finally, on 1Q, is there a positive impact from the flu? You've talked about tough comps, obviously, given your performance last year. How does the leap day comp all work into 1Q guidance - or just 1Q performance since you don't have guidance? Steve Filton : We have tended, I think, to artificially describe the middle of 2015 as the end of the ACA era. And obviously the ACA has continued to have an impact. But I think our point of view was the most dramatic and meaningful impact from the ACA really occurred in 2015 and the first half of 2015. And I think since, the back half of 2015 and in the four quarters since then, the payer mix dynamics that we've experienced have been pretty consistent. You repeated them, to some degree. The strongest growing segment of our payer population has been the Medicare population. Medicaid is probably second. We have seen our commercial volumes decline a little bit, and we have seen our uninsured volumes tick back up. And, again, again I think all of those dynamics have really been fairly consistent for the last four quarters or so. We view that, again, as indicative of the underlying strength in our markets because I think Medicare business is largely unimpacted by the ACA. It's largely impacted by a lot of the economic recovery issues. It just, I think, is reflective of the strong market share position we have in our markets, our ability to take market share and grow demand, et cetera. And I think we have a view that continues. As far as the flu, interestingly, I think in most of our markets, I know that generally it's been a relatively busy flu season, particularly over the last four to six weeks. I think in most of our markets it's been a pretty moderate flu season. Now, again, I think we tend to largely ignore the transient impact of the flu either way. But I will say that I don't think we're benefiting greatly from the flu in our markets. And, finally, I think the leap year, leap day, that's just a mathematical issue. It just makes what for us - which I already said earlier - was a very difficult comparison in Q1 just even a little bit more difficult, but not something that I think has any real impact on our ultimate and full-year guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman : Steve, in the past you've talked about a shortage of psychiatrists in some markets actually forcing you to put a hold on patient admissions. Is that still the case and to what extent? Steve Filton : When this labor shortage really started to manifest itself in the middle of 2015, we talked a lot about the psychiatrist shortage because, quite frankly, in the beginning that's what I think was most impactful on us. I think what we found was that we were able to devise ways to mitigate the physician and psychiatrist shortage more easily. We used things like telemedicine. We used things like physician extenders, RNs and psychologists, doing some of the work that psychiatrists had traditionally done, to fill in for that. And I think it proved to be fairly effective. While we continue to have some pockets of psychiatry shortages in a few markets, I think we don't view that as a really pervasive issue at this point. Relatively quickly the bigger issue became nursing shortages and we really couldn't find the same kinds of solutions, meaning there were not technical solutions. You really can't replace a nurse with telemedicine. They really are at the bedside. They're the hands-on provider. You really can't extend the nurses' duties with people under them because the people under them tend to be non-professionals. So, the nurse shortage proved to be a little bit more intractable to us, so that remains an issue. Again, just back to my overall comments, I think we feel like we've made progress on our clinician shortages in general. I think you've seen that reflected in slightly improving, incremental improvement in volumes in Q3 and Q4. We obviously would hope that the pace of those improvements will accelerate in 2017, and expect that they well. Gary Lieberman : And then maybe just a follow-up on the benefit from the IMD exclusion or the potential benefit. Are there things you need to do proactively, like making sure you're in appropriate plans and actually going out and marketing to referral sources? Or is it more reactive just from the perspective, that patients that show up at the hospital you're now allowed to accept them as opposed to previously turning them away? Steve Filton : We have to do what you said, which is, in order to have access to these managed Medicaid patients, we obviously have to make sure that we are a contract provider with the appropriate managed Medicaid plans in particular markets. I think for the most part we have been able to accomplish that and that has not been a real hurdle. I think the hurdle, which may have been under-appreciated, quite frankly, by providers as well as by investors, has been that this pattern of referrals and this pattern of patient behavior has been in place for decades. These adult Medicaid patients have been accustomed, I think, to going to acute care emergency rooms when they need care. And our ability to step in and just redirect what are these decades old patterns in a very short period of time is somewhat limited. Now, again, I think we're trying to do that. And we can certainly engage with the managed care companies to help us in that endeavour by competing on the basis of price and offering lower rates. But I think what we've concluded is that the more economically effective way to get to those patients is in some sort of collaborative venture with the acute care hospital - getting them to close their units down and send their patients to us, or getting them to lease their behavioral units or freestanding behavioral facilities to us, or joint venturing their facilities with us, or joint venturing new facilities with us. We've done every version of what I just described and we continue to negotiate with more acute care hospitals to do every version of what I just described. I think ultimately that's the way that we will really enjoy the benefit of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, although, again, in the short run, as I was suggesting, I think we're already seeing, we're likely to see some incremental benefit just from an increase in Medicaid utilization, which clearly we have already experienced. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird. Whit Mayo : Maybe just an update on Henderson, I know it's early but how is that hospital tracking versus planned? And is that new capacity having any impact on your existing presence within the market? I think it's a lot closer to Dignity's facilities. But just curious how this is playing out versus your initial expectations. Steve Filton : It's still relatively early, Whit. The facility opened in the beginning of October. We had consistently guided and told people that it would have an impact on EBITDA - an EBITDA drag, if you will - of $5 million to $10 million in the back half of 2016. I think that the actual results are absolutely in that range. I think our expectation embedded in our guidance for 2017 is a turnaround and some level of accretion. And, honestly, I think the turnaround at Henderson would otherwise have provided a bigger tailwind for us in our 2017 guidance except for the fact - and these are unrelated but I think they wind up mathematically offsetting each other - but we've got a schedule in the 10-K, for when folks get a chance to read it in more detail, that shows our Texas Medicaid reimbursement and our expectations that our Texas Medicaid reimbursement will go down $16 million or $17 million in 2017. That decline, unfortunately, I think, largely offsets the improvement in Henderson. What I think we were hoping would be a standalone tailwind really doesn't. It winds up just being an offset for us. As far as cannibalizing our existing business, you described as very quickly, I think every other hospital that we've opened in the last 10 or 15 years in Vegas has, to some degree, cannibalized some existing business, mostly on the [indiscernible] side of the market. But in the case of Henderson in the southeast part of Las Vegas, that's been a market that has historically been dominated by Dignity. And I think we have the view that most of the market share that we would take would be from Dignity. That seems to certainly be the outcome in the first few months of operation. Whit Mayo : Are there any other supplemental reimbursement changes we should be aware of? LIP? California provider fee? I think you got a little there. Just curious if there's anything we should be mindful of. Steve Filton : I don't think anything else that's a material change for next year or this year. Whit Mayo : Okay. And maybe just one last one - DSOs ticked up a bit. I don't know if that's just Cambian mathematically flowing into the financial statements. But just any color to share would be helpful. Steve Filton : Yes, I think they're actually flat between the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. Operator : And we have no other questions in queue at this time. Steve Filton : Okay. We would like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everyone again at the end of the first quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Rice - UBS Justin Lake - Wolfe Research Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners Ralph Giacobbe - Citi Whit Mayo - Robert Baird Ann Hynes - Mizuho Securities Operator : Good morning. My name is Toni, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Thank you. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. And we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services Results for the First Quarter ended March 31, 2017. During this call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements I recommend the careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended on December 31, 2016. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.12 for the quarter. After adjusting for the favorable impact from our January 1 adoption of ASU 2016-09, as discussed in our press release and the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records, applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.10 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 4.8% during the first quarter of 2017. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions, and a 0.4% decrease in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 19.7% during the first quarter of 2017 from 21.1% during the first quarter of 2016. On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 1.4% during the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.4%, and adjusted patient days increased 0.2% over the prior year first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 1.1% during the first quarter of 2017 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division increased to 25, excuse me, decreased to 25.6% during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as compared to 27.5% during the comparable prior year period. Our cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately $483 million during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $475 million in the first quarter of 2016. Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined slightly to 50 days during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to 51 days during the first quarter of last year. Our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization declined to 45.2% at March 31, 2017 as compared to 47.7% at December 31, 2016. We spent $144 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2017. Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Joanna Gajuk : This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. So first on the psych business, if I may. So same-store revenue growth decelerated, right, to 1.4% from like a 2% growth, call it, from second half of '16, right? So there's probably a leap year impact there, right, which maybe the 100 basis points, is that right? Steve Filton : Correct. Joanna Gajuk : And then, was there also maybe some headwinds still from the exchange rates, right, because in the Q4, you said it was about 100 basis points. So was it also in that ballpark? Steve Filton : Yes. I think it was a little bit lower, but yes, we have the same sort of directionally currency impact in the quarter. Joanna Gajuk : Okay. So I guess if you adjust for those two things for the leap year and the exchange rate, so maybe your kind of say, core sort of same-store revenue growth was maybe 3%, 3.5%. So what I'm getting at, and the main question that I have here is last quarter you kind of talked about your expectations for that business to come back to a 5% call it, same-store revenue growth by the end of the year. So do you feel like in traction, you're getting towards the target, and how you're going to get there whether it's 3% or 3.5% kind of starting point for the year? Steve Filton : Okay. Thanks, Joanna. Yes. So I think everything that you said is accurate, and I think for the most part, we feel like we're largely on track to continue to improve. I think we started to see improvement in our behavioral volumes and consequently, revenues in the back half of 2016. I think admission growth continued to improve into the first quarter, and we continue to adhere to our guidance, which is that we anticipate exiting 2017 at about a 5%, 5.5% same-store revenue growth rate in behavioral which would restore us to sort of where we were right around the middle of 2015 when we started to suffer from labor shortages, both physicians and nurses in a number of our hospitals. Joanna Gajuk : Okay, that's good to know. And a follow-up to that was -- so the one thing I've noticed was for the same-store length of stay was actually down 2% year-over-year. And I guess it was somewhat stable in '16. I mean, prior to '16, you had multiple years of declines but I guess '16, it seemed like it was stabilizing. So is there something that you've noticed in Q1? Or is there some impact from the leap year effect here? How should we think about length of stay in terms of same-store, and how's that kind of impacted the adjusted patient days? Steve Filton : Yes. So well, length of stay was down about 2% in the quarter as you note and that obviously has a muting impact on revenues because virtually, all of our reimbursement is on a per day or per diem basis in the behavioral business. The decline in length of stay was in our acute behavioral business. We're doing, I think some further analysis, but anecdotally, as I talked to the hospitals, it seemed like it seemed to be focused on the managed Medicaid portion of our business, but it wasn't really focused specifically on a particular payer or a particular geography or a particular hospital. It didn't strike me in the work that I did in reviewing it to be necessarily indicative of a continuing trend. And as you point out, length of stay has been relatively stable for well over a year now. So we'll see as we move forward, but, and I did notice that our public peer announced a similar decline in their U.S. length of stay during the quarter, and I don't know if they had any comments on it, but it seemed, we seem to have a similar dynamic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Gary Lieberman : Maybe can you update us on your JV pipeline with hospitals that you've talked about in order to attempt benefit from the changes to the IMD exclusion? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, what we've said before, Gary, I think is, remains largely true, and that is, we continue to have a large number of conversations with a variety of not-for-profit hospitals, largely not-for-profit, actually, some for-profit hospitals around the country about being able to joint venture with them in some way to help them run their behavioral operations. Some of those conversations have already been executed and acted upon. We had, as I think we've mentioned before, probably 7 or 8 existing arrangements that, quite frankly, have been existing for quite some time now. We announced a couple of new hospitals that we're building in conjunction with acute care systems last quarter or the quarter before that. And we continue to have significant number of conversations with other hospitals. We continue to believe that, that opportunity that we describe as acute care integration is probably our single biggest, at least domestically, the business development opportunity over the next several years. And we are very focused on it and devoting a significant amount of resources to it. Gary Lieberman : So maybe, can you just update us on where you are in U.K. and the CMA review? And any remedies that you guys may expect to offer up? Steve Filton : So we got the report from the CMA last Friday, late last Friday on the markets that they have expressed some concern about. The way the process works, is we have until this Friday to decide whether we want to offer a remedy, as they describe it, which would be the divestiture of certain facilities. We are, literally, as we speak, going through the process of cost-benefit analysis of whether we think offering a remedy is an appropriate solution or whether we would just rather go to a Phase II review, where we think we might have some fairly robust and valid arguments that might cause the CMA in Phase II to modify their position, and we have to see. If we offer remedies this Friday, the CMA has until May to respond to those remedies and decide whether they are in their minds adequate. And if they decide they're inadequate, we would also go to Phase II. So obviously, within a couple of days, we'll make an announcement of what we have chosen to do. Gary Lieberman : I guess, maybe just to follow up on that. Have they said or have they told you how many actual facilities are under review? And if you do go to a Phase II review, is there any negative financial impact you've met? Steve Filton : So there are basically, I think 5 individual markets that the CMA has identified as having some level of concern with. I think the answer to your question is if we go to a Phase II, we don't really believe that there's any material implication in the sense that, and I think we were clear about this when we announced the transaction, that because our presence in the UK is relatively small and the transaction itself is relatively small, there were no significant synergies to be realized by the combination of our existing business and the Cambian adult business. So any delay is not really costing us in terms of being able to achieve some measurable amount of synergies. So we'll make a judgment again about whether the costs of going through Phase II, how that compares to the benefit of potentially getting the CMA to modify their position. Alan Miller : Also, were we to sell a facility or two facilities, there's a robust market in the UK And we would recoup whatever we sold the facilities for. So we have to see what that all means. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital. Frank Morgan : Certainly, HCA and even then they actually called out commercial mix shift. Are you seeing anything like that in your acute business? Steve Filton : Frank, I don't think so. We got some questions last night about the relatively flattish acute care revenue per admission and inquiries about whether that sort of implied some issues with payer mix. I think as we looked at our payer mix for the quarter, it seemed to be pretty consistent with what we've been running. And I would think that what is really sort of driving or the impetus behind that relatively flat revenue per admission are two things. One is simply mechanical and that is as we've talked about at some length, we opened our Henderson facility in the fourth quarter of last year in Las Vegas. As Alan mentioned on our year-end call, it's doing quite well. It's ramping up rather robustly, but obviously, its results and its revenues are in our non-same-store numbers to the degree that some of its business is coming from our existing facilities, and there's a cannibalization of some of our existing revenues in Vegas that's impairing or muting, I guess, a better word, our same-store revenues in the Vegas market. So there's a little bit of shift in my mind from same-store to non-same-store. And I think the other issue that we did see in the quarter was a bit of a decline in acuity. And again, nothing that I sort of view as worrisome or troubling in the sense that our surgical volumes were rather strong in the quarter. Surgeries were up 3% or 4% between in and outpatient. But our medical volumes were up even more, given the fact that our same-store adjusted admissions were up 5%, medical admissions were up even more. And the increase in medical admissions which tend to be lower acuity just skewed those revenue per admission numbers down a little bit. But I think that's more a function of a relatively robust admission numbers than anything else. Frank Morgan : Got you. And on the ED, emergency department, ER volumes, what were those on the same-store basis? Steve Filton : I think our ER volumes were up also, like 3% or 4% in the quarter. Frank Morgan : Okay. Maybe, if I can, just on the behavioral side. I think you're acknowledging that you're going to see some growing momentum in census that started last year and carrying on. Could you give us any color on how that volume moved across the months of the quarter? Did you end, say, the third month of the quarter at a high note? Or was it flat? Any kind of color on the possibility of growing momentum in census? Steve Filton : No. Other than what I said before, I mean, I think that stepping back from the quarter, and stepping all the way back to the back half of last year, I think beginning in Q3 of last year, we began to make some progress, particularly on this labor shortage issue. And I think our admission started to grow, albeit gradually and pretty incrementally, but we saw improvement in Q3, improvement in Q4, a little bit more improvement in Q1. Within the quarter, I wouldn't say there was any particular trajectory to point to, but again, over the last few quarters, I think that the trajectory has generally been incrementally positive, and we would hope that would continue through the balance of the year, and that certainly what our guidance is based on. Frank Morgan : Got you. One last question. On the 5 markets identified by CMA, how many beds or how much revenue would those 5 markets represent? And I'll hop off. Steve Filton : I'm not sure I know the answer to that question, Frank. I think what we're trying to, really more precisely, I think quantify is what other satisfactory remedy to the CMA would involve in terms of EBITDA that they would be asking us to divest. I'm not sure we certainly have a sense of what exactly that number is, but I would certainly make the argument that in terms of our consolidated EBITDA, it's a very minor number. We have a next question? Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Chris Rigg : I got on a little late here. So hopefully this wasn't covered, but when I look at the behavioral segment, EBITDAR margin down roughly 200 basis points year-to-year. Obviously, there are several moving factors there, but you've got the leap year, you've got the FX, and then sort of the core staffing concerns that have been out there for a while. Can you sort of just maybe flesh out those 3 items, just to give us a sense for what sort of anomalous because of the calendar in FX versus sort of core pressure? Steve Filton : I mean, I think the fundamental issue, Chris, and I think we've been pretty candid about this for a bit now, is that with same-store revenue growth of 1.5%, it is extremely difficult to have, I think in any sort of practical expectation of an expanding margin. We think we need to get to probably 3% or 4% same-store revenue growth to even begin to sort of have the possibility of expanding margins. And if we exit the year as our guidance suggests that we will at 5%, 5.5% revenue growth, then we believe, we will return to a model where we'd have expanding margins. But I think the reason that you see contracting margins currently is simply because our current revenue growth is not sufficient to support the increase in expenses. And I think we talked about this in the last quarter or 2, the current expense load does incorporate some investment in solving the labor shortage problem. Meaning, in wage increases in certain markets that we've had to make to be competitive as well as temporary use of, or use of temporary nurses and temporary physicians, so there's some amount of what I would call extra or excessive expense as well. So until we get that same-store revenue growth up to a somewhat higher level than we are today, I think we're going to be faced with these relatively stagnant or even declining margins. Chris Rigg : Got you. And then on the labor issue, and I'm not even sure if this is the right way to think about it. But can you give us a sense do you think you sort of fixed the problem, are you 80% of the way to fixing the problem, 50%? I'm just trying to get a sense for where you think you are in terms of getting things completely under control and sort of back to normal inflationary trends. Steve Filton : I get asked that question a lot, and it's a difficult one to answer because it sort of implies that it's kind of a fixed or static issue, and you can sort of measure, as you ask the question, you measure your sort of percentage of achievement. And the challenge really is that it's very fluid and I think we've made a lot of progress on hiring nurses and physicians and filling vacancies. We've worked hard to increase our retention rates and reduce our turnover rates, but they're constantly changing. I mean, literally, every quarter, we're hiring new nurses, and some are leaving. I sort of think about it as a process in which we take two steps forward and one step back. We make improvements, I would cite, Boston is a market that was maybe at one point in time, our number one more challenging market from a labor perspective. We've got multiple facilities in that market, and I think all of them are really running kind of back to normal levels with the exception of maybe one. But a couple of other markets have proven to be a little more problematic in the interim. So I think we're making net progress, and I think that net progress is reflected in that incrementally growing admission number. But it's hard to peg it as a sort of a percentage of achievement towards the ultimate goal. It's sort of a constant and continual process. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Sarah James : So in the past, you've kind of framed up where you are with the labor shortage in terms of bed closures. And in the past, I think you've talked about making good progress being maybe like a quarter or a third of the way there, and with the goal of reopening all of the closed beds by the end of the year. Do you still feel like that's a realistic goal? And are you any further down the line towards reopening beds? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, I appreciate the question, Sarah. I think as I was saying to Chris, we absolutely have reopened a number of units where we had closed beds. We've uncapped census in a number of facilities where we had previously capped census. And I think again as I was addressing Chris, on a net basis, I think we have less closed beds or uncapped census today than we did six months ago or nine months ago. But to be fair, I think we still have some places where we are still suffering from a lack of clinicians, whether they'd be nurses or psychiatrists. And we continue to address those as we go forward, look, I'm a financial guy, who's very objective, and I just continue to point to the admission data as really the proof in the pudding here rather than any sort of labor metric that to me, the proof that we're making net progress is that our admissions are growing incrementally each quarter for the last three quarters. Sarah James : Okay. Then a clarification on the length of stay. It sounded like you're indicating that this is an industry-wide trend for the behavioral health sector. I just wanted to clarify that there were no policy changes that impact how you evaluate the necessary length of stay, that this was more a factor that you did not I guess, direct. Steve Filton : Yes. So just to be clear, I mean, I'm not sure that I was bold enough to suggest there was an industry-wide trend, simply to note that our peer in the behavioral industry who also reported publicly last night had a, what seemed like a similar decline in their U.S. length of stay. So I'm not sure that's the same as describing it as an industry trend, but no. In response to the second part of your question, as we did the analysis, it is not apparent to me, in any way that we are changing our policies. Length of stay, I think is largely a payer-driven issue. And sometimes when payers put additional pressure on us, it takes us a little bit, a little while to get our response in place, et cetera, or even realize that quite frankly, we're under pressure. So there may be some of that going off, but we haven't internally changed any of our policies. Sarah James : Okay. And last question here is on the joint ventures. For the ones that you're kind of stepping into like a Baylor or Providence, their large systems, how do you think about the time line to when you can start to have those conversations about expanding system wide? How close are we to that step? Steve Filton : Well, I think to some degree, we're already there. I mean, we have multiple arrangements with Baylor, and we have multiple arrangements with Providence. So I think that we've already demonstrated a level of expertise and competence that has given them confidence to do further deals with us, further joint ventures. There is no sort of prescribed time line in our arrangements or in our contracts. I think this is as you might expect with any sort of a vendor, the notion of gaining confidence from the company that you're serving, and hoping that in doing so, they'll allow you more opportunity and more responsibility. And again, I think we've demonstrated that in the case of both Baylor and Providence, and I think we'll, we hope to continue to do that with lots of other hospitals and hospital systems around the country. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: Maybe a couple of questions, if I could. You've obviously seen a nice strength in the absolute admissions on the site side, and especially, given the leap year day in the first quarter. I wonder, as you've drilled down, obviously, there's been some adverse publicity around the site business -- are you seeing any impact at all from that, that you can discern of maybe the facilities that have already been discussed? Are they seeing any different trends than the ones that haven't? Just and any, is there any update in discussions with the regulatory authorities that's worth highlighting? Steve Filton : So I think that, at your last question, A.J., there really is nothing substantive to report on a sort of a status update regarding the large government investigation. There's really nothing new there. As far as your other question about have we really seen an impact on the underlying business since then, I think the most recent negative publicity began in early December, I think we've said a number of times, we've said it on the year-end call, and I'll just reiterate it today, I think the answer to that is no. We really see no response from our referral sources of any measurable note. We've seen no response from our own clinicians and a change in their behavior. Honestly, the single biggest reaction, external reaction that we've gotten to that and to the media reporting has been from the investor community, not from clinicians themselves. I think clinicians have tended to discount that reporting as being largely anecdotal and not an accurate depiction of what it is really like to run a behavioral hospital in the U.S. So no, I mean the short answer to your question is no. And again, I'm just going to go back and say Q1 is the first full quarter we had since these articles started to appear, and our admission growth actually ticked up in the quarter. A.J. Rice: Right, right. Then maybe I could ask you about capital deployment. You guys just standout that your debt-to-EBITDA is approaching two, I guess, now the lowest by -- well range in the industry. You made an opportunistic buy of some shares in the fourth quarter, you slowed it down a bit in the first quarter. Is this approach on share repurchase really to try to look for the opportunistic situations like you had in the fourth quarter? Or you think we'll see a pickup in that? And maybe as an alternative deployment of capital for de novo projects or for acquisitions, what are you all seeing out there? Steve Filton : Look, I'd make the one comment, being that the first quarter is the most difficult sort of the mechanical quarter for us to be a repurchaser of shares. We literally have about a two week window during the quarter where we are not in a quiet period, and just the first couple of weeks of March, and sometimes it's a little bit awkward to manage through that. Look, I think we continue to believe that we're very bullish about the prospects of the company's future earnings potential in both divisions and as a consequence, I think that we view share repurchase as an attractive use of capital deployment. And I think we'll continue to be an active purchaser of our own shares throughout 2017, as I think we represented we would be as well as continue to investigate other potential acquisition and deployment opportunities because I think our capital structure is such that we have a lot of flexibility to do both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : I'm going to follow up on A.J.'s question for the second time this morning. I'd love to hear Alan, just your view, big picture on capital deployment. You've created, Alan, a lot of value for shareholders over time. And a big part of that in my mind, I've been covering the stock for pushing 20 years now, is how disciplined and thoughtful you've been on capital deployment, whether it was the original site facility buys, the PSY deal, and also, aggressively buying back your stock, even going as far as doing big ASRs and levering up to do them. So with 2 times leverage and a free cash flow, this 6%, 7%, probably the biggest question I get is how you deploy capital from here? So can you give us kind of your updated kind of state view of the world on capital deployment and M&A and share repurchase? I'd really love to hear it. Alan Miller : I think that I'll reiterate that we are opportunistic. We've been in a fortunate position that we've been consistent with earnings, and we certainly have a big bank line and all the capital that we would need in the foreseeable future. So whatever is opportunistic for us, we take advantage of. Steve talked about difficulty in buying our shares in the first quarter. We think our shares, and I think the Street usually thinks that they're good values just not undervalue, but we're always looking at deployment of our capital, where we think we can do well with it. We're very excited about the 2 new hospitals that we built in acute care. We're excited about our acquisition in the U.K. our latest acquisition. We've got to work our way through it, obviously. But we're excited about all of those. So depending on what appears to us opportunistically in good returns, that's what we follow. So just to reiterate, we can buy stock, we can buy a company or a small company. We can build a hospital or a number of hospitals. So we have all of those avenues open to us. Justin Lake : And Alan, can you just tell us what, do you see a robust M&A pipeline? I mean, the, obviously you've done some of those site deals that are certainly interesting, but you generate so much cash that the, I think people are somewhat surprised that you're paying down debt at these leverage levels rather than buying back more stock. I mean, are there mechanical ways to accelerate share repurchases whether it's an ASR or whatever, so that you don't run into these mechanical issues? And maybe that is just you're seeing a big M&A pipeline. So if you just follow up with that, that would be really helpful. Alan Miller : I think there are all of those. I think we would like to buy shares. There is an M&A pipeline. We're very excited about the Cambian Adult business that we bought. Cambian was offered, as you may know, for the last few years, a whole company, which we weren't interested in, so we opportunistically bought the business that is profitable. We're very excited about that. We're excited about opening the hospital in Henderson. We like our shares. I don't know what else to say other than we look at all of these things. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana Gupte : The first question I had was on acute, on bad debt, and I apologize if someone asked this. It did pick up, and you guys have all had a pretty solid 2016. So is this about exchange attrition or something else that's going on or just one-offs? Steve Filton : So I'm sure people who listen to our calls regularly feel like I sound like a broken record on this issue. I always make the point that we never look at bad debt expense in isolation, that we only look at uncompensated care in total, which is bad debt and charity care and uninsured discount. And we also look at it as a percentage of gross revenue because it is impacted by our gross pricing, uncompensated care, the nature of our accounting will always be that it will increase at a minimum by the amount that we increase our gross pricing. And when we look at our 2017 Q1 uncompensated care in total as a percentage of gross revenue, it is exactly flat with the first quarter of 2016. So while I can see that bad debt expense increased significantly, I think that the total amount of uncompensated care really has not changed in a measurable way between Q1 of '17 and Q1 of '16. Ana Gupte : Okay. So nothing, no trends outside of the accounting for it. Nothing that you're seeing that should change the uncompensated care on a go-forward basis for '17? Steve Filton : No. Look, I think we have acknowledged, probably since the middle of 2015 that, after a year and half, beginning in the beginning of '14 of uncompensated volumes declining fairly dramatically, that beginning in 2015, they started to creep back up for I think some of the reasons that you alluded to, Ana, which is that, first of all, I think that the benefit, the significant benefit from the Affordable Care Act leveled off. I think there was some disenrollment in the exchanges as premiums went up. I think some people got the care that they were looking for, and maybe disenrolled from the exchanges as a result of that. But I think that trend has been fairly steady. We don't see it necessarily accelerating. We believe we've incorporated it in the net revenue guidance that we give, so when we talk about acute care net revenue going up 6%, or anticipated going up 6% in 2017, that already presumes a slight and continued uptick in uncompensated care. But no, I don't think we're seeing any changes that we did not anticipate. Ana Gupte : Okay. Then moving on to behavioral. The slide say the length of stay declined, I think the question has been asked about that the revenue per patient day and the mix shifting to Medicaid, I'm assuming, is a piece of it. How much pressure are you seeing, if any, on commercial contracting in a downward? And should we think about that as it's going to be flat going forward? Steve Filton : So I think we have talked about pricing, sustainable pricing in the behavioral division to be in the kind of 1% to 2% range. So when we talk about hoping to exit the year at 5%, 5.5% volume growth in behavioral, which is sort of getting us back to where we were before the labor shortage began, we're really thinking of that being composed of 3% to 4% volume and 1% to 2% price. If you look at our pricing for the quarter, our revenue per patient day, per adjusted patient day is right in that 1.5% range, particularly if you adjust for the currency fluctuation. So I think from a pricing perspective, we've been where we think we're going to be and we were in the first quarter. So I think on the behavioral side, the outstanding variable remains volume. And what will be required for us to get from where we are today to where we hope to be at the end of the year is an increase in volume. Operator : [Operator Instructions] You have a follow-up from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice: I thought that maybe I just come back. Any comments that you guys would care to make on what's happening down, and watching with the ACA repeal and replace, where you see that? I know, Alan, you follow pretty closely. Second, I know you've gotten a way from talking about your exposure, but I think it's relatively modest you perceive to some of the changes that are being made, but any updated thoughts on -- of the acute and behavioral and what your exposure might be to some changes? And then I guess, the third aspect to this question is the administration. The new administration clearly is asking for people to give them insights on what regulatory changes they might like to see. And it has been instructed in healthcare, there just doesn't seem to be that much, that healthcare providers or payers are bringing forward, at least overtly. And I wondered if there was anything that would be on a wish list that you guys might put in front of the administration in terms of regulatory changes that would be helpful. Alan Miller : A.J., we got some information this morning, but I don't know what you could make of it. I don't think we're going to see anything in the short run. I mean, the House, the 2 sides of the Republicans in the House have been talking to each other. And this morning we saw a couple of changes, but they haven't come up with a consistent plan to be voted on, and then after that, it has to go to the Senate. So I don't think we're going to be looking at anything in the short term. I really don't. And I'm familiar with all the different changes that they've been talking about, but I don't think it makes sense to get all concerned about it. They're trying to, a lot of different things, they're trying to keep the insurers in line, and there's a lot of ways to do it, subsidy. We did go through this in great detail, but I don't think it's worthwhile. The bottom line is, I don't think we're going to see anything in the short term. I don't think they'll even get to a vote because they learned that it doesn't make sense to bring it up to a vote if you don't have the votes. I think Ryan is learning about how these guys, how it should work. What was your other question? Also, just give me a call, A.J. Steve Filton : So A.J., I mean, you asked about our exposure. I mean, and look, I think the point that we made when repeal and replace was being discussed, was that we really have said fairly consistently from the outset that our behavioral business has benefited very little from the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, to the degree that it is scaled back. We don't think the behavioral business would be impacted much. I got into a lot of questions a few weeks ago when the Republicans first floated this idea of getting rid of the essential health benefit, and I'd made the point that I don't think again that our behavioral business has benefited a great deal from the essential health benefit. I think that the real benefit to the behavioral business from a benefits perspective was when mental health parity passed, legislation passed several years ago. And that's really what I think has increased and made more robust behavioral coverage around the country. And I think as long as mental health parity remains in place, and to the best of my knowledge, there is no conversation in any corner of the legislative activity that suggested that is in any way, is being tinkered with. I think that we should be in pretty good shape there. Your last question, I think about the industry suggesting regulatory changes, first of all, I think we would largely do that through our industry organization. But I think the second part of that is maybe why our lobbying organization has been not quite so aggressive about that is because they're really fighting the, what I think the big battle is at the moment, which is ACA repeal. And I think that's occupying their attention. Alan Miller : Yes. The point that Steve made just bring us back to the point I was making earlier about all the changes. I mean, essential benefits, they've been arguing about it. So what they came up with was, it seems to me a very lenient way for all the states to get exceptions. So what do you have? Depends on what states, one which, have exceptions based on what? Of the essential benefits. So you really don't, we don't have anything to really comment on that I think that's worthwhile at the moment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe : I hopped on late, so apologies if this was already addressed. But can you give a sense of same-facility EBITDA? And maybe what that was down year-over-year kind of on a dollar basis? And if you can give the contribution of maybe non-same facility, that would be helpful. Steve Filton : So I think on the acute side, Ralph, same-facility EBITDA was down like 2%. And I would make the point that I think that was very much within our expectations. We were asked maybe even by you directly on the Q4 call whether it was possible that acute care EBITDA could be down in Q1, given how robust the numbers from Q1 of '16 were. And I think we said that not only was it possible, but I think we thought it was likely. So same-store EBITDA was I think down 2% in the acute. I think full non-same-store EBITDA was actually up 2%, and that's largely I think the Henderson impact that I discussed before. On the behavioral side, I think same-store EBITDA was down like 5% on the behavioral side. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then anything on the health plan business? Is that something you're still testing? Do you want to grow it? How's performance been? Just any thoughts there. Steve Filton : Yes. I think we have said fairly candidly that the health care business in its first couple of years has been a drag on our acute care results and margins, but that we thought 2017 was an important transition year in which we would really minimize that drag. And I think, at least in the first quarter, that was the case, I think we had a few million dollars of losses, but nothing that I think materially impacted the numbers. And we would certainly expect that trend to continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Whit Mayo : I might just sneak one in here. Just looking for an update on foundations, and then maybe how that is trending versus your expectations. And do you think about getting much larger in the addiction space going forward? Steve Filton : Yes. Whit, when we bought foundations, I think we acknowledged that it was sort of a transition period for the addiction treatment business largely moving from sort of an out-of-network model to an in-network model. And one of the attractions to us of the foundation itself was that it sort of had a blend of business, and therefore, we thought could and would make that transition more easily than another company that was really more exclusively reliant on the added network model. I think in the short period that we've owned them, they are going through that transition, and there's some temporary disruption. And we're working our way through that. I think we feel like over the long run, the demand, especially for addiction treatment services, is doing nothing but increase. And we still think it's a smart thing to have a significant presence in that business. And so we continue to focus on working our way through transition in the model by being able to take advantage of that demand as it grows. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Ann Hynes : I'm getting back to Washington since Trump is introducing his tax plan today, and based on our analysis, any change in the statutory rate is very good for Universal. With that potential change in capital allocation plans, any, maybe an increase of dividend or anything like that? Steve Filton : So Ann, I mean, I think we would concur with your 20,000-foot analysis, which is that likely, almost any reform and reduction in the corporate tax rate would benefit a company like ours, which is basically a statutory rate taxpayer. But I think we're still so far away from any relevant details or being able to really calculate what the impact would be. It would be sort of wildly premature for us to say that we're going to take this windfall and reinvest it in a particular way that I think we're a long way away from that. But we'd certainly concur with the notion that if the Trump administration is able to advance tax reform, and I mean, incorporate tax reform in a meaningful way, we should be a beneficiary on that. Ann Hynes : Okay, great. And on the de novo facilities, this seems to be a very successful strategy for you. Is there any other markets that you currently operate in that you see more de novo facilities? Steve Filton : Sure. I mean, in the, I think if you look at our history, one of our most significant strategies has been enhancing our existing franchises, and we've built new hospitals in any number of our existing markets. We've built 3 new hospitals in the Vegas market, and with the Henderson, that's actually the fourth new hospital that we've opened in the last 10 years or 12 years. We've opened the new hospital in Riverside County, California. And I'm not going to get into details because I think we have for certain competitive reasons, we like to keep our strategies sort of close to the vest. But we are certainly looking at other markets where expansion would make sense to us, where we have a strong franchise currently, and have desire to take advantage of a continuing growth in the market and strengthening our franchise in those markets. But yes, absolutely, that's a continued focus and likely a continuing strategy of ours. Operator : And there seem to be no further questions at this time. Steve Filton : Okay. Well, we'd like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to talking with everyone next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call.

Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Tanya and I will your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UHS Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Filton. Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors, and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.91 for the quarter after adjusting for the favorable impact from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09 as discussed in our press release, and the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the Supplemental Schedule included with last night's earnings release. Adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $188.1 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, during the second quarter of 2017, as compared to $191.1 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, during the second quarter of last year. On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2017 increased 5.1% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 6.0% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year. On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.2% during the second quarter of 2017, as compared to the second quarter of 2016. During this year's second quarter, as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year decreased 3.7% and \u2013 excuse me, increased 3.7% and adjusted patient days increased 1.4%. Revenue per adjusted admission decreased 1.4%, and revenue per adjusted day increased 0.9% during the second quarter of 2017, over the comparable prior-year quarter. Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first six months of 2017, we are revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $7.50 to $8 per diluted share, from the previously provided range of $7.70 to $8.20 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, decreases both the lower and upper end of the previously provided range by approximately 2.5%. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, our cash provided by operating activities decreased to $534 million from $836 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2016. The $302 million decrease was caused primarily by a $217 million unfavorable change in other working capital accounts, resulting primarily from changes in accrued compensation and accounts payable due to timing of disbursements, and a $92 million unfavorable change in cash flows from foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to our investments in the UK. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 51 days during the second quarter of 2017, as compared to 50 days during the second quarter of 2016. At June 30, 2017, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 46.1% as compared to 47.7% at December 31, 2016. We spent $118 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2017, and $262 million during the first six months of 2017. In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately 984,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $116 million, or approximately $118 per share. Since inception of the program through June 30, 2017, we have repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $641 million, or approximately $117 per share. Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, everybody. A couple of quick questions, if I could ask maybe. Just looking at the technical financials, on the non-same-store psych business, it looks like, I guess, that's mainly Cambian. It looks like you might have had pressure on that result. Was there anything else in there that you'd highlight, and how is Cambian doing right out of the box here? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: A.J., I think, as we'd discussed in the first quarter, and I would reiterate in the second quarter, that Cambian operations are performing pretty much as we expected. When we acquired Cambian late in 2016, we talked about an ongoing run rate of about $45 million of EBITDA, and I think we're on track with that, with the exception that in the first six months of ownership, we had a sort of transition services agreement with the previous owner where we were paying for some of their administrative services. And that depresses the EBITDA a little bit; I mean, not a great deal. But I think from an operating perspective, the facilities have been performing as we expected and the expectation is that they'll continue to do so. Now, we do have a negative currency adjustment and have had that just in terms of \u2013 that affects, frankly, more of our existing operations than the Cambian operations. I think what you are looking at in terms of the non-same-store behavioral results is about $13 million or $14 million of unfavorable adjustments in the quarter relating to a couple of items : a non-recurring one-time adjustment to disproportionate share monies in one particular state and some malpractice expense adjustments. Those are offset, to some degree, by $5 million or $6 million of favorable adjustments in the acute division. The net of $7 million or $8 million of unfavorable adjustments is something we didn't disclose on a consolidated basis because we didn't view it as material. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thanks. Then I guess, stepping back, if I look at the results, it looks like maybe a little bit of puts and takes in acute, but I would characterize that as largely in line with expectations, maybe a little bit ahead, and that to the extent there was any variance, it was mainly on the behavioral side. I'd love to hear you confirm that. And then drilling down, it seems like the behavioral variance is largely in length of stay, which I know we've talked about; a couple of payers in the Medicaid side that you've been trying to negotiate with, that have put pressure on length of stay. Have you been able to drill down and give more flavor as to what you're actually seeing with that length of stay and whether it can be corrected quickly, I guess? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, I will confirm your characterization, A.J., of the acute results for the second quarter as being in line. I think they were very much consistent with our expectations. In particular, we're pleased with the strength, particularly the volume strength on the acute side, but, again, the overall result is, I think, very much in line. On the behavioral side, again, I think your characterization is fair. The 2.2% revenue growth, even when you adjust that for the negative currency swing between years, I think that number becomes something like closer to 2.75% same-store revenue growth on the behavioral side, and that's still a little bit lower than where we expect it to be at this time of the year. We probably expect it to be closer to something like 3.5% and I think you've identified the variance as the length of stay, I mean, that admission growth number which I think now has grown for four consecutive quarters, is really well within, and, frankly, probably a little bit ahead of our expectations and I think is reflective of what we have been saying all along, that the underlying demand for our behavioral services across the portfolio remains strong, but the length of stay decline that we've experienced in Q1 and Q2 is not something we anticipated when we gave our original guidance. I think most of the commentary that I would make on that length of stay contraction is similar to what I said in Q1, and that is that I think it's a result of really two dynamics; one is that we are seeing more Medicaid patients who tend to have a lower length of stay than the rest of our payers. We believe that probably the impetus for that increase in Medicaid utilization is the benefit of the IMD exclusion being lifted, and \u2013 but I think one of the things that's happening in the short run is, there is some adverse payer mix selection, and that increase in Medicaid patients is crowding out some of the Medicare and commercial patients who, in many cases, are probably better-paying patients, and also those with higher length of stay. The other issue, I think, that we talked about, and I think you were sort of alluding to in your question is that within the Medicaid payer mix in that patient population, we're seeing some more aggressive behavior on the part of payers. I think our point of view is that over the course of the next few quarters, we will either, where it's clinically appropriate, be able to impact that length of stay and restore it to where it was, or I guess I should say, and/or the admission growth will continue and will offset that impact of the length of stay decline. And so in our minds, we will get to where we targeted, from the sort of 3.5% same-store revenue growth that we thought, and we're probably 75 basis points behind there, I think we feel like we will get to that 5% revenue growth that we thought we'd exit the year at. We'll get there, but it will probably be a quarter or two behind schedule. A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, Good morning. Thank you. Steve, can you provide an update on how the UK volumes on the behavioral side look compared to the U.S. volumes? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think, Jason, I don't have the exact data in front of me, but I think the UK volumes are growing. I mean, honestly, we are more capacity-limited in the UK than we are here in the U.S.; we run at occupancy rates in the UK that are probably in the low 90s as opposed to the high 70s that we operate here in the U.S., but I think, we're growing admissions in the UK by that similar, sort of, 3% to 4% number that we're reflecting on the U.S. side as well. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And on the acute care side, the soft revenue per adjusted admission growth, is that from the mix shift that we saw in the first quarter? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's really a mechanical issue that because we are reimbursed almost exclusively on the behavioral side on a per-day or per diem basis, the effect of a decline in length of stay is that revenue per admission declines, and that's what you're seeing. I think the way that we do our model is, we do it based on revenue per day rather than revenue per admission, and the revenue per day growth of roughly 1% in the quarter is very consistent with what our expectations were. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Actually, I was referring to the acute care side... Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I'm sorry. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: ...where I think you had lower growth in surgery volumes compared to medical volumes. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. No, I think on the acute side, that's exactly right. I mean, I think to some degree, Jason, the growth in our admissions on the acute side, the outsized growth which, I think, has been, and my expectation, will continue to be generally better than our peers' is a function, to some degree, of seeing more of those lower acuity admissions. I think some of those lower acuity admissions over the last few years had been converted to observation patients, and one of the things that I think we said over the course of the last few years is that at some point, the pendulum would begin to swing back, at least partially, the other way, and more of those observation patients would qualify for in-patient admission where they've met clinical criteria, et cetera, and I think you're seeing that happening. So, we're seeing a bit more of those lower acuity admissions, but obviously to a degree that's also driving the revenue per admission down. I think also as our peers have noted as well, we continue to see and have seen, I think, for the last couple of years, an incremental increase in uncompensated patients, a slight decline in commercial patients, particularly commercial exchange patients, and I think those trends continue, although I don't think they were particularly \u2013 there was anything particularly dramatic or new in the quarter. Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question here. So, just to follow up on the last point; in terms of the payer mix that you mentioned that you feel like you continue to see slight declines in commercial patients and increase in uncompensated or uninsured patients, so, should we expect these trends to continue, and so, I guess, if that's the case, should we expect the sort of flat pricing to continue for the rest of the year for the Acute Care business? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Joanna, I would answer the question by saying that the 5% revenue growth \u2013 same-store revenue growth that we experienced in the quarter was similar to our expectations; and we said at the beginning of the year that our expectations for acute care revenue growth were in the 5% to 6% range for the year, with the understanding that those numbers would get better as the year progressed because the comparisons get easier. I think when we gave that original guidance, our presumption was that revenue growth would be split pretty evenly between volume and price; and, I think we would sort of stick to the overall revenue assumption, and I think we'll likely trend that way. But if we continue to generate higher admissions, I think that revenue per admission will be lower. But I think we continue, as I think A.J.'s initial question indicated, our acute overall results are very much in line and our acute guidance remains very much in line with what it was originally, and that is something like 5% or 6% revenue growth. How we get there between admissions and volume may change, but I think we're comfortable with the overall revenue guidance. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That makes sense. But then staying on the acute, right, so you're talking about the 5% to 6% revenue growth, and I guess, the margin did not really improve that much as you would expect; and, I assume there is partial impact in there from the health fund business. So correct me if I'm wrong there. And then, is there anything else you would highlight? I guess the fact that you're talking about a lower acuity and increases in payer mix, but I guess that's reflected in the \u2013 not much of a margin improvement in that segment. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, I think that, as we've talked about probably over the course of the last few quarters, probably the single biggest impairment or, I guess, obstacle, I guess, is a better word, to growing those acute care margins has been the wage pressure and the labor pressure. I think on the acute side, we continue to run higher than what we would consider to be ideal levels of premium pay that is over-time and use of temporary nurses, in particular. I think our general sense over, again, the course of the year in our guidance was that those pressures would become more muted in the back-half of the year when the comparisons became easier, and that's still our expectation. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And on the labor front, any color in terms of the psych business in terms of how you are progressing in terms of the pressure there? Thank you. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, we first began to talk about the labor pressures and the labor constraints probably in the middle of 2015, actually, initially, I think, as a shortage of psychiatrists, and then later more as a shortage of nurses; and we really began to talk about it because we began to see our admissions more muted. As I said in response to, again, I think A.J.'s initial question, those behavioral admissions have been growing for the last four quarters, I believe; and in my mind, that's reflective of the progress that we're making on that labor front. So, as we fill more of those positions, our admissions go up. To be fair, we have not completely solved or resolved that problem and we still have pockets of either nurse or physician shortages, but clearly in my mind, the 3.7% admission growth that we posted in Q2 reflects the fact that we've made a significant amount of progress on that issue and expect to continue to make progress as the year goes on. Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is Austin (20:53) on for Sarah. So, we're looking a little closer into the behavioral health business and, I guess, we're just kind of wondering, how has the competitive dynamics of hiring behavioral health nurses changed over the past year? Unknown Speaker : Can you speak up a little, please? Unknown Speaker : Yeah. Sorry about that. How has the competitive dynamics of hiring behavioral health nurses changed over the past year and have competitors become more aggressive with their hiring process to either gather or retain their nurses? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Austin. So, I think we've been pretty clear about this. I mean, I think what happened beginning in around the middle of 2015 is that, as the economy continued to recover and, in particular, as unemployment rates went down, and especially in certain markets where the labor market seemed particularly tight and competitive, we saw that our competitor hospitals were hiring away nurses and physicians, and that wage rates were being elevated and became more competitive, et cetera. And I think one thing that became \u2013 I don't want to say it was a new phenomena, but it certainly seemed to accelerate and be at an elevated level was we really began to see acute care hospitals hiring away our behavioral nurses; not that we had never seen that before, but I think we were seeing it at a rate and a frequency and a scope that we had never really seen before and quite frankly, continue to see it. Now, we have responded by adjusting our own wage rates and by doing any number of other things to both attract, and I think, in particular, to retain nurses once we have them hired, but certainly we would characterize the market for both nurses and psychiatrists as more competitive today than certainly it was, I'd say, two or three years ago. Unknown Speaker : All right. Great. Thanks for the color. So, it looks like you guys did make some progress on that front with behavioral health adjusted admissions growing by 3.7% during the quarter, which is better than we anticipated. So, I mean, how do you see the ramp for the remainder of the year and into 2018 for behavioral health adjusted admissions? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, again, I think our original guidance for the year presumes that we would exit the year at about 5% revenue growth rate, which we sort of further broke down to the sort of 3% or 4% volume, and 1% to 2% price. As I suggested earlier, I think we're at a rate in Q2, of about 2.75%, if you adjust for the currency change; which is about 75 basis points from a revenue perspective behind where we thought we'd be in. That, I think, accounts largely for the miss in Q2, as well as for the guidance or the guide down in the quarter. But I think our expectation is that we will get to that 5% revenue growth, just maybe a quarter or two later than we expected, and it will either be as a result of, as I said, our being able to impact that length of stay decline where it's clinically appropriate, or from the admission growth, just continuing its upward trajectory, because honestly, that 3.7% admission growth or adjusted admission growth that we saw in Q2, as you suggest, not only is higher than what you expected, but it was higher than what we expected, and quite frankly, it's right at a level that we thought it would take us to the end of the year to get to this. So, we certainly have an expectation that it can continue to grow and that the underlying demand will support that growth. And so, we believe it'll continue to trend up at least for the foreseeable several quarters. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. The question \u2013 the first question I had was, while your \u2013 the provision for that flip-downs look relatively stable, the charity and uninsured discounts, as a percentage of revenue trended up quite meaningfully. Can you give us any color around what's going on there? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, Ana, for those who have listened to our calls for a long time, I'm sure I'll give an answer that sounds familiar although maybe frustrating to those who focus on this. We always say that we really, internally, focus entirely on sort of, the cash net revenue per admission or net revenue per day depending on which division we're looking at, as opposed to individual shifts between charity care and uninsured discount and bad debt expense, which we acknowledge, fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and which we struggle with explaining. I think on the acute side, as I already discussed in response to, I think, it was Jason's earlier question, revenue per admission was relatively flat in the quarter. I think that had more to do with mix of patients and lower acuity patients than it did with payer mix, although, I did acknowledge, as many of our peers have talked about over the last several quarters, that we continue to see an uptick in uncompensated patients and a downturn in commercial patients, particularly commercial exchange patients. Those phenomena, however, I think have been present for at least the last six maybe even eight quarters. Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : So, there isn't any acceleration in either attrition off of the marketplaces and/or from a macroeconomic perspective and oil-heavy economies that you're seeing more uninsured patients in any accelerated way? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Not, I think, in an accelerated way; I think we've seen that, again, those trends in place now for a while and quite frankly, I think they continue with each passing quarter. But no, I wouldn't characterize that trend as accelerating. Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Then on the behavioral side, back to the length of stay, you alluded to Medicaid and then to some degree, private payers; CMS has just come out with a, kind of, an initial suggestion around moving to a different, more value-based oriented behavioral reimbursement, and putting all of that together, do you see this as broader pressure that maybe hard, more challenging to avert even in the back-half of the year in 2018, or is this something that from better negotiations and it's more tactical and it can be brought back to historical? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, I think it's hard to say; I don't know that we have a perfect inside into how this length of stay trend is likely to develop. I think that there is sort of a natural tension between payers who would like to see patients discharged earlier and providers, and particularly the psychiatrists who are making that length of stay or that discharge decision, who feel like patients are sometimes being asked to be discharged by their payers sooner than medically appropriate or medically necessary. We'll continue to do everything that we believe the clinical record suggests as appropriate, to keep patients as long as our psychiatrists deem is appropriate, but, how those trends develop over time, I think, it's hard for us to say. I will make the point that the length of stay for acute psychiatric patients is already, on average, sort of in the high single-digits, so, changes to them \u2013 and I'm not a clinician, and I'm not going to get into sort of the clinical aspects of this, but changes to what is already, I think, we believe a relatively low length of stay, for patients who are quite ill in many cases, can be, I think, significant and we're going to continue to work with our payers to make sure that our patients stay for the appropriate length of time and get the appropriate amount of treatment. Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. Thanks, Steve, for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Actually just wanted to follow-up on the last point, Steve. When we think about the length of stay pressure, I guess I had always assumed it was more on the longer length of stay at a residential treatment side, but what are you saying it's sort of broad based and you're seeing it even on the acute side at this point? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, I think, Chris, and this may be what's informing your point of view is that back in the 2013-2014 period, when we also experienced a length of stay decline in the behavioral division, we did at that time, describe it as primarily focused on the residential business, our long-term patients, but I think over the last couple of quarters \u2013 and then that length of stay by the way stabilized, I think in 2015-2016. Over the first couple of quarters in 2017, the length of stay pressure that we've been experiencing has really been in the acute side of the business, the acute behavioral side of the business and not on the residential side. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I guess how much \u2013 you sort of alluded to this, you can get to the 5% target just if you get the admissions growth to a high enough level; but I mean, what is your level of confidence that you guys can sort of affect stabilization and the length of stay versus just the payers backing off a little bit? I think, I guess I'm just trying to figure out how much is in your control versus third parties. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look. I think that this is a push and pull sort of dynamic, the payers are always pressuring providers for, in our minds, the lowest possible length of stay and again, the ultimate decision, I think, comes down to a question of clinical appropriateness and certainly on our end, that's being made by a treating psychiatrist. We hope that on the payer end, it's also being made by someone with a clinical background who has the best interest of the patient at heart as well. It's difficult for me to predict. Obviously, we suggested, or I suggested at the end of Q1 that we would hope to be able potentially to impact length of stay in Q2 if it was clinically appropriate and that really didn't happen. So again, the only point that I'll make is, I think we believe we can get to our revenue guidance number; even if we don't get to it by the end of 2017, we can get to it early in 2018 through some combination of a continued increase in admissions and potentially a stabilizing length of stay number. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay and if I could just slip one more in; on the acute care side, could you give us a sense for what type of revenue growth you're expecting for the second half of the year? And I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, so again, our original guidance on the acute care side was 5% to 6% revenue growth for the year, and as I said earlier, kind of split pretty evenly between price and volumes. At least, that was our original assumption. The notion always was, that would be a sort of increasing trajectory as the year went on because the first half of the year comparisons from a revenue perspective were quite difficult, and the comparisons in the second half of the year were markedly easier. And again, I think that remains our projections. I think the acute care performance, as in an earlier question, suggests it was very much in line; and our guidance, and our guidance both from a revenue and an EBITDA perspective, remain the same for the back half of the year. Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Steve, just wanted to ask a quick clarification question. The 2.2% same-store revenue growth in the behavioral business is actually 2.8% after currency, correct? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Correct. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That would be the best same-store growth in a year, and you're expecting almost a point of improvement in each quarter in the second half to get you to kind of a 4% to 5% range, is that correct? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think something more in the 70 basis points or 80 basis points a quarter, Whit, you know, is probably... Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: But just over 4%? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That would be the best same-store growth in probably two years. And with that type of growth, you do believe that you can grow your margins year-over-year? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I think, Whit, if we get to that 4% growth, we should see \u2013 and the model suggests and the historic performance would suggest, we should have some margin expansion at those levels. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And maybe just an update on capital deployment, how you're ranking priorities and just maybe update us on your joint venture development opportunities; just wasn't sure if there's any developments worth discussing. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah; a couple of different questions, I guess. I mean, from a capital deployment issue, I don't know that there are any sort of imminent opportunities to deploy significant amounts of capital through M&A, but we continue to explore those opportunities all the time. We talked at the end of Q1 about ramping up our share repurchase activity in Q2, which I think the numbers suggest we did, in fact, do. And I think as we think about the model for the balance of the year, we think that our share repurchase will probably be at a minimum at those same kinds of levels as we saw in Q2. As far as the joint venture strategy on the behavioral side, those conversations continue to be quite active. I think we've already announced a number of those ventures, including some new hospitals that are being built in partnership with big acute care partners that will open sometime in 2018. I think when we get to the end of the year and we give our 2018 guidance, we'll be more specific about how we expect the joint venture strategy to specifically impact our earnings going forward; but, I will say that the conversations and the continued planning remain quite active on that front. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And maybe just one last one; wasn't sure if there's any update with the government and the DOJ as it relates to the investigation, just any developments worth sharing. Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: No, I think as we said \u2013 or I said in Q2, in public forums and conferences, et cetera, that it certainly seems to us that the level of engagement with the government, the frequency and the scope of our conversations and contacts have increased over the last few months. We are cautiously encouraged by that and believe that it suggests that we hope, I guess, that we're in the later innings of this process. I don't think we are far enough along to be able to, with any level of precision yet, predict a finite outcome or even the timing of such an outcome; but again, I think we remain cautiously optimistic that we're a lot closer to resolution on this process that has been ongoing for, now, close to five years, than we were \u2013 I don't think we necessarily had that same view even as recently as maybe, let's say, six months or nine months ago. Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. No, very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. First, let me follow up on Whit's question there on the OIG, Steve. I know this is obviously a sensitive topic; just curious, I mean, the \u2013 I guess it has been four years you've been receiving requests intermittently. Now, you're saying that the OIG discussions have increased. Can you tell us, have they kind of laid their cards on the table, so to speak, in terms of what their concerns are? And if so, is there anything there, if they have told you those concerns, that you think could have a material impact on your business or do you feel like you have reasonable counter-arguments for most of their concerns? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, I think we've suggested for some time, Justin, that we believe that the crux of the government's point of view was that patients were either inappropriately admitted or their length of stay was inappropriately longer than it needed to be, or their clinical treatment was inappropriate. We, I think, have said from the outset that we didn't necessarily share the government's point of view at all and have, I think, made a bigger argument to the government where we've been presented with some of their points of view, which I think has been in a fairly limited number of cases that we had a dramatically different point of view. But that's the nature of these investigations and, look, I think, there is some heavy lifting that remains to be done on both sides and, again, I just think that our point of view is, we hope that we're a lot closer to that, to both parties being willing to do that heavy lifting and get to a conclusion than we've been in a while. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. That's helpful and then Steve, the \u2013 my impression is that the \u2013 from a cadence perspective, the behavioral business, I think, you've been saying publicly in those same conferences that behavioral \u2013 this ramp in behavioral revenue looks like it was on track for most of the quarter. It sounds like it must have turned down in June relative to April and May; can you tell us what happened there specifically, and then given it did turn down so late in the quarter, if there's anything you could share with us in terms of how July is looking relative to June, that would be really helpful. Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, I think that we did make comments during the quarter that talked about sort of the strength in May, et cetera, which is sort of the implication being that June was weaker than we expected, and we did make those comments because at that point we were in our quiet period. I wouldn't read too much into it. It looks to me like July has bounced back some. I mean, I think if you step back, and again, I'm just going to return to sort of the cadence that I talked about, and I think Whit was sort of suggesting in his comments, the admission growth in particular has been on an upswing for the last four quarters and that translates to revenue growth being on that same upswing. And I think we believe that both of those trends are going to continue, albeit probably a little bit more slowly than our initial 2017 guidance implied. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to ask or drill down on that IMD issue, and I'm sorry if I missed this number, but approximately what percent of your acute short-stay admissions now are coming from IMD? We know they were zero a year ago. I'm just curious, what percent of the admissions they recommend and, I mean, excuse me, they represent, and also what the length of stay actual comparison is for Medicaid versus the rest of your book? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, it's difficult to say, John, in the sense that IMD patients, or patients who are coming in as a result of the IMD don't necessarily carry a Medicaid card that says IMD, et cetera. I think we take the point of view that we have seen our Medicaid utilization increase since the IMD exclusion was lifted, and we make sort of, a default kind of \u2013 or we reached a sort of a default kind of conclusion that the increase in Medicaid utilization is a result largely of the IMD exclusion being lifted, but it's difficult, with any precision, to sort of identify the precise number of patients who really are at our hospitals, are eligible to be admitted to our hospitals because of the IMD exclusion, and I apologize... John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: No. Maybe a different way of asking it would be, what's Medicaid mix then in short-stay business? What was is it a year ago? What is it now? How much did it go up? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So, I don't have those statistics right in front of me. I will tell you that I think our overall Medicaid utilization, which obviously includes traditional as well as managed Medicaid, is in mid-40s, et cetera, for our consolidated behavioral business. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And what was it a year ago? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I don't have that data, John. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And on the other part of the question, do you have at least just a directional sense \u2013 I mean, is it 7-day length of stay versus 10? I mean, is it something like a couple of days shorter, or do you have just a directional sense of what the difference is in length of stay? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Do you mean Medicaid compared to our other payers? John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Correct. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think the Medicaid length of stay on average in the acute side of the business is probably in that six-day to seven-day range, probably Medicare is in the seven-day to eight-day range, and I think commercial was probably in the low teens, kind of 12-13 days. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And just on another point; you guys continue to carry around a great balance sheet; your cousins yesterday at National (43:18) have stepped up their end-market purchases of acute care hospitals. Are you seeing \u2013 I know you guys are very patient and strategic, but are you seeing more opportunities there? Do you agree with that strategy? And also, on the kind of flipping over to the behavioral side, you know, are you seeing any addiction type assets that are interesting as well? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. Look John, we've always been interested in the in-market hospital acquisition opportunity. The challenge for that is, we're in a relatively limited number of markets and that means that there are a relatively limited number of hospitals that might be available to us. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: In the past year, as an example, however, we bought Desert View Hospital in the Greater Las Vegas market, that's in, to be fair, a smaller rural hospital, but one that we think rounded out our presence in that market. We obviously also built the Henderson Facility that Alan has mentioned on several of the calls and it has been doing quite well. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, we continue to look for those opportunities in all of our existing markets whether they're inorganic M&A or organic capital capacity expansion. On the behavioral side, yeah, I mean, there are \u2013 I think the addiction corner of the behavioral market seems to be the sort of, hot, sort of market. We entered that kind of new style addiction business a couple of years ago when we bought Foundations. Part of our thought process when we bought Foundations was that it would provide a platform for us to continue to expand that business and we wouldn't necessarily have to do it through M&A which, we view as relatively expensive. I think most of the addiction assets that have been for sale over the last couple of years seems to be pretty expensive. So, we're growing the addiction business where we think it's appropriate, mostly, I think through organic means. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I hopped on a little bit late, so, Steve, not sure if you gave the payer mix that's in the quarter. If you haven't, it would be helpful to know sort of what it was on a year-over-year basis as well. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. Ralph, I mean, I think we've talked about sort of the payer mix trends in the two divisions; on the acute side, continuing \u2013 which are all continuing a decline in commercial utilization, an increase in uncompensated, on the psych side, an increase in Medicaid, but I've really not gone into more specifics on that. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And as you look to 2018, can you maybe just talk about the pricing backdrop, your expectation for your sort of, pure managed care rates, Medicaid rates, Medicare rates? And then some of the acuity mix pressure that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, do you think that's kind of a comping-in thing as you don't see those pressures in the next year, you think there's more pressures as you think about sort of the acuity side of the equation from a pricing perspective next year? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I mean, I think that the pricing assumption that we made for our 2017 guidance, which is blended pricing on the behavioral side of 1% to 2% and blended pricing on the acute side of maybe 2.5% to 3%, is probably what \u2013 I mean, again, I'm not about to start to give 2018 guidance at this point, but as I sit here in mid-2017, it strikes me that that outlook at the moment, and things certainly can change between now and the end of the year, but that outlook seems reasonable for next year as well. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. But could you just put that into context? The last couple of quarters obviously is \u2013 particularly on the acute care side, you had negative and sort of flat pricing all-in. So, is there a way to sort of context as we think about next year? From pure rate perspective, it sounds like maybe 2%-2.5%, but do you think there's going to be sort of pressures on either acuity and/or payer mix that's sustained? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, so in response to a previous question, I think it was Joanna from Bank of America, what I said was, I think we were comfortable on the acute side with the assumption of a 5% or 6% same-store revenue growth rate in the acute business; and while we expect over time that that will be split pretty evenly between price and volume, it is conceivable that in the short run, like you saw in the second quarter, it may be skewed more towards admissions if we're getting those lower acuity admissions, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we were comfortable with the overall revenue growth of 5% to 6%. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: We do not; other than to thank everybody for their time, and we look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. Thank you.  Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Thank you, Sarah. Good morning. We are expecting Alan Miller to join us by telephone and hopefully we\u2019ll make that happen before we begin the Q&A. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors, and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.47 for the quarter. After adjusting for the favorable impact from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, as discussed in our press release, and the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications in our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $143.4 million or $1.49 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2017, as compared to $157.2 million or $1.60 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.  As mentioned in our press release, our financial results for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2017 were unfavorably impacted by an after-tax aggregate of approximately $14 million to $15 million or 14 - resulting from the following, an unfavorable after-tax impact of approximately $8 million to $9 million or $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share, related to the hurricane expenses and estimated business interruption impact incurred by 28 of our behavioral health facilities located in Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, and our three acute care hospitals located in Florida, and an after tax charge of approximately $5 million or $0.05 per diluted share recorded in connection with a court order in Texas related to certain litigation. Generally, our facilities impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, did not sustain extensive property damage, and the vast majority have resume normal operations. However, a portion of the beds at our 124 bed behavioral health facility located in Houston, Texas, remain closed. And although our three behavioral health facilities located in Puerto Rico are operational, these facilities which have 240 beds in the aggregate, continue to operate on auxiliary power in areas that have suffered extensive damage to surrounding infrastructure and properties. It\u2019s difficult to predict the impact that the hurricanes may have on the future operating results of these four facilities. On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2017 increased 2.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.5% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 1.8% during the third quarter of 2017, as compared to the third quarter of 2016. During this year's third quarter, as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.1%, while adjusted patient days decreased slightly. Revenue per adjusted admission increased 1.3% and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.6% during the third quarter of 2017, over the comparable prior year quarter.  Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine months of 2017, we are revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.25 to $7.50 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $7.50 to $8 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the effect of electronic health records impact for the year, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, decreases the lower end of the previously provided range by approximately 3.3%, and decreases the upper end of the previously provided range by approximately 6.3%.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our cash provided by operating activities decreased to $878 million from $1.4 billion generated during the comparable nine month period of 2016. The $258 million decrease was caused primarily by a $128 million unfavorable change in cash flows from foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to our investments in the UK, and a $101 million unfavorable change in the other working capital accounts, resulting primarily from changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of disbursements.  Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 53 days during the third quarter of 2017 as compared to 50 days during the third quarter of 2016.  At September 30, 2017, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 45.4%, as compared to 47.4% at December 31, 2016. We spent $156 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2017 and $419 million during the first nine months of 2017. During the quarter, we completed and opened 27 new acute care beds and 135 new behavioral health beds at existing facilities.  In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the third quarter of 2017, we have repurchased 870,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $94 million. Since inception of the program, through September 30, 2017, we have repurchased approximately 6.34 million shares at an aggregate cost of $736 million.  Earlier this month, the Competition and Markets Authority provided the final ruling regarding the phase two investigation of our acquisition of Cambian Group PLC\u2019s Adult Services Division in the UK. The final ruling requires us to divest one 18 bed facility which generates less than $1 million of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The final ruling represents a reduction in the number of divestment sites identified in the phase one decision.  We\u2019d be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from Justin Lake. Mr. Lake, your line is open. Justin Lake : So Steve, first question is, your guidance appears to imply a pretty steep ramp in the core EBITDA of the company in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And I'm assuming there's about $15 million of drag still in the business from the two psych facilities and the continued hurricane impact to Puerto Rico. So if I look at that, can you tell us, how do you bridge down from 3Q to 4Q? Is t - do you expect a big ramp in the behavioral business? Is the acute going to get better? Help us understand that sequential improvement. Steve Filton : Sure, Justin. So I think that the way we approach the guidance for the balance of the year was to suggest that the miss that we had in the third quarter and the issues that generally caused that miss, which were I think largely transitory, would however continue into Q4. So to the degree that there was a continuing impact from the hurricane on the four facilities that I mentioned in my opening remarks, that would persist into the fourth quarter, to the extent that we continue to suffer lower than expected results at a handful of behavioral facilities with regulatory challenges. Those challenges will continue into the fourth quarter as well. In terms of the ramp in the fourth quarter, I think that we - that was embedded in our original guidance for the year, in our original notions of the trajectory of earnings for the year. And that was the sense that the back half of the year would continue to get stronger, both from a behavioral volume perspective, as well as from a relief on the labor pressures and wage pressures on both sides of the business. So I think it's a combination of those sort of two dynamics that really inform the way that we came up with the guidance for the balance of the year. Justin Lake : So just to follow up, you're expecting a meaningful ramp from 3Q to 4Q, both in volumes and in some release on wage pressure similar to what you expected before, despite the fact that it didn\u2019t look like it happened in Q3? Steve Filton : I think that's correct. And I think the other issue which I should have mentioned is the sort of continued improvement at the Henderson facility, our new facility in Las Vegas which, at least from a cosmetic standpoint, will be included in the Q4 - excuse, me in Q4 in same store results, which will make the same store results look stronger. And the other point that I mentioned, Justin which I think is just an annually recurring point is there is I think normally a step up from Q3 to Q4 due to just the seasonality of the business. Justin Lake : Great. Thanks for all the color, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Raskin. Mr. Raskin, your line is open. Joshua Raskin : Good morning Steve. Maybe just not germane specifically to the quarter, but I'm just curious where you stand as you guys are coming in towards the end of the year with line extension. Maybe on the acute care side, is there any change in appetite around ASCs or maybe free standing EDs or even urgent care centers? And on the behavioral, is there any more focus on substance abuse or maybe other types of clinics in that segment? Steve Filton : Sure. So I think on the acute care side, and I think honestly, Josh the answer to these questions, while I think there are some sort of global generic answers I can give, I think that in many cases or most cases, we really do look at these questions on a market by market issue. On the acute side, we certainly acknowledge, as have most of our peers, that there is a continuing trend I think driven mostly by payers to move patients into what they perceive to be the lowest cost setting of care for patients, whether that\u2019s ASC or freestanding imaging centers or urgent care centers or freestanding EDs, et cetera. We have certainly entered any and all of those businesses to some degree in certain markets. We have ASCs in a number of markets. We are building APDs in several markets and have had I think some relatively notable success in the early stages of that. We\u2019ve got freestanding imaging centers, et cetera. We've got physician operated urgent care centers again. And I think we really view it on a market by market basis, but certainly it's informed by, as I said, this global view that payers will continue to look to shift patients to the lowest cost care setting that they can.  I think on the behavioral side, it\u2019s a similar sort of notion. I mean we have a very large behavioral health presence with the largest freestanding operator in the country. And I think our continuum of care, both here in the US and in the UK, really spans the continuum of services and includes acute services, residential services, specialty services, addiction treatment services, et cetera. And I think in every market, we continue to look for where there are gaps in service lines in that particular market. So I don't know that on a global basis we're necessarily sort of looking to expand in any of those businesses, but within individual markets, we're certainly doing our best to fill in those service gaps so that in most of our larger markets, we're providing a pretty I think extensive continuum of services. Joshua Raskin : Okay, great. And then just a second question on the acute care side. It feels like it's becoming a little bit of a buyer's market. There seems to be a lot more facilities for sale than necessarily buyers out there. So I'm curious. You guys have always been so opportunistic. It seems as though UHS has had a really good sort of timing historically around movement of assets. Is the acute care segment more attractive? Are there new markets that you're actually looking at, at this point? Steve Filton : Josh, I think we have been looking at potential acute care opportunities for some time. We like the acute care business and feel like if you can be in an attractive, growing market with a good market position, you can be successful. We believe that certainly we've demonstrated that with our own acute care results. Obviously, I think this has become, as you describe it, kind of a seller's market, to some degree because we've got a number of distressed operators who are looking to deleverage, et cetera.  I think our general impression is that the assets that they are selling, at least in these early phases of their divestiture plans, are the less attractive assets. And unless they really provide sort of some in-market synergies for somebody, they're not necessarily all that attractive. And I think most of these sales have been going to other in-market providers. Should that change and should either of these distressed sellers or other sellers, other not-for-profit sellers, begin to sell assets that we think fit, are a better fit for our profile of strong market positions in growing markets, we certainly would be interested because we feel like we've got a proven track record of being able to operate in our own outstanding returns in those kinds of markets. And in the interim, we continue to invest in the acute care business within our own markets, building new facilities and adding capacity where that's appropriate as well. Joshua Raskin : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Fishbeck. Mr. Fishbeck, your line is open. Kevin Fishbeck : Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could parse out the EBITDA impact from the hurricanes among the two divisions, either - I guess both maybe on an EBITDA basis, but then also maybe from a volume basis. Steve Filton : Sure, Kevin. So I think on the volume revenue side, we feel like the hurricane impact, coincidentally I don\u2019t think these events, is about the same on both sides of the business and it's probably in that 100 to 110 basis points of volume and revenue, because obviously there's no sort of pricing dynamic associated with the hurricane impact. In terms of EBITDA, we talked about a $12 million to $13 million - sorry, EBITDA impact, I think you're talking about probably eight or so on the behavioral side and four to five on the acute site. Kevin Fishbeck : Okay. And I guess one of the things that is still interesting to me, I guess in response to my earlier question, is that you're still looking at the same kind of rebound and reacceleration in the business. I guess one of the metrics that you wouldn\u2019t expect the hurricanes to impact would be length of stay on the behavioral side. So I just want to make sure that that's right because that seemed to still be a pressure because now the third quarter in a row where that's a pressure. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and why you think that that's not going to be continue to be a pressure on site? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean so I think that in Q3 we did actually see the length of stay decline, diminish from the rate at which it was declining in Q2. So I think sequentially we made some progress. I think our point of view that we articulated last quarter was we certainly feel like there are some things that we may be able to do to impact length of stay where that's clinically appropriate. But then if we couldn\u2019t, that we had a point of view that the underlying demand was strong enough and the reservoir of unmet demand of patients looking to be admitted to behavioral hospitals, was strong enough that we just needed to improve the efficiency of our throughput, so that if beds were being vacated earlier because of length of stay pressure, we just needed to increase the throughput and fill those beds sooner, again always where clinically appropriate. And I think that's our point of view and why I think we had the perspective that this 5% same store revenue growth target that we've essentially set for the behavioral division, because that's what we were running back in 2000 when we started to see some diminution in that number, is achievable. It\u2019s really the confidence that allows us to say that is this the metrics that we continue to see internally that demonstrate a there's a significant reservoir of unmet demand. Kevin Fishbeck : Okay. And then just to follow up on another comment you made before about that the labor pressure is going to improve. I guess what gives you - is there any data points that you're seeing right now that actually indicate that? Because again in general, we're hearing companies talk more about labor pressure rather than less about it, but you seem to be thinking that this is something that's going to get better over the next few quarters. So any color or comment you give us that that's taking place? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean so I think, and it may be - look, I think these trends tend to be relatively market specific. And while I think more companies are talking about it today, I think we were probably one of the earliest companies to really highlight this issue back in the middle of 2015. And honestly it may be a function of being in markets that are faster growing than the national average and that recovered at least at a disproportionately more aggressive pace than the national metrics would suggest, places like Vegas and Southern California and South Florida, et cetera. So I think we have a point of view that's informed by our previous experience with labor shortages that two things happened during labor shortages. One, on a macro basis the market tends to adjust for the labor shortages. More nurses enroll in nursing school, part time nurses take on more hours, retired nurses come back and work extra shifts because wage rates are going up and there's an attractive sort of economic equation for them. So I think we see that happening at a macro level in our markets. But the other issue I think is that because we've been facing this issue now for I think almost two years, and we've been focused on it and we've been addressing it, I think we\u2019re finding that we're making internal improvements in our own markets, both at the rate that we're recruiting mostly nurses but other clinicians as well, and also the impact they were having on the retention of those that we recruit by implementing aggressive mentoring programs and career development programs and providing incentives for our employees, again most notably nurses who come to work for us to really want to stay in our organization and build their careers with us. Kevin Fishbeck : Okay. Then my last question to follow up on that last point. The company specific side of it because I think for the last year or two, you kind of talk mostly about how things normally work out over time, and there hasn't been as many clear cut things. Do you have any more specifics around either how many nurses you're bringing on or what your turnover rate has been as you've made progress on retention? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean so I guess a couple of things. I mean I think again on the acute side of the business, I think that the way that the labor shortage was manifested primarily was through margin pressures, that even though our revenues and volumes were quite robust and have been quite robust for the last few years, I think our acute care margins haven't always been where we would have expected them to be, given those revenue growth rates. And I think it's because of those wage pressures. I think that the acute margins have been improving and that's the ultimate. I can give you other statistics about the things you asked about, retention and recruitment rates, et cetera. But in my mind, the proof is in the pudding and it's the margin improvement over time that's really demonstrating our improvement there.  On the behavioral side, I think the labor shortage manifested itself in weaker volumes. And for the most part, I think volumes have been, particularly admissions have been increasing for the last year or so. Now Q3 was a bit of a hiccup, but I think that was impacted by a bunch of different things, including the hurricanes, et cetera. But I think generally, we feel like we've continued on this trajectory for the last four or five quarters of improving our volumes on the behavioral side. And again in my mind, that's the proof in the pudding that we're improving that labor situation and filling the vacancies. Kevin Fishbeck : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And Mr. Filton, just to let you know that Mr. Miller has joined. Steve Filton : Thank you. Operator : You\u2019re welcome. And your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe. Mr. Giacobbe, your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Good morning. I just want to start on the acute care side, Steve. Even if we add back the hurricane impact, it looks like trends slowed a little bit from the mid and even high single digit revenue you\u2019ve been posting. I think you mentioned some other things to kind of consider. Can you sort of call anything out? And then along those lines, just the acute care pricing, down 0.6, a little bit worse than what we've seen of late from you. Maybe just walk through the dynamics there just around pure price versus payer mix versus acuity mix in terms of where there is disproportionate pressures. Steve Filton : Sure. So I think there's a least several questions embedded in what you've asked. So I'll try to cover them all. I mean one is, in terms of the overall acute care revenue growth, I will just remind everyone that the comparison that we're facing in the third quarter to last year's third quarter, is quite robust. We had 9% revenue growth in last year's third quarter, really an extraordinary number. So it was always going to be a tough comparison, I think on the revenue side. And as a consequence, I think where we landed in Q3 was not far off from where we thought. Obviously, I think you need to adjust the 2.2% revenue growth on the acute side for the hurricanes by 100 basis points or 110 basis points. You\u2019re in the sort of low threes there. I think the only other thing worth noting, and I sort of alluded to it before in response to, I think somebody else\u2019s question was that a little bit of it is sort of the pace at which capacity comes on the acute side. So we opened our Spring Valley tower in Las Vegas last year in the second quarter of 2017. So that anniversaried or that impact was anniversaried in the third - the second quarter of 2017. We opened in \u201916. We anniversaried in \u201917. Just as an example, I think Spring Valley\u2019s revenues for the first six months of the year grew by like 15%. In Q3 they were sort of flattish. Now, that trend will I think kind of reverse itself in Q4 when, as I mentioned, I think to Justin before, Henderson will come into our same store numbers. And I think that will make the same store numbers look a lot better. If you want to sort of normalize all that, you can just look at our total numbers and not the same store numbers. But I think we continue to make pressure. In terms of the specific pricing question that you asked, we talked about this a little bit on the Q2 call. I think one of the dynamics that we're seeing that is cosmetically affecting our metrics is that out West in particular in Nevada, in California, we're doing I think a better job of qualifying those short stay patients as in patients rather than observation patients. And the result of that is a higher level of admissions, but a lower level of revenue per admission. Now, I think we have a point of view that over time, our acute care revenue should grow by roughly 5%, 5.5% and it should be split pretty evenly between price and volume. But in the current climate, as I think we're making those changes on the observation status, it's skewed more towards admissions than it is, or more towards volume than it is to revenue. But I think the ultimate dynamic is the same and ultimately will settle in at that roughly 5%, 5.5% growth rate that will be split pretty evenly between price and volume. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then you mentioned working capital drag in the UK and DSOs were up a little bit. Can you maybe just flesh that out for us? And as you think about next year, any thoughts or expectations around operating cash flow and CapEx at this point? Thanks. Steve Filton : So we have hedged our balance sheet investment in the UK from the initial investment several years ago. And generally the way that has worked is as the currency translation rate has declined, we had a cash flow benefit and as it has strengthened a little bit in the recent quarter, the settlement of those foreign currency exchange contracts have a negative impact. So that's what you're seeing in the cash flow statement. In terms of the DSOs, I think that's largely a mechanical issue we have in the UK when we bought the Cambian assets. They had a practice of billing the NHS in advance. And because we converted them to our system and our practice is to bill in arrears, we made that change to be consistent. That created sort of a short term working capital crunch in the UK, but not something that is, in my mind, a significant issue going forward. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. And then just the cash flow and CapEx at this point, any thoughts around that for next year? Steve Filton : I mean we'll give specifics when we give our guidance at the end of the year. But I mean I think our cash flows generally should grow at the rate at which our EBITDA grows. I don't see any sort of significant cash flow pluses or minuses going into next year in CapEx. Also I think ought to continue in roughly the same rate that we're running in 2017. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Borsch. Mr. Borsch, your line is open. Matthew Borsch : Maybe I can just pick up on the UK topic and just ask you what you're seeing in the UK market, if you\u2019ve seen any pressures on volumes. And get you had alluded last quarter to that occupancy is actually your challenge there. And wonder if you just update us on that as well. Steve Filton : Sure. I mean I know that the topic of the UK was particularly intense yesterday given the release of one of our peers. I think it's worth noting, I think everybody knows this, but I'll just remind everybody, that our geographic footprint and presence in the UK is dramatically smaller than our peer who was addressing the issue yesterday. Having said that, I think we have said that our UK facility is operating at fairly high occupancy rates. They continue to do so. Other than specific facility issues, I don't think we have seen any particular pressures or issues with volumes in the UK, nor on the labor side. I mean we acknowledge that the labor market is a tight one in the UK, much as it is here in the US. But labor issues tend to be market specific, just I think as they are here in the US. And we really haven't been experiencing those sorts of accelerating issues in the last few quarters. I will note and I made the comments about the final CMA report in my opening comments, that we're now prepared and are actively integrating the two companies now that we\u2019ll be beyond the CMA process. Cambian has always had a history of having great success in the temporary nursing area and the use of registry. They use very little of it. We think they have some real best practices that we'd like to migrate to our legacy Cygnet facilities in the UK. So now that we are going to be able to integrate the two companies, we're looking forward to hopefully even making further improvements in that regard, and if anything, reducing the amount of temporary nurses and registry that we use in the UK, following along the historic success that Cambian has had. Matthew Borsch : And Steve, if I could just on a different topic, as you're looking at the - all the headlines on the ACA exchange enrolment and in light of Anthem\u2019s announcement yesterday of pretty broad, not complete but pretty broad exit from exchanges, how are you thinking about that directionally in terms of impact on your plan for 2018? And is there anything that you can do as it relates to participation in different payer networks that that might make any difference there? Steve Filton : Yes. Look, it's difficult for us, Matt to be terribly proactive in this regard, in the sense that we really don't know in our individual markets what the level of enrollment is in the exchanges or disenrollment, et cetera. So it's a little hard for us to react in advance. Generally we have the view that in virtually all of our markets, there remain viable commercial exchange choices for those who want to enroll. And so that is helpful. I think in terms of network participation, again with very rare exceptions, we are network providers in virtually every network in every one of our markets. So I think we're already well positioned. If there is movement amongst products or amongst companies to be able to benefit from that. so I think at one level, we're just going to have to wait and see from a macro basis what level of disenrollment there is in the exchanges come next year. But I mean in terms of being in all the networks, I don't think we could really do that any more extensively than we currently do. Matthew Borsch : All right, sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Frank Morgan. Mr. Morgan, your line is open. Frank Morgan : Thank you. Steve, I was hoping you could give us some detail on the bed expansion schedule over there, what will be coming on in the fourth quarter and what you're assuming for next year. And then secondly, in terms of any other drags on the business end, on the behavioral side of the business, I know there were some issues at a couple of facilities, but any assumption about that continued drag as it relates to guidance for the fourth quarter? And then finally, any details on this court order payment? I was going back looking through the filings and I didn't know which one it relates to. But any color there would be great. Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure. So I think I'll do it in reverse order. The court ordered issue is old litigation in one of our south Texas facilities literally that goes back 15 or 16 years. A court order came through in the last few months requiring us to make the payment that we disclosed in the quarterly release. We\u2019re appealing that payment and hope to either have it reversed or substantially reduced. But because it was so old and didn't seem terribly relevant to our current operations, we recorded that item in the other segment, not in either of the two operating segments.  As far as, I think you were alluding to the behavioral drags, specifically I think I mentioned this again in answer maybe to Justin's original question on the call. I mean we definitely saw a drag in two or three facilities on the behavioral side that are experiencing regulatory challenges. I think they've been relatively well publicized in Oklahoma and in Massachusetts. As we try and work out our issues with the regulators in those states, rectify what they believe are the corrections we have to make et cetera, it's a bit of a double whammy because in the current environment, in the current quarter and quite frankly into next quarter, we expect we'll have a lower than sort of ordinary referral stream and lower than expected volumes. But we're generally keeping our expense structure in place in the hopes that we're going to rectify this relatively soon and will be able to get back to relatively normal operations.  So I think what I was saying in response to Justin earlier was that we assume that the drag from those facilities that we experienced in quarter three, would be fairly similar in Q4, but that as we entered into 2018, we would either rectify the revenue side of this and essentially get back to where we were. Or we would have to right size the facilities and adjust our expenses to a lower, a more permanent sort of revenue reduction. So we'll deal with that, but at least in Q4, the assumption was as we continue to work with the regulators in the States in those markets, it will be the same magnitude of result. Alan Miller : And then I think your bed expansion question, which was your first question, we will - it's not always the most ratable sort of thing, but I think we've been adding beds at a pace of about six or 800 beds a year on the behavioral side. That\u2019s certainly been our target, and I think that has not changed for us, and we would expect something along those lines in 2018 as well. Frank Morgan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ana Gupte. Miss Gupte, your line is open. Anagha Gupte : Good morning. Steve, wanted to follow up on the behavioral side. So as you point out, it's encouraging that your length of stay pressure hasn\u2019t gotten worse sequentially. I wasn't sure when we met with all of you in September. Given that, and I think your commentary about volume being largely impacted by it sounds like transient issues on hurricane, maybe more seasonality or whatever, what is the timing do you think now of you getting back to that normal revenue growth rate? You had given us an update in the second quarter it being in mid-2018. Steve Filton : Yes. I don't think that's really changed, Ana. I mean again, I think from the original guidance back at the beginning of the year, the original guidance sort of was premised on the idea that we could get to that sort of 5% targeted same store revenue growth rate in behavioral by the end of 2017. And I think we really changed that view at the end of the second quarter to say now this was now more of a first half 2018 issue, either Q1 or Q2. Again, I think given some of the challenges in Q3, I guess I would conservatively say it's probably now more a Q2 of \u201818 issue. But I think it's all really from our perspective, just elongating the timeframe on an incremental basis rather than changing any sort of fundamental view we have about what the real underlying metrics of the business are. Anagha Gupte : And on the length of stay, can you tell us and any more color on why it's stabilizing now? It sounds like from all your comments, this is coming mainly from mix shifting to managed Medicaid and managed Medicaid payers putting in a lot of pressure. Has this been kind of a one-time thing because of the IMD exclusion and it then subsides and you kind - your comps get easier so next year you\u2019ll have a flattish number? Is that a fair assessment? Steve Filton : Generally, yes. I mean I think there is - we're talking about a relatively short length of stay for these Medicaid patients to begin with. So I think there is quite frankly almost by definition, a limited amount of downside in terms of how much the length of stay can be reduced without really impacting the clinical outcomes and the quality of care for these patients. That\u2019s number one. Number two is I think, because we're now focused on this issue, I think we're just doing a better job of really documenting the clinical needs of these patients and the need, where appropriate, for them to stay longer where that\u2019s clinically appropriate, et cetera. So I think it's a combination of kind of a natural floor on this issue, as well as our just doing a better job representing the interests of our patients and our clinicians. Anagha Gupte : And as far as - so given that you\u2019re seeing it's a natural floor, do you think you would still need to invoke mental health parity or any other kind of legal routes to pressure them, not necessarily in court? Or is this pretty much something that\u2019s behind you at this point? Steve Filton : No. I think and I think we've said this before, I mean I think we have sort of a menu of options available to us that just range from day to day interactions with the payers and providing them proper documentation, et cetera and extend all the way up as you suggest, to ultimately having to take a payer to court. And obviously that's the last sort of resort that we would try and avoid. But again, I think that we're going to pursue what we think is best for our patients and what our clinicians advise us is best for our patients to whatever degree we have to. And again, I think we would hope that in most cases, that can be mutually agreed upon with the payer, but if we need to be more aggressive, we'll do that as well. Anagha Gupte : And a final question. Can you give us an update on the regulatory settlement that you\u2019re seeking with the federal and state agencies, and the magnitude of that and timing? Steve Filton : Yes. That\u2019s a slow moving process. It has always been a slow moving process. I mean I think we have expressed a more positive view I guess on our part in the last quarter or two, that the government seems more engaged and more interested in bringing this investigation to conclusion than they have been for a while. But to be, I think realistic about it, I think we're still well into the middle of next year at the earliest before we could realistically bring this to conclusion. We feel like we're working as - on as focused basis and as aggressively as we can on our end to provide the government everything they have asked for and to keep moving this along. And we hope that they\u2019ll respond in a sort of similarly interested way, and have every reason to believe at this point and hope that they will. Anagha Gupte : Great. Thanks so much, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Gary Taylor. Mr. Taylor, your line is open. Gary Taylor : You've answered almost everything I had. Just last one. On the four Puerto Rico behavioral facilities, do you have annual revenue and EBITDA contribution from those combined facilities? Steve Filton : Yes. Sure. So just to clarify, Gary, I mean I think that it's three facilities in Puerto Rico and one in Houston that has beds closed. But the fundamental question I think, probably on a combined basis, those facilities have annual EBITDA of maybe $10 million or $12 million. So it doesn't seem all that material. But I just want to make the point that in the short run, because I think of a dynamic that I described before where effectively we\u2019ve reduced substantially the amount of revenue we have. We may have increased the expense, but we certainly have reduced the expense. As we sort of wait for the markets to get back to normal and we try and do right by our employees, the drag that those facilities I think could provide over the next quarter, is I think far greater than their actual EBITDA. So I think we have the sense that it could be another $5 million or $6 million drag in the quarter because we've got reduced revenue and not reduced expense. So they're not all that large facilities, but that's why in the short run I think they have an outsized or potentially an outsized impact. Gary Taylor : So you could actually run a loss near term? Steve Filton : Correct. That's exactly the issue. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Whit Mayo. Mr. Mayo, your line is open. Whit Mayo : Back to the two behavioral hospitals that you referenced that were a drag in the quarter from regulatory issues, did you actually give the dollar amount that it impacted the quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. so - well, I'm not sure that I did, Whit, but I think that number is probably in the 7, 8, $9 million range at the two or three facilities that I think are facing sort of current regulatory challenges. That was the drag in the quarter. Whit Mayo : Got it. And just - sorry, I had a couple of numbers written down here that may be a little inconsistent, but the hurricane drag on a EBITDA basis, that was how much for the behavioral business in the quarter? Steve Filton : Somewhere in that $8 million range. Whit Mayo : Okay. So looks like adjusting for those two items, EBITDA would have increased 1.5% or so year over year. So a little bit better trajectory I guess on the underlying business. Is that how you would characterize it? Steve Filton : I think that's fair. Whit Mayo : Yes. And then on - in terms of same store revenue or just admissions volumes, patient days, how did the hurricanes impact the topline for the behavioral segment? Steve Filton : So I think we said that we believe that the impact was about 100, 110 basis points on both volumes and revenue. Whit Mayo : Okay. So that would get you to, close to 3% same store revenue. Looks like maybe the highest year over year increase in five or six quarters. So just want to make sure we're looking at this correctly. Maybe my next question just on capital deployment. You bought back some stock. You continue to pay down debt. Leverage is in the low twos at this point. And I know the message has sort of been, doesn't make a whole lot of sense to pay down a lot of debt here and we're going to get more aggressive on buybacks, but it doesn't seem like you're getting terribly more aggressive. So just anything to read into this? Just curious on any updated thoughts as you think about the balance sheet and leverage going forward. Thanks. Steve Filton : And I think all the comments that you made which were meant to articulate I think our position remain the same. We do - we are more than comfortable with our current leverage levels. We don't want them to be any lower. We\u2019ll continue to be I think an active acquirer of our shares at these levels. We do try and balance that and manage that against any other external opportunities that may arise. There are not always easy to forecast or predict in a precise way. So there is a bit of a struggle to manage that, but I think otherwise everything else you said about leverage and about the attractiveness of repurchasing our own shares remains true. Whit Mayo : Okay. Maybe one last one and I\u2019ll get back in the queue is, I know you're not giving guidance for 2018 at this point. I mean presumably you're in the midst of the planning process. And I just didn't know if you\u2019re looking at Street numbers and you see any discrete headwinds or tailwinds that you\u2019d like to call out at this point. Just I don't know, maybe just a frame of how you're thinking about the businesses generically next year, just to give us a little bit of help in framing up where we should be for 2018. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So we certainly are not giving guidance today and will not give 2018 guidance until most likely the end of February, which is our normal practice. But I think I have mentioned already previously in this call, as well as at other times. Our general sense of the trajectory of the two businesses, we kind of believe that the behavioral business will sort of get back to what we would sort of describe as kind of a normalized 5% same store revenue growth rate sometime in the middle of 2018. We think that the acutes, which have been running pretty consistently, at least at the 5% to 6% range, will continue to do so into \u201918. So you can sort of I think presume the EBITDA growth that goes along with that. In terms of some of the pushes and pulls that go along with that, some of the special reimbursement items are still difficult to project. We\u2019ll certainly be able to give more precise guidance on that sort of - on those sort of issues as we get closer and as we give our formal guidance. But again, I think we've talked about how we see the fundamental trajectory of the two businesses is pretty candidly and frankly, pretty consistently for a while now. Whit Mayo : Yes. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from John Ransom. Mr. Ransom, your line is open. John Ransom : Good morning. Most of my questions were asked, but just a more philosophical question. Hospitals have been moving into the outpatient business for a decade plus. It\u2019s not new. But I just see more rhetoric and I think more awareness from consumers that just because it's outpatient, if it's owned by the hospital, there's a premium that's paid, versus say a physician owned surgery center. A, do you think that's a legitimate criticism? And B, is that something that the industry can address by becoming a bit more sensitive to the elasticity of demand? Because it looks to me like there are emerging - with the freestanding urgent care clinics, with physician and surgery centers, that there are lower cost options out there than what hospitals can do, even though they call it outpatient. Is that something you guys think about at all and is that a legitimate issue to be focused on? Steve Filton : John, I think it's a legitimate issue. I'm not sure, and certainly a lot has been written about consumerism and the consumers making these choices. I think from our perspective, this still largely remains of payer driven issue. And to your point, I mean at the end of the day, payers have a clear line of sight, I think most of the time about where the most efficient and cheapest care is being provided. And we have to be competitive as hospitals to compete with the niche providers who are providing that same care. So I think this is more of an issue with - between the providers and the payers than necessarily between the providers and directly with the consumers.  I also believe that as the reimbursement landscape continues to evolve and we move to more bundle payments or ACO payments or even ultimately the capitated payments, the leverage will swing back to the providers, to the hospitals and the physicians who will control more of that healthcare dollar. And when they control the healthcare dollar, I think they'll be able to steer that business back to where they're providing it as opposed to where these niche providers are providing it. So again, this is a slowly evolving and slowly developing dynamic, but I think that's the direction we'll continue to move in. John Ransom : So is it also fair to say that it may be relative to expectations in the early days of the ACA. Have the new age payment structures with managed care, they've been slower to evolve for than you might have expected. And if so, if that's true, then why do you think that is, other than it's just really complicated and payers are bureaucratic and slow to move? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think the first part is absolutely true. And again, as I've said in answer to a number of questions already today, look, healthcare I think is very much a local market business and a lot of these trends move at different paces in different markets. We tend to be kind of smaller, probably not a great description, but less developed, less mature I'll call them, managed care market. So I think some of the trends don't develop as quickly in our markets as they do maybe in some others. But yes. I mean look, we've cited for instance the development of narrow networks as something that we generally look forward to and felt like we would benefit from. And we've seen some of that and we've helped engineer some of that in our markets. But it's been slower than we expected.  And look, I think your point, John about it being complicated is not something that should be overlooked or taken too lightly. I think one of the reasons why payers are slow to move on these things, and why quite frankly, providers are slow to move is because it is complicated and you do need a lot of analysis and information to make sure that everybody can continue to sort of be viable and prosper when you change the reimbursement landscape in a terribly significant way. So I think it'll continue to evolve, but it will be at a measured pace. John Ransom : Yes. And just one more on this topic. As you know, of course CMS took a step back on CJR and it's voluntary versus mandatory. How was - is UHS - do you have a uniform approach to this where you might do it in some markets and not in others? Or is it more of a market by market decision? And just kind of where are you on the post-acute bundling of particular hips and knees? Steve Filton : Yes. So, and I think we may have talked about this publicly before, but UHS was actually I think a pretty aggressive early adopter of the bundled payment initiatives and volunteered in many of our markets, if not most of our markets, for the initiatives. I think we felt like we were well positioned, particularly in partnership with our physicians to benefit. And I think for a lot of the reasons that CMS has stepped back in terms of timeliness of information and the sort of fulsomeness of the information available to allow providers to manage through these issues. We, I think we became a little bit disillusioned and sort of disenrolled from a lot of these programs. But I think we've spent a lot of time and focused being prepared for these. And when I think the payers, both the government and the private payers are ready to move forward with them, I think we feel like we\u2019ll be well positioned and prepared to move forward with them. John Ransom : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Sarah James. Miss. James, your line is open. Sarah James : I wanted to go back to the comment on resolving the nurse shortage on the behavioral side of the business. So in the past, you\u2019ve talked about bed closures because of the nursing shortage. Can you just remind us what percent of beds were closed or kind of the headwind experienced on admissions from those bed closures? And then the resolution that's coming in 4Q, should we think about that as being all the beds reopening, which I think was the goal you had stated in the past? Or is it a step towards that, but not quite reaching a full reopening of the beds? Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure, Sarah. So I mean I think what we said when this - we first started discussing this problem, which as I mentioned earlier was probably a good two years ago, we. were careful to note that this was really a market specific issue, that there were a half a dozen markets that were particularly difficult for us, maybe 20 some odd facilities. The reason that we don't necessarily sort of give these closed beds numbers or percentages of beds that are closed, et cetera is because I think those who follow the industry like to think of this as sort of a static issue, that there's kind of a number of closed beds at the outset and then you just continue to work that number down. I mean the reality, as you might imagine is, it's a fluid sort of issue and a facility that had a problem is able to solve its problem, but then another facility comes into it.  What I said I think in response to an earlier question is, ultimately the way we've measured our progress, particularly on the behavioral side of this, is the continued growth in admissions over the last year or so. The labor shortage was a problem that manifested itself on the behavioral side ultimately and originally through a pretty dramatic decline in admission growth. And I think in our minds, the way that we're able to convince ourselves that we're ultimately solving that problem is through the recovery of admission growth and the rebound in admission growth. And even though as somebody asked before, we certainly track a lot of other metrics like vacancies and turnover and number of nurses in training and orientation. Ultimately the proof in the pudding is, are we able to open these beds and are we able to increase admissions? And we feel like for the most part, we've been able to do that, albeit in an incremental way. The progress has been slow, but we've been able to do it pretty slowly and steadily for the last year or so. Sarah James : And will you reach the full benefit of the additional admissions in the fourth quarter or should we still think of this as a work in progress? Steve Filton : Yes. so I think, again what we've said is, for a variety of reasons, I think it will take us to the first half of 2018 to get back to the 5% targeted behavioral growth. One of the issues that continues - we\u2019ll continue to work on will be the labor shortage. So I don't think that will be - and by the way, I don't think even when we get to the 5% growth, that it'll absolutely mean that we've solved, if you will, the labor shortage. It will just mean that we've kind of returned to at least sort of a status quo that we were at back in the middle of \u201815 when the problem really began to accelerate. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks? Steve Filton : I do not, other than to thank everybody for their time, and we look forward to speaking with them at the end of the year. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Angela, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Year-End Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. And we both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $7.81 for the year and $2.31 for the quarter. After adjusting each period for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the favorable impact from January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, all is disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $189.6 million or $2 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $176 million or $1.80 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2016. On a same-facility basis, in our acute care division, net revenues increased 6.5% during the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to a 7.3% increase in adjusted admissions. On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 1.6% during the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.5%, while adjusted patient days decreased 0.7% during the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.9% during the fourth quarter of 2017 over the comparable prior year quarter. Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.183 billion during 2017 as compared to $1.334 billion during 2016. Contributing to the $151 million decrease was an unfavorable change of $144 million in cash flows from foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to our investments in the UK. Our accounts receivable days outstanding remained unchanged at 52 days during each of the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016. At December 31, 2017, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 44.7% as compared to 47.7% at December 31, 2016. We spent $139 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $558 million during the full year of 2017. In 2017, we completed and opened 471 new behavioral health beds, including de novo facilities. During 2018, we expect to spend approximately $600 million to $625 million on capital expenditures, which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities. Also, in January of 2018, we acquired the Gulfport Behavioral Health System, a 109-bed behavioral health care facility located in Gulfport, Mississippi. In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced in 2014, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $101 million or $100 per share. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2017, we have repurchased approximately 7.35 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $836 million or $114 per share. Our estimated range of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 is $1.758 billion to $1.837 billion, representing an increase of approximately 3% to 7% over the $1.709 billion of EBITDA generated during 2017. In addition, our 2018 guidance range includes an estimated favorable impact on our provision for income taxes and net income attributable to UHS of approximately $142 million to $152 million resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as discussed in last night's press release. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2018 is $9.25 to $9.90 per diluted share. This guidance range also includes the favorable impact of approximately $1.52 per diluted share to $1.63 per diluted share resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This adjusted EPS guidance range represents an increase of approximately 23% to 31% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $7.53 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 as calculated on the supplemental schedule included in last night's press release. During 2017, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $10.92 billion to $11.06 billion, representing an increase of approximately 5% to 6% over our 2017 net revenues. Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : Your first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Steve, on the behavioral side, can you give us some color in terms of, ex the hurricanes and ex some of the regulatory challenges you're facing at a handful of facilities, what was your view of same-store revenue growth and behavioral EBITDA year-over-year? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Justin. So, we discussed in our third quarter conference call two non-recurring items in the third quarter. One \u2013 and you've referenced both of them, one was the impact of the hurricane or various hurricanes in the third quarter. We estimated that to be about $7 million or $8 million in the third quarter and suggest that that impact would continue into the fourth quarter, largely in our Puerto Rico facilities and, to a lesser degree, in a couple of Houston facilities. And, in fact, we had another sort of $7 million or $8 million drag in Q4. Similarly, we discussed, as you referenced, three, what we described as regulatory-challenged facilities in Q3 that amounted to a drag of $9 million or $10 million in the third quarter, and said that it would also persist into Q4. It did. We also said that, by the end of the year, we would resolve those issues. We have resolved those three facilities in the sense that in Boston and in Dallas, we have decided to close the facilities in question partly because we have a broad network of hospitals in those two markets where we think we can treat most of the patients that were being treated at those two hospitals. And then, in Oklahoma, where we have lost a significant Medicaid contract or state contract, we regained that contract as of January 1. So, we're back on a more favorable trajectory in our Oklahoma facility. Having said all that, I think when you make the adjustments for those items in Q4, we believe that same-store behavioral health revenue was about \u2013 grew by about 3.5% over last year's fourth quarter and EBITDA was generally fairly flat, maybe just down very slightly. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then, it looks like mix was the key driver of why we didn't see the hope for behavioral same-store revenue improvement on an adjusted basis. Can you give us some color on what you saw there? And then you're two months into the first quarter, any updates you can give us on both volume and mix on the behavioral side and how you see things trending through the first two months of Q1? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think as the metrics suggest, our admission growth, our behavioral admission growth in Q4 was generally within our expectations. Length of stay, which has been a pressure point at various times during 2017, did pressure our overall volume growth and therefore, our overall revenue growth in the quarter. And I think, Justin, as your question suggests, we believe that most of that pressure was a result of payer mix issues. And when I say that, I really mean just an increase in Medicaid patients and a decline mostly in Medicare patients. And our Medicaid patients generally have a lower length of stay. So, to the degree, we have more Medicaid and less Medicare patients, our overall length of stay will naturally decline somewhat, and I think we saw that in Q4. Our expectation is that the underlying demand for our behavioral beds and our behavioral services remains rather strong. We're going to continue to market and focus on all of those who are demanding our services, but especially for Medicare and commercial patients for whom we may have seen some slight decline in business. And that will help restore both the length of stay and the revenue trajectory so that we can get back to this 5% same-store revenue growth target that we have talked about for some time and that we \u2013 our guidance assumes that we'll achieve that sometime in the middle of 2018. Operator : Your next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. I apologize if I missed this, but your revenue rebound in the acute care space, clearly, some of those is hurricane related, but the part of it that was not hurricane-related, where was that geographically? Can you talk about that a little bit? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, I mean, again, Peter, when I think you say some of the rebound, I assume you're talking sequentially from the third quarter. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes, correct. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think when you compare to the fourth quarter of last year, we are getting several benefits in our acute care revenues and EBITDA. One is, and we talked about this a number of times during 2017, a fairly significant turnaround in our health plan operations. That's really more of an EBITDA issue. But in the fourth quarter, there's probably a $15 million, $16 million turnaround in our health plan results in Q4, largely as a result of a very soft fourth quarter last year. There's also, as much has been written about and talked about, a very significant flu impact in Q4. And while I think we always find it difficult to sort of absolutely precisely define what the benefit is, I think we believe it probably helped our admissions and our revenues by 150, 200 basis points in the quarter, and probably contributed an incremental $9 million or $10 million of EBITDA in the quarter. And then finally, I think as at least one of our peers, Tenet, has discussed at some length, we did have sort of a catch-up California provider tax revenue in the fourth quarter of $6 million or $7 million. So, that's probably $30 million to $33 million of, to some degree, non-recurring EBITDA. Now, again, I think even if you adjust the fourth quarter results, the fourth quarter acute care results for those non-recurring items, it was still a very, very strong quarter. But it's helpful to sort of keep that in mind as you think about what the ongoing earnings power of the segment is. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. And then just one more, if you don't mind. The additional funding for the opioid crisis, some of that's going to be headed towards behavioral health treatment. Have you thought about how you're positioned to capture some of that and what could you capture of that today and what do you think it'll mean for the company over the next year or two? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think it's worth noting, Peter, that we have a well-established addiction treatment business that would include the treatment of patients who are suffering from opioid addiction. Today, I think we would estimate that somewhere around 10% of our behavioral revenues are addiction treatment related. Again, difficult to make it a terribly precise number because so many patients who have addiction illness also have other diagnoses, and these dual diagnosis patients as they're referred to are often \u2013 or they're not always characterized as addiction patients. But with 10% of our revenues currently coming from addiction treatment and a comparable number of our beds dedicated to that service, we are, I think, in a good position to respond to the needs of every one of the communities that we service. To the degree that there are more funds available from the government, in particular, a lot of, I think, those funds are being directed towards outpatient treatment, and we've already opened some new outpatient services to specifically respond to that. There are new medically-assisted treatments for opioid addiction that we've begun to pilot and experiment with those as well. So, to your question, I think we are well aware of obviously the focus on the opioid crisis and on the additional monies that may flow from the government. I think we're in the very early stage of this, so it's a little hard to know exactly what those monies are going to be for, exactly how they're going to be allocated. But we're certainly very much on top of it and prepared to respond to the needs as they arise. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. So, one topic that's been coming up increasingly is a focus on capital allocation for higher acuity on the acute side and that becoming a competitive environment. Can you talk about how you see UHS positioned? What your plans are for driving acuity mix and how you see revenue per adjusted admission on acute trending going forward? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Sarah. So, I think that \u2013 and this is not terribly new, but I think for some time now, some of the lower acuity procedures that had historically been done in the hospital setting have been moving out and into different and more ambulatory settings and the business that remains in hospitals tends to be skewed towards the higher acuity patients. In that regard, I think for several years now, much of our capital spending on our acute care segment has \u2013 particularly within our hospitals has been dedicated to that \u2013 those higher acuity services. We've expanded a lot of our emergency rooms where many of these patients are entering the system. We've expanded our operating room capacity and technology and things like cardiac cath labs, et cetera. At the same time, I think we've made an effort to make sure that we're also participating in this trend of moving lower acuity patients to sort of more ambulatory, lower cost settings. And so we've invested over the last several years in freestanding emergency rooms in a number of our communities, in ambulatory surgery settings, outpatient imaging settings, et cetera. We always view health care as a very local business. In every community and every market, it's a little bit different and the needs are different and our responses are different. But effectively, I think we've been trying to target our capital spend to meet sort of those two trends of higher acuity patients remaining in the hospital and lower acuity patients being shifted to more ambulatory settings. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: So putting that all into perspective, how would you see the revenue per adjusted admission trending over the intermediate term compared to where they have been historically? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, we have talked about, we're feeling that in our acute care segment, a 5% to 6% same-store revenue growth rate is a reasonable target. Furthermore, I think we've identified an expectation that that revenue growth rate would be split pretty evenly between price and volume. So you're talking about 2.5% or 3% revenue per unit growth in \u2013 on the acute side. And obviously embedded in that number is some of this acuity again, what I prefaced my remarks to you saying, I don't think that this trend towards higher acuity patients in the acute business is necessarily new. So I think it's embedded in the numbers that we're projecting in our guidance for next year. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, everybody. Just a couple of questions as well. First of all, on the outlook for 2018, you just said, I guess, a 5% to 6% same-store revenue growth in acute. Maybe can you give us a flavor for what's embedded in terms of EBITDA growth on a same-store basis in both sides and maybe in the behavioral segment for the year? And is there any other puts or takes that we should remember as we think about laying out unusual items? I know the hurricane, hopefully they won't recur at the same level in the back half of the year, but any other things to highlight? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, A.J. So, I think when we talk about the projections for next year, they are kind of same-store recurring projections as you repeated. On the acute side, I think we're talking 5% to 6% revenue growth, which in our minds translates to 6% or 7% EBITDA growth. On the behavioral side, as I alluded to in my earlier comments, our expectation is that by the middle of 2018, we ought to be able to get to this 5% revenue growth and 6% or 7% EBITDA growth, but that's a ramp up as the year goes on. So, embedded in our guidance is a more blended 3% to 4% revenue growth for the year, maybe 2% to 3% EBITDA growth. There are \u2013 we do get the benefit, I think, of some non-recurring items. We talked a lot about them already in answer to the questions about the fourth quarter and in the third quarter. And I think if you go back to the second quarter, we had some additional malpractice expense, and we had some Massachusetts dish (21:38) unfavorable adjustments. I think you can presume that all those items don't reoccur and that's probably in total another $25 million, $30 million of non-recurring items, non-recurring unfavorable items in 2017 that don't reoccur in 2018. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Unfavorable to EBITDA line? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. And again, I will say that sort of offsetting that, and you can see this in the 10-K that we filed last night, is a $30 million reduction in provider taxes year-over-year. So part of the reason I haven't highlighted the sort of non-recurring items, I think they largely cancel out and the same-store results for the most part is what you see flow through. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then maybe conceptually, you guys have the lowest leverage in the sector, strongest balance sheet, I guess, and you also, as you said in your prepared remarks, you're picking up $150 million of additional cash flow from tax reform. Any thoughts of where we go from here in terms of capital allocation? I know you love to do deals, but it seems like they've been coming pretty slow. You've been active on the buyback, you certainly could be a lot more active if you wanted to, dividends even, some companies you're talking about are accelerating capital projects, what's \u2013 give us some flavor for what you're thinking? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, we're extremely pleased that we have as much flexibility as we do with our balance sheet as you have suggested. And obviously the benefit from the tax cuts just enhances that position. UHS has a reputation for being very judicious in terms of how we deploy our capital, both from an M&A and a CapEx perspective. I think we'll continue to do so. On the other hand, as we've already talked about a little bit in this call, we're very focused on spending dollars and enhancing our market franchises so that they really can compete across the continuum, whether it's in behavioral or in acute care. We'll continue to do that. As we move into next year, we'll continue to explore all the alternatives, and where it makes sense, we'll continue to be an active acquirer of shares and returner of capital to our shareholders because we think that often that's a compelling deployment of capital for us as well. But we're not going to sort of set targets at the beginning of the year or make any firm commitments because it's something that I think we continue to evaluate all the time based on the opportunities that are presented to us. And I think as you kind of alluded to in your question, the most variable of all those metrics are the M&A opportunities. At any point in time, we're looking at generally a series of M&A opportunities, some of which seem attractive, some of which seem compelling, and we often pursue them. And to your point, not a ton has wound up being actionable or executable in the last several years, but that doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to spend times on those that seem worthwhile and have in our minds a reasonable chance of actionability. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: A.J.? A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes. Hi, Alan. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Hi. Steve has covered the waterfront. I don't want to skip the part that we like our stock, and we think it's a good value. And we have been buying consistently, and we're always looking at it. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. That's great. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig into length of stay a little bit. It sounds like you're saying that length of stay is under pressure in part because of payer mix shifts, but I want to understand why you're seeing those payer mix shifts. Is it because fundamentally the Medicaid business is just seeing more demand growth because of things like IMD et cetera or do you think you're somehow losing market share in commercial and Medicare, just some status on that. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, actually I think in some respects, Kevin, you answered your own question. I think that we are seeing more Medicaid patients because the IMD exclusion has been lifted and because in any number of our facilities we can now be reimbursed for adult Medicaid patients for whom we were unable to be reimbursed for many, many years. So, that I think has contributed to the surge in Medicaid patients to a degree. I think that there is a lot of competition for some of these other payer classes like Medicare and commercial, both with other freestanding facilities and also with acute care hospitals who operate behavioral units. One of the things that we have focused a great deal on is the idea that a number or many Medicare behavioral patients also have certain physical or medical surgical ailments, and payers sometimes and patients and families presume that they can be better treated in an acute care setting. We've focused very much on an ability to treat those kinds of patients, or at least a subset of those kinds of patients, in our behavioral freestanding facilities as well. So, we're very focused on treating those elderly behavioral patients who also may be medically compromised. I think that there's been increased competition for those patients. So, I think it's a function, again, as you suggested in your question, of both just an increased flow of Medicaid patients because of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, and an increased competition for some of those other patients, particularly Medicare patients, amongst all providers. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : In the past, you talked about getting to that 5%, 5.5% range, and then when length of stay started to pressure, you kind of said, well, we can still probably get there. We just need to accelerate admissions more. And we really haven't seen admissions really accelerate, obviously, to close the gap. That would be necessary to get to that 5% to 5.5%. So it sounds like you're saying that at least in the short term, there's some pressure from competition. I mean, how do you think about that ramp to 5%, 5.5%? And if length of stay continues to be flat or down a little bit, where is the biggest opportunity to kind of see that acceleration from here in admissions? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, I mean \u2013 and I'm not sure that I wouldn't characterize the trend a little differently than you, Kevin. I think we saw our admissions decline fairly precipitously back in right around the middle of 2015. We largely attributed that decline to labor shortage and a shortage of clinicians, mostly nurses, but to a lesser degree, psychiatrists in some markets. We spent a good year or so addressing that issue and I think began to really make progress on filling many of those vacancies in the middle of 2016. And I think if you go back, you'll see that actually admission growth from about the middle of 2016 to the middle of 2017 really did increase pretty ratably and steadily, which I think, now, I think, is where your question is more valid. It stalled a little bit in the last couple of quarters because of this length of stay pressure. I think what keeps us or why we remain confident is that when we look at the number of patients that are being presented to our facilities, who sometimes we're unable to treat, either because we don't have all of the clinicians we need, or we don't have all the beds we need, or because they're medically compromised, as I was recently just alluding to, I think we think the demand is there, and that's why we continue to talk about being able to get to that 5% number. Now, again, I'll be the first to acknowledge that this has been kind of a greater slog and has taken more time than we originally anticipated. But I think we believe firmly that the underlying demand remains strong and is sufficient to get us back to that 5% growth. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, this is still a labor issue in your view. If you had enough staff, you'll be seeing a lot more volume than you're seeing right now. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think it's a combination of issues. I think it is a payer mix issue, as I suggested. It is still in a few handful of places. It's a labor issue. It is in some places a physical bed and physical capacity issue. And finally, in some cases, it's a sort of the ability to treat certainly medically compromised patients. So, I wouldn't say it's a single factor. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, Steve. First question is just, it's been a while since we saw one of the behavioral health acquisitions and we see Gulfport now. And I'm just curious was, are you seeing a change in pipeline? I know you mentioned already that the M&A is the least certain of the capital deployment areas. But have you seen any change in trends there? Is the pipeline a little bit more robust or less robust at this point? I'm just curious on the behavioral side. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, obviously, we \u2013 again, I think sometimes you have to take a step back when people say that the acquisition pipeline and activity is really slow. And I mean, we did the Cambian acquisition in the UK just a little over a year ago. That was a fairly significant acquisition. In the U.S., we've talked about the fact that we've been very focused on these integration or joint ventures with acute care hospitals and integrating with them and penetrating their behavioral businesses. We have in our 2018 plan and embedded in our guidance is an opening here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, of 126-bed hospital that we're building in partnership with a not-for-profit hospital. That'll open at the end of the second quarter. We have a hospital in Spokane opening at the end of the third quarter, a 100-bed hospital in partnership with the Providence system out in the Greater Seattle market. And then, the Gulfport deal that I mentioned in my remarks is a similar sort of deal. I mean, that's an acute care hospital that we began talking to. And in that case, they simply decided to sell us their behavioral unit. So, we have a great many of those conversations continuing to occur. And we think that's a fairly lucrative aspect or avenue of growth for the behavioral business although one that we concede sort of, again, progresses rather slowly as these not-for-profit hospitals are fairly deliberate in their decision making. But, I think, the three projects that I outlined are good examples of how this is sort of coming to fruition and will continue to come to fruition for a number of years to come at this point. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Got you. And that's part of the targeted bed openings that you guys have talked about, right? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Correct. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. Got you. And then just lastly, on your share buybacks, is there a magnitude in guidance for 2018? Did you put any in there? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I think in our guidance, we presume that roughly half of our free cash flow will be dedicated to share repurchase and the other half to sort of undesignated M&A opportunities. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. All right. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just ask about the Henderson facility that came into the kind of the same-facility base in the quarter. If you could just sort of break that out and let us know how much that contributed, that'd be helpful? And as part of that question, I'm hoping to sort of understand how long that tailwind might last? So what does the ramp period typically look like for a new hospital in your minds and if you have an estimate for sort of the productivity of that facility today relative to kind of a mature state, and how long you think it would take to get there, that kind of thing, that would be helpful for us. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Steve. So I would say that a typical acute care hospital opening, new opening, probably takes close to 24 months to ramp to call it maturity. I know Alan, in particular, has talked about how over the last few quarters Henderson has ramped beyond our original expectations. I think that's fairly typical of the new hospitals that we've opened in the Las Vegas market over the last 10 years. It's just such a vibrant market and such a strong franchise from our perspective that those hospitals tend to ramp. So Q4 of 2017 was the fifth quarter of Henderson's short life. And they're ramping pretty close to, I would say, maturity which in this case, I think, is measured in comparison to how our other hospitals in the market operate. We don't disclose the profitability of individual hospitals, but I will say that Henderson continued to grow in the fourth quarter. It was probably \u2013 contributed another $6 million or $7 million to our acute care EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter. I think there's another $5 million or $10 million tailwind from Henderson in 2018 as it continues to mature, but because it has ramped up so quickly, I think much of that benefit is already embedded in our results. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And just one on the guidance. It looks like the EBITDA margins at around the mid-point is about flattish. Could you just give us a flavor for kind of the puts and takes in that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I guess I would need to look at it more carefully. I mean, I think that the reality is we're expecting EBITDA for our operations to grow sort of in the low-single digits, and then we get some benefit from a lower share count. So, I think that's how you get to that sort of mid-single digit EPS growth for us. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I was thinking about the EBITDA margins just year-on-year kind of... Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Oh, EBITDA margin. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. And I think that's largely a function of the continued ramp up of the behavioral business. So, if \u2013 as I, I think in answering A.J.'s question before, talked about behavioral revenues growing at 3% or 4% and EBITDA growing at 2% to 3%, their margins are actually contracting a little bit. The acute margins are expanding a little bit, and that's, I think, you get those flattish margins. I apologize. I wasn't focused on the margin question. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I'd just like to come back to the question around the interplay of the payer mix. The capacity that you have through the de novo build out and the staffing and clinical adds versus the competitive intensity, so is this \u2013 what you're saying right now that you are turning away Medicare patients in favor of the Medicaid influx because you don't have capacity or is it that the Medicare patients that are going to other freestanding facilities or are the acute care facilities almost just keeping the good ones, I don't know, good is relative, but the higher price, higher length of stay Medicare patients for themselves, while sending new adult Medicaid from ER on the Friday night. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, Ana, I mean I don't know that it's possible for me to be terribly more precise than what I've said before in the sense that we certainly know a great deal about the patients that are coming to our hospitals. We don't necessarily always know exactly what patients are going elsewhere and what other hospitals or hospital systems in the marketplace are experiencing vis-\u00e0-vis market share, et cetera, especially in real time necessarily. So, as I tried to sort of answer Kevin's question, I think we're seeing a surge in Medicaid patients because of some of the changing dynamics in the regulatory landscape. One of the challenges that we have is that we're a business that receives our patient demand effectively and satisfies it in real time. We're not scheduling patients for admission the way a hotel is or the way an airline is or even quite frankly the way an acute care hospital might schedule its elective patients. Most of our patients are being presented to us on an emergency basis day to day, and it's a little bit harder to manage demand in those settings. And I think what I \u2013 again, I'm not sure I can be any clearer than I was with Kevin, but to say we're seeing more Medicaid patients and because of some challenges whether that's now the lower length of stay or more competition for those other payer classes like Medicare or clinician shortages or capacity shortages or medically compromised patients, all those factors are sort of contributing to the challenge of both managing payer mix and managing overall volume. But I think we remain confident that the underlying volume remains quite strong in the behavioral business. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Just asking another way, would the 2.5% adjusted admissions growth ramp up for 2018 from 1Q on and are you seeing that ramping up, and any color on 1Q, perhaps if you can give us \u2013 as you bring more staffing capacity and capacity on stream, should we expect the adjusted admissions itself to go higher and then length of stay and pricing can do whatever it's doing. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. It's difficult to predict and project particularly this early in the quarter. I know it doesn't necessarily seem so early on March 1, but obviously, all we've seen for February are volume numbers, which quite frankly look fairly encouraging. Behavioral volumes look strong in February. I think the year got off to somewhat of a slow start on the behavioral side. I think a severe weather, winter weather in a lot of our markets curbed some of our demand, particularly on the outpatient side. But February volumes look strong. But to be absolutely candid, I haven't seen any information on February payer mix or service line mix. And so, it's very difficult for me to comment on any sort of outlook for the first quarter beyond that, and obviously we still have March to go as well. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. So, thanks for that color, that's very helpful. Just moving to the UK knowing I know it's small for you, but there has been talks from the peer around a shift in local governments and some \u2013 that demand going to the competition and others perhaps, I don't know whether they're getting treated or is it kind of creating a pent up demand situation. Can you give us any color you're seeing at all in UK on the census? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Well, I think it's worth reinforcing your first comment, which is that our footprint in the UK is extremely small in comparison to our public company peer. And therefore, I'm not sure that our experience is necessarily indicative or their experience is necessarily indicative of ours. I will say that 2017 was largely a transition year for us. As I mentioned in a previous response, we did the Cambian acquisition at the very end of 2016 and spent most of 2017 working with the CMA in the UK on the outcome of that acquisition and what facilities would have to be sold. We were very pleased with the outcome of that process. We had to sell a single facility with less than a $1 million of EBITDA. And so, I think we felt like that work and that interaction with the CMA was worthwhile. But part of the outcome of that process is we were not able to combine our two businesses really until very late in 2017. So, we really weren't able to share best practices or achieve any synergies, et cetera. So, I think for us, 2018 will be a much better gauge of what we can do in the UK. Look, we would acknowledge that like in the U.S., it's a tight behavioral market, but I think Cambian in particular has had historical success at really minimizing the use of temporary nurses and registry. And we're hoping to use their best practices in our legacy facilities. And I don't know that we've seen the same pressure on our volumes that our public company peer has seen. And, again, we're in a much smaller number of markets and in different markets. But I think we've said pretty consistently, we haven't necessarily experienced those same issues. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. Thanks for the color, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones. Steve, when you said 471 behavioral beds, was that a 2017 number or a 2018 number? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: That was a 2017 number. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And did you tell us what you're contemplating for 2018 at? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I didn't. I will tell you that I think that number is probably a little bit higher, maybe in that 500 to 700 range. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And what will you spend on that to do that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think, on average, a new behavioral bed is probably in that $250,000 a bed range. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Obviously, it's dependent on where they are, et cetera, but I think that's a good average. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And are those all add on to existing facilities, new facilities? Are any of these in some of the JVs you had talked about? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So, like the two facilities that I mentioned before in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Spokane would be included in that number. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: And then, I think the bulk of the rest would be bed additions at existing facilities. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Last question, can you talk a little bit about what you're budgeting in terms of labor costs for both segments? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think we have the view that labor inflation in both businesses is probably in that sort of 3%, 3.5% range. I think the focus, which is a little bit different in each of the business segments, I think on the acute side, their main challenge, as a result of the labor shortage, has been increased use of what we describe as premium pay, the use of temporary nurses, the use of overtime. We've seen that number come down considerably in 2017 and our projections, I think, presume that it comes down more in 2018. On the behavioral side, the issue has been not so much labor inflation as much as it's been a difficulty in filling all those vacant positions. Again, I think, as I've already mentioned, I think we made a lot of progress in 2017. I think we presume that we'll continue to make more progress in 2018 and all that's incorporated, I think, in our guidance. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to the pricing side. It remains a little bit soft in the quarter. I know there was some acuity due to the flu, but California provider maybe should've helped balance that. So, I'm just trying to get a sense, is it payer mix, pure rate or something else that's kind of causing the drag? And as I look at 2017, it's been flat to down. So, just trying to understand kind of the visibility around that 2% to 3% embedded in for 2018. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. And, again, I think you've addressed some of it yourself, Ralph. I mean, I think that the surge in flu patients tends to really sort of drag down that revenue per unit. I think as most people understand, flu patients tend to be lower acuity, lower revenue per unit patients. And if we add 150 or 200 basis point of an increase in volume due to those patients, it has a pretty impactful impact or effect on that revenue per unit calculation. We've been saying for some time, however, that there's also been pressure on payer mix. I don't think this is terribly new or different in Q4. But for a number of quarters, maybe a couple of years now, I think we've continued to \u2013 really, I think since the ACA was fully implemented, we've continued to see the number of uninsured patients sort of gradually tick up every quarter, the number of Medicaid patients go up and the number of commercial patients come down. And I think that trend continues into Q4. And then finally, we've talked a fair amount in the last few quarters about the idea that, particularly, in some of our hospitals on the West Coast, which, in my mind, includes California and Nevada, we've seen a shift in very aggressive behavior on our \u2013 the part of our payers who have been very aggressive about categorizing our acute care patients as observation rather than inpatient patients. That behavior has been moderated some and we're seeing more of those patients being admitted. The cosmetics of that are our admissions go up and revenue per admission goes down because, again, they tend to be the lower acuity patients. So I think all of those factors contribute to sort of the dynamic that you see in the quarter, which is very strong admissions, driven by the flu, driven by this sort of shift back from observation to inpatient, et cetera, but it drives down the revenue per unit. I think in a more normalized sense and over time, we see revenue per unit and admission growth to be more comparable each in the 2.5% to 3% range. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then just want to talk a little bit about the competitive backdrop in the acute segment within your markets. Whether you think that's sort of more just a gauge around growth in the population? Is it \u2013 do you think you're just gaining market share? Are there may be closures in your markets? Just trying to get a better sense as you sort of look at the results of the sustained and what seems to be pretty outsized volume results, both versus peers and industry even trying to tease out some of the dynamics that you talked about in terms of observation, visits and the like? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure. I mean, look, I think it's worth noting that the trends that you're asking about, Ralph, have been in place for quite some time and we've been outperforming our peers for a number of years now. And quite frankly, I think if you go back to pre-recession periods, we were outperforming our peers generally. And I think it's mostly about the markets that we're in. The markets that we're in tend to be growing faster than the national averages. We've had a long time \u2013 for a long time, we've had a slide in our investor presentation which has indicated that our markets are projected to grow at often twice the rate of the national average, and so we clearly benefit from that. But then it's that sort of double whammy, if you will, of enhancing the franchises within those growing markets. So, Las Vegas is a perfect example where the market itself, with the exception of a few years before the recession, but the market itself has been one of the most robust and fastest growing markets in the U.S. for several decades now. We benefited from that, but we've also benefited by building new capacity, by increasing our market share in the market very considerably, et cetera. And obviously, while Las Vegas is our single largest market, I think that pattern has been repeated by us in a number of other markets, including Riverside County, California, including in the District of Columbia, including in several of our Florida markets. So, again, I think that that pattern has repeated itself and is really what has benefited our acute care performance. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And if I could squeeze one more in. I know you talked about capital deployment, I may have missed it. What about a more meaningful dividend? Specifically any thoughts or comments around that as well. Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we didn't \u2013 I didn't specifically address that in my previous comments, Ralph, but I think that everything is on the table and the company is open to and willing to look at a lot of different alternatives. As you know, tax reform only passed a couple of months ago and so, a lot of this deliberation and analysis is still ongoing and still in the early stages. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And we have no further questions, sir. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Okay. Well, we thank everybody for their time and I look forward to speaking to everybody at the end of the first quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's fourth quarter and year-end conference call.

Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Kristy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2018 Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Thank you, Kristy. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.36 for the quarter. After adjusting for the unfavorable $9.9 million after-tax impact resulting from the increase in our reserve related to the Department of Justice discussions and the favorable impact from our 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, as discussed in our press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.45 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. On a same-facility basis, in our acute care division, revenues increased 3.7% during the first quarter of 2018. Excluding our health plan, same-facility revenues increased 5.8%. The increase resulted primarily from a 2.3% increase in adjusted admissions and a 3.4% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.0% during the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.6%, and adjusted patient days increased 0.4% over the prior year quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.2% during the first quarter of 2017 (sic) [2018] over the comparable prior year quarter. Our cash provided by operating activities was approximately $364 million during the first quarter of 2018. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 53 days during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 50 days during the first quarter of last year. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 42.9% at March 31, 2018 as compared to 44.7% at December 31, 2017. We spent $189 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2018. Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Yeah. I was hoping that you could just give us some more detail on the moving parts here. As you know, your EBITDA came in below the Street consensus estimate, not that that's necessarily what you're targeting for. And then I just wanted to understand on the behavioral side in particular, what you think about for volumes going forward for this year and maybe beyond, given the targets you've set? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Matt. So I would begin by commenting that the results for the quarter, while we acknowledge and as you point out, were under the Street consensus estimates, they were not nearly as shy of our own internal budget. We were probably just $0.03 or $0.04 shy of our own internal budget for the year. I think our internal budget has a steeper ramp for the year than the Street estimates. I would say, particularly, I think in the third quarter, our internal budget is more robust than the Street estimate. So, we were, in terms of our internal budget, almost sort of spot on in terms of our acute results and slightly under on the behavioral side, which is really, I guess, the subject of your second question. I think when you adjust our same-store behavioral revenues for the decline in our Puerto Rico health plan, which we have really talked about over the years because it is relatively small and runs at pretty much EBITDA breakeven. But, after the hurricane had a significant loss of revenue, it probably distorts our revenue by about 50 basis points in the quarter. So you're looking at roughly 3.5% same-store behavioral revenue growth rate for the quarter. That's still a little bit light from where our own internal expectations were. I think we attribute most of the shortfall to an outpatient revenue shortfall, and we attribute that shortfall to weather and mostly weather issues in markets like Boston and Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., which had difficult first quarter weather-wise, and we were several million dollars short of our outpatient revenue budget for the quarter. But other than that, again, I think we're a little shy on the behavioral revenue and therefore probably $5 million or $6 million shy from an EBITDA perspective in the quarter, at least as it came into our own internal forecast. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. That's great. Thank you. Just one follow-up on that, in the first quarter, with the outpatient volume on the behavioral side, did you see that ramp up over the course of \u2013 I've forgotten actually when the weather disruptions occurred. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, actually if you recall, it was a bit of an odd quarter in that, I think, the bad weather really came sort of early in the quarter and then again late in the quarter, early March in a lot of these places. Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Hi, thanks. Good morning, Steve. Why don't you talk a little bit about the process and operations and protocols in your behavioral segment. And I'm just curious if there's been any changes in light of the investigation and, I guess, would there be any anticipated changes in just basic protocols and how you guys operate the business as part of that settlement towards. This been sort of status quo and no real changes in the operations? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think it's mostly been the latter, Josh. I mean, I think we've talked about this a number of times over the course of this investigation, which is now frankly into its fifth year. We certainly have taken the investigation very seriously. We've reviewed carefully all the documents that have been provided to the government and have tried to look at them in a very sort of comprehensive way. So, looking at them to analyze whether they are indicative of internal issues or things that we ought to be fixing et cetera. Look, I think, like every organization, if you're going to take that hard of a look at yourself internally, you're always going to find small things that you're going to tweak, and I think we've done that. But in general, I think we have felt like the investigation really has not uncovered or identified significant or pervasive problems within the behavioral health division, within our practices, within our protocols, sort of all the things that you talked about. And honestly, we have made that argument very vigorously to the government. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Okay. And then \u2013 so it sounds like I don't want to look forward to your math, but as part of the settlement, it doesn't sound like there's any changes that need to be implemented either, right? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Well, to be fair, I don't think we're at that stage of the settlement negotiations where I can say to you that the government will not ask for and that we will not agree to changes. That subject has really not risen yet with the government. I assume at some point, it may, but it has not yet. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Okay, got you. And then just one more. Acute care side, flu impact, did you see anything? Obviously, a decent shift between admissions and adjusted admissions, but anything that you care to point out, impact on EBITDA, et cetera? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yes. I mean, we talked in Q4 about the fact that we felt like we had realized a fairly significant favorable impact from the flu in Q4. I think in most of our markets, we felt like the real heavy sort of flu utilization petered out pretty early in the first quarter, certainly, by the middle and maybe no longer than the end of January. So, I think, we felt like the flu impact, for us, was much, much more minimal and really not even worthy of kind of calling out separately in Q1. Just commenting on sort of admissions and revenue per adjusted admission, our admissions in 2017 were really quite robust and our revenue per admission was sort of on the low side. And a number of times we addressed that in our calls and pointed out that, we felt a big driver of that dynamic was that we were paying or putting a lot of focus on the whole inpatient and observation issue, and that in working with many of our payers, particularly out West, we felt like more and more patients were appropriately qualifying for admission status rather than observation status. And what that had \u2013 the impact of that was, it inflated the admission number but tended to reduce the revenue per admission number, because those tended to be below acuity admissions. We suggested that once we anniversary that dynamic in the beginning of 2018, that those numbers would sort of become more in balance. And we projected roughly a 5.5% or 6% acute care revenue growth rate in 2018. Our actual growth rate in Q1 was 5.8% when you adjust for the health plan. And we said we thought it would be more evenly split between admissions and revenue per admission, and it was. So I think from our perspective, the dynamics in the acute care division, particularly in Q1, have played out much in the way that we've expected and much in the way that we've suggested to people they will this year. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Perfect. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. First, Steve, on the behavioral side. I know that this is still carrying year-over-year headwinds from closed facilities and the type of environment in Puerto Rico. Can you walk us through that headwind for the impact this quarter, and when those headwinds diminish in your mind on a year-over-year basis? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Justin. I think, frankly, the easiest way for investors to see the bulk of the impact that you are referring to is, if you look at the delta or the difference between our behavioral same-store EBITDA in the quarter and our total behavioral EBITDA in the quarter. And our total behavioral EBITDA is about $11 million or $12 million lower. What drives that $11 million or $12 million delta is a couple of things : one, which we talked about at sort of great length in the third and fourth quarters last year, are these three sort of regulatory challenged facilities that we had in Boston and Dallas. And we closed those two facilities and then restructured a facility in Oklahoma City to accommodate sort of a lower revenue stream. And basically, the closeout or restructuring cost in those facilities are largely severance as employees are laid off, et cetera. So we probably had about $6 million or $7 million of those costs in Q1. And then, we probably had another $3 million or $4 million in costs or EBITDA drag, I should say, from the acquisition that we announced at the very end of the year, a facility in Gulfport, Mississippi. When we acquire a new facility like that, we have to get a new Medicare number. And for the three, four, five months that it takes to get a new Medicare number, we're unable to bill Medicare or Medicaid and generally run at a loss. And again, that loss was about $3 million or $4 million in the quarter. Now, I will note that all those items that I just mentioned are items that we budgeted for and I think, quite frankly, is the main reason why our internal budget was lower than the Street estimates for the quarter. I think the only other item that you mentioned was a Puerto Rico drag. That remains in our same-store numbers. And it's probably \u2013 Puerto Rico is probably $1 million or $2 million off of where it was last year. As far as how these things continue, the closeout restructuring costs should end in Q1. We are essentially finished with those. The Gulfport, Mississippi drag should end at some point in Q2. We've had our survey of that facility. And as soon as we get certified, we'll be able to bill effective with the date of the survey. So, presuming that we can get through that, that should end sometime very soon. Puerto Rico is a little bit hard to predict. As you know, the island continues to struggle with infrastructure issues, et cetera. So I wouldn't \u2013 it's not impossible that that continues to be a bit of a drag. But honestly, I think we anticipated that it would be a drag in our 2018 guidance. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. And then, just one more question. You mentioned that your numbers were off Street consensus by $20 million, off your number by closer to $5 million. There's a $15 million gap. And it sounds like you're telling us to take that and basically move it into the third quarter, so raise third quarter by $15 million. Just want to make sure that's the right way to interpret it. And then, anything specific in your mind? Like, is it just Street mis-modeling, or is there anything getting better in the third quarter or kind of annualizing in the third quarter that you think we should keep in mind? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure. Look, we've intentionally, as you know, do not give quarterly guidance and I really don't want to get into sort of de facto giving quarterly guidance. But I'll simply make the point that our full year guidance is within, I think, $0.01 or $0.02 off the Street's consensus for the year. And so, again, I think we are largely on target and the only difference is timing. And I will suggest, as I did earlier on the call, that I think the bulk of that timing was that we had a less robust Q1, largely, I think, for the reasons I just enumerated, and we have a more robust Q3, largely because I think a lot of the negative issues that we had last year occurred in Q3 and then in Q4, so the comparison becomes much easier. But I'm not going to tell people exactly how they should model the year. But hopefully, this discussion gives people a pretty good sense of how we're looking at the trajectory of the rest of the year. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, just starting with the health insurance pullback. How did the impact in Q1 compare with your expectations and should we be modeling something similar for the balance of the year? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, Steve, just to make the point. There is a fairly significant decline in healthcare revenue, which, again, I mentioned in our prepared remarks, because we include the health plan in our same-store revenue. The driver of that revenue decline is we have largely reconfigured our business and particularly our service lines in that health plan business, most especially getting out of the commercial exchange business as, you know, I think, a number of other insurers have done. Because that was a losing business for us, the net impact is, we reduced our revenue fairly significantly, but our EBITDA in the health plan is actually up a couple of million dollars in the quarter now. I think, again, on the fourth quarter call, when we just talked about our guidance for the year, we suggested that we were thinking that the health plan would create about a $5 million or $10 million tailwind for the year as we expected their results to improve. So I think we're on track to be in that range and continue to be so. But just making the point that the Q1 revenue difference, which I do think will continue for most of the year, is not something that really will fall through to EBITDA in any sort of material way. In fact, I think it'll have the opposite effect on EBITDA. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Awesome. That's helpful. And just generally, clearly, you have more visibility on pricing for the balance of the year. So I just want to understand kind of what levels of adjusted admits you're assuming for the balance of the year, both in acute and behavioral, kind of, at the low and the high end of guidance? And maybe any other general comments on utilization and the outlook there would be helpful and I'll yield. Thank you. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I'm just going to repeat the comments that we made in our Q4 call, which was that our guidance for the year presumes that acute care revenue growth would be in that sort of 5.5% to 6% range and it would be split pretty evenly between volumes and price. And again, I think that's pretty much we ran in the first quarter. In the first quarter, we were a little bit more skewed to price than to volumes, and I suspect those numbers might bounce around a little bit during the year. On the behavioral side, we talked about getting to something close to 5% same-store revenue growth by the third quarter. And we imagine that would be 3% to 4% volume and 1% to 2% price. In Q1, we did actually better on the pricing side. I think as we have pressured our payers for some price increases to offset, quite frankly, some of the other volume pressures that we see, but I think that remains our projection. Now again, the ramp for behavioral or the behavioral results for the year presume much more of a ramp, that each quarter we presume that the revenue growth will incrementally increase a little bit differently than on the acute side where we thought it would be pretty steady and ratable. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, just one last follow-up, if I can. On the behavioral side, was there any sort of meaningful impact from those three facilities that you've now closed on the overall same-store metrics that kind of goes away as we think about this ramp? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Well, again, maybe I was not clear about this, but I think effectively, we've removed those hospitals from same-store. So as I said, there's $6 million or $7 million of closeout costs in there. But to your point, I think, by removing those hospitals from same-store, it does hurt the same-store EBITDA numbers because those hospitals were generally profitable in the first half of the year. So, that creates a headwind for us in the first half of the year. It'll create a tailwind in the back half of the year, when they were losing significant money and they won't be in the same-store. All that, of course, is embedded in our guidance. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I just want to first maybe ask about the length of stay pressures for the Managed Medicaid that you've been experiencing. I know I think when we were down there in December, there was some discussion about setting up a task force to sort of look market by market and really try to drill down exactly what's happening there. So, how should we think about this going forward? We just get to the third quarter and your sort of anniversary the incremental pressure you saw last year and it sort of steadies out, or have you guys felt like there's something you can to do to push back on this? Where are you at your thinking on the length of stay pressure? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So I think the point that we made in Q4 and I think we've made for the last few quarters is that, what we see on the behavioral side is that, within each of the payer categories, length of stay is relatively stable. And what I think drives the overall reduction in length of stay is the continued shift. Mostly, I think, at this point and particular in Q1, from traditional Medicaid to Managed Medicaid, so our managed payers, probably not surprisingly to most people, tend to be more aggressive from a utilization review perspective. I think what you're alluding to, A.J., is that, across the board, I think we're taking a hard look at length of stay and length of stay management and utilization review management by all of our payers, and just taking the steps that we think are necessary and appropriate to have the right and appropriate clinically justified length of stay. So where we think payers are arbitrarily reducing length of stay where it is not clinically indicated, we continue to push back in all sorts of ways, both in terms of strengthening our documentation, strengthening our contractual language, sometimes challenging the payers through the state insurance commissioners, all those sorts of things. To be fair, I think we find that, that is a kind of slow and tedious process and perhaps takes us longer than we might have originally anticipated. So, I think, our point of view is that, as you articulated, we don't believe length of stay is really going to continue to worsen. And particularly, when we get in the back half of the year, the comparisons will get a lot easier for us, which again is part of the reason why I think our budgetary ramp for the year may be a little bit steeper than the Street's. But we will continue to do all those things that I just enumerated as we continue to really \u2013 I think fight on behalf of our patients for the clinically appropriate and justified length of stay. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then the other thing I was going to ask you about was, maybe on the capital deployment question. You guys have pulled \u2013 slowed down the buyback pace in the first quarter. I mean, clearly we've seen other guys when they're trying to negotiate with the government, maybe put things like that on a little hold or slow down, maybe that's it. But I also wondered whether there was anything in the deal pipeline that you guys are seeing, either in acute or behavioral, that looks interesting or are you \u2013 your thought process on whether you might see transactions step up in terms of potential acquisitions. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think two sort of discrete issues. I think your first comment, A.J. is fairly accurate. I think we feel that, as we get what we hope is closer to an ultimate settlement with the government, it probably makes sense to hit the pause button a little bit on our share repurchase activity. As far as the deal pipeline, it's always difficult to characterize. It seems to be open and active on both sides of the business. But, I think, as it always has been, there's a lot of activity and it's always very difficult to predict with any level of precision how much of that activity can ultimately result in an executable transaction. So we continue to be busy in terms of evaluation and assessment on the M&A side. But I wouldn't say that we've slowed down our repurchase activity because we've got anything imminent in the pipeline. I don't think that's the case. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Let me add to A.J. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: A.J., good luck at your new employee. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: They're lucky to get you. We're also busy with integration, and that is joint ventures with non-profits. We're very active there, and that's a good area for us. It's another area. We're going to open a hospital in Lancaster. We're up in Oregon. It's a good new area for us. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Interesting. So, that relates to the IMD exclusion, easing and people on the behavioral side or is it something else? Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think it relates to the fact that the non-profits that are not in behavioral look to the leader and they want to get into that part of the business for going forward. So we're there, and I think we're going to be very prominent. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, interesting. So, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. I wanted to understand the step up in salary expense. Can you break out if this pressure was more on the acute or behavioral side? And then help us understand if this was more one-time pressure like signing bonuses for new recruits, or if it's more ongoing like hourly wage increases? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sarah, so from my perspective, I think that the wage environment and, I guess, the labor environment has not changed a great deal over the course of the last few years. We've been in a pretty tight labor market for a while now. And I think it affects both segments of the business potentially in different ways. On the acute side, there's been a lot of pressure on what we described as premium pay, overtime to our own nurses, and the use of temporary or registry or outside nurses or traveling nurses. But to be fair, I don't \u2013 we've been at this sort of pretty low unemployment rate now for several quarters at least, and I don't necessarily believe there is incremental pressure. I think the main sort of issue that you see between the two segments is when you've got the acute care segment growing at roughly 6% revenue growth, it's able to drive margin expansion because that's a sufficient level of revenue growth to achieve operating leverage and efficiencies. On the behavioral side, we're not quite there yet. That sort of 3.5% or a little higher revenue growth is just simply not enough to drive real operating efficiencies. And so I think we have pretty sort of flattish same-store EBITDA. I think in both cases, it's more a function of the revenue growth than it is any significant changes on the salary side. Again, it's a tight labor market on both sides of the business and I think will continue to be so as long as we're at these very historically low employment rates. But I don't see anything terribly new or incremental in that regard. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And just to follow-up on your comment on the behavioral side. While you're waiting for the revenue to ramp back up in a way that could facilitate higher margins, are there any cost initiatives that are going on that can help offset some of the wage pressure on the behavioral segment? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, as a CFO, it's sort of always my natural inclination to believe that every business that we own could be run a little bit more efficiently. But to be fair, I think that our behavioral business has been and continues to be run at a pretty highly efficient level. And I certainly don't believe there's a ton of low-hanging fruit. Again, we're constantly, I think, as any good operator is, trying to make sure that all the things that we're doing are efficient within the confines of making sure that we continue to maintain the highest quality of care for our patients. But I wouldn't suggest or offer to people that there's a ton of opportunity for efficiency until and unless we continue to increase that revenue growth, which we expect we will do. Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Just want to wrap up one final question on some of the weakness that caused in the first quarter you attributed to outpatient behavioral volumes. I'm just curious if you have any commentary. Have you seen that recover to more normalized level here in the second quarter so far? That's my first question. And then, I think, in the past, you've talked about some of the relationships with some of your referrals sources from acute care hospitals to your freestanding behavioral hospitals, about the mix of the referrals that you've seen. Is that an area that you focused on and any progress in terms of getting a better mix of referrals from those acute sources? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, I think your first question, Frank, I think, is really asking for kind of a preliminary read on the outpatient activity in Q2. Honestly, I think what I've said to people historically is, inpatient volumes is something that we literally get sort of a daily real-time read on. Most of the other data within our two businesses, we get some anecdotal feedback on things like outpatient revenue and surgical trends, et cetera, but nothing terribly precise. My gut reaction, and again, this is more anecdotal and subjective, from talking to our folks out in the field is that, yeah, in these markets where we had a bad weather first quarter, the volumes and the activity have rebounded in Q2, but I don't have a lot of data to support that. We'll have to wait for another month or two to see whether that proves out to be correct. I think your second question, it really talked about the fact that we have indicated in 2017 that our Medicaid utilization had risen. To some degree, we attributed that to the IMD exclusion being lifted. But I think we also suggested that in some markets, some of our referral sources, our acute care hospitals, ERs in particular, were being more selective in sending us sometime some of their Medicaid patients, but not necessarily Medicare and commercial. I think that's a pretty sort of specific sort of comment, and in those markets, we are sort of addressing that with our referral sources. I would say, generally, our payer mix has remained pretty stable in Q1 and has not changed a great deal. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. And you mentioned you did have more clarity on the inpatient side of behavioral. So any color on how the inpatient side is looking so far in 2Q? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I'm always hesitant to really give a lot of sort of feedback in that regard. Again, I think generally the calendar this year \u2013 and I'm not a big calendar guy, but I think the calendar was generally skewed to better volumes in April than in March. The surveys that I've seen sort of suggest that. I think that's been our experience on both the behavioral and the acute side. And other than that, I don't know that I would suggest that there's a ton of trends that I think are worth calling out at this point. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. On the acute side, your occupancy improved nicely year-over-year, but you weren't able to bring that much to the bottom line in terms of incremental margin. I'm wondering, first, I thought that those lower acuity admissions may be tied to the flu, but you said flu wasn't much of an impact. So I'm wondering if there's something else that caused what looks like lower acuity admissions in the quarter. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, Peter, it's always difficult for me to respond to sort of other people's expectations. But again, we talked about acute care performance and our guidance for our acute care performance in 2018 being 5.5% to 6% revenue growth and 6% to 7% EBITDA growth. We hit both of those metrics in Q1. Again, I'll sort of repeat what I said somebody earlier, as a CFO, I'm always of the mind that we could have done a little better, could have been a bit more efficient, could have \u2013 but generally, I felt like our acute care performance was very much in line with our expectations and very much in line with what we laid out for the year. And again in an environment, as I said, where it is a tight labor market, where there is a reasonable amount of wage pressure and has been for some time, I thought it was a pretty strong performance. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on the behavioral side, can you talk about opioid treatment? I assume that's mostly going to outpatient treatment. Have we seen a pickup in that and how are you on setting up new programs for that, where do we stand on seeing any kind of incremental revenue from the opioid situation? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think you sort of \u2013 in asking your question, you've sort of framed the sort of conundrum for us, and that is, there is certainly as I think anybody who reads newspaper or browses the Internet knows the amount of opioid addiction and the amount of sort of addiction illness in general is doing nothing but increasing in great numbers and at a great pace. The reimbursement for that treatment, I'm not sure is keeping pace with the actual demand. Now there have been some additional federal monies dedicated et cetera and legislation passed. But I'm not sure that has really flowed through to the provider community and the patient community yet. So we're watching it very closely and I think in certain markets where there clearly is incremental reimbursement available, we have created, as you suggested, largely outpatient programs to respond to it. But I would say, at this point, we have not been benefited in any measurable way from an increase in addiction demand or really, I would say, addiction reimbursement. We expect that in the future we might, and we're very attuned to that. But I don't think it's occurred yet. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. You talked about reconfiguring the health plan with getting out of the exchanges. I guess, are you still committed to having that offering as it's clearly been driving a lot of noise. And then are you \u2013 given that you're sort of a pretty concentrated portfolio, do you have interest or have employers in your markets showing sort of more interest and discussion around direct contracting? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So, Ralph, I guess, the way I would answer the question again, I think we've talked about the rationale for the health plan, it's probably I think going on 3.5 years old at this point, we've owned it for 3.5 years. I think two things. We bought the health plan because I think we have a point of view, as I think most hospital providers have, that we will continue to move to more of a risk-based environment where providers of all sorts, hospitals and physicians, take on more risk and act more like insurers in the future, and as a consequence, will require skills like underwriting skills that they historically have not had. We always thought that owning an insurance company and having that platform and having that infrastructure would enable us to build that very important skill set. I think the other issue for us is, we feel like, on a market by market basis, being able to use that underwriting expertise to create things like Medicare Advantage plans in certain markets or accountable care organizations in other markets, again, is an extremely important competitive advantage to be able to leverage. So yeah, I think we're committed to continue to remain in that business, but I think as our current activity indicates, we will adjust the business and tweak it to do the things that we think are most effective, most profitable and then do not do things that don't generate profitability or steer business to our hospitals, et cetera. I mean, we're not in the insurance business just for the sake of doing it. We think it's beneficial to our hospitals and beneficial to our overall results. And I apologize, Ralph, on... Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: The direct contracting? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Oh, yeah. We're not \u2013 again, at this point, I don't think we're seeing a great deal of direct contracting from employers, partly because in most of our markets I think the employers are simply not big enough to do that. We've seen a little bit like I think from the casinos in Las Vegas, some of the casinos, but generally not. But again, building that underwriting expertise I think will allow us to do that if there's more of a demand for it in the future. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, I did want to go back and try to better understand the components of the same facility revenue growth. You mentioned, and we did certainly see, outsized volume in the last kind of year or two, and then muted and even negative pricing. And you talked about sort of the shift back of observation in patient and now it normalizing. I think I'm just not sure I'm following the dynamics on the impact on the pricing side and why would that have the impact of popping the pricing stat. And then the second piece of that which is the \u2013 on the pricing side, is there anything more in terms of either pure pricing increases that you're getting, payer mix or acuity mix to comment that might have helped us stack this quarter. Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, again, I think the dynamic is simply that, if what you're doing is converting those observation patients, a portion of observation patients to inpatients, what it will do will increase the number of admissions and drive a higher than sort of, I'll call it, average admission growth rate, which I think was happening in 2018 and which I think we called out multiple times. But at the same time, it tends to lower the average revenue per admission, because by definition, those patients who are on the bubble of meeting admission criteria are your least acute patients. They're not open-heart surgery patients, they're not hip implant patients, they're not \u2013 your ER trauma patients, they're patients who are, again, at a lower acuity levels. So again, admitting them drives higher inpatient admission numbers, but tends to drag down that overall revenue per admission. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just payer mix and acuity mix in the quarter? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think both payer mix and acuity were fairly constant for the quarter. Again, I mentioned that it was not nearly as busy a flu quarter as the fourth quarter was, so that didn't have much of an impact. So as I think about it, I think, both payer mix and acuity were pretty stable in the quarter. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Steve, on the outpatient revenue shortfall versus budget that you discussed related to weather, would you be willing to quantify like how far short of budget were you? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So when we did the analysis, if we were at just last year's level of outpatient revenue growth, our adjusted patient day growth would've gone from 0.4% to 0.9%. So it's worth like 50 basis points of adjusted patient days. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I'll do some maths on that. And then my other question was, admissions growth faster than adjusted admissions growth, which is rare. And I guess it's primarily the outpatient revenue shortfall. I just want to make sure that the health plan revenue wasn't included in the gross revenue you were using those calculations and skewing it at all. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: No. So when we do the revenue per patient day and revenue per admission calculations, we exclude the health plan. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Last question, do you have a same-store ER visit number you can share? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: There's a little bit for memory, but I think pretty consistent with our admission growth. It was in that sort of 3%, 3.5% range. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Just wanted to see a little bit more about what you felt like the core improvement was happening, if any, I guess, in the site business this quarter versus Q4. I think on the Q4 call, you said, excluding hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Houston and the regulatory challenges at the three sites, that you were saying the site business grew revenue about 3.5%. And it sounds like you're saying, kind of excluding some of those same issues at Puerto Rico, you're looking at 3.5% again this quarter. So is that fair that the number kind of on a core basis was relatively stable from quarter-to-quarter or is there anything going on underneath that that makes you feel better about the trajectory? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So I think when you sum the patient days and the revenue per patient day, you're at that roughly 3.6%. I think we can see, Kevin, that number is probably a few million dollars light from where we thought we would be. And again, we attribute most of that shortfall to the outpatient shortfall in the quarter. So I think we have the view that if the outpatient revenue have been where we thought it would be, we would have been pretty close to our revenue growth trajectory for the quarter. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So when you kind of segregate it, your view is that the core business is showing the improvement that you would have thought outside of outpatient? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, we think so. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, going back to another question about margins in behavioral, just a few years ago, those margins were like 26%, 27% type margins. You're now more like 22%. Are those \u2013 where do you think a normalized margin might be over time, once you get the business growing 5% again? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, what I would say, Kevin, is I think the reason the margins have declined over the last few years is because the revenue growth has been below \u2013 I don't mean to sort of make it like it's a magical number, but that sort of 5% revenue growth that we think is right around, particularly in a kind of a tighter labor environment, the number you need to drive operating leverage and margin expansion. My point of view is that if and when, and we believe we will get to those numbers relatively soon, those revenue growth numbers, we will continue to drive margin expansion again much as we did for many years in the behavioral business. And effectively, you'll get those incremental margins as long as you can sustain that level of growth. I mean, the fundamental sort of business model for the hospital business, and I think it's true for both behavioral and acute, is that as long as you can continue to drive that revenue growth, it is largely a fixed and semi-fixed cost business, and as long as that volume growth is not constrained physically by capacity issues, et cetera, I mean, again, maybe the easy answer from my perspective at a minimum, we ought to be able to get back to those margins that we were running before we started to experience the labor issues two or three years ago. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, on the acute side, it sounds like you're saying there's shifts in observation to short-stay admissions, anniversarying that dynamic is really basically is that \u2013 is it fair to say the entire kind of slowdown in core volumes? Or is there anything that you would point to on core acute care volumes year-over-year underneath that and anything regionally that you might point to? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: No, I don't think so. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just last question. You guys changed the settlement amount that you booked on your balance sheet. Is there anything that we should read into that? Is there anything that we should expect to happen two or three more times or does this argue for significant or meaningful progress along those negotiations? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: What I would say is that our outside accountants have told us that the accepted convention in the accounting industry at the moment is that companies are required to reserve for at least their minimum level of willingness to settle in these situations. So, I think, what to be read into it is that our current reserve is just that, is an indication of our minimum willingness to settle or I guess, alternatively, we've made an offer in and around that number to the government. Having said that, I would suggest that this continues to be a process. I wouldn't suggest to people that we are close to settling at that number by any stretch. Even though, as I did say to somebody earlier in the call, we continue to vigorously defend our position to the government, it is entirely possible that that number changes a number of times in the future. We would hope not too many times and we hope this doesn't go on for too long, but honestly, we're largely stuck at proceeding at the government's pace. And we'll continue to cooperate and respond to the government as expeditiously as we can, but in large part, we will proceed at their pace. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of an Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. The first question, just follow up on the acute side, it is noticeable always that your volumes were higher and you attributed it to observation stays and your pricing growth was lower. Is this intentional the shift that you have put together \u2013 seen this quarter and is it coming from the specific set of payers or is it dictated by payer mix or might this again bounce around going forward because it just happened, if you will, rather than being intentional? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So again, I mean, this is an issue that we spoke about I think just about every quarter last year. I think what we were finding is that, our payers, particularly our payers in, what I would describe as, our Western markets, California, Las Vegas, were in our minds our commercial payers were being particularly aggressive about observation status and keeping patients out of the inpatient status. And we \u2013 I do think very deliberately pushed back in a number of different ways, again, better documentation, different contractual terms in our contracts, et cetera and, I think, made a significant amount of progress in 2017. But on multiple occasions, again, I think we pointed it out, we try to be very transparent about what was happening and suggest that, that was sort of inflating the admission numbers in 2017 and those numbers would regress to something more normal in 2018, which I think is what has happened. Back to your question, I mean, are those numbers likely to bounce around from quarter-to-quarter? The answer to that is, always yes. Volume numbers and utilization numbers in the hospital business are not absolutely predictable. So yes, those numbers will bounce around some for a variety of reasons, including some fluctuation in the whole inpatient observation dynamic. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, thanks. And then again on the volumes in acute, a lot of your peers in the not-for-profit systems talk a lot more it feels like about mix shifting to ambulatory and ASCs and ED to urgent care. I haven't heard that from you, and maybe I just missed it in terms of what you're observing and your CapEx strategies and building out access points, and is that because of the nature of your markets or something else? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: No. Look, I think, Ana, we have the same general point of view as most of our acute care peers, both for-profit and not-for-profit have, and that is, we know that a significant portion of the business has shifted to ambulatory settings. It so happens that investment in the ambulatory business tends by its nature to be just smaller, costs $10 million to build a freestanding emergency department as opposed to the $200 million of cost to build a freestanding hospital. So we don't necessarily call it out. But we have, and have mentioned previously, probably a dozen freestanding EDs, for example, that are either operational or under development at the moment in a number of geographies. We have primary care physician sites in a bunch of our hospitals, we have some urgent care sites, some outpatient imaging ambulatory sites. And again, every one of those strategies is tailored to the markets. So no, honestly, I think in the markets that we're in, we're as aggressively investing in the ambulatory business as any of our peers. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay, that's helpful. I didn't realize that. And then the final one on acute, if I could. On procedure volumes and seasonality, there was a little bit of something in the hurricane, but it felt like 4Q was steeper last year than it has been in the past. And moving into 1Q, have you seen something that would suggest that the seasonality is continuing to accelerate, and is that because of more ASC-type commercial, high-deductible type procedures or you're not seeing and have you seen sort of a stabilization at this point of seasonality? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: It's a good question, Ana. Honestly, not one that I think we are best positioned to answer. As you know, I think there were a lot of sort of experts, if you will, who predicted that Q4 volume for hospital providers would be higher because so many more plans had higher copays and deductibles that would encourage their subscribers to have ambulatory source of elective procedures at the end of 2017 if they had exhausted their copays and deductibles. And that in turn, Q1 volumes could be somewhat lower. But this advantage that we have at the moment is, number one, we don't know what our hospital peers are going to report over the course of the next week or two weeks, so that's hard to measure. And it's just very difficult for us to measure whether patients in total, have more patients have exhausted their copays or deductibles, et cetera. I think the insurers are much better positioned to do that. So honestly, I think later in the year, maybe in Q2 or Q3, we'll be able to look back and see if there was kind of more of a seasonality shift in Q4 and Q1, but at the moment, I think that's very difficult for us to do with any level of precision or objectivity. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you. Then moving to behavioral, one question on the pricing growth being better. You said you've been able to convince your peers, pressing better on negotiation. Is that a sustainable level of pricing growth improvement? Is it being driven by one specific segment of payers or even within a segment, certain set of payers, or is it more kind of a mix issue on payer mix or something else? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I mean, I think that our pricing in the quarter was on the higher side. Again, we described our expectation for future pricing to be in sort of that 1% to 2% range, and I think it's more likely that that's where it tends to reside. But we are aggressively going back to payers. We have not had in our minds adequate increases from in some time and those are both government and non-government payers, meaning managed and unmanaged payers. And we'll continue to do that. But no, I wouldn't suggest to people that the three-plus percent price increase that we saw in Q1 is necessarily sustainable over the long-term. I think something a little bit lower than that is probably more realistic. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Okay. Thanks. One final one. We saw the undertakings on Cambian. I think you took the last one on. As far as now the \u2013 broadly, what are you seeing on the volumes and census in the U.K.? And I believe, NHS is beginning to increase wages for nurses? Meaningfully, any likely pressures there? It's much smaller for you, but just what are you observing, if anything. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yes. I mean, I think, for us, our U.K. experience in 2017 was fairly specific in the sense that because we spent most of the year going through the CMA process, the U.K. equivalent of the FTC, and one unable to combine the Cambian business with our legacy business. We didn't really have the opportunity to sort of drive any actual operating efficiencies, but even sort of best practices and things, and I think that we feel like 2018 will be a year of greater opportunity to do that. And so, I think, as the year progresses, we'll be able to better report even though it is a relatively small component of the business, on hopefully, improvements we've been able to make to that business now that we have been able to combine it since late 2017. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Got it. Thanks Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I don't think you talked about this, but just any quick update on how your addiction business is doing? I know it's small. But I'm just curious about how that is trending versus your behavioral, if you see any diversions there? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: No. I mean, again, I think in response to Peter Costa's question earlier, which was a little bit more sort of forward-looking, again, I think we see a decent amount of demand in the addiction business, both in sort of our dedicated addiction business, both in sort of our dedicated addiction business, as well as in many of our other facilities that have at least a component of addiction treatment. But I think the addiction treatment business is undergoing some fairly significant changes, moving more from an out-of-network model to more of an in-network model, moving in some cases from an inpatient model to an outpatient model. We're sorting of sorting through all those things as you suggest. I mean, addiction treatment is a relatively small component of our overall behavioral business. But I think we're very attuned to those changes and trying to take advantage of those changes as we move forward. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: John Ransom>: And then my other question, and again I'm sorry, if I missed this, but U.K. labor proposal by the NHS, do you have any use there that are worth talking about? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Many ways, I view it as sort of a similar situation. I think the U.K. labor market is tight and will remain tight for some time. I think I have said on some previous calls that one of the things that most attracted us to the Cambian business was that there management really had a long track record of managing labor pressures really well. And I think we felt like there were again best practices that they would be able to bring to our legacy business. Again, we really were able to do that in 2017 because we had to hold the two businesses separate until we were through the CMA process. I think we're hoping to be able to leverage some of those practices in 2018. We'll be better able to report on that later this year. John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Most of my follow-ups have been asked, but I'll ask this one. What about surgical volumes. Gary asked about same-store ER volumes, but what about surgical volumes in the quarter? Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, so I think our inpatient surgical volumes in particular were strong, and you're generally tracked sort of inpatient admissions, that is they're growing in that kind of 2% to 3% range. Outpatient balances around a little bit more just because there's a ton of really low acuity outpatient procedures initiative sometimes, be up or down. But I think our overall surgical procedures have been pretty much tracking our admission volumes. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hi good morning. So I have a more strategic question for you. When I look at your stock performance over the long-term, obviously, it's been great. But it's been a rough two years for shareholders since you've been having these issues in the behavioral segment. I think we're really going on the tenth quarter of underperformance. So for shareholders and analysts who are really stuck while you are fixing these issues, at what point do you look at the share performance over the past two years and decide, need to unlock the value of the company because I would argue this company has a lot of value. Your acute care business is doing really well, you're under-levered, you generate quick cash. And although, behavioral's underperformance, it's still a great business. But the stock doesn't, I guess reflect that reality. So I guess, what are your thoughts on that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So Ann, I don't think we necessarily disagree with your observation. I think, as operators, I think our priorities are to address the issues in the business that have created some of the underperformance in a pretty difficult environment over the last couple of years. I feel like we've made a lot of progress in that regard. It has been and I think we can see a little bit longer slog, a little bit slower than we originally envisioned. But I think we feel like we are making real progress and then ultimately, those improved results will sort of trigger the kind of evaluation performance that you're suggesting, you would hope to see. I think in addition to that, we have been an active acquirer. We're on shares. I suggest that before I think sort of prudent reasons than current reasons, we've kind of put a pause on that, but we have every intention and expectation that we can do that and we'll do that again in the future. And I think, from our perspective, those are the two most important things that we're going to do which is continue to really focus on improving the operational metrics that we think are within our control. And again, I think we feel like we've done a lot of that, and I think we feel like it's going to start to pay bigger dividends, not to use that phrase necessarily. But \u2013 and then secondly, we're going to try and deploy capital in the most efficient way that we can, but would really love to get to the other side of this government investigation before we do that in a significant way. Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And then I'm sorry, if I missed this, but I know cash flow you talked about in the press release, but your expectation is for cash flow to grow this year, correct? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I think our expectation is that cash flows should grow largely the same way that EBITDA grows ultimately for the year. Ann Kathleen Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just wanted to squeeze one quick one here. The other operating expense line was pretty well controlled in both segments. Can you just talk about the drivers of the sustainability of that and whether that line includes health plan earnings as kind of a contra expense just for the models here? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yes. So, second part of your sort of question or suggestion, Steve, is correct. So when I talk particularly on the acute side about reduction in premium revenue on the health plan, there's a concurrent and commensurate reduction in medical loss payments and that gets recorded in our other operating expense, to fetch that line as well. But also generally, that other operating expense line in both of the businesses tends to be where most of the fixed and semi-fixed costs reside, so they tend not to be as volatile as some of the salary and supply numbers. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : That is all the questions at this time. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Okay, we thank everybody for their time, and look forward to speaking again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC Ann Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Kristy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2018 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you, Kristy. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018. During this conference call Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections, and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.39 for the quarter. After adjusting for the unfavorable $7.2 million after-tax impact from the increase in our reserve related to the Department of Justice discussions as discussed in our press release and calculated on the Supplemental Schedule, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $233.3 million or $2.47 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2018. This compares to $188.1 million or $1.94 per diluted share of adjusted net income attributable to UHS during the second quarter of last year as calculated on the Supplemental Schedule. On a same-facility basis, in our Acute division revenues during the second quarter of 2018 increased 3.3% over last year's comparable quarter. Excluding our health plan, same-facility revenues increased 5.1%. The increase resulted primarily from a 1.9% increase in adjusted admissions and a 3.1% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 2.8% during the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the second quarter of 2017. Excluding the health plan in the Behavioral division, same-facility revenues increased 3.3%. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.2% and adjusted patient days increased 0.3%. Revenue per adjusted admission increased 2.0% and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.6% during the second quarter of 2018 over the comparable prior year quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 our net cash provided by operating activities increased to $629 million from $534 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2017. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 53 days during the second quarter of 2018 as compared to 51 days during the second quarter of 2017. At June 30, 2018 our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 42.9% as compared to 46.1% at June 30, 2017. We spent $181 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2018 and $370 million during the first six months of 2018. Year-to-date, we have added 52 new acute care beds and 313 new beds to our busiest behavioral health hospitals. Our behavioral health integrations joint venture pipeline is very strong with a large number of active discussions ongoing. Earlier this month we opened the 126-bed Lancaster Behavioral Hospital, a joint venture with Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. And later in the year we'll open a 100-bed hospital in Spokane, Washington, a behavioral joint venture with Providence Health System. In conjunction with our stock repurchase program, during the second quarter of 2018 we repurchased approximately 1.12 million shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $130 million or approximately $116 per share. Since inception of the program through June 30, 2018 we repurchased approximately 8.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $971 million or approximately $114 per share. Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just a detailed question first. You have this $15.3 million other income item now. You haven't had that line before and I think some of it's related to accounting change. How should we think about those items in there in trying to compare your operating income with prior periods and what you've talked about in terms of guidance and so forth? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Okay, A.J. So I think there's really two kinds of items on that line. The first as we disclosed in the third paragraph of the press release is an unrealized gain on the change in market value of certain marketable securities; essentially our investment in our group purchasing organization, Premier, and the shares that we own in Premier. We would presume that \u2013 because I think it's impossible for us to predict that change in those marketable securities \u2013 we'll never include that number in our own guidance. And to the degree that it's material, we'll call it out so that people can exclude it whether positive or negative. Obviously it was positive this particular quarter. The rest of what's in that line are income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, miscellaneous gains and losses from the sale of assets, et cetera. We believe they're sort of the normal non-recurring source of things that in the past would've been included in our EBITDA and suggest that that's the appropriate way to continue to think about that moving forward. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then let me just ask you about where you feel you are on the rebound in the Behavioral Health business. I know over time you have highlighted I guess over the last couple of years labor challenges, obviously dealing with managed Medicaid and the fact that they've become a bigger chunk of the payor mix in Behavioral, and then there was a couple of isolated situations that you've addressed in the first quarter. Where are we at? I know the goal is to get back \u2013 I think the goal is to get back to 4% to 6% sort of same-store revenue growth on a steady basis. Can you just sort of update us on those areas and what's your confidence level to getting back to that in the back half of the year? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure. And to some degree, A.J., I think that the metrics that I mentioned in my opening comments provide a reasonable sort of overview to where we are with this. The encouraging development from our perspective in the Behavioral Health division is over the last couple of quarters our revenue per patient day has been higher than we anticipated. We, originally in our initial guidance for the year, talked about that number being in the 1% to 2% range and it's been in the 3% to 4% range over the last couple of quarters. And I think that's reflective of the success that we've had in a number of initiatives, including continuing the shift of patients out of our residential beds and into our acute behavioral beds which are a higher paying and higher revenue service. I think that that higher revenue per day growth reflects progress that we've made with our managed care and insurance companies in things like reducing denials, et cetera, which has the impact of raising that revenue growth number. So that's a plus for us. We're sort of exceeding our expectations there. Obviously the negative for us is that patient days are relatively flat in the quarter compared to last year. Even though admissions are growing, we continue to see length of stay pressure. The length of stay pressure as I think we've discussed for any number of quarters now mostly comes from the continued shift of Medicaid patients, traditional fee-for-service Medicaid patients, into some sort of managed Medicaid program where we generally find the payors are more aggressive about utilization review, et cetera. We continue to, where it's appropriate clinically, to pushback on our managed care payors. But to be fair, I think as long as that shift from traditional Medicaid to managed Medicaid continues to take place, we're going to face that phenomenon. Now it's worth noting that about two-thirds of our Medicaid patients today are already in a managed program, so there's a limited amount of that shift that remains but it will be somewhat of a challenge. I think the opportunity for us really remains on that admission metric which grew by a little less than 1.5% this quarter. I think we continue to believe that the demand that we see in our facilities is sufficient enough to drive that number measurably higher. The main thing that we have to do is make sure that our available beds are appropriately staffed with nurses and psychiatrists; that's been the biggest challenge. In some cases we're building new capacity to accommodate that demand, and in some other cases we're evaluating the clinical criteria that our hospitals have used for admitting patients because I think we feel like in some cases patients are being turned away who really do meet the appropriate clinical criteria. So we're focused on all those things. We feel like we've made progress on a number of them and I think it's reflected in that revenue number. But we're the first to admit that it's been a tough slog. There's a lot of moving parts. We feel like we've made progress. We feel like the demand is there and that we're going to continue to make progress. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And just in terms of stepping up in the back half of the year, I think the comps get a little easier and some other things. Do you still feel like you'll do that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think our original guidance contemplated that our Behavioral Health revenue would continue to grow in the back half of the year, and we're not adjusting our guidance so we continue to believe that that is correct. And we are aided by the fact as you articulated that the comparisons, particularly for our behavioral health facilities, will get easier in the back half of the year, and also we had a number of unfavorable non-recurring items in the back half of 2017 which, by definition, we presume will not reoccur in 2018. A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Thanks. Steve, maybe just to follow-up on that last question. It sounds like you guys are confirming guidance here, but obviously there's a decent ramp embedded in that guidance now that you've reported the first half of the year. And I heard easier comps but maybe if you could just give us a little bit more color on what gives you the confidence that the trends will improve. And maybe you could spike out a couple of those unfavorable second half 2017 items just so we get a perspective on magnitude. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure, Josh. I think it's worth noting we talked a little bit about this in Q1. In Q1 we talked about the fact that UHS's own internal budget or guidance was somewhat lower than the Street, and that later in the year that would turn around because for the full year our internal budget seem to be pretty consistent with the Street consensus numbers. I think for the first six months our results are pretty much in line with expectations. So while I acknowledge your observation that the guidance includes a relatively significant ramp in earnings particularly for the Behavioral business in the second half of the year, I will say that was what we originally contemplated and that really hasn't changed. And I will reconfirm, again, what you're suggesting which is that we are not changing our guidance at all this quarter. As far as those non-recurring items, again, those were all in our press releases and publicly discussed last year so you can go back and see them in detail. But I believe that for the most part they centered around negative headwinds from hurricanes in the third quarter last year that affected both our Acute and Behavioral businesses, and then what we've described or I described as sort of regulatory-challenged facilities in the Behavioral division that ultimately there were three facilities that we talked about, two of them have ultimately closed and one has been downsized. So the significant decline in revenues and profitability that we experienced in the back half of last year obviously will not reoccur in the back half of this year. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Got you. So those were non-recurring but those were actually included in your adjusted earnings. You just spiked them out, you're saying. Got you. And then just a last question. It sounds like there's \u2013 I don't know if there's a little more progress or not on the settlement. Obviously the reserve changed there so probably indicative of at least some conversations. But more importantly, is the settlement an overhang in any way? From a capital deployment perspective, do you think about share buybacks or even M&A differently as you're waiting for some further guidance from the government and/or a final settlement? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So just to make some further commentary which I think is largely consistent with what we've said about the process, we've said for now several quarters that we certainly feel like we're in a settlement phase with the government. We're discussing the settlement terms, we're making offers and counter-offers, and they're making demands and counter-demands. Having said that, I think I've acknowledged every time I speak about this that it is a relatively slow pace, probably slower than certainly than we would like, and there's not a whole lot we can do about that. We move largely at the government's pace but the process of offers and counter-offers and demands and counter-demands continues. We still hope that there's a relatively near-term resolution to this, and hopefully by the end of this year, but that's certainly not a certainty. And again, I think we're doing everything we can to keep this moving along apace. I think your second question about to what degree it's an overhang, I don't think \u2013 and particularly I think as the discussions continue and obviously the potential magnitude of the settlement tends to narrow, I don't think it's had much effect, if any, on our willingness to invest, whether that's internal capital or external uses of capital, acquisitions or share buybacks. Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC : Perfect. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. I'd like to move to the Acute Care side of the business. Looks like the seasonal drop off was a little bit worse this quarter coming from 1Q down to 2Q with margins deteriorating a little more than we've seen in the past. Would you say that was more pressure on admissions and your staffing levels were too high or do you think there was something else going on in that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So I think, Peter, in both Q1 and Q2 we talked about not only in our 2018 guidance but sort of ours (17:28) kind of sustainable growth rate for the Acute division over the next several years would yield kind of 5% to 6% revenue growth and comparable maybe 6% to 7% EBITDA growth. The 5% to 6% revenue growth numbers we've hit in Q1 and Q2. I think what you're alluding to is that EBITDA growth and profitability was a little bit lighter than we expected although I think, again, our own internal expectations seem to be lower than the Street's and then think in part we were acknowledging that particularly in Q2 we had a pretty tough comparison not only to last year but I think to a couple years of very robust growth, both revenue-wise and profitability-wise in the Acute business, and some slowing. I think we've also found over the last several years even though the trajectory of the Acute business has generally been rather positive and pretty robust, there's a little more volatility in that business I think than we have found in the Behavioral business. And so I think we largely attribute the second quarter lightness and the margin contraction sequentially to just some of that intra-quarter volatility in that. I think our point of view is still that over time if we can grow that business 5% to 6% at the revenue line that EBITDA growth in the 6% to 7% range should follow. Even though we didn't hit those numbers exactly in Q2, I think we think that over time, and I think if you go back and you look at our performance over time you'll see that that's true. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then do you have any comments on the M&A environment right now in the acute care space? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: We continue to look at acute care opportunities really that span the gamut of whole hospital and whole system acquisitions, the expansion of ambulatory care capabilities. We have a pretty aggressive program of our own development of freestanding emergency departments in some geographies, et cetera. I think what we're finding on the acute side is that there have been a fair amount of not-for-profits and not-for-profit transactions. I hesitate to describe them as acquisitions because I think a lot of them are just kind of merged assets, but I think that has limited some of the opportunity. But we continue to find not-for-profit hospital systems which I think are, from our perspective, the most sort of target-rich assets that we look at. Yeah, there are a number in the pipeline and we continue to evaluate them. And in the meantime, I think as we've stressed a lot over the last several years, we continue to invest very heavily in our own facilities. We tend to talk on this call about the new hospitals that we've opened in Las Vegas and Henderson and in Riverside County, California. But in the back half of this year we're opening quite a bit of new capacity, not quite at the same levels of magnitude, but new beds, new emergency room capacity, new surgical capacity in Las Vegas and several of our hospitals in California, in the North Dallas market in Texas. So while there hasn't been as much of an opportunity for external M&A, we still are finding quite a bit of opportunity to enhance and expand our own franchises through organic CapEx. Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, I think you mentioned looking for sort of an acceleration in the Behavioral same-store revenue growth number in 2Q to instill confidence in that 5% target, and I think the timeline there most recently was sort of 3Q. I'm sort of curious how you're thinking about that level now as well as when you think it's reasonable to underwrite a return there. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I mean I think one of the challenges that we've had, Steve, is that we saw this slowdown in our Behavioral revenue growth really begin in the back half of 2015, and we attributed most of that slowdown to a labor shortage of particularly nurses but, to a lesser degree, psychiatrists. And I would say for about a year we focused on that and really kind of redid a lot of our infrastructure to be able to better address the shortage. And I think beginning in the back half of 2016 we began to make measurable progress and both our volumes and our revenues began to increase. As we sort of projected how that would continue to play out, we tended to project that as sort of a ratable increase. The reality is the business doesn't necessarily work that way and the recovery has been somewhat choppier and, to be fair, somewhat slower than we originally imagined as well. We still think that that 5% target is reasonable, that 5% revenue growth target is reasonable. We still have it out there for the back half of the year. It's part of our guidance and I think we presume that we can get there or get pretty close. But we acknowledge that it's a bit choppy. And again, I think as I sort of commented on in responding to A.J.'s original question, we find that we're making progress in some areas like the shift of services from residential to acute and reduction in denials, but in others and solving the labor shortages is a bit more problematic than we thought. But we think we're continuing to make progress and feel like that 5% target is still reasonable. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And I guess just thinking about the Behavioral business overall, can you remind us what percent of admissions come from acute referrals? And I know you said the mix of Medicaid has been rising in that, but what about the pace of growth and the total number of referrals system-wide? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So I think our Acute Behavioral business which is about 75% of our revenues in that space, historically somewhere in the 35 to 40% range of our admissions tend to come from acute care hospital emergency rooms. It's still probably our single largest source of behavioral patient referrals that can vary by geography, it can vary by hospital, it can vary by program. But order of magnitude, that's I think a good indicator. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And the pace of growth, is it changing? Do you think the DOJ investigation is affecting the referrals at all on any level or no? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Look, I think that's always difficult to determine with absolute precision. But over the last several years we, the management team here, I think talks to our operators in the field quite a bit. And as they describe challenges to us, things like the nursing shortage, et cetera, and potentially other challenges that we've talked about in various of our calls, the government investigation really never comes up. I'm of a mind that the people who are aware of our government investigation are people who read our 10-Qs and 10-Ks. And while we spend a lot of time preparing those and writing those, there's a pretty small audience for them. And I think in the sort of broad behavioral operational landscape, there's not a whole lot of people who are terribly familiar with that. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood, and maybe just a last maintenance one, a follow-up on A.J.'s question on the add backs. If I think about that $15.3 million, it seems like the marketable securities, just the changes in the value there, $8 million in that third paragraph that you referenced which implies there's about $7.3 million of items that you suggested would normally have been I guess in the reported adjusted EBITDA less NCI number, is that the right way to think about that? And maybe if you'd give us some more color on the nature of the $7.3 million of earnings, what exactly those are and how that amount compares to the prior year, that would be helpful. And then I'll yield. Thanks a lot. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. So what I said I think before, Steve, was I think what's in that number is quite frankly a bunch of small miscellaneous items that include income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, gains and losses on small asset sales, et cetera. We didn't go back quite frankly to recapture the prior year number in part because the accounting sort of perspective was we were not going to restate the prior year for that. But I think as we looked at those various items that are included in the balance of I'll call the non-Premier items on that other income line, our general view was that those are items that will kind of normally be there, they'd be largely recurring, and they historically have been part of our reported EBITDA. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Good morning. First question just obviously, Steve, a lot of focus on guidance. Can you tell us if the Behavioral business stays in that 3% to 4% range in same-store? What I'm mathing to is if Acute does 5% then the one-timers reverse themselves, which they should, you end up at about in the range of the low-end of EBITDA. Is that the right way to think about it? And then anything above the low end would be driven by Behavioral getting better? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's generally fair. I mean I will say that the Behavioral I think EBITDA performance in Q2 was probably better than expected in part because a larger component of that revenue growth came from the pricing side of things, and sort of by definition the pricing side of things doesn't have an associated sort of incremental cost to it. So if we can continue to make progress on that front, I think that's helpful, et cetera. But I think if I get the question that you're asking, Justin, is if we can't get the Behavioral revenues to grow in the way that we expected in our original guidance, it certainly would be tough to get to the high end of our guidance in the back half of the year. We're not certainly conceding that at this point, but I think it's a fair statement. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. And then, Steve, your depreciation number was a little bit lower than I expected. Was there any kind of change in accounting there or anything driving that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I can't think of anything material, Justin. I will certainly go back and look at the detail. Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. Can you remind us maybe just the math behind some of those one-time items and comp issues were in the back half of last year? So if you don't actually show any improvement but just the one-time issues abate, how much should that be a tailwind to volumes in the second half of the year? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, Kevin. I mean I'm going to do this a little bit from memory. I don't have them in front of me and all those items were very publicly reported so they're available to everybody. But I think in the third and fourth quarters of last year we had a drag from the hurricane in the two divisions that I think probably totaled in the kind of $15 million to $18 million range, and then the losses and additional expenses from the three regulatory-challenged facilities in the Behavioral business which I think were another sort of $10 million to $15 million, so I think somewhere in that $25 million to $30 million range in total. But again, I make the point that those items were all disclosed and very publicly discussed so they're all out there for people to see. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'm sorry. I guess I was actually kind of more interested from like a same-store revenue perspective I guess when you think about achieving that 5% number because people seem to be focused on that as much as the EBITDA number itself. Is it 100 basis points to same-store revenue growth or is there a ballpark number for that? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So I think when we talk about getting back to that same-store growth level, we're really viewing those items as discreet from that. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, so it's not a situation. So those were one-time headwinds last year, so the fact that there's an easy comp you still think 5% on a run rate basis, not just from an easy comp is the right way to think about it? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So when I say there's an easy comp, I'm just referring to sort of the core business, not to those non-recurring items. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then you mentioned that the challenge has been to kind of make sure that your beds are staffed and that you're adding beds in the places where there's capacity issues. Can you give a little commentary on kind of where we are in that process? How much of a challenge is that still? How close are you to kind of fully getting over that hump? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I think, look, the challenge in describing it \u2013 and look, I understand when people question and try and get a sense of this issue, they tend to view it in sort of a linear fashion that it's kind of an issue that we have X number of vacancies and that represents Y percentage of our total labor slots, and we filled so many of them and so we've made this much progress. But the reality is particularly in an industry like ours that has such high turnover rates, I think nursing turnover nationally in the U.S. is in the 30% range, the issue is we hire nurses, nurses leave; we hire psychiatrists, psychiatrists leave. We sort of solve the labor problem in a hospital and we don't have any sort of restriction on bed capacity in that hospital, and then the issue arises at another hospital in another market. It has always remained throughout this I think a relatively small number of markets and small number of hospitals that have been affected. But to be fair, part of the challenge is we'll solve the problem at two hospitals and it'll arise at another hospital, et cetera. So that's part of the reason it's been sort of a slower recovery. But I find it difficult to sort of be able to quantify kind of in a percentage way or something like that how much progress we've made and how much is left to go. I guess what I always point to \u2013 and by the way, I do this internally as well \u2013 is I just focus people on the level of revenue growth because in my mind ultimately that's how the progress is measured. A problem manifested itself in a slowdown in our revenue growth, and in my mind it will be completely fixed when we recover that level of revenue growth. So while I think there are metrics and measurements that you can use to sort of help define your progress \u2013 number of vacancies, turnover rate, number of people in orientation; all those sorts of things which we get internally \u2013 I think ultimately our main focus continues to be on that revenue growth metric. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. No, I think that it wasn't fair for us to judge you on that as whether you're making progress. But I guess from a forward-looking perspective, it seems like staffing is a potentially gating factor so progress on that would be a leading indicator towards achieving that revenue number. I think maybe just last question on this topic would just be that I think people think that the labor market is getting tighter and that staffing is getting more difficult. Do you just feel I guess anecdotally or directionally that staffing is actually normalizing or stabilizing in some way for you versus where it's been in the last couple of years? Is it the same? Is it getting worse? I guess anecdotally, what does that look like? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think, Kevin, we have a point of view. As I said, I think the labor challenges really started to manifest themselves, by the way, in both divisions in kind of the back half of 2015, and we've been very focused again in both divisions on addressing them. I think our sense is they have generally stabilized now that we're a couple years into it. But having said that, I think we acknowledge we're in a very tight labor market. As a nation, we're at the lowest unemployment rates we've seen in 20 or 30 years depending on exactly who is quoting that. So I think it's going to continue to be a challenge but certainly I think we feel like it's stabilized, not getting worse, and we continue to make progress although it's incremental. Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to jump to the Acute Care side. Your organic revenue slowed a little bit. Still the 5% top line number that you talked about I think is still a good number. But the EBITDA up only sort of low single digits. Is there anything to sort of call out on why you didn't see better pull-through? I think you've been seeing pretty hefty EBITDA growth on pretty stable sort of top line. So just any color there, Steve. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think, Ralph, this is largely the question that Peter Costa asked earlier. As I said then, and so I'll just quickly repeat, I think that the Acute, the pull-through of EBITDA is a little bit more sort of volatile and erratic than it is on the Behavioral side. There was nothing I think extraordinary in Q2. I think our point of view is that over time that 5 or 6% revenue growth will yield 6 or 7% EBITDA growth. I think our historical performance supports that, but in my mind there was nothing extraordinary in the quarter. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right, fair enough. I mean a part of it is just I mean the pricing number did look pretty good and better than what you had in the past that I thought would just pull it through. But on that topic a little bit, on the acuity side that's been a sort of topic of focus. Can you just give us maybe acuity mix in the quarter, maybe how much that helped the pricing stat? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think that obviously the entire acute public company sort of universe was strong in Q1 and it seemed to be strong for at least HCA in Q2 and continues be strong for us. Now I will say that our revenue per unit has been relatively strong, although I think we've talked a lot about in 2017 that I think some of that was due to more inpatient admissions and fewer observation patients, and I think we still are benefiting from that to a degree. I think generally the industry is also benefiting from kind of a stabilization. We've all been focused on this sort of trend of moving the lower acuity outpatient procedures out of the inpatient setting and into other outpatient settings, either in the hospital or out of the hospital, and I think that's hurt acuity over the last several years. But I think we've seen kind of a stabilization and a bottoming out of that trend, so I think that's helping acuity as well. So I think we're benefiting from that. It's difficult for me to say that our peers are benefiting in the same way, but it just seems like the numbers across the industry are reasonably consistent, so I would guess that we're all benefiting in the same way. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. And then just last one from me. Can you just give us a sense of payor mix in the quarter and specific focus on the managed care side? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. Our payor mix has actually been \u2013 and again, I'm answering this question. I think for the Acute business, Ralph... Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: ...our payor mix in the Acute business has been relatively stable over the last several quarters, meaning probably Medicare is growing faster than any of our other payor mixes. Medicaid is growing but at a slower rate. Commercial is still positive but at a lower rate than our overall admissions. And uncompensated admissions have remained pretty flat for the last few quarters. Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank, your line is open. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, sorry about that. Actually I wanted to talk a little bit on the Acute side. I don't know if you discussed this yet, but I wanted to talk about or get some updates on looking at surgical volumes both inpatient and outpatient and then also ED. Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Frank, I didn't hear the very last thing you said. Surgical volumes and what? Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, surgical volumes both in and outpatient as well as ED volumes or emergency department volumes. Thanks. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Okay, sure. So I think on the ED volume side, and again the trends that I'm about to describe I think have been in place for several quarters, I don't think there was anything kind of terribly new or different in Q2. ED volumes have slowed down a little bit. They're actually I think rising slower than our overall admission growth. They've been pretty flat actually I think in the last couple of quarters. So I think it's reflective of the fact that we're seeing a little bit what I was describing to Ralph in the previous question. More of those lower acuity emergency room patients are being shifted into other settings, whether that's urgent care or freestanding EDs or doctor's offices, whatever it may be. And so we see our emergency room visits have kind of flattened out, although our admissions and the amount of business that we're getting in terms of inpatient admissions from the emergency room has not really changed which I think is reflective of the fact that those more acute ER visits remain at the same level. Surgical volumes are fairly consistent with our overall admissions. I think in Q2 both in and outpatient volumes for us were up 3% or 4% which also, sort of in reference to Ralph's previous question, are keeping that acuity number and revenue per unit number strong. So I think we continue to see relatively strong surgical volumes throughout the portfolio. Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Yeah, just sticking with the Acute side of it. Looking at what HCA was saying yesterday about the Department of Labor survey and how in their markets they're beginning to see accelerating commercial volumes probably because there's a higher rate of insurance even on the smaller employers. As you kind of look at your markets, and Vegas has been a very good market for you for a while, I mean do you think that that's impacting somewhat of a slowdown on admissions because it's more late cycle perhaps and the recovery was sooner than in the other parts of the southwest and southeast? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: So I'll try and answer your question and I will sort of provide one caveat which is the day before we announce earnings we don't get to spend a lot of time looking at our peers' earnings releases and analyzing their numbers. So you referenced their Department of Labor comments. I'm sort of at a loss. I don't know what they said so it's difficult. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : No. All they said was, and you don't need to \u2013 I haven't gone in detail through that survey either. Just all it said was I believe that unemployment going down in their view might be finally driving some of the, as I understood, some of the commercial volume pickup, payor mix pickup. And they talked a lot about Texas and Florida and I was just trying to compare that to the timing of the cycle in Vegas versus their markets. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah, and I think you make an important point. By the way, we were pleased by the HCA results. We like to see our peers doing well. I think it's reflective of the underlying strength of the acute care business particularly for companies that have strong franchises in robust markets. But I will say one of the challenges for us is those kinds of numbers that were in the HCA second quarter release were numbers that our Acute Care division has been putting up in a number of quarters over the last several years. And one of the challenges that we face is those comparisons have become more and more difficult for us. So when we started to put up really strong numbers Las Vegas and California and to a lesser degree Florida, but at the end of 2013 and into 2014 and 2015 we're into sort of the fourth or fifth year of that recovery in our end markets. And so I just think that comparison is a little more challenging for us. But again, I think to the degree that any of our peers are experiencing those underlying strong metrics, that's a good sign for us. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : No, fair enough. Your comps are definitely getting more challenging. The other driver I think that's being mentioned just more broadly is about mix shifting to lower cost sites of service, and that's what's driving potentially the higher pricing growth in the inpatient setting and so on. So are you observing that and is that part of the higher 3% to 4% kind of pricing growth at this point? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Sure. I mean I think you make the right point, and that is if we acknowledge \u2013 which I think we all do \u2013 that lower acuity business has been shifted out of the acute care hospitals into a whole variety of other lower cost and lower care settings, whether they're ambulatory surgery centers or freestanding EDs or urgent care centers, then by definition what's left in the acute hospital is the more acute, the more severely ill patient. And I think you would expect that acuity measures or revenue per unit measures would be going up which I think is what we've seen certainly in the first six months of 2018. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And then just following up on that with CMS. And you may not have \u2013 obviously with your earnings today \u2013 they put out the rule yesterday around site neutrality and they seem to be trying to, it feels like, foster, serve clinical care in lower cost sites of service, physician clinics, and away from outpatient. I mean is that impactful broadly for the hospital industry? They also did a small change on new drugs for AWP plus 6% going to AWP plus 3% to maybe discourage physicians from adopting drugs outside of clinical efficacy and safety. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. So I mean I'm going to make a little bit of a repeat comment as before. So when CMS releases a several hundred page new rule on the night we're releasing earnings, we don't get to study it a whole lot. My sense, in looking at it very quickly, is that we're largely unaffected by the sort of site changes. We'll say more about that as we have a chance to look at it. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : And then one final one on Behavioral, if I could. The IMD exclusion at one time was viewed as a fairly big tailwind to behavioral, the talk about acute JVs. And then the contracts haven't fully materialized and/or the acute hospitals may be preferentially driving less attractive payor mix, Medicaid or the like into freestanding. Any comments on that and is that likely to at some point become the premise is going to be realized? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I think that the original premise of the IMD exclusion being lifted and that being a significant benefit to the freestanding behavioral industry was valid and I think still is valid. I think that the practical challenge that we didn't necessarily anticipate at the time was that exclusion got lifted at a time when we were already having difficulty satisfying the existing demand that we had for our beds largely because we didn't necessarily in some markets have a sufficient number of clinical staff. And so all of a sudden we got an uptick and an upsurge in adult Medicaid business that we had never had before, but the difference was in this interim period this incremental adult Medicaid business proved to be not really incremental but it wound up squeezing out or pushing out other better paying, better revenue business, Medicare or commercial. I think over time as we continue to solve the labor problem that incremental business will truly become that incremental business and it will be as profitable as we once originally imagined. And then secondly which I think is a different issue, as you point out we couldn't be having these dozens of discussions about potential joint venture arrangements and integration arrangements with acute care hospitals unless the exclusion had been lifted because there would be this sort of awkward disconnect of a good chunk of their patients were adult Medicaid and we couldn't treat them. So having the IMD exclusion being lifted was I think a significant tailwind to these integration conversations which I think over time over the next several years will wind up being a very significant development opportunity for our Behavioral business. Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC : Yeah, makes sense. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I feel like I'm really beating a dead horse at this point so I'll be really quick. Just going back to, and I'm sorry, the other income, the $15.3 million Steve, just to be clear. So the $7.3 million that you said was kind of normal recurring noise, miscellaneous items, given the new accounting treatment and the way you're breaking out this line now, I mean you're basically saying you would expect to have a few million, several million positive gain on a go-forward basis as you're reporting on that line, right? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, again, I think to the degree that some of the items are truly recurring, income from unconsolidated subs, and I think honestly the way we'll address this issue next year, Gary, is we'll just create an income from unconsolidated subs line to make that a little bit more straightforward. But yeah, I mean, again, the incremental gains and losses could bounce around. But again, I don't think that they're going to have a material impact. We wouldn't expect that. I mean that's the nature on sort of these miscellaneous items. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just going back to seasonality for one moment in the second half on Acute. I want to make sure we're on the same page because you've made a few comments about seasonality. So if we think about Acute EBITDA for the third quarter, obviously you had the hurricane impact that was modest and the year-to-year EBITDA growth comp is easier. So as we see and hear today, we would think perhaps the year-to-year growth might accelerate. But then as you go into the fourth quarter, it was a really big EBITDA quarter in Acute. You had California provider tax, you had some health plans improving, you had the flu incident, et cetera, that would seem to be a more challenging quarter for Acute EBITDA growth. Am I just thinking about the Acute seasonality correctly? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Yeah. I think all those comments, Gary, are perfectly valid. I think my comments about the easier comparisons in the back half of the year earlier in the call was really \u2013 or I meant it to be specific to the Behavioral business, not to the Acute business. So again, and I think the way you described it is correct. I think the third quarter comparison for the Acute business is not too bad but the fourth quarter was a real bang-up quarter largely because of the real busy flu season and some other issues. And again, I think we've incorporated that into our own guidance. Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hi. I just want to follow-up on your comments about IMD and the JV opportunity. I know for the past couple of years we've been talking about it, and in your prepared remarks you talked about you have some things in the hopper. But I guess when will we see these coming to fruition again? Do you think that maybe the DOJ overhang, does that impact some negotiations at all or it really doesn't? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: No. I mean, again, because, Ann, these negotiations tend to be with large not-for-profit hospitals or not-for-profit hospital systems, and to be fair these negotiations about joint venturing their behavioral business are not necessarily their top priority. They tend to be slow, they tend to move at kind of a slower pace than I think we're accustomed in the for-profit industry. I don't know that any of our peers are closing these kinds of transactions any faster than we are. But what we are encouraged by is the general enthusiasm of the acute hospitals that we're talking to about pursuing these sort of arrangements. And as I did say in my comments, we just opened a hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania last month. We're going to open one in a few months in Spokane, Washington. Obviously where we're building new capacity that takes some time, so there is a bit of a ramp-up here. But I think from our perspective \u2013 and again, I think these are two different issues \u2013 the original premise of the IMD exclusion being lifted was there would be this surge of adult Medicaid patients, and that would be an immediate benefit. And I think to some degree we've clearly seen that surge of patients, although as I said I think in some cases they've been more replacement patients than new and until we solve that problem we won't really get the benefit. But I think those acute joint venture conversations we always perceived was a longer-term development opportunity and something that I think we feel like we'll be seeing the benefit of not just in 2019 but over the course of the next three, five, seven years as more and more of these transactions or arrangements are brought to fruition and new capacity is built and these arrangements are finalized. Ann Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Okay, thanks. And then just on Behavioral, I know the Boston market has been a very tough market for you guys and has weighed on the overall growth. Is that still the case? I know you closed a hospital. But regardless of that hospital, is it a market that still weighs on the overall growth and maybe the rest of the portfolio is growing more than the consolidated? Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: I mean generally the Behavioral portfolio is more diffused and sort of geographically disparate than the Acute portfolio, so it is almost impossible for one single market in the Behavioral portfolio to really have the influence that the obvious example of Las Vegas does on the Acute side. Having said that, I mean I think your commentary about the Boston market is fair. We run hospitals in the Boston market that are very highly occupied. We run it at very high occupancy rates, but there's a big chunk of managed Medicaid and we've had managed Medicaid business in the Boston market for years and years and years. It's a pretty low Medicaid rate so the profitability is going to be challenged in that market, et cetera. It's a big market for us. It's one of our bigger markets. It's not by any means our most profitable market, but I don't think the change in that market, as I would say the change in any of our markets, really drives the portfolio results in a meaningful way. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : There are no more questions at this time. Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.: Kristy, I just want to go back to one question we had earlier. Justin Lake had asked me a question about the decline in depreciation. And as I have a chance to look at it, I can see that I think the dynamic that he's referring to is we had depreciation and amortization associated with our electronic health records deal in the second quarter of last year. Several million dollars that has now become fully depreciated so we don't have it this year. So I just wanted to close the loop on that one question. Otherwise, we thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jessa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UHS Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  Thank you. Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Thank you, Jessa. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to walk this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2018.  During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections, and forward-looking statements.  For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, our reported net income attributable to UHS during the third quarter of 2018 was $171.7 million or $1.84 per diluted share as compared to $141.2 million or $1.47 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2017.  As calculated on the Supplemental Schedule, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS was during the third quarter of 2018 was $200.8 million or $2.23 per diluted share as compared to $143.4 million or $1.49 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.  Excluded from our adjusted net income during the third quarter of 2018 was an unfavorable after-tax impact of $37.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share substantially all of which related to an increase in the reserve recorded in connection with our ongoing discussions with the Department of Justice as discussed in our press release.  On a same-facility basis, in our Acute division, revenues during the third quarter of 2018 increased 6.7% over last year's comparable quarter. Excluding the health plan, same-facility revenues increased 8.1%. The increased revenues resulted primarily from a 1.5% increase in adjusted admissions and a 6.6% increase in revenue per adjusted admission.  On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 2.5% during the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the third quarter of 2017. During this year's third quarter, as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our Behavioral Health facilities owned for more than a year increased 4.7% and adjusted patient days increased 0.6%.  Revenue per adjusted admission decreased 1.9% and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.1% during the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine months of 2018, we are narrowing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9.25 to $9.60 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $9.25 to $9.90 per diluted share.  This provides estimated guidance range which excludes the favorable impact of the reserve established in the unfavorable impact of the reserve established in connection with the civil aspects of the government\u2019s investigation of certain of our Behavioral facilities and also excludes the impact of ASU 2016-09 decreases the upper end of the previously provided range by approximately 3% while the lower end of the range remains unchanged.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our net cash provided by operating activities increased to $975 million from $879 million generated during the comparable nine-month period of 2017. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 54 days during the third quarter of 2018 as compared to 53 days during the third quarter of 2017. At September 30, 2018, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization declined to 42.9% as compared to 45.4% at September 30, 2017. We spent $151 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2018 and $521 million during the first nine months of 2018. Year-to-date, we have added 76 new acute care beds and 313 new beds to our busiest Behavioral Health hospitals.  In addition, earlier this month, we opened the 100 bed Inland Northwest Behavioral Health Hospital a joint venture with Provident Health in Spokane, Washington and next week plan to open the 80 bed Palm Point Behavioral Health Hospital in Titusville, Florida. Our behavioral health integrations, joint venture pipeline is very strong and robust with over 30 active discussions.  In conjunction with our stock repurchase program, during the third quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 940,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $118 million or approximately $125 per share. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2018, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 9.45 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.09 billion or approximately $115 per share. We are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matthew Borsch : Hi, yes, I want to just ask on the behavioral side of the business. If you could talk a little bit about the rates that it looks like there was a little rate pressure or at least maybe the rate due to the rate mix that you are getting was a little over than what we had modeled. Steve Filton : Yes, so, Matt, I am not exactly sure what metrics you are focusing on to arrive at that conclusion. Obviously our revenue per adjusted admission was down 2% in the quarter. But that, I think is a function of reduced length of stay rather than any sort of rate pressure. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Steve Filton : Yes, our revenue per adjusted patient day is up about 2% and honestly that\u2019s kind of at the higher range of our expectation. So, again, that revenue per adjusted admission, I think is a function of length of stay and honestly that was what I think prevented us from \u2013 [Inaudible] the quarter because our overall same-store adjusted admissions on the Behavioral side in Q3 were quite robust, almost 5% and we were pretty encouraged by that number.  But unfortunately, lot of that benefit was mitigated by the length of stay pressure and I think that pressure is largely related to the dynamics that we\u2019ve been discussing for any number of quarters now which is the continued shift of patients from \u2013 for additional Medicare and Medicaid programs to managed Medicare and Medicaid programs mostly on the Medicaid side. Matthew Borsch : Okay. What do you do about that? I mean, is it, does that\u2019s going to be a continuing dynamic obviously? Steve Filton : Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair observation. Obviously, there is not much we can do about that overall shift of patients that\u2019s taking place outside of, sort of our ability to impact. What we are doing, I think is, and have been doing is trying to develop as much non-Medicaid business as we can and also, within all of our payer groups working hard to have the appropriate clinical documentation and appropriate processes, so that, we are getting that the appropriate length of stay as we\u2019ve clinically justified for all of our patients. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Stephen Tanal : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, just following up on that, thinking about the Behavioral segment, obviously, we were sort of hoping you guys will get back to a 5% type same-store revenue number for the segment and it didn\u2019t obviously occur. But the compare did a little easier in Q4. But I guess, just bigger picture, I\u2019d like to know how you are thinking about that revenue target now and what that would mean for the sort of growth algorithm or the EBITDA algorithm as you guys have framed in the past? Steve Filton : Sure, Steve, I mean, look at it, I am sure as you understand, I mean, from our internal perspective, we continue to working terribly focused and disciplined way on improving that behavioral same-store revenue growth dynamic in all the ways that we\u2019ve discussed over the last several quarters.  But, I think we also acknowledge that we\u2019ve created this sort of 5% target and now disappointed a couple of times both sort of internally and externally. So, I think what we have assumed for our fourth quarter guidance is I think largely a repeat of Q3 and relatively flattish behavioral EBITDA in Q4.  And in terms of when we give our 2019 guidance at the end of February, we will give considerable thought to how we are thinking about the trajectory of that revenue growth in the behavioral business.  I think our long-term point of view has not changed at all. I think we think that 5% is a reasonable goal. I think we believe that the underlying demand remains robust. I think we believe that the same-store admission growth metrics in Q3 support that view of the world.  But how quickly we are able to get to that 5% and over what period of time and what the trajectory is, I think at the moment, we are going to take a step back and think about how we establish those targets going forward. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Understood. And just one on the acute side as well. The biggest surprise I think for us certainly was the 6x jump in same-store revenue per adjusted admission and I am trying to think about all the different puts and takes a limelight that would capture.  One of the ones I wanted to ask, we don\u2019t see as much anymore, it\u2019s just in the bad debt front now. What are you seeing there? Was that materially better year-on-year and could that have possibly helped? Steve Filton : So, to your point, I mean, honestly I do think there are a number of kind of puts and takes and dynamics that are pushing that number upward in Q3. The comparison to last year\u2019s third quarter was pretty easy for the acute segment in large part because we had a hurricane impact in Q3 of last year, particularly in our Florida facilities. So that was helpful in the year-over-year comparison.  The continued ramp up of our newer hospital in Las Vegas, the Henderson facility was quite strong in Q3 so that was helpful. And then we had $10 million to $12 million of California UPL, all related to 2018 that we recorded in the third quarter that had we know and everything we knew in Q3, we could have and probably, appropriately would have recorded more ratably over the first three quarters of 2018.  So that made, the first two quarters look a little softer and the third quarter look a little stronger. I think even after you account for all sort of those dynamics, it was still a very strong acute care quarter and we were pleased the question that you ask specifically about bad debt and sort of the amount of uninsured patients.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s having a big impact. I think we found that over the last several quarters our payer mix including the amount of uninsured patients has remained pretty stable. So, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s having a material impact on the revenue growth one way or the other. Stephen Tanal : Perfect, and maybe just one follow-up on that and then \u2013 when we started the year, you were in the three ranges, pretty strong and I\u2019d say I remember correctly you kind of saw at that, you weren\u2019t sure that that sort of level was sustainable or that it looked a little bit high obviously and your peers are doing similar type numbers. How should we think about the sustainability now? Do you feel like there is a better trend here that could carry into 2019? Steve Filton : Yes, and I am guessing Steve, that you are asking about the acute business. Stephen Tanal : Yes. Steve Filton : So, we\u2019ve said for some time that kind of post-ACA benefit and post-economic recovery, we think a reasonable and sustainable model for our acute care business segment is, 5% or 6% revenue growth and 6% or 7% EBITDA growth. I think we find that our acute care results can be a little bit choppier and more volatile.  But I think over time, if you look at the nine months for instance for the nine month results for 2018, I think we are largely hitting those kinds of numbers and I think that that\u2019s our expectation going forward. Q3 was a real solid quarter. We are very pleased with it. But, I think the idea that we can just stay in that sort of growth going forward I think is a bit unrealistic. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice : Hello everyone. Couple questions. First is a follow-up on that comment about the California UPL. So if you had $10 million to $12 million that you accrued in the third quarter, and some of that related to the first two quarters, is it fair to say that roughly $10 million was related to the first two quarters.  And then second, I guess on that, I am assuming that was in your thinking about your original guidance and you just wasn\u2019t clear which quarter it would come in. Is that the way to think about it? Steve Filton : Yes, I think that\u2019s fair, A.J. And yes, I think you are right, I mean, basically two-thirds of the amount related to the first half of the year. A.J. Rice : Okay. Let me go back to the length of stay question, maybe drill down a little bit on that in Behavioral. There is a couple factors I think that are having an impact here. Obviously, we have the easing of the IMD exclusions related to Medicaid, managed care that went effective to summer of 2016, I know not every state, accepted that timeframe to start and then some, it seemed like there was a little bit of a lag into how that rolled out.  But I think that\u2019s affected length of stay, because that\u2019s driven more Medicaid managed care people going away. Then you add some states that really were on a managed Medicaid, but didn\u2019t include Behavioral now decide in the last year or two to include Behavioral, I am assuming that\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on here.  And then the third thing would be, that the same managed care plans might pressure you more on length of stay this year than last year, but you might not have a stable number even with the same plan on a year-to-year basis.  Of those three buckets, can you sort of walk us through where you are at and it seems like at least the first to you ought to anniversary this at some point in the next few quarters. And I wonder if that\u2019s your opinion. Any color on that would be helpful. Steve Filton : I think most of what you said A.J., we would agree with. The IMD, the listing of the IMD exclusion created a kind of bolus and an incremental increase in managed Medicaid patients. But there is just naturally as well as continued shift in various states from traditional Medicaid programs to managed Medicaid programs. And, we have said consistently that, our managed Medicaid and it\u2019s equally true honestly of our managed Medicare population tends to have a shorter length of stay than the traditional corresponding population, not surprisingly the managed payers just tend to manage utilization and particularly length of stay more aggressively than the traditional programs did.  And I think, I would also agree with your comment that there is a natural sort of floor to the length of stay as a result of those issues and we would argue that for I think two reasons, one is simply, because, at this point a majority of our patients on the Medicaid side, somewhere around 65% or 70% of our patients are already in managed programs.  So, at some point, that will anniversary and there will be no further shift. Obviously, it has to max at a 100%, it may max before or not all patients may ultimately shift. But, I think what our current results reflect is we are not at that point yet. We are that \u2013 there are still no further patients to shift. The one sort of statement that you may have had that I would object, that\u2019s probably too strong a word.  But just correct somewhat is to say that, within our payer classes, we are not really seeing dramatic changes in payer mix. Within managed Medicaid, our length of stay remains relatively stable within traditional Medicaid, within managed Medicare and within traditional Medicare and within commercial, our length of stay remains relatively fixed, so, and stable. So, we are not seeing changes. It\u2019s really this shifting population that\u2019s creating the length of stay pressure. A.J. Rice : Okay. And my final real quick will be just on the cash flow. Good solid cash flow again this quarter. Are you \u2013 you got some development projects in the development pipeline, you\u2019ve got obviously your leverage, you get almost, are you still having some room to take that off even and then you got the share repurchase which looks consistent with what you did last quarter.  Any update on what your thinking is around capital deployment and priorities? Steve Filton : No, again, I think I would say and echo what we\u2019ve probably said in the past. I think we feel like, we have a lot of internal organic opportunities building new beds in our behavioral segment in both kind of de novo developments like the Palm Point project that I mentioned in my remarks or the Spokane development reflective of our joint venture integration efforts.  On the acute side, we\u2019ve been extremely successful with our capacity expansion, not only the new Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas, but just new beds and new surgical, the New York capacity which we\u2019ve built in almost all of our facilities in Las Vegas and in a number of other markets. So, our CapEx number has been ramping up and I think we\u2019ll continue to probably ramp up some as we continue to identify these projects that are yielding solid returns. We look at other inorganic opportunities. Those are a little bit harder to predict. We also find our own stock to be a compelling value at the moment and we bought what we believe to be a decent number of shares in the third quarter and I think that activity will continue as well. So, I think that, it\u2019s more of the same and I think we view more of the same as a good thing in a sense that these are all good opportunities for us and we like the potential returns that they are going to yield on. A.J. Rice : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning. On the topic of development activity, just curious, are you seeing more development activity from competitors out in the local market in terms of de novo developments? What\u2019s your assessment of the competitive environment for new capacity and niches in Behavioral? Steve Filton : Okay, I was going to ask that. Yes, so, look, I think we\u2019ve said in over the last few quarters in response to similar questions, Frank, definitely in many of our markets, we have seen new Behavioral capacity, new beds, new facilities, new outpatient facilities et cetera. At the end of the day, I think we have said that, I don\u2019t know that we feel like it\u2019s diminished the overall demand.  And again, I think the admission growth that we experienced in the quarter is reflective of the fact that the underlying demand is still strong. But, it definitely affects our building and recruit qualified clinicians, nurses, psychiatrists, non-professionals, et cetera. So it is certainly a more competitive environment with more capacity out there.  I don\u2019t think in our minds, it has changed or really diminished the underlying or our underlying ability to create the sort of traditional level of demand. But definitely there is more capacity out there. Frank Morgan : Got you. One more now, and I will hop back in the queue. Just noticed that obviously the charge \u2013 the incremental charge on the DOJ, for the DOJ investigation, just curious if you could give us any more color on how close you may \u2013 do you think we might be here and how did we come up with this number that we took in the quarter? Thanks. Steve Filton : I mean, I think, we\u2019ve again said, fairly consistently that our reserve is reflective of our most recent offer to the government. That remains the case. I think obviously, those who are following this and then I know many are carefully, the increases to our reserves are coming more frequently and in bigger chunks and view it as a good thing.  I think it\u2019s reflective of the fact that this \u2013 our settlement and negotiations with the government are meaningful that pace of them has picked up. The gap between where our offers and the government demands are has narrowed and we are optimistic or hopeful that that means that we can reach a resolution that this is relatively soon.  But as we\u2019ve said, I think every quarter it\u2019s difficult to predict that end game with precision because we do largely proceed at the pace of the government said. So, I think that pace has picked up and we are encouraged by that and are hopeful for a resolution soon. But difficult to predict exactly how and when and the amount of that would be with precision at least at the moment. Frank Morgan : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, thanks. Want to go back to an earlier question about pricing. I guess, your 2% pricing on a patient care basis is I guess not a bad number. But if this below the 2.5% to 3.5% number you\u2019ve been seeing in the last four quarters or so? So, I guess, when you think about it going forward, 2% is kind of the right number to think about going forward there? Steve Filton : Yes, and it\u2019s a fair question, Kevin. I mean, if you think about it, when we gave our original guidance for the year and that 5% revenue growth, we actually imagine that that would consist of 3% to 4% volume and 1% to 2% price. You made the point accurately that we\u2019ve been on the high-end and if not frankly over the high end of the pricing range or maybe closer to 2.5%.  I think we have a point of view that, that number will moderate a little bit as we\u2019ve discussed some of that impact is a result of our transitioning residential beds to acute beds that have a higher level of revenue and there is a cap to that, because we don\u2019t have that many or our percentage of residential beds is getting to be relatively small.  So, yes, I think, now that as we think about it, we think that sort of ultimate model and again I am not going to going to say when we are going to get there, but that ultimate model of 5% revenue growth is probably now, we think about more as like 2.5% to 3.5% volume and 1.5% to 2.5% price. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, do you sense that in Q4 you kind of expect a relatively similar performance in the behavioral business as far as it sounds like same-store revenue growth and then relatively flat EBITDA which was kind of you did that sound a little bit from a larger perspective.  But I was surprised that with the same-store revenue growth decelerating being 2.5%, you actually saw some of the best margin performance you\u2019ve seen over the last year. So is there anything coming on in the cost side that you are now able to achieve margins relatively flat even if you only growing same-store revenue 2.5% to 3%. I think, you, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about a higher same-store revenue growth number that you needed to maintain margins. Steve Filton : Yes, so, I think it\u2019s a couple of things, Kevin. It\u2019s a good question. I think to some degree, as you know, we\u2019ve been talking about labor and wage pressure for several years now. I think sooner and maybe more frequently than many of our peers. And I think to a degree we are seeing some of that impact start to level out and anniversary out where maybe others are just starting to feel that a bit more acutely. That\u2019s I think a piece of it. The other thing is, I think it\u2019s just a credit to our operators and I have certainly have made this comment on previous calls, I think, in a tough revenue environment, where revenues are not growing as much as we would have liked and maybe would have expected.  I think our operators have managed the business generally very efficiently and with great care and I think that, the EBITDA results and the EBITDA growth is reflective of that. So I think it\u2019s a combination of those two items. Kevin Fischbeck : Is that something that\u2019s sustainable or is that something where you kind of compare when you identified whatever the number is $10 million, $20 million of savings, but then, do you anniversary that at some point and you\u2019ll need to be growing? Steve Filton : The model is not perfect. So, I would say that at around 3%, 3.5% same-store revenue growth on the Behavioral side, EBITDA should be flattish. And again, I think there will be quarters where we do a little better than that and quarters where we do a little bit worse than that and then as we get above that, I think you start to see some EBITDA growth and some EBITDA \u2013 some margin expansion rather.  So, again, I think the levels that we are producing, the level of growth correlated to the revenue that we are producing right now is about the best we can do. I don\u2019t know that we can sustain that. But I don\u2019t know that\u2019s going to vary dramatically from where we are today. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess a last question. When you think about getting to that 5% number on the Behavioral side, how much of it is stuff that might be within your control? Whether tying new beds, recruiting labor, or doing better documentation as you described. How much of it is just kind of getting to the point where you anniversary some of the more structural headwind to the business? Steve Filton : So, I think that the elements or the dynamic that is most out of our control is that sort of continued shift of patients out of traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs into the managed Medicare and Medicaid programs. Those decisions are being made by the states et cetera and we really have little impact on that. Having said that, I think there are a bunch of other dynamics.  And I think you picked through a few of them that are within our control we can try and alter our patient mix, we can build new capacity to find sources of new patients and in some cases to sort of reconfigure our patient mix. We can work hard to justify longer lengths of stay where it\u2019s clinically appropriate with the number of our payers.  We can explore accepting more both medically and psychiatrically acute patients. We can do all those things. But again, the point that you raise I think is a valid one. I mean, the one thing we can do is sort of hold back the tide of these patients who are moving from traditional programs to managed programs. That will continue although obviously as I noted before, there is sort of a natural limit to that as well. No more than a 100% of our Medicare patients can be managed, no more than a 100% of our Medicaid patients can be managed. And in both cases, we are well past the 50% mark. Kevin Fischbeck : And I guess, when we look at Acadia who is growing above that 5% rate in the U.S. they are obviously doing something operationally that\u2019s allowing them to overcome some of these structural headwinds. Do you kind of look at the items. Do you guess there is no reason why at some point in time we can\u2019t achieve 5% even if these headwinds remain where they are or is part of it just getting to a better comp? Steve Filton : Yes, it\u2019s a little hard question to answer when I am asked for real specific sort of comparisons with our peers, since obviously, I have little detail and little insight into their detail. I guess, my reaction has been one of the challenges or couple of the challenges that we have faced over the last several years in our Behavioral division, from a labor shortage perspective is very geographically specific. And when we talk about the markets where our labor challenges have been the greatest, we know that Acadia does not have as nearly a significant a footprint in some cases no presence in those markets.  And the same thing with some of the managed Medicaid issues that we faced. We talked about some of the states that have been most problematic for us and then we look at an Acadia map, we see that they haven\u2019t necessarily have a significant presence in those locations.  So, I think that\u2019s an aspect of it. So, again, I think all \u2013 what we are really focused on is what we can do in our markets and in our hospitals and don\u2019t spend a ton of time analyzing what others are doing because, again, the one thing we can\u2019t really change is the location of our hospital. So to the degree that issues are geographically centric, we are just going to try and deal with those issues where we have them. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to the behavioral side, Steve. The admission number did accelerate, is there anything you can point to whether it be the full channel, IMD opioid epidemic the alleviation of staffing challenges.  Just trying to get a better sense of sort of the pick up there and then the other side of it, I do want to go back to length of stay, I think the challenge is, the much deeper deceleration in this quarter, that\u2019s sort of hard to grasp.  The shift from traditional to manage, isn\u2019t anything new. So, are there anything to callout that\u2019s maybe disproportionate impact by stay, if you can call out any states that just sort of would make it worse for the pressure in the third quarter than what we\u2019ve already been seeing as sort of a continued pressure. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I am going to answer the second question first. And then maybe come back and ask to repeat the first question. Yes, I mean, we would agree that the shift of patients from traditional to managed programs is nothing terribly new.  I do think that in some of the states in which we operate, we\u2019ve seen the pace of that pick up, we\u2019ve talked about Florida, Illinois, Kentucky being among those sort of geographies where that\u2019s been more of a concern. So, and I apologize, Ralph. But can you just repeat the first part of your question? Ralph Giacobbe : Yes, it was actually sort of the positive side of the equation. The admission number did accelerate. So\u2026 Steve Filton : Got it, I got it. Yes, so, two things. I mean, to be fair, the comparisons and I think we knew this going into the quarter were relatively easy compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. We had a hurricane impact in a number of our behavioral facilities in the third quarter of last year. So, there is a little bit of built-in improvement there.  But I think the other piece of that and we\u2019ve been talking for any number of quarters, I think the other big piece is, I do think we made a lot of progress on the labor front. We don\u2019t have nearly as many \u2013 what we describe as cap edge or closed units because of the \u2013 a lack of qualified staff. So, I think that\u2019s the real underlying improvement is the strides we\u2019ve made in the labor shortage area. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. And then, just a follow-up. The implied 4Q guidance suggests EBITDA down I think low to probably mid-single-digits. Maybe help us with the decline there. I think you mentioned the behavioral side sort of flat.  So, it would sort of imply a steeper decline within acute and obviously come off of a strong acute front. So anything there? And then the last piece of that question is just, your all-in Medicare rate, could you just remind us what that shook out for fiscal 2019 and how it compares to 2018? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, so, I think that, our view of the fourth quarter and what\u2019s embedded in our guidance is a relatively flattish view of EBITDA. So on the behavioral side, I think that\u2019s kind of just a continuation of where we\u2019ve been and on the acute side, I think it is premised on the idea that the fourth quarter of last year was extremely strong. And we called out a number of \u2013 sort of call it a non-recurring items, we called out the $11 million to $12 million flu impact from a very strong flu season last year, we called out $6 million or $7 million of California UPL in the fourth quarter of last year. So, we started out, I think in Q4 if you eliminate those items I\u2019ll call it $16 million or $17 million in the whole.  I think we presume, we will make that up and that\u2019s probably kind of 4% or 5% growth in our acute care EBITDA. Because I still think the comparison is pretty tough even without those items. But cosmetically, I think it will be flattish EBITDA in the acute business and in the Behavioral business and I think that was sort of the core of our presumptions about Q4 guidance. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Thanks, hi, good morning, Steve. First question is, on the acute care side, as well. I am just curious if you can give us an update on sort of outpatient facility growth. I guess, both from the UHS perspective but from the competitive perspective as well and maybe projects that you guys are working on and if that\u2019s having any impact on the acute care\u2019s strength this year? Steve Filton : Yes, look, I think anybody who follows the acute care industry knows that the trend of outpatient and alternative site delivery has really accelerated over the last several years. We see our competitors doing that in our markets and we\u2019ve responded in kind.  So I think we\u2019ve talked about on previous calls, we\u2019ve developed probably a dozen freestanding emergency rooms most of which are open and we probably have another sort of like amount that are sort of on the drawing board. We have a smaller number of urgent care centers.  We have a bunch of primary care physician locations and specialist locations in our markets, imaging centers and our strategy quite frankly in every market is really meant to be tailored to the specific market needs and competition.  So, we see all those dynamics and they are reflected I think or manifested in different ways in our results. So for instance, we\u2019ve clearly seen our emergency room activity decline or visit numbers decline over the last several years.  But we have seen our emergency, or the admission from our emergency room continue to be quite strong and increase which I think reflects the fact that what\u2019s happening is, those less acute, less intensive emergency room visits are effectively migrating out of the traditional acute care emergency room into these urgent care centers and clinics and retail pharmacy clinics et cetera. And honestly, I think we view that as a positive development for everybody. It\u2019s a better location of the care where it belongs. So, but we are participating in that outpatient development in our markets in a very rigorous way. Josh Raskin : I guess, more specifically, is that contributing to the strong growth in acute or is this more sort of we are keeping up with the markets dealing in your view? Steve Filton : Yes, look, I think, I don\u2019t know that I have a kind of a single answer to that, Josh. I mean, I do think, number one, it is a competitive response to some degree we have to do that to keep up. But I also believe that the sort of the strong continuum that we establish in markets like Las Vegas, like Riverside County California, really allows us to put up the sorts of growth numbers.  I don\u2019t think we could have the acute care revenue growth numbers and the acute care volume growth numbers that we\u2019ve put out for the last several years if we hadn\u2019t developed this fairly aggressive outpatient in alternative care delivery strategy. I think we\u2019d be losing business, I am losing market share if we weren\u2019t doing that. Josh Raskin : Gotcha, gotcha. And then, just a second question, a separate topic. Obviously, a lot of focus on drug pricing and what more news yesterday and we are hearing about potential changes for Part B drugs and the hospital companies come together for generic manufacturing et cetera. I am curious, are you \u2013 just from your perspective, is that accelerating from a drug price perspective and how do you think \u2013 what\u2019s your best method to sort of combat some of that growth? Steve Filton : So, we \u2013 for the most part, I think rely on our group purchasing organization to \u2013 from a pricing perspective to negotiate the best contracts and the best pricing for us. But certainly, we had a significant focus on the operational side of that within our pharmacies managing to the most efficient formulary and the most efficient use of high cost drugs and whether they are oncology drugs or whatever it maybe.  So, it is a big focus of ours. I don\u2019t know that I think we have a point of view that a kind of big impact on our acute care results one way or the other meaning I think we believe that our drug pricing has generally risen sort of consistently with our overall cost inflation. But it certainly is obviously it\u2019s a big chunk of the overall hospital cost and something that we focus on a great deal. Josh Raskin : Okay, perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Hi, thanks. So, for 2009, when we think about the outlook. I know you are not giving guidance. But is there any out of the ordinary headwinds or tailwinds we should consider for either business, like for example, I know, in acute care you are going to get an IPPS benefit. Can you remind us what that should be in 2019?  And on the Behavioral, I know you talked a lot on this call about the length of stay pressures and the state \u2013 your state exposure. But is there any state that you have exposure in now that maybe hasn\u2019t got managed Medicaid and that maybe it will in 2019 that\u2019s on your radar? Thanks. Steve Filton : So, Ann, I think as far as sort of the puts and takes for 2019 and again, I am certainly not prepared to give a kind of a comprehensive list, but obviously to the degree that we had any non-recurring items this year. I am sure people are sort of thinking about that going forward. You made the point I mean, I think we have and I don\u2019t think I fully answered \u2013 I think it was Ralph who asked this question before.  We have I think our Medicare increase in the sort of 1.5% to 2% range for next year, as well as an increase in our Medicare dish payments, I think some people sort of throw the Medicare dish payments into the underlying rate which makes it more 2%, 2.5% rate increase. If you want to look at the dish benefits separately, I think it\u2019s kind of a $15 million to $20 million benefit.  So that\u2019s the tailwind I think into 2019 that actually starts in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other than that, there is nothing I think that we haven\u2019t previously talked about. But at the moment, we would call out our highlights.  As far as the length of stay pressure goes, I mean, it is something that is tough for us to have a great deal of visibility on, because a lot of time it doesn\u2019t takes place necessarily when the state moves from managed or traditional to managed, whether it\u2019s Medicare or Medicaid, a lot of times Behavioral is sort of a separate carve out and the timing is different than it is for the rest of the book of \u2013 I\u2019ll call it medical business. So, it\u2019s a little bit hard to say.  I mean, we will make our best efforts when we give our 2019 guidance to call out particularly for states that were concerned about or have focused on, but at the moment, I don\u2019t have any of that I would specifically identify. Ann Hynes : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. I wanted to go back to the comments on wage pressure. So, the behavioral salary wages and benefits ratio is up about a 100 basis points year-over-year or 190 from 1Q, 2017. How much of that is targeted increases to reach staffing goals. How do you think about balancing the revenue opportunity of having more staff with the margin pressure of higher wages and how far along in the process are you in moving wages to the ideal rate on the psych side? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a finite process. So, it\u2019s not like I think we have a point of view that where 50% of the way there, or 80% of the way there. I think we have a point of view that this is a constantly changing market dynamic that we are monitoring all the time.  The wages are the result of a competitive tension in a market and so, we are always evaluating and reevaluating base wages where always evaluating and reevaluating what others are doing regarding incentives, sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses, all kinds of nuance ways to approach labor recruitment and it may vary quite frankly by markets. So, the point that you raised is certainly one that we can see that before which is, wage inflation is certainly higher today for both our behavioral business and our acute business than it was three or four years ago and that\u2019s why we say that our underlying business model has changed.  So, it\u2019s four years ago we might have said that 5% behavioral growth would yield 7% or 8% or 9% EBITDA growth and today I think we suggest that it would yield 6% or 7% EBITDA growth and I think the reason or the main variable there is the wage inflation.  But, again, this idea of sort of kind of looking at it at sort of a linear issue that where 60% of the way there, 80% of the way there or 100% of the way there, I think is the wrong way of looking at it, because particularly in this very tight labor environment, I think it\u2019s going to be an ever changing dynamic. Sarah James : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Can you also update us on the JV that you have on the psych side where you manage the behavioral units for non-UHS hospitals and speak to whether or not the Baylor merger with Memorial Herman could present any opportunity for you to expand the Baylor JV? Steve Filton : Yes, so, I am not going to comment on any specific opportunity. But, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have somewhere between two and three dozen active \u2013 I think we think fairly serious conversations ongoing with a number of acute care hospitals and some bigger acute care hospital systems and honestly in most of our big markets and in both Dallas and Houston are big markets for us we have conversations ongoing. So, we have, I think a very good relationship with Baylor.  So, from our perspective, we would view Baylor as a very positive kind of sort of referral source for us et cetera whether that makes sense towards Memorial Herman in Houston, I don\u2019t know. But I think, if you know the mere fact that we\u2019ve had some already successful joint ventures with Baylor is something that other not for profits around the country view as sort of favorable.  Same thing with our Providence joint ventures in Washington State. The fact that we\u2019ve been able to do these projects with very large and well respected acute care hospital systems, I think is a real positive for us. Sarah James : And can you just remind us again on the economics of how those JVs work? Steve Filton : Yes, again, difficult question to answer sort of in a generic or a blanket way. Every conversation is different. I have sort of described, we have these conversations with acute care hospitals and in some instances our Gulfport acquisition from last year is an example of one where the acute care system just agrees to sell us their hospital, their behavioral facility.  They don\u2019t really want a joint venture et cetera. We\u2019ve done a few of those. We have others where we\u2019ve just leased a unit. Some or couple of our Baylor JVs are just a leased unit from them one of our Providence JVs is just a leased unit from then. And in other cases, we\u2019ve entered into a natural joint venture where we\u2019ve built new capacity.  We\u2019ve done that with Providence. We\u2019ve done that with the University of Pennsylvania here in the greater Philadelphia market. The ownership percentage that the acute care hospital takes varies in each one. So, it\u2019s very difficult to say, here is the model, here is what we would expect to earn from a margin or EBITDA perspective.  But I think the bottom-line from our perspective is that because more than 50% of the behavioral beds in the U.S. are run at the moment by acute care hospitals. The business development opportunity and revenue growth opportunity over the next several years is quite significant for us. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning. So my question is also on the behavioral side. And it seems like the large-scale M&A chatter is seemingly heated up again a little bit in the marketplace. So, I guess, I am just curious if you are able to provide any high-level color just on your current appetite for larger-scale M&A on the behavioral side, given that historically you\u2019ve been successful completing some larger deals. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, so, look, we are not going to comment on any specific deal or specific opportunity or news flow. I think we say all the time and we say it because it\u2019s true that we will explore and evaluate any opportunities that are presented to us.  And we are going to look for the highest returns and as I said, in I think response to A.J.\u2019s question earlier, we think we have a lot of opportunities to do that whether it\u2019s organic capital investment, whether it\u2019s share repurchase which we think is pretty compelling or whether it\u2019s inorganic M&A, we are going to pursue all those opportunities or at least from an evaluation perspective. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Maybe one just real quick confirmation question, just quickly on this discussion on your strong acute same-store revenue growth in 3Q and there was obviously a lot of industry discussion earlier this year around perhaps some acceleration of this greater acuity trend within the in-patient setting. You guys have somewhat dismissed that notion earlier this year for yourselves as far anything out of the ordinary and it sounds like for 3Q 2018, that might be the case again. So one of you can just give any quick color on that topic and just confirm that one way or the other. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I don\u2019t know that we dismissed that notion. I mean, I think what I have said in the past is, actually it seems to be \u2013 it seems to make intellectual sense that what we are seeing is a rise in acuity in the acute care business. Getting back to the question before that seeing more ambulatory and alternative site competition, it makes sense that the business that remains in the acute care hospital is higher acuity business and that the level of acuity would therefore sort of be rising naturally in the acute care industry just generally.  So, I think we sign on to that. I think we believe also that, acute care hospitals in general in UHS specifically has been focused in the last several years on more disciplined documentation, clinical, efforts to improve clinical documentation on the part of physicians and hospital itself. So, I think that\u2019s having an impact as well. So, I think there is to that element where those elements are contributing to the increase in acuity. And so, I don\u2019t know that we discount that. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Hello, Steve. So, on the acute side, as you point out, it\u2019s a little more unpredictable, can be choppy. And as you look at your portfolio of hospitals across various markets, and you look at the macro labor trends and the cyclical trends.  Any color you can offer us on market-specific on a same-store basis, what the volumes are looking like and if certain markets are beginning to top out. I guess, ACA seems to be seeing at least some tailwinds on their markets and what kind of read across are you seeing from yours? Steve Filton : Well, I guess, I\u2019d answer the question in two ways on it. One is, I think geographically, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent for several years now about sort of what our geographic trends look like that the strongest markets, the strongest performing markets have been Las Vegas, and Riverside County California and North Dallas, the District of Columbia.  The weaker markets on the acute side have been South Texas and Amarillo. Again, those trends really have not varied much in the last several years. I think more broadly, I would say that, those markets, those really strong performing markets from a UHS perspective really saw some very extraordinary growth over the last several years, as we benefited from the ACA and Medicaid expansion and economic improvement again in those markets that I ticked off. And I think from our perspective, we were likely to see some moderation in our acute care performance, which I think we saw a little bit in 2018, I think some of our peers who are now seeing some strength in their markets are just sort of maybe a little bit behind that cyclical curve from where we were. But I think they are sort of experiencing what we might have experienced a year or two in terms of really extraordinary growth. But I think we continue to put up very solid numbers in our acute care segment. Ana Gupte : Yes, that\u2019s super helpful. On the payer mix again on acute, is there any acceleration in commercial? And then, it was a point in time where Medicare seem to be a huge source of growth and what is that looking like right now and what might that look like as the next one to three years we see a whole lot of privatization to Medicare advantage and build us the managed MA plans B a little bit more pushback more on the machines, et cetera? Steve Filton : Yes, so, I think that, again the payer mix trends that we\u2019ve described over the last several years has remained pretty consistent at least for us and that is Medicare is probably our fastest growing payer population. Commercial probably grows a little bit slower than our overall. Uninsured has been fairly stable. And again, I think those trends have largely continued.  I don\u2019t think, I think that the Medicare advantage penetration of the acute industry is sort of more mature than the managed Medicaid penetration on the behavioral side. So, I don\u2019t go that we view it as nearly as impactful on the acute side as we do on the behavioral side. I just think we are so much more \u2013 this has been going on for so long on the acute side. It\u2019s just some much more engrained in our business. Ana Gupte : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful too. So, on the managed Medicaid, just one more follow-up to it, others have asked, is this kind of one managed Medicaid player you had suggested maybe Florida, with Magellan and earlier I think you saw the Pennsylvania pressure. So, is it widespread or is it kind of one player that\u2019s being the source of the length of stay pressure here? Steve Filton : Yes, I think what we find, Ana, is that, it really varies by geography. So there is no single payer who we find is most aggressive nationally. In every market, there may be a payer who is more aggressive. But it seems to me sort of more a localized than what I would characterize as really national behavioral on the part of any particular payer. Ana Gupte : Great. One final one then on the inorganic side. It sounds like you\u2019ve been at the table for some of the deal activity on the acute side and can you talk about the pipeline here. You certainly have the balance sheet strength to do it. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, look we are encouraged, we\u2019ve been looking for attractive not for profit acute care opportunities for many years now and to be fair, I think they\u2019ve been relatively scarce. We are encouraged that in the last \u2013 I don\u2019t know, six or 12 months ACA has announced, but couple of deals that I think are relatively new to them. That it\u2019s sort of the first time to those deals. They\u2019ve probably done it over a decade. And we are hopeful that that\u2019s reflective of maybe an uptick in activity in that area. But I\u2019ll just go back to what I said before, we will evaluate those opportunities as they arise. They are difficult to predict. We are not - we don\u2019t feel obligated to sort of grow for growth sake. So, we will invest in those opportunities organic, inorganic share repurchase, et cetera as they arise and as they make sense. And we will just continue to do that. Ana Gupte : Okay. Thanks so much, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Right. Good morning, Steve. I\u2019ll keep it to one question. Can you just say how was, in the Behavioral business specifically, you had some negative hurricane impact last quarter or last year in the fourth quarter I should say, it was in Puerto Rico. So, one would think that would be an easier comp. Can you just \u2013 can you tell us whether there was any negative impact in the fourth quarter already from the hurricanes you see in this year that offsets that? Steve Filton : Sure. So, and thanks for bringing that up, Justin, because, I probably should have mentioned that before. So, I did I think say in response to a question about the strong behavioral admissions earlier on the call that some of that \u2013 strong performance in this year\u2019s Q3, because of the comparison to last year where we had a hurricane impact, by the way not just in Puerto Rico. But we had \u2013 I think it was Hurricane Harvey in Houston and I think Irma in the Southeast. And then, we had a little bit of an impact from Hurricane Florence this year, but I think for the most part, it was fairly minimal. But in Q4, we had Hurricane Michael, hard to keep track of all the names. We had Hurricane Michael which did unfortunately do significant damage to our facility in Panama City, Florida, which is now closed and probably will remain closed for four to six months.  The good news is, all patients and employees were safe and nobody was injured, but that will probably be a $5 million, $6 million $7 million drag in Q4. So, as I was talking about the guidance for the fourth quarter, I should have made the point that, where we originally thought that we\u2019d have a pick up, because we had a drag in Q3 of last year \u2013 or Q4 of last year rather where we will probably have a relatively comparable drag in Q4 of this year from our Panama City facility. Justin Lake : And Steve, that must have been a pretty big facility and that big a drag. Is that \u2013 so you expect that in Q4 into Q1 as well, we should think about a similar $5 million, $6 million drag? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, the reason it becomes a drag of that magnitude, Justin is sort of, it\u2019s one of these that you put tweaks in between things, a facility that is going to be sort of offline for that period of time. We are going to continue to keep everybody on the payroll and effectively maintain our cost structure while we are generating essentially no revenue.  So that\u2019s what creates the drag even in a facility that may not be the largest facility we have et cetera. I will say it\u2019s a bit of a timing issue in that. I think, ultimately, most of this loss will be covered by insurance, but we tend to account for our insurance proceeds on a cash basis.  So it will be a drag in Q4. I think it\u2019s a little too early to say how much of a drag it will be in Q1. Ultimately, I think we will recover most of the loss sometime next year. Justin Lake : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just a couple quick ones. On the \u2013 going back topic of the day, I guess, the length of stay pressure on the behavioral side, are you seeing that primarily on IPF or is it also the RTC? And can give us kind of the latest updated either bed or revenue split between IPF and RTC? Steve Filton : So, I think from a revenue perspective, Gary, and I am doing this off the top of my head, I can provide better clarity later, but, I think about 75% of our revenues now come from acute behavioral revenues, maybe 12% or 13% from residential and the remaining from what we would describe as specialty which would include addiction services, outpatient or management contract business et cetera.  And most of the length of stay pressure I think is clearly from the acute business. We see a couple of residential facilities which has experienced some length of stay pressure. But I think it\u2019s mostly an acute issue. Gary Taylor : Great. My last question, on the administration's announcement around Part B yesterday, I mean, hospitals do separately bill under OPPS about a third of the total Part B drugs. I think that would equate to about 1% of the hospital industry's revenue. So the question is, do you contemplate any measurable impact from the announcement yesterday and the other policies just the site-neutral impact contemplate any measurable impact from that proposal? Steve Filton : I don\u2019t believe so. And I think, and I don\u2019t have them in front of me. So, again, I am doing this off the top of my head, Gary. But I would guess, that UHS\u2019s outpatient percentages or revenue are much lower than the industry\u2019s standards that I mean, I think that those are really sort of inflated by hospitals that have, for instance big outpatient oncology programs, et cetera that for the most part I think we have not really participated in. So, my sense is that, the impact on us is relatively minimal. Gary Taylor : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : There are no more questions. At this time, I turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Steve Filton : We just like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  Thank you. Steve Filton Chief Financial Officer, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Thank you, Emily. Good morning Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements, for anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.  We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to your questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $8.31 for the year and $1.70 for the quarter. After adjusting each period as indicated on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $220.1 million or $2.37 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, as compared to a $189.6 million or $2 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2017. As reflected on the supplemental schedule, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS during the fourth quarter of 2018 excluded a pre-tax increase of $31.9 million in the Department of Justice Reserve and a pre-tax provision for asset impairment of $49.3 million, which reduced the carrying value of the trade name intangible asset recorded in connection with our 2015 acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network. On a same facility basis in our Acute Care division, net revenues increased 4.7% during the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding our health plan, same facility revenues increased 6.1%.  The increased revenues resulted primarily from a 2.2% increase in adjusted admissions and a 4.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 2% during the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted admissions to our Behavioral Health facilities owned for more than a year increased 4.5%, while adjusted patient days increased 1.2% during the fourth quarter of 2018, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 1.1% during the fourth quarter of 2018 over the comparable prior-year quarter.  Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.341 billion during 2018, as compared to $1.183 billion during 2017. Our accounts receivable days declined to 50 days during the fourth quarter of 2018, as compared to 52 days in 2017. At December 31, 2018 our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 42.6% as compared to 44.7% at December 31, 2017. We spent $144 million in capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2018 and $665 million during the full year of 2018. In 2018, we completed and opened 234 new Acute Care beds and 734 New Behavioral Health beds, including de novo facilities. Our Behavioral Health integrations joint venture pipeline continues to be very strong. Today, we are announcing our latest joint venture, a partnership with Southeast Health to build a new 102-bed Behavioral Health Hospital in Southeast Missouri. During 2019, we expect to spend approximately $675 million to $725 million on capital expenditures, which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities. In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced in 2014, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately 1.22 million shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $149 million or $122 per share. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2018, we have repurchased approximately 3.32 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $401 million or $121 per share.  Last night's press release included our 2019 operating results forecast. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our estimated range of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, net of controlling interest is $1.826 billion to $1.909 billion. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2019 is $9.70 to $10.40 per diluted share. The adjusted EPS guidance range represents an increase of approximately 2% to 9% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS at $9.53 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018, as calculated on the supplemental schedule. During 2019, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $11.21 billion to $11.36 billion, representing an increase of 4.1% to 5.5% over our 2018 net revenues.  Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Emily? Operator : My apologies at this time. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt Borsch : So I was hoping that maybe you could touch on two things. Just helping us understand how much the outlook in 2019 is going to be driven by the acute side versus the behavioral side? And then maybe just in the quarter, if you could comment on the, the metrics were good, were strong that the revenue per adjusted net on the behavioral side was hoping you could just comment on that one? Alan Miller : Okay. I mean, I think generally, Matt, the approach that we took for our 2019 guidance was that the business trends in each segment would for the most part continue as they have been. So I think on the acute side, we took the position that the guidance or at least the midpoint of the guidance is based on something close to 5% to 6% revenue growth and 6% to 7% EBITDA growth. On the behavioral side, much more modest revenue growth are generally more like 2% to 3% and just sort of flattish EBITDA. Although, particularly on the behavioral side, there are a number of headwinds that we face in 2018 that will reverse themselves in 2019. Those include the start-up facilities that we had opened in 2018. It includes the regulatory sort of challenge facilities that we had in the beginning of the year that continue to be a drag for part of the year. It includes the end of the year challenges we had from Florida Hurricanes and the California fires, et cetera. So I think from an EBITDA perspective, I think I'll call it from a core. On a core behavioral basis, we expect EBITDA to be sort of flattish to maybe up 1% on a kind of all in total basis, I think we are expecting EBITDA growth of sort of 3%, 3.5% at the midpoint. As far as your question about revenue per admission, I'm not sure if that was an acute question or a behavioral question\u2026 Matt Borsch : Behavioral. Alan Miller : Okay. Matt Borsch : It was on behavioral because that was the only one that was, the others were strong and just that one that sort of stuck out is because it was a decline. Alan Miller : Sure. So what we always traditionally encourage people to do on the behavioral side is really look at revenue per patient day rather than revenue per admission because the revenue per admission is distorted by the length of stay change and in fact, in Q4, we had a relatively measurable decline in length of stay, a little over 3%. Matt Borsch : Right. Alan Miller : Even on a patient day basis and adjusted patient day basis, our revenue per adjusted patient day was only up a little over 1% which is certainly less than it's been. I think it's a function of a couple of things. One is the continued growth in our managed Medicaid business, which tends to have a lower revenue per day and reimbursement and than our Medicare and commercial business and also the challenges we were facing in our addiction treatment business, where we continue to move from out of network rates to in network rates and that had a bit of a dampening effect. I think over time we think that, that revenue per behavioral day should grow in the 2%, 2.5% range and for the most part over the last year or so it has gravitated even to that range or slightly above it. Matt Borsch : That makes sense. Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. First question just on behavioral length of stay. Steve, can you give us an update on what's going on with this continued shift from Medicaid fee for service to Medicaid managed care? the magnitude of it and how much of the decline, do you think is coming from this? Steve Filton : Sure Justin. I mean, we've said for some time. I think certainly since about the beginning of 2017. So really for the last two years that the reduction in length of stay during this period has been driven primarily by a continued shift traditional Medicaid patients to manage Medicaid patients and that remains the case, you know, the majority of our total Medicaid patients are now in managed programs. In Q4, I believe 65% to 70% of our Medicaid patient days were represented by managed Medicaid days and that number has grown from I would say 50% within the last 18 months or so. So it's been a fairly dramatic shift.  The number of large states or states that are large from our perspective in terms of behavioral presence have more recently gone to a managed system states like, Florida and Kentucky and Illinois and we felt the impact of that and I think that continues to be the major driver of the length of stay contraction. Going forward, and I think we talked about this last quarter. I certainly have talked about it over the last quarter at conferences et cetera. I think our point of view is that over the intermediate term, the next 12 or 24 months. We're still presuming that that process has to play itself out. And as a consequence, I think our guidance and our projections for the next couple of years presumed that length of stay continues to decline by 1% or 2%, a year those numbers can bounce around each quarter, but I think that's our point of view over the longer term. Justin Lake : So Steve. That's really helpful. So, 50% goes to 65% to 70%, has that been a steady sloping line? Has it leveled out at all? Steve Filton : It really has not leveled out in the last couple of years, I mean it's been an increasing trend in the last couple of years, it's not an absolute sort of straight line if you will, Justin. So I think length of stay decline bounces around, but if you kind of plotted it as points on the regression graph. I think you'd see a fairly steady decline over the last couple of years that on an average is around the 1% to 2% decline. And again, that's the trend that we would project would continue for another year or two. Justin Lake : And Steve, just last question the, yes, I guess what I was asking is more just the last couple of quarters. All right. Obviously this would annualize at some point once it steadies for the last couple of quarters. And then if you're at 65% to 70% now, can you run us off of a list of stance or maybe we could follow-up just there are 2 or 3 or 4 states that kind of the bolus of where they still haven't gone Medicaid managed care and on behavioral that we should be kind of looking at, that's kind of the key last dates that would be transferring over to this. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean you know it's a perfectly reasonable question, Justin. And as you might imagine, I get asked all the time and I think we've been fairly candid in conceding that it's been difficult for us to predict with great precision, how this shift was going to take place over the last couple of years and how it will take place over the next couple. We certainly know the states that are, you know, moving to a more managed sort of approach, although I will make the point that in many states the changeover for behavioral care is not always done at the same time as the rest of the medical services population. Justin Lake : Right. Steve Filton : So we can always tie those together and we don't, I think, have the same sort of insight and kind of real-time data that the payers have quite frankly. So the best that we can do like I said it's sort of largely kind of track where we are, obviously we know that with that no more than 100% of the population can shift, although I'm not sure we are convinced that it will be that high and presume that will continue to occur at about the same rate, but we can see it, and we wish these were not the case then we were better able to predict with greater precision and the trajectory of how that will go. Justin Lake : Thanks for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. AJ Rice : Hi everybody. First, just to clean up a couple of things on the guidance, do you have a bed growth number on the psych side? And would you highlight on the acute side any unusual items that are beyond just sort of the expectations for same-store revenue and EBITDA growth, maybe a supplemental payment changes or I know the health plan has been a drag, do you continue to expect that to be a drag above and beyond with the acute business does anything that's unusual that we might want to factor into our modeling on the acute side. Steve Filton : Sure AJ. So I think your question surrounded mostly the acute care business. As I said, same-store revenue growth on the acute side is sort of 5% or 6% in the model. We acknowledge that kind of on the high end of what seems to be sort of industry averages, although there is not a great many good public company comparisons for our acute care business any longer. I will say that most of that number is based on our historical trends over the last couple of years, we've, while I think that's a strong number. It's reflective of the sorts of experience we've had over the last few years and the strong performance particularly in a number of our better kind of stronger franchise markets like Las Vegas, Southern California DC et cetera. I will also say, however, that I think that number is inflated particularly in 2019 by some of the increased capital spending that we've seen over the last few years, I mean, our overall capital spend has gone from roughly $350 million three or four years ago to closer to $700 million in '18 and again in '19 some of that has been real big ticket items like the new hospital in Henderson, but a lot of that is just continuing to enhance our franchises. We've added beds to our Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas. We've added beds to Henderson, even though it's only a couple of years old. We've added beds to Summerlin in Las Vegas. We've added very large new emergency room project to our hospital in Manatee, Florida or Bradenton, Florida, we've added emergency room capacity and beds to our hospital in Denison, which is in the North Dallas market.  So, I do think that some of that acute care revenue growth is embedded in our guidance as well as far as the health plan goes, as we've talked about over the last several years, the health plan has been steadily improving the guidance for next year continues to expect it to improve. I would say it's a kind of smaller incremental improvement next year maybe in the $8 to $10 million range. And then the offset to all that as you mentioned is the supplemental payments and we've got a schedule in the 10-K that projects this or lays out the supplemental payments over the last several years and projects the 2019 number. And in 2019, we're expecting a measurable decline in supplemental payments. All that of course is included in the guidance. AJ Rice : Okay. And you have a bed growth of target for the site business? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean we've been talking about for the last several years bed growth in the kind of 600 to 800 range a year which includes I think as I said in my prepared remarks additions to existing facilities as well as de novos, it's sometimes a tough number to really get again down precisely because there's always a lot of it depends on local zoning and regulatory clearance and those sorts of things, but I think our point of view is that we ought to be and we were at the high end of that range in 2018 and we certainly ought to be in that range again in 2019. AJ Rice : Okay. Maybe just one last one on the capital structure, you're down to like 2.3x debt to EBITDA that's low for the industry, it's low for you guys. Historically, even though you tend to be more conservative than the industry. I know you got the DOJ settlement sounds like that's getting close, you took another accrual for that. So that's a cash outflow, but any thoughts on share repurchase. I know you've been at sort of $400 million. It sounds like for the last couple of years or so. Any thought about stepping that up. Steve Filton : Yes. So I think you've almost asked and answered your question. That is correct that our share repurchase has averaged about in that $400 million range pretty consistently for the last several years. It's what we have embedded in our guidance for 2019. I think it's possible that number accelerates either as a result of a settlement of the DOJ case and/or how we think about other external opportunities that there may be out there outside of CapEx from an M&A perspective, those are often more difficult to predict but at least, sort of what we have in our guidance is fairly similar to what we've run the last few years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Tanal : Thanks, good morning. Just looking in the queue on the Medicaid addition supplemental benefits. I know it's not, I don't know you guys typically guide to, but the Q had, if I sort of implies $50 million for Q4. It looks like it came in sort of $67 million. Is it fair to sort of say that was upside versus the plan without it? You might have been below the line of the guidance or how should we think about the timing there as well? The Q is filed in November. Was that a really late in the quarter sort of surprise or? Steve Filton : Yes, so if it's good question. Steve, to be fair, I know you, this morning, we've been looking at it. As I responded to you and I will tell everyone that increased supplemental payments in Q4 were in our guidance, they are about $15 million or $16 million in Texas and in our minds, I think largely an offset to the non-recurring benefits we had in last year's Q4, the blue impact and the California UPL. I'm not exactly sure why the schedule didn't seem to reflect that in Q3. We're taking a look at that and we'll let people know, sometimes like that. Stephen Tanal : All right, that's helpful. And then just thinking about that sort of program holistically, for the full year net supplemental payments stepped up $22 million. Is it fair to assume that was driven primarily by a mix shift toward Medicaid or is there other sort of discrete factors that would be overlooking? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean I think it's not appropriate to just sort of make that assumption. Although, it seems somewhat intuitive or logical, the states themselves in Texas in particular, I think tweaks and retweaks and changes their supplemental programs quite a bit to respond to sort of various needs and various constituencies. So oftentimes, it's the underlying formula itself rather than changes in sort of the nature of our business per se. And I think in the case of Texas over the last several years, it's been much more of that, that they've been changing the formula that it has been changes in our underlying business. Stephen Tanal : Got it. And is that kind of similar sort of story for '19 in the K you spell out you expect that to step down $30 million. So that's not really a reflection of how you're modeling payer mix shift I guess or is it? Steve Filton : No, no and that's a good question and a good example of the fact that the reduction in particularly thanks to UPL, which is probably about two-thirds of the overall reduction is again absolutely related to a change they have made in there. I'll call it their formula or their approach rather than any change in our businesses. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess just bigger picture on the behavioral segment. Just would love to check in on kind of the long-run thought process or the algorithm. Are you still kind of thinking that 5% same-store revenue growth is achievable? So, when and how are you guys thinking about kind of same-store EBITDA growth that's achievable longer term in the business? Steve Filton : So, I think our view of the fundamentals in the behavioral business have really changed very little over the last several years. Although, certainly we understand and concede that the business itself has been under more significant operating pressures than we've seen in some time. And I think our point of view is that the behavioral business and same-store revenue growth had been averaging for many years, that's sort of 5% to 7%. Certainly, it has been averaging that in the first half of this decade, the 2010 decade and then that growth slowed pretty considerably around 2000 to late '15 early '16. A lot of that slowdown was we believe attributable to a labor shortage. We still concede that we're in a pretty tight labor market, but we've made some improvements there and I think solved some of those issues.  We've also struggled with a length of stay issue that I discussed with Justin before, but I think we ultimately believe and I think are heartened by for instance the 4.5% same store adjusted admission growth in the quarter, we're heartened by the idea that and have, I think maintain this all along that the underlying demand for behavioral services continues to be strong throughout our portfolio, throughout our service lines et cetera. And that continues to be our view and our whole focus is just on doing the things we have to do to be able to sort of solve the issues whether they are labor shortages or length of stay issues that will allow us to get to those levels of historical benefit from that underlying demand. I think the one change we've made in our guidance for 2019 that is different than what we did in '17 and '18 is we're sort of no longer projecting or predicting an exact timeframe in which we will get back and restore that's 5% growth. I think we, as I said in my remarks earlier are projecting that in our guidance, at least the behavioral business continues at about the same pace, it's running right now and at whatever point and we're working quite on a very focused basis to get there, but on whatever point it improves, we'll adjust our guidance we'll revise our going-forward sort of projections, but we're not going to kind of play this game projecting and then we projecting at the moment because we think that's too difficult to do. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Maybe just last question on behavioral than or in general for me. The writedown or impairment charge of Foundations Recovery Network. There's three sort of pieces to that. One was the wildfire impact on the facility, honestly not sure how large that was relative to the total write down, but you did call out kind of tougher expectations for reimbursement and perhaps the competitive dynamics indicating fewer de novos. Is that a localized issue or is your outlook on, sort of changing a bit in that, help us think about that. Steve Filton : Sure. So we've talked, certainly for the last few quarters about changes in the addiction treatment business model that certainly the Foundations Recovery Network represented, that wasn't addiction treatment model that really relied heavily on direct to consumer marketing, either through the media, television and radio or through the Internet, there has been a number of changes in that sort of marketing, particularly in the Internet and some of the search engine logic that's made patient capture more difficult for providers over the last several years. Also, and I think many providers have acknowledged this that business has moved over the last several years from an out-of-network model to more of an in-network model and that certainly results in lower reimbursement.  Foundations also relied more heavily on a travel-to-treatment model in which patients would often travel longer distances sort of outside of their home markets to get what they consider to be sort of the best treatment available. I think payers are, have been more restrictive about those kinds of decisions, et cetera. So all those things have, I think affected the growth trajectory of that business. And then as you pointed out, and certainly we've acknowledged that and talked about that for some time. And then in the fourth quarter, I think our most profitable facility in the foundations portfolio, our addiction treatment facility in Malibu, California was closed as a result of the wildfires there. And there doesn't seem to be any path to reopening that anytime in either the near intermediate future. So that was sort of the triggering event although certainly not the primary one to do the write down. Stephen Tanal : Awesome. Alright. Maybe just an update on behavioral leadership changes well, how did the search go? And then sorry for all the questions, I'll yield there. Appreciate it. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, as we, or as I've sort of discussed in the conferences that I've attended since Debbie left the company. We've talked about the fact that we would undergo an aggressive and comprehensive search to replace her and we've done that, we've, it's still relatively early in the process, but we've been pleased at how the search is going, we think there are a number of good solid viable candidates who we're exploring and will continue to do so, but we're quite pleased with the way that our behavioral team has sort of stepped up in the interim, lots of people, kind of filling in and taking on additional responsibilities in the interim and feeling very comfortable that how the business is being run at the moment. And so when we obviously have an announcement of a new person will make that but a very comfortable in the interim that things are progressing as we would have hoped and expected in the interim. Stephen Tanal : Very helpful. Alan Miller : I've mentioned also that Mark has now taken them very active role replacing Debbie and it's working out very well. Stephen Tanal : Great, thank you, Alan. Thank you Steve. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Steve, a quick. I guess the first one, just a clarification on the DOJ settlement accrual, would you characterize that as any change in progress or is that just sort of latest proposal from UHS at this point? Steve Filton : Well, I think it's both Josh, I mean, as we've said for a while now. We've adjusted our reserves periodically pretty much lately every quarter to reflect whatever our latest offer is. So that's certainly what the reserve reflects or something very close to our latest offer. But I also think it's worth noting that the gap between our offer and the government's demand has narrowed quite considerably. And I think we view ourselves certainly on the monetary issue to be close to agreement on a final number with the government. There obviously are other issues to be negotiated along with that including release terms and a compliance agreement and the end of kind of all the spectrum of investigations. But we would hope that the monetary piece of this is sort of the most difficult and that once we can agree on that the other items will fall into place in short order, although that's always difficult to predict with the government. So, I think it's difficult for us to project any sort of precise time frame here. But we are certainly optimistic that on the core monetary issue, we are close to a settlement with the government. Josh Raskin : Got you. Definitely a change in tone then, I guess. And then just on the acute care side. I'm curious, are you seeing any changes in trend around CapEx spending by competitors in any of your, let's call it the larger markets either new capacity whether that's inpatient or outpatient, are you seeing other sort of step up their spending as well? Steve Filton : That is sometimes hard to say. I do believe you know particularly in our markets, that I think have shown relatively robust economic growth markets, again as I mentioned earlier, like Las Vegas, like Riverside County California, like the District of Columbia, some of our Florida markets, the North Dallas market, because I think they're growing markets, because we've done well in those markets. I think that for the most part, we're seeing our peers in those markets. Investing as well, but I think one of the reasons why we tend to be focused on making sure that we're maintaining our franchises in those markets and hopefully enhancing our market share positions is the idea that we want to make sure that we're not overtaken by our peers.  So I don't know, obviously we don't really have access to a lot of objective data about exactly how much is being spent in each of these markets. But my anecdotal sort of notion is that many of our peers, at least, those that can afford to are investing in the better markets. But I think we feel that we are maintaining our competitive position at least in every one of these markets. Josh Raskin : Okay, perfect that's what I was looking for. Thanks Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Sarah James : Thank you. You've talked about the behavioral model yielding flat EBITDA in years for top line growth, 2% to 3.5% and more like 6% to 7% EBITDA achievable and a 5% top line year. I'm wondering if there are things that you can do on the supply side or other areas that would allow you to achieve EBITDA growth, even if top line is growing less than type person, thanks. Steve Filton : So, I mean as a CFO, I always sort of have the position that we can always drive more efficiencies. Then we have, and that's certainly the message I deliver to operators. But the reality is, if you look at our behavioral business over the last several years is that even on relatively modest growth. We've maintained margins in the mid '20s, I think it would be unrealistic to expect quite candidly that until we can engineer or restore that and that sort of historical level of revenue growth at around the 5%, that add 2% or 3% growth. It's possible to really have any sort of measurable either margin expansion or EBITDA growth et cetera. We certainly strive for that and we strive to be as efficient as possible, but the nature of the operating model is that most of our costs are fixed and semi-fixed. So where you really generate the leverage in this model is through at least modest revenue growth, and until you get that it's hard. Again, I'm going to always say there, there are pockets of opportunity for greater efficiency. But I wouldn't say that there are, there is any low hanging fruit out there in terms of driving greater efficiencies. Sarah James : Got it. That's understandable. What about on the acute side, are there initiatives under way with supply costs or scheduling that you could look to drive some improved leverage there or margin expansion on the acute side? Steve Filton : Yes, I think the acute side is a different question. I think that there is an acknowledgment on our part and on the part of our operators as well as on I think observers in the industry, that there is a fair amount of duplication and some excess cost broadly in the acute industry and this is not specific to UHS. I think that the general view is that the real way to drive improvement there is through changes in the payment model, and those are certainly occurring slowly and we move, we're moving again incrementally away from the traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model to more of a what's called fee-for-value model. But, I think I would describe as more of a risk-based model. We disclosed in our 10-K for instance that we've agreed to participate in a number of additional bundled payment projects for Medicare. I think those will drive incentives and encourage sort of throughout the continuum more effective behavior and sort of a ringing out of costs and we are very focused on that. And I've talked about it for a number of years. So as the payment model changes, I do think that there is an opportunity on the acute side to drive more efficiencies and less variability in the system and that should be helpful and there'll be some card growing profitability in EBITDA and margins. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with BOA. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Wanted to ask about the site revenue per patient day. It sounds like one of the factors is the Medicaid mix shift, which is likely to continue. It sounds like the next year or two, but at the other factor you mentioned was going back in network with some of the addiction centers. I guess, I don't ever really hearing a lot about that in the past, that's something that just happening now. When do that anniversary or is that going to be a longer-term headwind to pricing. Steve Filton : We certainly have talked about that dynamic last couple of quarters, I don't know honestly that it has had a measurable impact on pricing before the fourth quarter. And so my sense and mostly because of the foundations' contribution to our overall behavioral performance is still relatively small, I don't know that over time, it will have a real dampening effect on our revenue per day, which is why I said earlier, Kevin that I think our longer-term view is that the behavioral pricing should be in that kind of 2% to 2.5% a day range and the reality is over most of the last couple years, we've been hitting that range, if not somewhat exceeding it, and I think as we looked at some of the factors affecting Q4, they were a bit anomalous and don't really expect them to continue at the same level of magnitude. Kevin Fischbeck : So would you say that, so the 2019 is going to be below that number in your guidance? Steve Filton : Below... Kevin Fischbeck : 2% to 2.5% Steve Filton : No no. I think that effectively, what we are really projecting, when we're projecting 2% to 3% revenue growth in 2019. We're essentially saying that that will largely come from pricing and volumes are projected to be relatively flat in our guidance. Our hope would be we can exceed that, but that's what our guidance implies. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. And then just circling back on the labor cost issues and we have a business you talked about making progress there and where do you think you are in that progress, are you halfway through 2/3 of the way through, how is that shaping up? Steve Filton : It's always a difficult question to answer, when posed that way, Kevin, in the sense that it sort of suggest sort of a linear process that we have X amount of openings at a point in time. And then, we were able to fill 50% of them or 75% or whatever. And the reality of it is, that we fill openings and we hire and we train people and then people leave and et cetera. It's a very fluid kind of a dynamic and particularly in a tight labor market, which I think the current labor market is appropriately characterized as.  So I think we've made a lot of progress since we began to talk about this issue in late 2015 or early 2016. But we also acknowledge that it remains a tight labor market, and there are still facilities where we have vacancies and in some cases, this is sort of a chronic problem, but certainly we don't have the level of closed beds and closed units that we had two or three years ago, you know and that tends to occur now on a much more sort of one-off basis, but again I think that providers in general and behavioral providers in particular are going to be facing and the issue of the labor shortage at both the nursing and the psychiatrist level will continue to be an issue for the foreseeable future as long as the labor market remains as tight as it is right now. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay and then just last question. The new head of the sector is when you bring, whoever that is and, is there any change in direction or emphasis that you would expect the new person to bring in and does having a new head of that business in anyway help DOJ resolution? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I think we have a point of view that we and I think folks who listen to our conference call et cetera, certainly have a good appreciation of this over the last several years, have faced some difficult operating challenges in the business and we've touched on those already in the call. The labor shortage is the pressure from our managed Medicaid payers increased competition, et cetera. And I think it's been difficult for all of our operators, including the head of the business segment to kind of taken a step back and think about how to grow this business over the kind of longer term, we believe very firmly that there isn't a very significant role for behavioral care in the future healthcare landscape. We also believe there is a growing demand for behavioral care. And I think all that is validated by much of the literature et cetera, that's being written about how to effectively deliver healthcare and in the future, et cetera and so I think we're hoping that with a new person sitting in that lead chair, that they'll have a bit more time to reflect on some of those longer-term issues and the longer-term growth opportunities in the business and in the meantime we remain and I think Alan's comment is, we remain at every level of the organization, both he, and I and Mark as well as a very capable staff senior and mid management behavioral leaders are very focused on sort of making the trains run on time and solving and addressing all those operating issues. But we would hope that a new person would really be able to do some things from a longer-term perspective, maybe we've neglected for the last year or two. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And is there any implications for the settlement? Is having a new person in there clear the air at all or may change the timing in your view? Steve Filton : No, I don't think that personnel change has anything to do with the DOJ investigation or settlement. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks, good morning. So, on this whole behavioral managed Medicaid issue regarding the shorter length of stay and the leverage you can maybe pull to try to offset this or mitigate the impact. I'm just curious about on the revenue side. Perhaps renegotiating contractual terms and diving a little bit deeper, is there any color around the notion where under value based care you could receive either bonus payments or just some sort of better compensation for having shorter length of stay, whether it's versus peers or some other metric. And shouldn't that kind of be the end goal to some degree, but just curious to get your thoughts on this concept of being rewarded for having shorter length of stay in behavioral. Thanks. Steve Filton : So it's a good question. Steve, I think that there are payers who would make that argument. I think unfortunately, we have a point of view that length of stay has been viewed on the behavioral side of the business as a proxy for some sort of quality of care metric. And I think we feel that's a fundamentally flawed approach. At the end of the day, we have a point of view that length of stay is really a clinical determination that should be made by clinicians based on the clinical needs of a patient rather than the financial outcomes.  And so, I think we're reluctant to sort of promote a system that encourages anybody providers et cetera to really drive lower length of stay just to achieve a better financial result because at the end of the day, I think, we're concerned that sure changes the clinical needs of the patient. So, while I think there would be payers that would welcome that. I think that fundamentally, we prefer other measures of quality that we believe exist and we believe perfectly appropriate in terms of quality rewards and quality bonus payments, we think length of stay is the wrong measure for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citibank. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Morning, you mentioned a strong JV pipeline and the new build. I guess, can you just help frame the opportunity to Steve there and whether sort of contribution there is sort of an accelerant to growth or just sort of needed to get back to sort of the baseline that you talked about in that mid-single digit. And then you had the write-down on the addiction treatment center. Is that still an area of focus or opportunity or what's your interest maybe more broadly and generally around expanding service lines at this point. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So I'm sorry, can you just remind me what the first half of your question was. Ralph Giacobbe : I'm sure just the JV pipe... Steve Filton : Yes. The JV pipeline. I'm sorry. We've talked about this a lot, I mean, I think, we think that the broadly the JV opportunity is a very significant opportunity somewhere around 50% or 55% of all the inpatient behavioral beds in the U.S. are today operated by acute care hospitals. And so to the degree that we can penetrate that market in some way by helping them manage those businesses by leasing those beds, by partnering with those acute care hospitals, by building new facilities with those acute care hospitals, as we've done in many of these instances, that's probably the single biggest domestic growth opportunity we have in the behavioral business. We've also acknowledge that you know despite our focused efforts, it's a relatively slow developing opportunity and will continue to be so. Now, we'll continue to focus on it and we'll continue to do those transactions that make economic sense, but it's hard sometimes to make the acute hospitals want to go or need to go faster than they're going at the current time. In the short run, then I think I kind of touched on this before the some of those projects can be a little bit of a drag. So in 2018, we opened joint venture with Lancaster new beds, we opened a new hospital win in Washington State with Providence Health Care. That's a bit of a drag and in 2019 actually some of the improvement in Behavioral will come from the continued ramp up and growth in those facilities and there's not a lot of brand new facilities coming on in '19. So, there's not much of a drag, but ultimately over time And again, when I say over time in this case, I'm really talking about a timeframe of four, five, seven years, I think, we think it's a very significant growth opportunity and one that positions us, I think even more importantly as a partner with not for profit acute care hospitals around the country in a way that we may be able to lever in other service areas.  As far as you're, question about the addiction treatment business, I mean in general, I think we are taking a pause on expanding again what I'll sort of call this a new style model that characterize Foundations Recovery Network of direct-to-consumer marketing, travel-for-treatment, that sort of issue. In general, we acknowledge that addiction illness particularly opioid addiction, but quite frankly addiction elements of all sorts, continues to be a growing phenomenon in the country and needs to be treated. It can be treated in many ways in our old model, which is sort of not a direct-to-consumer marketing, but a referral source marketing kind of an aspect. So, we'll continue to take advantage of that in terms of other service lines as best as I can tell, Ralph. We have probably the broadest service line offerings of any inpatient behavioral provider in the country that spans general psychiatric treatment, geropsych treatment for the elderly for diseases like Alzheimer's and Dementia, autism, eating disorders, all kinds of sort of niche behavioral treatment. So we're certainly open to expansion, but there aren't a whole lot of behavioral illness is that we don't already treat somewhere in our portfolio. Ralph Giacobbe : Yes, that makes sense. I was asking more about sort of if that gave you a pause on any of that, but it doesn't sound like it does. And then just a follow-up question you typically breakout the performance. Some of your bigger markets on the acute care side, I know behavioral isn't as concentrated, but can you give us a sense, you even by market or maybe even as you look at the broad portfolio in terms of what percentage is really underperforming. I guess I'm really just trying to get a sense of whether it's a small percentage of facilities really driving the softness or if it really is sort of a broader pressure that you're seeing across all your markets? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean the math is such Ralph that, you know the reality is our two business segments are about the same size from a revenue perspective, but obviously we have a much smaller number of acute care facilities and those facilities tend to be more concentrated than they are on the behavioral side. So we certainly talk always about the Las Vegas market and it's hard, I don't know that there's another, I'm certain that there isn't another public acute care company, that has sort of a market presence comparable or market contribution comparable to that. But on the behavioral side, we generate roughly the same amount of revenue, but with a much larger number of 200 plus domestic facilities.  It's really impossible for any one facility or really even any one market to have the same sort of measurable and material impact that allows Vegas does on the acute side which is why we really never talk about kind of individual markets for the most part on the behavioral side, I think you sort of your question about sort of what percentage of the hospitals are underperforming et cetera, my general sense is that in a portfolio of 200 plus hospitals, it's always going to be sort of like a bell curve, where there's going to be a small number of outperformers and a small number of underperformers and the vast majority of hospitals are going to be in that large, middle and in that large middle. I think we have a point of view that the issues that we've discussed over the last few years, labor shortages, managed Medicaid, length of stay pressure, increased competition, there are issues that are being felt by a relatively wide array of facilities and are not particularly focused on a specific market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter [indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, guys, thanks for taking my questions. A few quick ones here. Following up on AJs acute bed question, you grew beds in the fourth quarter by 3.4% and what percentage of your 5% to 6% revenue guide in the acute business [indiscernible] and as you look at the supply versus demand in your markets, how confident are you that these bed additions can continue over the next few years? Steve Filton : So, I tend to think about the capital investment in the Acute business, not so much on a bed basis. I think that's a relatively kind of dated way of looking at the business, which is not to say again, we certainly have added beds and I think that's a reflection of our ability to want to meet demand, but we've also are spending a lot of money to increase emergency room capacity and to increase surgical capacity at many of our hospitals and other service lines as well, particularly in what I would describe as sort of the high-end service lines like Cardiology and Orthopedics and Neurosurgery. At the end of the day, and again, to be fair, Peter. I don't know that I have a precise number because I think it's difficult to really parse it to that level, but you know what I was trying to say earlier is that of our 5% or 6% Acute Care revenue growth some of it may be 1% or 2%. I do believe is really being driven by this increased capital spending, not just on beds, but again on the other items that I talked about, but it's very difficult to say, when you add a bed or you add five more ER days or you add another operating room, exactly what the contribution of the incremental investment is because this capacity effectively becomes fungible. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, fair enough. On the behavioral side of the business, you guys did a great job with the mission is to offset length of stay pressures. How sustainable do you think that 5% admission growth is? And is there any margin impact from having more patients stay for shorter period of time? Steve Filton : Yes, look, I think we've conceded that a shorter length of stay is a bit more of an operational challenge, which I think is probably intuitive to people who think about it that turning over patients more quickly requires a bit more of an effort, etcetera. But we also acknowledge that to some degree, that's the way the business is headed. And so we will deal with that, I think we have a point of view it again sort of harkening back to an earlier exchange I had that 5% revenue growth at some point is and restoring that number is not unrealistic continues to be in our minds, very achievable. We think of that as sort of, you know 2.5% to 3% volume growth and 2.5% to 3% admission, pricing growth rather depending on what happens to length of stay that will drive sort of what the required admission growth will have to be to get to that level, but again I think we have a point of view that in the relatively near or intermediate term 2% or 2.5% patient day growth should not be unrealistic and would be consistent with what we've run for an extended period of time historically. Unidentified Analyst : All right. And then last question on the behavioral leadership. Have you had any increased turnover at the divisional or other management levels since Debbie left? Steve Filton : We've lost a couple of people to Acadia since Debbie left, I'll make the point that in the normal course with UHS and Acadia being the largest certainly for profit behavioral providers in the country, there is always a flow of personnel at various levels of hospital and regional levels back and forth between the two companies. So, it's always, it's hard for me to say that that's terribly unusual, but it's only been a couple of people. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks so much. Alan Miller : We just hired somebody from Acadia yesterday. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open. Whit Mayo : Hi, thanks. I wanted to go back to the supplemental program question and just rip in the headwinds that you've called out in your 10-K. Just to be clear, there are also some tailwinds that you have coming with federal dish, a much favorable IPPS update that should more than offset those headwinds. Correct. And is there a number that you could size for what you think your Medicare dishes this year? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, the impact of the Medicare decision and thanks for reminding me Whit and others. I think we've talked about on previous calls, but it's probably in that $18 million to $20 million annual range for us, it begins in October of '18, but over the federal fiscal year it's about an $18 million to $20 million benefit. Obviously that's embedded in our guidance as well. Whit Mayo : Right. And then you've got an incremental pickup with your IPPS update that could be another what? Another $10 million or $15 million or so? Steve Filton : Correct. Whit Mayo : Yes. And coming into 2018, when I go back and look at your 10-K, you predicted that you would see a $30 million headwind to all of these state programs, and it actually came in much higher. I think you said $156 million, you recorded over $200 million. Before that you expected $145 million coming into 2017 became came $40 million higher than your 10-K disclosure. So I guess I wanted to understand how you come up with this forecast? Because it almost always has an upward bias. And I don't think investors probably appreciate how fluid some of the calculations are inside these programs. Steve Filton : Yes, and it's a reasonable point where and I think it gets back to what I think it was the conversation that I was having with Steve Tanal earlier in the call. What we're able to do at the time we gave our guidance is based on what states current model is we project what we think are our impact or benefit is going to be. But often that model changes, often they sort of have interpretive changes or whatever and there are some underlying changes to our or some changes to our underlying business that are difficult to project. But, yes, I think it's much more of this sort of states changing their models that we often cannot predict. And so I do think we take a little bit of a conservative approach when we project that at the beginning of the year. Whit Mayo : Yes, now I agree. And can we go back to some of the 2018 behavioral headwinds? I just want to make sure that we're all in the same page with the numbers for the hurricane, regulatory challenges, wildfires. Is there any way to maybe size each individual bucket, so that we're all thinking the same numbers? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean the things that I would call out and at least I called them out sort of by item earlier, I mean the continued improvement at the Lancaster and Spokane, de novos, the Gulfport acquisition that was done at the very end of last year. The turnaround in those three facilities is probably $8 million or $9 million benefit going into '19 having a full year of the Danshell acquisition in the UK is probably another $4 million or $5 million in '19. The Hurricane, Florida Hurricane and California fire impact is probably $7 million to $9 million drag in the second half of '18 and then the regulatory facility challenges that we had early in '18 would probably another $5 million or $6 million. And I think all those things have been clearly discussed and delineated people want to go back and check the numbers, but that's kind of my recounting of it, at least Whit. Whit Mayo : No, that's perfect. That's all I got. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Frank Morgan : Good morning. Most of mine have been asked, but just, Steve, you mentioned CapEx in your guidance. Could you tell us what your implied cash flow from ops would be on that guidance for 2019? Steve Filton : I think our free cash flow in '18, Frank was sort of close to $800 million and basically I think the free cash flow guidance for '19 is sort of, it came to that with a slight growth in EBITDA. Frank Morgan : Okay. And then finally, just any color around the surgical volumes, inpatient, outpatient as well as ED business and I'll hop. Thank you. Steve Filton : As it is in most periods, I think surgical volumes have grown pretty consistently with that 2% or with whatever the admission growth is. So, and in Q4, that 2% admission growth sort of would imply and I think is what we ran kind of 2% to 3% surgical volume growth, both on the in and outpatient side. And we, I think we have time, maybe for one more question. Operator : Certainly, your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gary Taylor : Hi, thank you. Mine will be really quick, because I think you've answered everything. I just wanted to go back and clarify one thing. Stephen, just make sure I understand it. So when you were talking about how you built guidance for the year and you talked about behavioral and I think you're suggesting that you still kind of view that business is running 2% to 3% top line with flattish EBITDA, but because of a number of idiosyncratic factors the number which you were just discussing with Whit, the actual behavioral EBITDA growth guidance is plus 3% to 3.5% for 2019. Is that all correct? Steve Filton : I think that is all correct, Gary. Gary Taylor : Okay, perfect. That's all I have. Thank you. Alan Miller : Okay. We like to thank everybody for your time and look forward to talking to everybody again after the first quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019. During this conference call Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the Company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.57 for the quarter. After adjusting for the favorable impact from our adoption of ASU 2016-09 as discussed in our press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.45 for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. On a same facility basis in our acute care division revenues increased 4.7% during the first quarter of 2019. The increase resulted primarily from a 4.9% increase in adjusted admissions and a 0.4% decrease in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3% during the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.9% and adjusted patient days increased 0.9% over the prior year first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.5% during the first quarter of 2019 over the comparable prior-year quarter. Our cash provided by operating activities was approximately $391 million during the first quarter of 2019. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 51 days during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 53 days during the first quarter of last year. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 41.5% at March 31, 2019 as compared to 42.9% at March 31, 2018. We spent $170 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2019. We completed and opened 52 new behavioral health beds and expect to open another 350 new beds at our busiest behavioral health hospitals before the end of the year. We also completed and opened two new freestanding emergency departments in the first quarter, one in South Texas; and the other in Wellington, Florida, bringing our total number of FEDs to 10 with several more expected to open over the course of the year. In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced in 2014. During the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased approximately 841,000 shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $106 million or approximately $126 per share. One final note included with our press release last night was a schedule of selected hospitals statistics, to the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Certain statistical information on that schedule related solely to be as reported behavioral health facilities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was inaccurate. The corrected as reported, behavioral health, statistical information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-Ka as filed this morning with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other than the as reported behavioral health statistical data as just discussed, no other changes are required to any of the financial or statistical data including all same facility statistical data as originally included in last night's press release and related Form 8-K as filed last evening. Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning, Steve. First on the acute side. EBITDA was below expectations there. It looked like it was pricing. Can you walk us through a few things, one, why was pricing so weak in the quarter. How did you see a kind of flow through the quarter and how far off was acute EBITDA from your internal estimate? And kind of how far was the quarter off. Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure, Justin. So first of all, let me say that I think similar to last year first quarter results, we were a little bit short of our own internal expectation, a couple of pennies short. I know we were measurably shorter than the consensus estimates however. Internally, I think as you suggested our acute care results were probably $10 million or $15 million short of where we expected to be. And conversely, our behavioral results were made up about half of that. So, we were ultimately, as I said a couple of pennies short from an EPS perspective. The main driver of this shortfall again, I think as you suggested on the acute side was, pricing or revenue per adjusted admission weakness. What we saw in the quarter was a measurable shift of higher margin, higher revenue, surgical patients to lower margin, lower revenue, medical patients, which is not really that sort of typical pattern particularly early in the year. We did see that pattern abate, as the quarter went on. So, in other words, surgical volumes were extremely weak in January, they got better in February, they got better in March. And it looks like they're continuing to get better into the early stages of the second quarter. Justin Lake : And. So are you saying March and April were pretty much in line from an acuity perspective and therefore from a profitability perspective in the acute business or the miss was in January, February? Steve Filton : Yes. I certainly will say that about March, obviously April is sort of an incomplete picture at this point. But at least from a statistical and service mix perspective, it appears those trends continue to improve in April. Obviously at this point we haven't closed April, we haven't seen payer mix information, all that kind of stuff, so I'm not going to make any broader comments about April's profitability. But in terms of the service mix dynamic that I talked about, it did seem to again and continue to improve into April. Justin Lake : Okay, thanks for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning, Steve. Two questions, kind of related. I guess, first is just any overall thoughts of the IPPS proposal this week, and anything we should be thinking about. And then second, I guess related to that as I think about the impact coming in 4Q. Medicare advantage versus Medicare fee-for-service, in terms of the payments to your facilities. I just wanted to see where we were on that, if anything has changed in recent years or does the M&A payment typically reset directly with the fee-for-service changes come October 1. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, so as far as the IPPS rule, we had in our 2019 guidance beginning in October. I believe an assumption that the IPPS would increase on sort of an all-in basis by something like 2.6% or 2.7%. I think when we calculated the impact of the final rule that's out now, again all in with the effect of DSH and with the effect of wage and exchanges, we were coming very close to our estimates. So I think from our perspective, and certainly has an impact our 2019 guidance, is largely a push. As far as your second question, I think that generally we find Medicare Advantage rates tend to follow and contractually sort of \u2013 I think described them as being reset with the overall traditional Medicare rate. So I think we generally find them to be strongly connected. Josh Raskin : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. In terms of the surgical softness, can you just give us a sense of magnitude at all of the decline in the early part of the quarter versus recent recovery? And then maybe which surgical line saw the greatest impact. Steve Filton : Yeah, I mean. So for the quarter, Ralph inpatient surgical volumes were flat with last year, outpatient volumes were up maybe 2%. Historically, I think what we have found generally is that surgical volumes and admissions tend to move in relative lockstep, so that if admissions are up 4%, then usually surgical volumes are up 3% to 5%. So the level of disconnect in the quarter was certainly greater than what we're accustomed to seeing. In terms of sort of the monthly cadence or progression. I don't necessarily have that in front of me, but as you can think about it, I mean in terms of \u2013 if inpatient surgeries were flat for the quarter, they were down early in the quarter and then got better and we're a little bit up in the quarter towards the end. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. And anything on surgical line? Steve Filton : Yes. And in terms of what I was saying before, what we saw is a decline in those higher margin, higher revenue surgeries, those would include orthopedics, hips and knees and spine. They would include cardiology, stent and open hearts and pacemakers. So, I think all the sort of traditional areas that you would think of as high-acuity, high revenue, higher margin procedures. For the most part, were down across the board, across the portfolio. And as I said, we began to recover and did recover as the quarter progressed. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay and then just to just to clarify, was it loss of surgical volume, altogether, or was it more of a shift to those procedures from inpatient to outpatient. So you sort of still kept it, which is why maybe the overall volumes got looked okay, but the pricing and margins got hit or is that not the dynamic. Steve Filton : Well, again I mean I'll just sort of repeat the overarching metrics. Our adjusted admissions were up 5%, inpatient surgeries were flat, outpatient surgeries were up 2%. So it leads you to believe there is a little bit of shift from inpatient to outpatient, but the biggest shift I believe is, less surgical patients and more medical patients and again those medical patients are lower revenue, lower margin patients. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, fair enough. I leave with that, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Thanks. On the psych side, I guess, you said that the numbers were better than you were expecting in the quarter. What was \u2013 what exactly came in better was it a revenue beat or was it on the cost side? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, if you recall, Kevin at our year-end call, just a couple of months ago, we talked about the basic premise of our same-store guidance on the behavioral side was roughly, how we ended last year, which was kind of 3% revenue growth. We had 3% admission growth in Q1 we had 2.5% pricing growth, those numbers fell pretty robust as unfortunately we continued to see pressure on length of stay. Although again that was largely as expected we said at the end of the year, we were embedding in our guidance an assumption that length of stay would continue to decline 1% or 2% in 2019, and it declined 2% at least in the first quarter of 2019. So in many respects, the underlying metrics played out as we expected. I think we just saw a little bit more efficiency, we saw as \u2013 we predicted or our guidance presumed relatively flattish EBIT on a same store basis. I think we had more of a 4% EBITDA growth, or something on a same store basis. And I think that's a little bit of efficiency, and it's a little bit of the anniversarying of some of this, the wage and salary pressure that we've been talking about for the last couple of years. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then I guess as far as the length of stay pressures. The quarter was better, I guess in some of the more recent quarters. There, are you seeing anything around there to kind of give you visibility and that continuing to decline or a pressure continued to abate. Or is the right assumption to be that it's still going to be in that kind of 2% range, as far as length of stay pressure? Steve Filton : Yes. So look, we've been I think reluctant in the more recent quarters to make real definitive predictions about the direction of length of stay and behavioral. We've talked, I think about the biggest variable and the biggest volatility there being, the continued migration of traditional Medicaid patients into managed Medicaid plans, where they tend to have a lower length of stay. And while, we're certainly aware of the states in which that migration occurs, the pace and the cadence at which it occurs. The level of, sort of aggressive behavior of the particular managed care payers in a particular geography or state varies. And as a consequence, it has not been easy for us to historically predict how length of stay is going to go. So, I think we're going to stick with the idea that, over the course of the next 12 or 24 months, we'd expect length of stay to decline 1% or 2%. We're certainly doing a number of things internally to try and do our best to make sure those numbers reflect a fair length of stay from the payers that is consistent with their clinical diagnoses et cetera, and proper treatment and outcomes. So, we continue to work on it but from a financial perspective, I think the expectation is still 1% or 2% decline for the near term. Kevin Fischbeck : And then maybe this last question, the accrual for the DOJ settlement I guess was flat sequentially. So, I'm not sure how to read into that, is that a sign that you're getting close to the end and the two sides are not very far apart at this point or is it more a sign that there's still a ways to go and there was not a lot of progress made this past quarter in the settlement discussions? Steve Filton : What we had talked about in our year-end call a couple of months ago was the idea that we felt like we were nearing an agreement on a monetary settlement with the government, but that there were several non-monetary issues to be negotiated and discussed. And I think over the last couple of months, the focus of our interaction with the government has sort of shifted to those non-monetary items, things like terms of a release and the periods of a release and the conclusion of related investigations, criminal and otherwise. And so I think what's to be read in that is that we continue to negotiate rather vigorously with the government, and I think both sides are committed to bringing this matter to a conclusion. We as always hope it will go faster but are dedicating our resources to make sure that happens. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Two questions. First of all just drilling down a little further on the strength and certain medical relevance to surgical. When you as you rattled off some of those surgical case categories, hips and knees back some of that and my mind maybe has some aspects of postponable nature to it or even an elective I guess, whereas obviously open hearts doesn't. But as you talk to the operators is there any indication that maybe what we're seeing is sort of a flattening out of seasonality because of the proliferation of high-deductible health plans. Is that a factor here in what we're seeing? Steve Filton : So A.J., I think that the dynamic that you just described is certainly real and has quite frankly existed for many years, so I honestly we have long seen late in the year in November and December, an uptick in elective procedures as people have satisfied their deductibles and look to have those procedures and those treatments done at that time. And then we see kind of a slow start in January. February as the clock resets on their deductibles, et cetera. What people have speculated over the last several years is that that dynamic would be exacerbated as more and more plans became high deductible and the deductibles themselves became bigger et cetera. So, I think it's not an unreasonable sort of postulation that that's some of what we see happening. In an objective way that's very difficult for us to prove, we just don't have enough information about you know sort of our patients. You know insurance sort of position this year versus last year to really make those kind of broad sort of conclusions. I think the payers would probably be in a better position than we are to make those sort of judgments. But there is certainly has been speculation on the part of our operators that that may be a dynamic in what's happening. I'll also make the point that, I know it doesn't necessarily answer it, but last year, in the first couple of quarters, UHS and other acute operators were generally reporting stronger revenue per unit, stronger acuity. And in some cases sort of struggling to explain that fully. So, I do think we're working off of pretty high comparison historically and I think that's playing into this a little bit as well. A.J. Rice: Okay. And maybe the other question I was going to ask is drilling down on capital deployment. I wonder if you could give some color as to, it seemed like maybe your discussions with the government were causing you to be a little conservative relative to capital deployment. I know you're down to debt-to-EBITDAR rather 2.3 times, which is very low for the industry. Any thoughts on the cadence of buyback activity over the course of the year. And then I guess, there's also been some deal activity in the last 18 months and markets you might have an interest in. And there's also been discussion about possibly physician deals being out there. Any update on both sides buyback and deal activity pipeline from your perspective? Steve Filton : So, I think we made the point A.J. that over the last I think three years we've averaged pretty consistently low $400 million of share repurchase annually. Embedded in our guidance for 2019 as a similar $400 million to $500 million number. I think based on our first quarter performance and the buying that we've done under a 10b-5 into the second quarter, we're comfortably on track to get to those numbers. I think what we've said is that likely until we settle with the government, the cadence and the pace of those repurchases probably doesn't change all that dramatically, although we're certainly trying to take advantage of what we believe sort of unjustified weaknesses et cetera in the stock. In terms of deal opportunities. I think that's always difficult to comment on, with any level of specificity. Obviously, you've made the point and we certainly concur that our conservative capital structure leaves us a lot of flexibility. So, we certainly feel like we're in a position to respond to opportunities as they arise and opportunities are presented to us all the time and we're evaluating them, but we're not going to comment on any specifically. A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Ana Gupte with BBB Leerink. Please go ahead. Ana Gupte : Hey, thanks, good morning Steve, good morning Alan. Just one last one, perhaps from me, on the mix shifting that you've seen from surgical to medical. Is there anything you're able to tell from the various geographies that you're playing in? Is anything incrementally, different? Also, do you see any differences by payer mix, which would kind of then play to A.J.\u2019s question about seasonality and high deductibles? And any delayed mix shifting to ambulatory sites of service perhaps that you hadn't seen before? Steve Filton : No. I mean, I think, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we've been fairly active in certain markets in developing and opening freestanding emergency rooms and certainly in those markets, we've seen some shift of emergency room business out of our hospitals into the freestanding entities. But more importantly, I think we feel like we're seeing, we're capturing business that some of our competitors would have otherwise seen in those FEDs. So generally, I think our ER business remains rather robust. And in fact, I think one of the dynamics we see in the quarter is we are seeing more of a higher percentage of capture of ER patients in admissions. We did look at this dynamic of the shift from surgical to medical. We certainly looked at across the portfolio, and we saw this dynamic present in many of our markets, not just one or two. So it didn't seem to be geographically specific for us and couldn't really determine any patterns in that regard. Ana Gupte : Okay. And it's not got to do anything with observation stays, which your pattern used to be more on higher volume, lower pricing growth. I think that's probably 2017 and then it sort of slipped a bit. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, I think that maybe related to the comments I was trying to make to A.J. before, which is we explained some of the strong acuity and revenue per admission that we were experiencing early last year to the idea that we\u2019ve had success with some of our payers, particularly out West, in getting more of what I \u2013 we sort of describe as those bubble cases categorized as in-patients rather than observation. So it's possible that some of the revenue weakness in Q1 is an anniversary-ing of that dynamic, although again I think that the bigger issue is the shift of surgical patients to medical patients. But that could have at least some incremental impact. Ana Gupte : Okay, great. Thanks. On behavioral \u2013 switching to behavioral. So you talked about in 12 to 18 months, you'll get back to 5% and clinical staffing was driving volumes up, offset by the, hopefully, last of the length of stay pressure from Medicaid to managed Medicaid. Do you feel it's kind of maxed out on the staffing dynamic here on the volumes and then on the length of stay, this payer mix shift, which I think you're like two-thirds managed Medicaid, one-third Medicaid? Correct me if I'm wrong. Are you kind of seeing the same dynamic in the timing to return on that 5%? Steve Filton : Yes. So look, we talked about the pressures that labor shortages were really causing for us and impacting us back in late 2015 and early 2016, I think, is when that problem really kind of reached its height. Since then, I think we've made a great deal of progress. Now we certainly still remain in a pretty tight labor environment as does the rest of the country. And so we still have pockets where either we have a shortage of a psychiatrist or multiple psychiatrists and nurses or even in some cases, nonclinical or nonprofessional clinicians. But I think we've made a significant amount of progress and the amount and occurrence of those sort of shortages are much more infrequent today than they were a number of years ago. So that's much less of a barrier to revenue growth and admission growth. The length of stay issue, which we talked about before a little bit, remains I think probably the biggest barrier to or getting to that sort of 5% target that we've talked about before. We continue to work on that and I think also have a point of view that at some point over the course of the next year or two, we'll largely begin to anniversary that. But we're not quite there yet. Ana Gupte : Okay. And then one final one. You've always pointed out your commitment for the company on a diversified model. And usually, you have one business somewhat offsetting the other. Looking at the first quarter, and it sounds like it's beginning to get better on the surgical side, how do you feel relative to plan in acute, behavioral and then more broadly relative to guidance? Steve Filton : Well, I mean, I'll just make the comment, which I think you made, I'm going to sort of reiterate. And I think we feel like our two-segment strategy, which we've been committed to for well over three decades, has served us well over that time in many respects. But one is it's been a good business diversification strategy that as one business was under some pressure, the other tended not to be. And this last quarter seems to be another example of that. As far as how we sort of view the cadence or the trajectory of the businesses, I will say that this year's first quarter at least feels to me a little bit like last year's first quarter, where we missed our internal projections by a couple of pennies but missed The Street consensus by a measurably greater amount. We made that point on the call. And I will say the one difference last year was the miss last year was behavioral related. The miss this year is more acute related. But I think we had a point of view that we were still on track to get where we projected we'd be and in fact, wound up the year within 0.5% of the midpoint of our original guidance. So obviously, we can't guarantee that, that will be the same result this year, but we certainly feel, given that we only missed our internal projections by a couple of pennies and given that the trends in acute care that seem to have driven the miss in Q1, seem to be reversing themselves, we feel pretty good about our ability to land safely within our original guidance. Ana Gupte : Thanks Steve. Appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Thanks for all the color on the surgical volumes. I won't press that anymore but it sounds like that's mostly resolved at this point. Can you talk about the Medicaid DSH cuts that are coming in the fourth quarter? I know there's a letter running around Washington trying to build up support to delay those cuts. How exposed are you to that? I know it's more of a nonprofit item. But for you guys, it's probably still a little bit. Can you talk about that a little bit? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, Peter, we do disclose. I don't have the numbers in front of me. But now in our 10-K, we disclose our DSH reimbursement, and we project our DSH reimbursement into 2019. There was some decline that is embedded in our 2019 guidance. Obviously, we would be pleased if Congress was to step in and sort of either abate or reverse that. Hard to know what the likelihood is of that at this point, but I will say that I think all that is embedded in our 2019 guidance already. Peter Costa : So if it is delayed, it will be an upside to you guys as opposed to if it comes through, it's a negative? Steve Filton : That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s correct. Peter Costa : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So really, I guess, for us a little more time has passed now since the elevated noise level over a month ago around the push by the current administration for greater transparency in managed care or commercial hospital pricing. Just curious if you have any updated thoughts on whether this is either gaining momentum or maybe just losing steam since that conjecture came out last month? Steve Filton : Look, I think there is a lot a focus on transparency in pricing. Although I think, to some degree, it's a little bit misdirected. I mean it is largely focused on a very small group of patients who really don't have health insurance either from the government through Medicare or Medicaid or commercial insurance. And the reality, even though there are sort of the anecdotal stories that can be rather sort of lurid, is that most patients like that really don't wind up paying what I would sort of call retailer sticker prices. So there's a lot a focus on it. I don't know that it's \u2013 we certainly have complied. We post our prices, as you're supposed to now, on our website. But I don't know that it really addresses a significant problem. I think it's one of the solutions in search of a problem. I do think that there are other kind of initiatives in what I'll call the billing and collection area that I think do \u2013 will get more traction and will put more pressure on some providers. That includes what \u2013 sort of under the umbrella this kind of broad surprise billing, which is generally sort of an out-of-network billing dynamic. These are for what I think are generally hospital-based physicians, ER physicians, anesthesiologists, et cetera, who may be not in-network when a hospital is in-network. We have very few of those cases. We really require our hospital-based physicians to be generally in any networks that we're in. So we don't think that's much of an issue. I think in a broader sense, that's a bigger issue than the transparency pricing that's gotten some amount of traction. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with UBS. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe just remind us for a second what the headwinds were in the first quarter of last year for the behavioral segment? I had $8 million or $9 million penciled in but wasn't sure if that's right. Just trying to figure out what the real underlying growth is this quarter. Steve Filton : Yes. So I think with \u2013 the items that you're referring to were $5 million or $6 million of headwinds from the three regulatory-challenged facilities. Those facilities have improved this year by maybe $3 million. I will note that the activity from those facilities has been moved into the non-same-store segment of behavioral health. The other issues were the relatively slow start of the Gulfport, Mississippi facility as we got our Medicare and Medicaid numbers. That facility has also probably improved something like $3 million in the quarter. But that I think has been largely been offset by probably $3 million or $4 million of drag from our Panama City facility that was impacted by a hurricane late last year and remained closed during the first quarter this year. They since reopened in early in the second quarter. And then I think the last drag that you're referring to was a $1 million or $2 million drag from the slow hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico. And unfortunately, that market remains relatively \u2013 or the recovery remains relatively slow. So I'm not sure we have a big turnaround there. Whit Mayo : Okay. So maybe to keep it as simplistic as possible, as you normalize internally for headwinds and tailwinds, on a same-store basis, how much do you think EBITDA increased or decreased in the first quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. So on a same-store basis, I think it's largely a push with the Gulfport improvement being offset by the Panama City loss. Whit Mayo : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I know you had some supplemental headwinds that you cited and included in your 10-K. And any way to size maybe what the first quarter impact was, at least optically, on the revenue per adjusted admission statistic for the first quarter? Steve Filton : So I think on the acute side of the business, there's probably a $6 million to $8 million drag from the projected DSH declines as well as these managed Medicaid pay-for-performance payments that we get in California. We don't actually include them in our sort of special reimbursement tables in the Qs and Ks and we record them largely on a cash basis. But we recorded about $4 million in last year's first quarter and nothing this year. So there's probably, like I said, about a $6 million or $8 million drag on the acute revenues that contribute to some of the weakness in their pricing in the first quarter. Whit Mayo : Okay. Okay. And then maybe just one last one. Case mix, I don't know if you actually gave a case mix number. I was just curious if it was actually down year-over-year. Steve Filton : Case mix is down year-over-year, but I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, Whit. Whit Mayo : Okay, I\u2019ll follow up with you. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just the one numbers question I had, Steve, was on other operating expense in the acute business was up on a dollar basis almost 8% year-over-year. And on a per adjusted day basis, about 2.3%, which, given the strong volume growth on acute, is a little higher than we'd probably anticipate out of what's mostly a fixed cost bucket. So anything unique on other operating expense to call out this quarter? Steve Filton : I don't think so. Gary, I think, as you point out, I think the way to look at it is on an adjusted \u2013 per adjusted admission basis. And I think all of our expenses in acute care are up in that sort of low single-digit range on that basis, which is generally where we'd expect. I understand the point you're making that I think is people model often that other operating expense model is usually just going up by kind of an inflation rate. I will say the one functional area that's included in that, that has seen some pressure is that's where we record our locums or temporary physician costs. It's where we record a lot of our contract service physician costs for things like ER subsidies or if there are appropriately anesthesia or hospital subsidies. Those expenses get recorded in that other operating expense line. And we've seen more than just kind of inflationary pressure in those functional areas in the last few quarters. Gary Taylor : Got it. Also, I think at least in my universe, you're one of the first providers to report under the new accounting rules on the capitalized leases. We see that on the balance sheet, both sides of the balance sheet. Is that all just excluded from all your current debt covenants or no amendments or anything, it's just not included? Steve Filton : That\u2019s correct. Gary Taylor : And last question is, is there any update on behavioral leadership external, internal search? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean that search continues quite vigorously. We've been pleased with the quality of candidates that we've been able to see and hope to be able to make an announcement about that soon. Gary Taylor : Okay, that\u2019s it. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Matthew Gillmor : Hey, thanks for the question. I'm following up on the acute performance. I think Ana asked about payer mix trends within the acute business, but I'm not sure I heard the direct answer. So Steve, can you maybe provide some color on how payer mix trended during the quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. I think payer mix has been relatively stable, Matt. I think we've done \u2013 or we had a focus on our process of trying to qualify the uninsured for Medicaid. And so I think we've seen an uptick in Medicaid utilization to a degree. But I think that's actually kind of a favorable shift out of uninsured into Medicaid. But just generally, again, as we sort of evaluated our revenue changes for the quarter, I think we found that they were not really driven by payer mix as much as they were by the service mix that we talked about at fairly great length already. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. And then one on the behavioral business, and I guess it was sort of in the context of some of the Medicare for All proposal that have come out. And there's obviously been a lot of effort to try to understand sort of how that impacts the acute business because there are large differences between rates between different payer classes. And my sense was on behavioral, that those differences were pretty minimal, but I was hoping you could confirm that and maybe talk a little bit about the different rates within the behavioral segment. Steve Filton : I mean, I think we've always had the point of view that the general relationship of payers and their rates is similar in both acute and behavioral, meaning Medicare is sort of in the middle in terms of the level of reimbursement. Medicaid is the lowest payer reimbursable-wise, and then commercial is higher than Medicare. I would say on the acute side, the spread between those three is larger, but the overall relationship is similar on the behavioral side. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. One quick question on the surgeries. Can you sort of talk about market share and if you guys lost any market share within surgeries from competitors? Or this is widespread across not only in your hospitals but also against your competitors? Steve Filton : So Pito, we do track and get market share information in virtually all of our markets. Unfortunately, none of it is as real-time as in the quarter that we're talking about. So we're probably, depending on the market, still a couple of quarters or three away from really seeing market share shifts. But we have \u2013 as you might imagine, there's a lot of sort of informal communication that takes place within markets between facilities, but especially between clinicians, doctors especially but nurses who practice at multiple facilities. And so we have, I think, a reasonable sense in most of our markets as to how we're doing on a real-time basis. And there was very little concern in the quarter that the decline in surgeries was some sort of significant market share shift. There was just sort of no evidence, even anecdotal evidence that, that was happening. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. A few more quick questions here. You also disclosed that 35% to 40% of all behavioral admissions came from hospital ERs. Has that changed at all in the last year or so? Steve Filton : No, I don't think so, Pito. I think that, that number has been pretty stable for a while. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. And then on McAllen. Tracking employment in McAllen markets, it looks as though the economy is sort of growing there for the first time in almost a decade. Are you seeing any growth there? Any green shoots of trends within that market? Steve Filton : I mean again, as we've discussed quite a bit over the last several years, that South Texas market has been one of our softer markets economically and as a consequence, from a payer mix and a volume perspective for us. And yes, they've been encouraged, I think, by some of the changes recently. I think sometimes, it takes a while for those underlying market-specific changes to sort of filter their way into the local health care economy. So I don't know that we're seeing a huge change in that market, but I think they're a bit more bullish than they've been. Pito Chickering : All right. And then last question on this one is looking at the managed Medicaid business length of stays versus the states that have no managed Medicaid, you're obviously going to see low \u2013 much lower length of stays in the managed businesses. Do you see any different readmission rates for states that have heavily managed Medicaid versus the ones that don't, i.e., do the lower length of stays impact readmission rates? Steve Filton : That's a great question and one that we are greatly focused on. The challenge that we have is the availability of data. As you might imagine, when a patient is seen in our hospital and then is readmitted, it's not always to one of our hospitals. So we don't always I think have complete or perfect information on readmissions. Sometimes, the state will have that. Sometimes, the payers will share that. Sometimes we can \u2013 there are other ways that we can get it. But we do make the argument, in many cases, to the payers that we think that some of this pressure on length of stay is really not suitable or not appropriate for the long-run care of the patient because we think that \u2013 and we can at least prove, in some of our cases, where we have the information that patients who were discharged earlier are being readmitted more frequently. So I assume the payers look at that same information and draw their own conclusions. But a part of the challenge we have is we don't have all that information. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And there are no further questions in the queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Steve Filton : Okay. Thank you, Heidi. We appreciate everybody's time and look forward to speaking with everyone again next quarter. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Heidi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference. Steve Filton : Thank you, Heidi. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends, before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.66 for the quarter. As discussed in our press release and calculated on the Supplemental Schedule, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $247.2 million or $2.76 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2019. This compares to $233.3 million or $2.47 per diluted share of adjusted net income attributable to UHS during the second quarter of last year, as calculated on the Supplemental Schedule. On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2019 increased 9.0% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.0% increase in adjusted admissions, and a 3.5% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, net revenues on our behavioral health division increased 2.7% during the second quarter of 2019, as compared to the second quarter of 2018. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.5%, and adjusted patient days increased 0.3%. Revenue per adjusted admission increased 2.2% and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.4%, during the second quarter of 2019 over the comparable prior-year quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, our net cash provided by operating activities increased to $624 million from $607 million generated during the comparable six month period of 2018. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 51 days during the second quarter of '19, as compared to 53 days during the second quarter of '18. At June 30, 2019, our ratio of debt-to-total-capitalization, increased to 43.5%, as compared to 42.9% at June 30, 2018. We spent $154 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2019, and $324 million during the first six months of 2019. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a $1 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, in conjunction with previously approved stock repurchase programs during the second quarter of 2019, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $339.2 million or approximately $125 per share. During the first six months of 2019, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $445.6 million or approximately $125 per share. Since inception of this program in 2014 through June 30, 2019, we have repurchased approximately 14.2 million shares, at an aggregate cost of $1.68 billion or approximately $118 per share. As disclosed in last night's press release, we have recently reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice's Civil Division, and on behalf of various State Attorneys' general offices to resolve the civil aspect of the government's investigation of our behavioral health facilities for $127 million, subject to requisite approvals and preparation and execution of definitive settlement and related agreements. We have further been advised that the previously disclosed investigations being conducted by the DoJ's Criminal fraud section in connection with these matters have been closed. We are awaiting the initial draft of a potential corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services, which we expect will be part of the overall settlement of this matter. In connection with the agreement in principle with the DoJ's Civil Division, during the three and six month periods ended June 30, '19, we have recorded a pre-tax increase of approximately $11 million in the DoJ reserve, which includes related fees and costs due to or on behalf of third parties. The aggregate pre-tax DoJ reserve amounted to $134 million as of June 30, 2019 and $123 million as of December 31, 2018. Our financial statements, assume that the amounts included in the aggregate pre-tax DoJ reserve are fully deductible for federal and state income tax purposes. Since the agreement in principle with the DOJ's Civil Division is subject to certain required approvals and negotiation and execution of definitive settlement agreements, as well as negotiation and execution of a potential corporate integrity agreement with the OIG, we can provide no assurance that definitive agreements will ultimately be finalized. We therefore can provide no assurance that final amounts paid in settlement or otherwise or associated costs on the income tax deductibility of such payments will not differ materially from our established reserve and assumptions related to income tax deductibility. Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Well, you've been dealing with this investigation for quite some time, so it's great to hear that it's winding down. I wonder if you have any feeling if we look at it you compared to your largest peer domestically, your same-store revenue and EBITDA growth have been a little less than them and we've talked about some regions historically, but I wonder if you would think that getting this thing done once and for all, is it going to potentially -- and not necessarily in the next quarter, but the next few quarters help you in terms of recruiting, staffing in some of the key markets, where they have been a focus on this? Do you think it will help you with some of your referral sources? Steve Filton : Look AJ, I'll make the sort of obvious statement that, it can't hurt. But I will say that, over the last several years, as objectively and in some cases subjectively as we could, I think we tried to determine whether the government investigation was having an impact on our business, on our referral sources, on our clinicians' behavior, and neither objectively, I think, nor anecdotally, could we really ever demonstrate that in any sort of material way. Now look, I'll also, again, say what I think is fairly obvious, I mean, we have expended substantial dollars in legal fees and other costs to defend this case. So at a minimum, I think on average, our costs associated with defending the case have been in excess of $10 million a year for the last five or six years. So we will free those costs up. We certainly have dedicated a significant amount of time and effort internally, certainly on the part of some individuals. I think we have made every effort to try not to distract our operators with the issues of this case. But again, I think -- and there is no way that -- there's just not sort of a general halo benefit, but I don't think we've ever suggested that there'd be a dramatic and measurable uplift in the business. But like I said, it certainly cannot hurt. Alan Miller : So the criminal investigation also came to absolutely nothing. So you will have to deal with the existing management for a while. A.J. Rice: Yes, we expected that, so thanks. The other question, obviously big bright spot in the quarter was the rebound on the acute care side, and I know you had said that you thought it was an anomaly in the first quarter, and you see somewhat of a rebound in the second, which we did. I wonder if you can comment specifically on the -- the big markets you have, Vegas, Southwest Texas, Southern California, was it sort of across the board, or was it focused, and maybe just an update on those. Steve Filton : Sure, AJ. So I think when you have a quarter that has the sort of fundamental strength that we had this past quarter, almost by definition, it has to be fairly broad-based. And I think, in fact it was, and I think for the most part, it follows the -- at least geographic commentary that we've made, and been making for a while now. Las Vegas continues to be strong. Our Henderson facility continues to ramp up. But we're also making capacity expansion decisions in a number of our Vegas facilities, and I think those are benefiting as well. The Southern California, Riverside County market had a strong quarter. The Denison-North Dallas market had a strong quarter. Again, that was a market that I think has also benefited from some fairly substantial capital investment in the last year, and we did talk in Q1 about the fact that we expect that some of these capital investments would begin to yield both revenue and EBITDA returns in the back half of the year. And finally, I'll say something that I don't think I've said in a while, that South Texas, the McAllen market had a pretty strong second quarter and that's a market that, for the most part, has been lagging for us over the last several years. So that's, I don't know if that's the beginning of a trend, but it's certainly an encouraging sign. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt [ph] with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Maybe I'll just continue on that line. A little bit more, if you could talk about what you're seeing sort of linked by service category patient in terms of driving the strength on acute care, if there is any more granularity you can give us on that? Steve Filton : Sure, Matt. So look, I think the sort of the headline dynamic in Q1 was the fact that our acute care revenue per unit -- per adjusted admission, let's say, was certainly lower than our expectations, and we attributed that weakness almost entirely to an unfavorable shift from surgical to medical business and surgical to medical patients. We struggled to really come up with a definitive explanation for that dynamic, but said that by the end of the first quarter, it seemed to have sort of reversed itself and we were operating at much more normalized mix levels and in my appearances at conferences and things in Q2, I think I reiterated that that was clearly true. And I think when you look at the results in Q2, you can see that in those trends have been reversed and maybe we've recaptured if you will, some of that, I'll describe it as lost surgical business in the first quarter. I think what I would suggest to people and I suggest this, because I think we think about it this way, is I would look at the first six months of acute care results as sort of a unit, and look at those results as being kind of the more sustainable metrics of this business. 6% to 7% revenue growth. I will say that the admission strength -- that 5% admission growth, which was pretty much the same in both Q1 and Q2, I'm guessing, when we see the other company numbers, will be at the high end, and I'm not sure that those can be sustained indefinitely. But again, that 6% to 7% acute care revenue growth, maybe a little bit higher than what we had in our guidance, but generally in the ranges of what our expectations were. Unidentified Analyst : And one more if I could; as we look ahead to this current third quarter, where you have an extra business day, but there is a mix of other things. Is there anything that we should think about, in terms of the topline volume outlook? Again just sort of sticking on the acute care side for this current quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. Candidly Matt, I don't know that we pay a lot of attention to these calendar issues. I think we have a point of view that all that comes out in the wash [ph] over the course of the year. But broadly, I don't think we have any expectation that other than sort of the normal kind of seasonal fall off in activity that we get in the summer time, which we would expect to occur this year, just like every year. I don't know if there's anything other than that, that we would specifically call out about expectations for acute care performance in Q3. Unidentified Analyst : Great answer. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks, good morning. First question on capital deployment. I think the market is going to applaud you for all the share repurchase you did in the second quarter. Now that the investigation is pretty much behind you, can you give us an update on how investors should expect you to view kind of the capital deployment through the lens of how much of the free cash flow are you expecting to return quarterly, and then where you think the right leverage level for this business is? Steve Filton : Sure, Justin. Look, I think that first of all, I would suggest that the sort of accelerated level of share repurchase activity in Q2 was a function of a couple of different things. I mean, I think that UHS' stock price along with many of our peers, and just healthcare in general, suffered in Q2, as a result of some of the sort of headline noise around Medicare for All and some of the other sort of legislative initiatives. I think we always felt that was largely overdone, and view that as a significant and unique buying opportunity. But I think also more broadly, we certainly had a greater sense that we were nearing the end of this DoJ process. We also I think were fairly bullish on the underlying fundamentals of the two business segments. So altogether, I think we were just fairly bullish about the prospects of the company, and I think that was reflected in the share repurchase activity. It's also reflected, I think in the $1 billion reauthorization that we announced last night. In terms of sort of committing to a specific level of share buyback or the pace of that or to sort of say what people should expect. I think we're reluctant to do that. I think we've always been an opportunistic buyer, and that opportunistic sort of dynamic depends on a number of factors, including what other opportunities we may find out in the marketplace externally through M&A or otherwise, development, what's happening in the stock market etcetera. So again, I think that we're likely to see a share repurchase pace that's above where we've been the last several years, but not prepared to make any specific commitments today Justin Lake : Okay. And then, if I could just follow up on the behavioral side, you saw a stabilization in length of stay, but then it's a bit of an offsetting drop in volumes. Can you give us any color in terms of, you know, do you feel like there is any kind of light at the end of the tunnel on length of stay, and then what's going on with volumes. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I think a couple of points Justin, and I've made this point before, I do think that there is some interplay between the length of stay and admission dynamics. So that when length of stay is coming down, we generally have seen admissions go up, and it's just I think, a mechanical process of patient beds being vacated sooner and increased admissions to fill those vacancies sort of faster, and I think this quarter you saw a little bit of the reverse of that dynamic as length of stay stabilized, I think you saw admission volume come down a little bit. That's sort of the first point that I'd make. Secondly, I mean, we continue to see the dynamic that we've talked about for some time, which is as more patients shift and transition from managed Medicaid or -- excuse me, from traditional Medicaid programs to managed Medicaid programs, we see their length of stay decline. That overall dynamic or that dynamic was offset overall by a bit of a shift in Q2 from adolescent business to adult business, adolescents tend to have a longer length of stay than adults. And so I think that offsets the Medicaid dynamic at least in Q2. I don't know that that's necessarily a continuing trend. Otherwise, I think generally, the trends remain stable in the behavioral space, I think we believe that a number of our facilities are poised for volume improvement, and our expectation has been for some time, that the revenue growth in this segment will increase from the sort of 3% that we've been at for the last several quarters, to something above that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. So it sounds like the acute surgical trend was up related to investments to attract new volume, not just deductible wear down and the timing of patient scheduling in 2Q versus 1Q. So I'm wondering if that makes you more bullish on the second half? Steve Filton : Sarah, I mean I think what we said in Q1 was two things. I mean, one is, we didn't see any reason why the early weakness in the first six to eight weeks of the year of surgical volumes would likely continue. And in fact, they did not. So I think I would particularly to in-patient surgical volumes, which were relatively flat in Q1, and up like 3% in Q2 and that -- I think resulted in a significant shift in acuity and revenue per unit. And I think, again, I would suggest that sort of revenue acuity and revenue per unit that we've seen for the first six months, so ought to generally be more in line with what we see in the second half of the year. But we did also make the point, when I think a number of people asked in Q1 about the -- sort of the guidance ramp and the earnings ramp for the year, and I think we did talk about any number of, I'll call them mid-sized capital projects in the $20 million, $30 million range where we're adding capacity of some sort. It could be beds, it could be ER capacity, it could be surgical capacity. But in any number of hospitals and markets in Las Vegas, in Denison, Texas, in McAllen, and I think we started to see in Q2, some of that. So look, honestly, I think we expressed confidence in our ability to meet our guidance even after Q1, which I think some people found disappointing. But I think certainly after a strong Q2, we're feeling even more confident that our original guidance is very achievable. Sarah James : Got it. So it sounds like this was contemplated in your full year guidance, and I'm wondering if since the nice return that you got on these investments for expanding capacity in other areas, does it change your strategy on how competitive you want to be on that front, seeing the return that you got on these investments? Could we see rationale for an uptick in investment spend as part of your growth strategy? Steve Filton : Yes look, I think we have a point of view that, we look at capital investment opportunity, as we look at almost all capital deployment opportunities on very much of an individual basis. And so I think our point of view is that, money well spent, well targeted makes sense in a market where we can demonstrate that demand is there for a particular service or a particular investment and that's the way we look at it. I don't think we take the view that, if we have kind of a robust quarter, it's all of the sudden reason to invest more, or quite frankly the opposite, if we have a softer quarter, that is a reason to invest less. I think we have a long track record of being a pretty judicious employer of capital, and that's why I think we had the point of view, that as we invested capital in our markets in these strong franchises, that it would earn a return over a reasonable period of expectation, as we originally contemplated. And again, I think we're seeing that kick in, in Q2 and our guess is it will continue to kick in over the balance of the year, as our guidance is [indiscernible]. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess Steve, with a little bit more of the details around the settlement known now at this point, I'm curious if you have sort of enough information to know if there is any change in operations expected? I don't know if that's in the corporate integrity agreement, etcetera, sort of any business practices that you feel change because of this? And then do you have a view on sort of final settlement and timing of disbursement and resolution in totality? Steve Filton : I'll answer the second part first. Josh, I mean I think we would guess that this whole process will be ramped up probably by mid-fall. But to be fair and for those who have followed us, the cadence of this process is largely in the government's control. So we've not always been as accurate as we would like in estimating these things. Obviously, we're much closer to the end, and hopefully that makes it a little bit easier to guesstimate the time frame in a more accurate way. But that would be our best guess, that we can wrap this up completely and tie a ribbon around it by mid-fall, and that would be when we make our payment. As far as changes to operations, we've made the point I think fairly consistently. We have vigorously defended ourselves for the five or six years of this investigation, feel that our processes, our compliance, infrastructure, etcetera are all fairly robust and quite conscientious and really, I don't think that with the exception of small tweaks here and there, that really changed fundamentally our own internal processes over the course of this investigation. We've not seen a draft of a compliance agreement or corporate integrity agreement from the government, so I can't really respond in any way to say, this is how our behavior could or would change in response to that. But we're not expecting the government to require significant underlying changes to our fundamental operations. I think they will ask us to sort of strengthen and validate our compliance program, which we're more than prepared to do. But no, I don't think that we anticipate any significant changes to the underlying way that we approach this business. Josh Raskin : Got you, that's perfect. And then, last quarter you talked on the acute care side, obviously the slow start in January, getting a little better in February, better in March, April [ph]. Anything to point out, in terms of the cadence across the quarter in the second quarter? I mean it seems like with the 9% revenue number, I'm guessing broad based strength across each month. But just curious if there was any movement intra-quarter? Steve Filton : Yes, look, I think it seemed -- and again, given the fact that I think we still struggle to explain that surgical weakness sort of out of the gate in early 2019, it's a little bit hard for us to exactly sort of describe what was going on. But it seemed like that surgical volume and surgical acuity in particular, just continue to strengthen, as the first six months went on. And to the point where I think we're now back to, after six months, feeling that we're at a much more normalized level. And again, I think if you look at our six month pricing and six month revenue growth, it seems not at all out of line with what our original expectations for the year were. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning. I guess hopping over to the behavioral side of the business, you talked about volume trends. But just curious, any updates that you may have around the rate environment, particularly any kind of states that did midyear updates in their rates? And then my other question is just, an update on your health plan business and DSH payments relative to your guidance? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So the health plan, I think as we said earlier in the year, is operating at close to breakeven, that's pretty much what our expectations were, and I think we have every expectation that's the way we'll finish the year and so we're pleased with that turnaround over the last couple of years. And as that business operates at a breakeven and adds value to our markets in other ways, I think it's much closer to fulfilling our original intent for that business. I think our DSH numbers are coming in fairly close, and you'll see when we publish the Q, we give that detail. But I think they're kind of pretty close to what our expectations were. And then as far as rates go, Frank, again, when I look at sort of where we are for the six months in terms of revenue per unit, I think in the -- on the acute side, we're in sort of a 1% to 2% range, that's a little bit lower, but I think that's kind of a function of the -- sort of higher volumes, I would guess that as the year goes on, volumes will come down a little bit and rates will come up a little bit. Rates on the behavioral side in the sort of 2.5% range, I think, are pretty consistent with what our expectations are. So I don't think there's been any kind of midyear rate changes, either by government or commercial entities, that significantly change our outlook. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead. Mr. Giacobbe, please unmute your line. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. If I want to go to the behavioral business, I think I kind of conceptually understand the comment, that when length of stay drops, then it gives more room for admissions to increase and vice versa. So there is some interplay there, but that almost kind of implies that there is some sort of capacity constraint at the company to have -- need that, to have that trade-off, either from a bed perspective or from a staffing perspective. Why is it that we can't see both happen at the same time, do you feel like you need to add more beds or are there still some staffing shortage that's kind of acting as an offset? Steve Filton : Yes, and I didn't mean to imply Kevin, that's sort of the only dynamic and that effectively, where we can't drive revenue any higher under our existing capacity, and I think you're correct, when you describe sort of the -- the potential capacity constraints as being both physical beds and labor, but I think in some facilities, that's the case, and I do think if you go back and you look at length of stay and admissions for an extended period of time, you will see some of the interplay that I've talked about. Having said that, there is no question that our volume growth is still a little bit lower than we'd like it to be, and that we were expecting. I guess the two places that I point to in the quarter, one sort of obvious and just mechanical, we continue to have this facility in Panama City, Florida, which was closed in the fourth quarter of last year due to a hurricane, reopen sometime during the second quarter, but significantly down both revenue and volume wise in Q2. Hopefully by Q3, that will largely start to wash itself out. The other issue which I know we mentioned, at least in the last couple of calls is that, the addiction treatment business continues to struggle, again, both from a volume and a revenue perspective and that sort of provides some unfavorable movement of the needle on volumes that has nothing to do with capacity or the issues that we discussed in your question earlier. Kevin Fischbeck : So I guess, what is causing the addiction treatment center issues, and when do you think you can get those resolved? Steve Filton : Yes look, I think it's a -- it's a bit of a complicated dynamic, but it's mostly payer driven. I think payers are doing a couple of things. I mean one, they are clearly moving away from the out-of-network model that many providers sort of relied on, we relied on, in part, it was not our exclusive model. But as our patients move from out-of-network to in--network, generally the reimbursement rates are coming down. And I think payers are also looking for non-inpatient alternatives to addiction treatment, and we're seeing the impact of that as well. We continue to work on that business. We've seen some sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2. But again, I mean if I would point to a particular segment of the behavioral business that is, is driving that volume weakness, this would be it. Kevin Fischbeck : And maybe just last question, and I guess you touched on that maybe a little bit in the past two answers, but you mentioned that you don't really view the investigations being a huge overhang from a volume perspective or growth perspective. But then separately, you talked about how you do expect revenue to be growing or to accelerating in the psych business in the future. So what exactly do you think is going to be the biggest driver to that growth? Steve Filton : Well, and again, those to me are just two discrete statements. I think we have said all along, that our confidence that the volumes in the business would grow, is that our own internal data suggests that there remains a significant amount of unmet demand and a significant amount of what we describe as, deflections. Patients who we are unable to admit at various times, because of different reasons. Again, I mean you touched on some of them, a lack of a physical bed, the lack of sufficient clinical staff, certain clinical criteria, the inability to treat a particular diagnosis, etcetera. And I think we are working and have been working over the last several years on those issues. We have clearly made progress. I mean the revenue growth in our behavioral division is much higher in 2019, than it was back in 2015 and 2016. We are the first to concede that improvements have come slower than we expected. But what has always reinforced our fundamental bullishness, is this idea that there is a significant amount of unmet demand out there, and that the demand sort of dynamic and demand equation has not really changed in any basic ways, since the business slowed three or four years ago. Kevin Fischbeck : So when you say, Steven, then working to address these issues is, is that you're spending more on Cape or that you're hiring more nurses, what exactly is the driver to address those issues? Steve Filton : Yes, no, I think it's a multitude of issues, and I think, all of which we've discussed over the course of the last few years, we've added more beds, we've clearly added more personnel and really focused on recruitment and retention over the last several years, and I think we have improve that situation, and we've addressed the issue of our ability to treat a broader array of patients, particularly patients with more acute or more complicated illnesses and in particular, sometimes co-morbid medical surgical illnesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead, sir. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me? Steve Filton : I can hear you, Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, thanks. Steve, hoping you can give a little more of a sense of payer mix and/or volume trends in each of the commercial Medicaid and Medicare buckets, if there was sort of any acceleration from baseline or more pronounced move in any of those categories, specifically within the surgical comeback? Steve Filton : No, look Ralph, I think we made the point in Q1 that the surgical weakness or -- and that unfavorable shift from that from surgical to medical was not really payer related, but seemed to be relatively broad based, and almost by definition -- or maybe not by definition, but the improvement has not been, I think, payer based. Our payer mix, I think has been fairly consistent for a number of years now. On the acute side in particular, Medicare is probably our fastest growing payer. Medicaid follows that commercial is probably growing at a slightly slower rate, but still a positive rate, and uninsured rates have been generally the same. The only other kind of payer mix issue that I'd point out, certainly not unique to us, but amongst our commercial population, we certainly see a greater portion of the patient nor of [Phonetic] the bill, the overall hospital bill due from the patient and we've tried to modify our collection processes and procedures to address that. And again, we're certainly not unique in that phenomena that I think every healthcare provider has experienced over the last several years. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, that's helpful. And then you've had some volatility within the acute care stat particularly around sort of the components of revenue with periods of outsized volume and pricing stats. I know in the past you've talked about the dynamic around observation stays, and can't help but notice, a big admission number for sort of the quarter, and year-to-date. Just want to flush out, is there any of that observation noise still at play here or anything else to call out perhaps driving the optics or the stat that kind of makes up the overall revenue? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I don't think so. I mean I will say, certainly as we -- when we talk to our operators, this issue of observation versus admission is an ongoing issue at this point, really with our commercial payers. So again, it's an ongoing issue that we're constantly addressing. We have devoted a significant amount of both internal and external resources to the proper classification of patients, and making sure that we get paid appropriately from our payers. But I don't think, to your question, it's really influencing the optics of admission growth etcetera. I don't think we're seeing significant changes, back and forth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Following up on the share repurchase questions. I understand that doing M&A is a priority for the company. But if there are no deals, is there a minimum leverage ratio that you guys can sort of guide us to? So if there is no large deals -- so we think if you guys are running between 2.5 and 3 turns of leverage, is it just your repo or is that the right way of thinking about it? Steve Filton : Yes, Pito look, again, we're not going to commit to a specific leverage ratio on the call today or frankly at any point. I think we like to maintain flexibility, but we acknowledge that our current leverage ratio is low, probably relatively inefficient. But it leaves us a tremendous amount of flexibility to become a more active return of capital to shareholders, which I think we tried to signal in a couple of ways that we would be, in today's or yesterday's press release, but also leaves us the flexibility to respond to other opportunities that frankly we may or may not even be contemplating today, as we move forward, and so we're going to continue to do that. But I think the obvious sort of statement is, we've certainly operated the company at higher leverage levels than we're at today, for the right sort of deals and the right sort of investments back in the mid-2000 period, which may be a long time for investors. But for many of the members of management, it's not so long ago. We bought back probably over a two or three year period, and maybe 20% of the outstanding shares of the company. We're happy to do so. It made sense at the time, and if that sort of an opportunity presents itself in the future, so be it. Pito Chickering : Okay. I mean just sort of I guess, ask this a different way, if you guys are running at two turns of leverage with just your repo, are there any deals that you've seen in the last five years, that you guys couldn't complete by going from that leverage to higher multiples? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, look, it's one of the things about M&A it's difficult to answer, because we're not going to get into specifics of deals that we've looked at and contemplated and what their size was, etcetera. But look, your basic question, Pito, I think it's fair and our -- and maybe commentary. We have a lot of financial flexibility, given our capital structure. We acknowledge that. We like that, and we think that that flexibility, has allowed us over the last many years to respond to opportunities as they arose, and to be judicious employers or deplorers of capital, and I think we continue to view ourselves that way. Pito Chickering : And then one last quick follow-up here. We obviously see the key trends be very volatile over the last six months. As you look at the cadence of admissions during 2Q, do you plan on making any changes to staffing going to third quarter, or you assume that things normalized in the back half of the year, from a staffing perspective? Steve Filton : It's a great question. And honestly, it's an everyday challenge for hospital operators as their volume goes up, they have to decide whether it's kind of a [Indecipherable] increase that necessitates more permanent hires, or whether it's a more temporary sort of an increase that is better served by either over time or temporary nurses, registry nurses, etcetera. So honestly, I think we're making that judgment in each market, depending on what's happening in that market, etcetera. Look, I think it's fair to say that UHS' acute care volume strength is not something that's terribly new over the last several years, and quite frankly maybe for periods even much longer than that, our acute care volumes have generally been sort of industry-leading and ahead of our peers. So you know, again, I do think we think about our volume growth as -- that sort of above average volume growth, as sort of more of the norm for us, although again, as I mentioned earlier, I'm not sure that 5% is likely to persist. That would be an extraordinary level of volume growth to see over an extended period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks, good morning, Steve and Alan, and congrats on the strong results. And I guess just for us, there has been some continued ebb and flow and washed [ph] in this year, just around the push for greater transparency in hospital pricing and actually healthcare pricing overall. I guess, I'm just curious, if you have any updated thoughts around this topic from the UHS point of view. Thanks? Steve Filton : Look, I think as Steve -- the transparency tends to focus on two things. One is transparency for the individual patient, who does not have insurance or has a significant self-paid portion of insurance that is trying to negotiate a particular rate. Honestly, I think that affects a relatively small percentage of the population and a small percentage of the procedures. Healthcare is complicated and sometimes it's not always easy to just say, look I'm having gallbladder surgery, I want to know exactly what it's going to cost, that may be a difficult exercise for an individual patient. The other dynamic, which seems to be the focus of at least some legislators, is this idea that there ought to be complete transparency at the rates paid between private insurers and private hospitals, whether that is a concept that really will get traction and also proved to be legal, etcetera. I'm not sure. But at the end of the day, I believe that the broad outlines of that sort of pricing landscape are out there, I use the sort of easy example that if we've got a payer who is our -- the number one player in the market, and it becomes public knowledge that the rates that we accept from that payer are the lowest in the market. To me that's not a surprise. It's not a surprise to us, it\u2019s not a surprise to the payers in the market, and if a much smaller payer comes to us and says, well, now that I know that you accept much lower rates than this payer, we want you to accept the same rates from us. We are just not going to do it and no one is going to be able to force us to do that, unless the government decides that they're just going to set prices all around. And I don't think it's going to be the case. So I don't think we view transparency as something that will change our everyday business practices by a great deal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Peter Costa : Thanks and congratulations on the quarter. I had a couple of questions somewhat unrelated. The first one related to the acute care business. I appreciate your view of looking at it sort of over a six month period, but within that period, it sounds like there's a little bit of a difference in the second quarter of improvement, particularly McAllen and maybe Denison as well. And I'm wondering if you can scale those improvements for us, and then perhaps, where are we in terms of how much further there is to improve in those two markets? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean I think that's difficult to do, Peter. I think, you know what I was suggesting is that, earlier in Q1, there was a lot of focus on this idea that some people felt like the ramp for the balance of the year was aggressive or more dramatic than they imagined, etcetera, and we simply suggested that, the cumulative effect of these sort of mid-sized capital projects, was something that we thought was helping this ramp as the year went on. And that we were making the point I think, or I was making the point that, because it was not a whole hospital project like a Henderson or Temecula from several years ago, we tend not to talk about these individual projects, And therefore I cited and I saw it as a potential disconnect between our own internal model and the Street model. Look, at the end of the day, sort of our guidance is our guidance, and I think it suggests to -- not just suggests, it very explicitly said to The Street, this is what we expect our earnings power to be for the balance of the year, and our guidance remains unchanged, and I would just broadly say, we continue to have confidence in our full year guidance. Obviously, we sort of never really get into what the Texoma emergency room impact likely to have. I just don't think quite frankly that's a terribly productive conversation, when you get down to that granular level of detail. Peter Costa : Okay, that's helpful. And second question is more on the behavioral side, you've gone through the change in management there and I'm wondering if you've seen any out migration either of clinical staff for facility level management or referral sources to Acadia since Debbie went away? Steve Filton : No, look, I think that Debbie has talked about and we've acknowledged that a handful of personnel have moved over. I don't think that's a terribly significant surprise when somebody at that level and somebody of that tenure moves. But I think we're very comfortable with the staff that remains here. We've got a very deep and long tenured and hardworking bench that we're quite pleased with, and feel like when we fill that top slot, it will really just sort of round out our approach. As far as sort of the other issue of referral sources and payer behavior or whatever in market, I would say we've seen no impact whatsoever. And again, I wouldn't -- I'm not surprised that those markets tend to operate very independently, those clinicians think of themselves as the employees of XYZ hospital rather than sort of the broader corporate entity, and we frankly encourage that. So we've really seen none of that at the detail operating level Peter Costa : And then just lastly from a leadership position, where are you in that process at this point and do you think we're getting closer to the end of finding somebody? Steve Filton : Yes, when we undertook the process based on that, I mean, it has been a long time since we feel that, particularly behavioral position. But we've filled the comparable acute position a few times over the last few decades, and it has generally been an eight, nine month, 10 month process, we're starting to get towards the end of that, and I think we feel like the original estimate of time, we're about right in that. I'm not going to set an exact date, but I would think sometime within that range or close to it, we should have a very capable person sitting in that seat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with UBS. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Just wanted to follow-up on that last question. Just as it kind of relates to leadership. Is there anything strategically maybe that you're doing differently now in the behavioral business? Are we going to be talking about any new initiatives a year from now, any investments? Just wondering like what actually has changed like at the local field level in that division, and what we should expect to see in terms of changes in terms of initiatives and strategy going forward? Thanks. Steve Filton : Look Whit, I think we've talked a number of times about the fact that we are trying to use -- I mentioned before that it has been a long time since we changed at this top position in the behavioral segment. And so I think we would like to use the opportunity to at least reevaluate a potential sort of strategic reset. And that, I think, kind of a complete overhaul of the business, so I think we have a very successful business. But as we think about new technologies and things like telemedicine, the use of telemedicine in the behavioral space, or how the behavioral slice of the business interacts with the broader population management initiatives that we see in the healthcare, I think probably, to your point, as you frame the question, a year from now, I would guess that we may be talking about those dynamics more, than we had in the past, and I think where we're hoping that the opportunity to hire a new person with some different experience, etcetera, will allow us to engage and maybe more productively in those conversations. Whit Mayo : Okay. So we'll stay tuned there. I wanted to go back maybe for a second just on Pito's question around staffing. Now that we're at 4% unemployment wherever we are, I think most investors, at least in my conversations really struggle to see how acute care hospitals aren't seeing more pressure around staffing costs, and what are you seeing and how do you address the question and maybe if you could comment more specifically on contract labor and professional fees. Obviously, the physician staffing companies are under some level of stress at this point, so wonder if you're seeing more ask around subsidies, any comments would be helpful? Steve Filton : Sure. Look Whit, I think broadly your comments are fair, finding a sufficient number of qualified clinical personnel in -- frankly in either business segment, whether that's nurses or doctors, is definitely challenging, and a very significant portion of our operators' efforts I think are focused on recruitment and retention, again, of qualified clinical personnel, whether that's nurses or doctors. Look, the issue again, when you talk about -- when you sort of look at 4% unemployment, how are we not more challenged. I mean, I think we are challenged, but this is always one of those things where we don't have to outperform 99% of the universe. We just have to outperform our local competitors, who are basically -- who we're competing for, for those clinical personnel. And so, we work very hard at recruitment and retention policies that allow us to do that. It's a big focus and I think our flexibility, our willingness to be creative, etcetera, helps us in that endeavor. But it's absolutely a challenge. And look, I think one of the reasons why the two businesses appear not to have as much cost pressure, as you might expect is, we saw a lot of that cost pressure two or three years ago. Frankly, I think as a company, we talked about it a lot more in 2015 and 2016 than many of our peers. I don't know if that's because we were feeling it sooner in our markets or just because maybe we were being more realistic about the impacts of it. But I think to a degree, what we're seeing now two or three years later is that, those pressures at least as they are reflected in the financial statements, have anniversaried themselves and have largely sort of stabilized. Whit Mayo : Can you comment maybe on professional fees and the question around the physician staffing company subsidies, any color would be helpful? Steve Filton : I think other than anecdotally, I mean look, I can -- I could tick off three or four examples throughout our portfolio, where we've seen some pressure from our contract physician providers for increased subsidies or fees or whatever it might be. But I don't think that overall, and I have said -- few people have asked about our other operating expenses over the last several years, and I think a little bit of a tick-up in that, on that line is some of that pressure. But I don't think it's really enormously needle moving in terms of really keeping margins suppressed or anything like that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just a few quick questions. First, Steve, you had mentioned the ongoing DoJ investigation costs were about $10 million or so annually that would go away as this closes. Do you anticipate any measurable costs from complying with the, with the CIA that you're going to have to sign? It seems like other companies might point to a couple of million dollars or so associated with that. But want to get your thoughts. Steve Filton : Yes. So again I think we've tried to be clear, we've seen nothing specific from the government, so it would be difficult for us to kind of frame what the costs could or should be. But I guess and maybe I should have been a little bit clearer than this, I mean I think that the relief of those legal fees at a minimum, should help to fund whatever that incremental costs might be. Gary Taylor : Right. And then I may be just missed the tail-end of your response to Frank's question, I didn't catch if he asked it explicitly. But was there, was there anything to call out in the acute EBITDA this quarter in terms of just supplemental payments, extra supplemental payments or something that we might see in the Q? Steve Filton : I don't think anything material. Gary Taylor : Okay. And my last one, maybe this one more for Alan, if he's still listening, I was just thinking about Intermountain acquiring Healthcare Partners Nevada and just what are the implications of that? Do you think that's a precursor to them wanting to get into the Vegas hospital market? How much would you care about that? Any thoughts would be interesting Steve Filton : Yes, I mean I'll answer that. [Indiscernible] we've routinely discussed here, so I think we're of the same mind. Look, I think the good news, as this process unfolded, we had concerns that United would be able to keep this business, and I think that would have created a real competitive advantage for them. So when the FTC required them to sell this business, I think that -- we view that as a favorable development. I guess, ideally, we would have liked for the business to be sold to a payer, who would have no real presence in the market, that would have been sort of perfect from our perspective. But the fact that the business has been sold to a provider, who doesn't really have much of a presence in the market, I think is kind of maybe the next best thing. Look, I think it's a signal as you sort of alluded to in your question, that over time, Intermountain probably will -- either has plans or will execute plans to develop some sort of provider present in the market. But obviously, that will take some time, and they will have some obstacles to overcome, in a market that is sort of well entrenched amongst a small number of providers. So we face sort of competitive dynamics in all of our markets. This will be a new one in Las Vegas. But it's not one that at the moment we're losing sleep over. Although to be fair, we're focused on it and we are prepared to respond to it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. John, your line is open. John Ransom : Hi, good morning. This is sort of an [indiscernible] question and I don't mean to imply that it's material short term, but we have heard in behavioral, that the payers are starting -- the managed care payers are starting to layer in some outcomes type, penalties, for example readmissions within a certain timeframe. And so my question is, are you seeing that, number one. And then number two, do you think anywhere in our lifetime, we're going to see any meaningful type of quality/outcomes data in behavioral, which certainly has lagged this in acute by a decade or more. But just curious to see if, if this is a way of raising the bar and if there is anything to this? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. Yes, I'll go in reverse order, John. I mean certainly, your comment is accurate, the sophistication and the maturity of quality reporting and outcomes reporting in the behavioral segment, certainly lags. The acute care med-surg segment and maybe other service lines as well. But I think UHS has sort of been on cutting edge. We have worked directly with the joint commission as an example, to develop more standardized quality and outcomes reporting. I think we do more in that area than just about anybody else in this space. But I agree with you, we are probably several years behind where the med-surg industry is. As far as the sort of specific dynamic of payers having sort of readmission penalties, I don't think we've seen that. I also find it a little bit incongruous, in an environment where payers are -- at least in our own minds, you know, aggressively and in some cases, arbitrarily insisting on shorter length of stay in earlier discharges of patients, for the payers then to come back and suggest that we should then bear penalty, because those patients have to be readmitted, when we thought they were prematurely discharged. We would struggle with that. So we've not seen that in any sort of material or measurable way. John Ransom : So just what is the benchmarking for quality? What is being measured and do you even have electronic medical records yet in behavioral, is it just some qualitative reporting, is there anything that's being measured at this point? Steve Filton : Yes, look, I think things like use of restraints and frequency of restraints, outcomes, measurements are actually being measured. I mean it's probably too complicated and by the way, I'm probably not the best person as a non-clinical person to be the one to address it. But happy offline to share more of that detail. Operator : Gentlemen, your final question comes from the line of Steve [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Steve, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, Steve. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just wanted to the clarify first on the DSH commentary before, you said tracking in line with guidance. I think guidance is for DSH to be down -- well, Medicaid supplemental payments to be down $30 million year-on-year in '19. And so I just want to understand, is that sort of still the latest thinking, is that what you're tracking to and maybe anything to know in the cadence there? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, I think as we disclosed in the first quarter, it's a little bit less than that or the decline is not as great. But I don't think in the second quarter, the trajectory changed a great deal from what our first quarter Q had. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, okay. And maybe just one on the behavioral side then as well. So noticing same facility earnings were higher than non-comp -- or sorry, higher than total. So like the non-comp facilities seem to have lost about $7 million in the quarter. I am just sort of thinking about what's in that bucket. I think Danshell will fall in there. It's 25 hospitals, but it looks like there is 39, just the way you guys reported. So maybe Panama City is another one. But can you remind us sort of what else may be in there, and then how Danshell did in the quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. So Danshell is tracking pretty much. I think when we acquired them, they had about a $10 million annual EBITDA stream, and I think they are tracking something close to that quarterly, obviously. I think in terms of otherwise, the non-same-store -- I know we had a -- Florida has eliminated their CON and we had I think a $3 million write-off or so of our behavioral CON assets that and that non-same-store number. I can't think of anything else terribly material in that number for the quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Perfect. And just maybe bigger picture thinking Danshell and UK, can you give us your thoughts on how that business is doing, maybe your level of interest and potentially growing the UK business on the behavioral side? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, look, I think that Danshell is sort of reflective of the way that we envision growing the UK. It was a small -- again $100 million so acquisition. And I think we are looking for those sort of one-off, either development opportunities. We've done a few de novo developments. We've added beds to a number of facilities in the UK. We've done a few smaller acquisitions like Danshell and a company called Alpha. But I think other than that, it's not like we are looking to increase the size of our footprint in the UK by multiple times, that's not our intent. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. All right, thanks a lot Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. Steve Filton : Okay. We just thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everyone again next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, CFO, Steve Filton. Thank you. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO is also joining us this morning. And we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the Third Quarter ended September 30, 2019. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends, before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, our reported net income attributable to UHS during the third quarter of 2019 was $97.2 million or $10 per diluted share. As calculated on the Supplemental Schedule our adjusted net income attributable to UHS adjusted during the third quarter of 2019 was $176.3 million or $99 per diluted share. Excluded from our adjusted net income during the Third Quarter of 2019 was an aggregate unfavorable after-tax impact of $79.1 million or $0.89 per diluted share, most of which related to a provision or has an impairment recorded in connection with our Foundation's recovering network business. On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2019 increased 9.3% over last year's comparable quarter. The increased revenues resulted primarily from a 7.4% increase in adjusted admissions, and a 1.6% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, net revenues on our behavioral health division increased 2.1% during the third quarter of 2019, as compared to the third quarter of 2018. During this year's third quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.5%, and adjusted patient days increased 0.4%. Revenue per adjusted admission increased 2% and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.2%, during the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the comparable prior-year quarter. Based upon the operating trends and financial result experienced during the first nine months of 2019, we are revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year end of December 31, 2019 to $9.60 to $9.90 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $9.70 to $10.40 per diluting share. This revised estimated guidance range, which excludes the unfavorable impact of the Foundation's asset impairment, the unfavorable impact of the current year increased in the department of justice reserve and related provision for income taxes and the favorable impact of the ASU 2016-2019 increases the midpoint of the previously provided range by 3%. Contributing to and included in the revised estimated earnings guidance range for the year end at December 31, 2019, is an annualized loss of $0.11 per diluted share recorded during the first nine months of 2019 resulting from a decrease in the market value of certain marketable securities held for investment and classified as available for sale. The revised estimated earnings guidance range for the whole year of 2019 assumes no change in the market value of these marketable securities during the fourth quarter of 2019. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, our net cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.049 billion from $949 million generated during the comparable nine-month period of 2018. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the third quarter of 2019, as compared to 54 days during the third quarter of 2018. At September 30, 2019, our ratio of debt-to-total-capitalization declined to 42.3% as compared to 42.9% at September 30, 2018. We spent $156 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2019, and $480 million during the first nine months of 2019. During the first nine months of 2019, we completed and opened 183 new beds at some of our busiest acute care and behavioral health hospitals. Just this week, we broke ground on a new acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada, which will have 200 private patient rooms and is expected to open in 2022. We also broke ground on a new five-storey bed tower at our Centennial Hills Hospitals in Las Vegas, Nevada, which will add 56 patient beds and increased capacity in the neonatal intensive care unit and intermediate and medical surgical units. Our behavioral health joint venture pipeline continues to be very robust. In September, we announced the partnership with Valley Children's Healthcare in which we will build a new 128 bed behavioral health facility in Madera, California, which is expected to open in 2022. And earlier this week, we announced the partnership with HonorHealth in which we will build a 120-bed behavioral health hospital in Scottsville, Arizona, which is estimated to open in 2021. In conjuncture with our stock repurchase program during the third quarter of 2019, we have repurchased approximately 551,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $79.5 million, an average of approximately $144 per share. During the first nine months of 2019, we have repurchased approximately 4.11 million shares at an aggregate cost of $525 million, an average of approximately $128 per share. And since inception of the program in 2014 through September 30, 2019, we have repurchased approximately 14.7 to 14.8 million shares, at an aggregate cost of approximately $1.76 billion at an average of approximately $119 per share. Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, Good morning. This is Andrew Mac [ph] on for Steve. Just wanted to follow up on the strong acute volumes in the quarter, how much of visibility do you have on the elevated volumes and what steps can you take going forward to better capture earnings associated with those volumes? SteveFilton: Sure. So obviously, our acute care volumes have been strong all year long and frankly have been strong for the last several years, I think, reflecting the underlying strength of the end markets in which we're located as well as our continued trends of increased market share. Having said that, volumes increased even more in the third quarter, you'll recall that earlier in the year, we talked about an expectation that that could likely happen as we were bringing some new capital projects on in late 2018 and early 2019, and I think we're seeing the impact of that as well but as your question suggests, that increased volume did create some challenges for us in the quarter, as we tried to satisfy that volume, we found ourselves in the position of having to use more premium pay that is temporary nurses, registry nurses, overtimes, shift at rental, etc., as well as other nonlabor costs, locum physicians, and contract services, etc., as the volumes increased. While we had some anticipation that we were going to have to deal with those issues, we acknowledge that we're operating in most of our markets with pretty tight labor conditions and even where we're anxious to fill vacancies on a permanent basis, we're not always able to do so immediately. So, that I think was the challenge in the quarter and why we were unable to bring as much of that revenue and volume growth and pull it through to the EBITDA line. But I think we have a point of view that our operators historically have responded to these sort of challenges and will in short order drive greater efficiencies as they adjust to the higher level of volumes. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. As a follow-up, is it fair to say that underlying wage growth remains within expectations in the low single digit percent range? SteveFilton: I think that is fair. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck. Your line is open. KevinFischbeck: All right, great. Thanks. I just wanted to understand the guidance just a little bit. You know, if you cut it by about $0.30 and it looks like in the quarter $0.13 cents was due to the marketable securities dynamics, so this guidance to the last guidance, you know, $0.17 cents, I guess is operational or is there anything else besides EBITDA that changed in your view between the previously and today? SteveFilton: No, I don't think so, Kevin, I think effectively, we were, adjusting our guidance as you suggest for the miss in the third quarter and for the negative adjustment for the marketable securities that, as you might expect, we really have no way of projecting. KevinFischbeck: We see how you've changed the guidance. You change the low end basically for the change of marketable securities, but you change the high end by a whole lot more. So can you talk a little bit about, kind of, I guess, maybe what the hope or the expectation was and what the implications for Q4, you seem, optimistic that labor costs on this, at least on the acute side could be fixed relatively quickly? Is that not going to be a Q4 dynamic? SteveFilton: Yes. I mean, I think it's just a mechanical sort of exercise. Kevin, you know, there's one quarter left in the year and in order for us to get to the high end of that original guidance, the performance, quite frankly, of both segments would have to have improved rather markedly, I think, while we have an expectation that we can improve the underlying trends in both business segments, you know, in the next quarter, there's, you know, by definition, sort of almost a limited amount that we can do. KevinFischbeck: Okay. And then just the last question on the psych side, I guess, we saw a slowdown in growth sequentially, you know, anything that you would point to there and, I guess, how do you feel about the pace and time in the ramping that back to what you talked about as a normalized growth rate? SteveFilton: Sure. I mean, the revenue needle is not moving a great deal in the behavioral segment, but I understand that people are very focused on, and I think for the first three months of the year, semester revenue grew by about 3% and in the second quarter grew by about 2%. So it was a slight step down. There was really nothing terribly extraordinary in the third quarter, some minor items we had, you know, currency headwind in the UK that was probably worth about $3 million headwind, the EBITDA, we had a couple of million dollar headwind to EBITDA from the continued ramp up and reopening of our behavioral facility in Panama City, Florida that had been closed by the hurricane a year ago, and we have a continued drag from our addiction treatment business, which was probably, you know, a $3 million or $4 million negative EBITDA drag in the quarter. Other than that, you know, I wouldn't call out anything sort of extraordinary. I think we continue to be challenged in selected markets and hospitals with labor shortage issues where we're having to cap census and turn away patients, but I think over time we think that we can correct those situations and that volume and revenue growth could be restored in the behavioral segment. KevinFischbeck: Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Lake. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Could we talk a little bit about acute care pricing, Steve? About 1.5% this quarter, and then you look closer to 2.5% and that might have been one of the headwinds to acute here on 3Q. So can you walk us through what the issues were in the quarter and kind of highlight mix both on the commercial mixing acuity while you're doing that. Thanks. SteveFilton: Sure. So just to reframe things for everyone, we went into the year with an expectation that acute care revenues would grow in the 5% to 6% range and we presumed that that would be split pretty evenly between price and volume about 2.5% to 3% increase in both. Obviously from a volume perspective, we've been exceeding those numbers by a very significant amount all year long, and as I said before, even increasing some in the third quarter. On the pricing side, it's been a little volatile, but for the year and for the third quarter, pricing as you know, Justin, instead of in that 1.5% range, which is, you know, 100 or 125 basis points, kind of, short of our expectation. I think in the third quarter, that's probably a function of maybe three discrete trends. One is with the extremely high ER volumes. ER visits were up 6% to 7% in the quarter. We've seen an increase in uninsured, you know, we've seen our uninsured volume pick up for the quarter. We've also seen, even though, we had relatively strong surgical volumes in the quarter, I think overall surgeries are up 5% or 6% in the quarter, with overall admissions up 7.5%. It implies that we are seeing a slight skew to more medical cases rather than surgical cases. That also sort of tends to mute acuity a little bit and drive down pricing. And finally, I think we're seeing some more aggressive behavior on the part of our payers, and we saw an elevated level of denials in the quarter. So I think those three items, elevated denials, slightly higher uncompensated care, and slightly lower acuity as the three items driving that what I'll call 100 to 125 basis points shortfall in pricing for the quarter. Justin Lake : Okay. And then if I could just follow up, you know, looking ahead, to 2020, Steve, I know your typical framework is, you know, mid to high single digit acute, and you know, you're pretty conservative coming into the yearend and rightly so on behavioral, probably in the flattest range with some share repurchases. Is that how we should think about the framework for 2020 or anything around that'd kind of move the needle we should be considering? Thanks SteveFilton : Yes. I mean, we will not formally give our guidance until the fourth quarter earnings at the end of February, but I think you know the way that you framed, the underlying assumptions for the two business segments, kind of the way we framed it in 2019, is I don't know that we'll feel terribly differently, but we certainly would like the benefit of the ensuing four to five months to give us a better perspective on how the two businesses are trending. Again, my overall comments are, we're pleased with the acute care volumes and they're really sort of at extraordinary levels and again I think that reflects the underlying strength of our franchises. But we also expect that we'll be able to drive more efficiencies and better margins out of that level of volume and revenue growth over time. And on the behavioral side, we continue to work in a very focused way to restore the volume and revenue growth. And I will point out one encouraging trend in the quarter in behavioral is we've seen some stabilization in length of stay, which has really been kind of a troubling dynamic for us for several years. So if length of stay can stabilize and remain stabilized, I think we've got a bunch of strategies in place to drive higher volumes, but you know, when we give our guidance in four or five months, we'll be more explicit about that for 2020. Justin Lake : All right, thanks a lot for the call. Operator : Your next question comes from an Ann Hines [ph]. Your line is open. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, good morning. Can you give a mission trends per pair class, like the uninsured, commercial, Medicare, Medicaid. And I know you had an uptick in uninsured. Are there any specific states that are more troubling than other states? SteveFilton: I'd just sort of broadly try and give some color, you know, if the overall admissions are growing by 7.5% in revenue per adjusted admission, I think Medicare admissions are growing the fastest than Medicaid, then uninsured admissions. And I think commercial admissions, you know, continue to be positive that are probably growing inside of the low single digits maybe 3% to 4% and uninsured admissions, which have been growing maybe 5% to 6% in previous quarters or maybe, you know, 8% or 9%, just given again, I think it's really driven by that increased level of the ER activity in terms of sort of the geographic kind of dispersion of that. I think we've long sort of disclosed that our biggest uninsured markets tend to be in South Texas and in Amarillo that had been changed but I think the increase and then uncompensated volumes in the quarter is pretty widespread because again the strength in our E. R. volumes are pretty widespread in the quarter. UnidentifiedAnalyst: All right and one last question I'm surprised you didn't buy back more shares in the quarter given your increase authorization last quarter what goes into making I'm that type of position on a quarterly basis and general can you talk about the acquisition market going forward. SteveFilton: Yes. I'm we continue to pursue a great many acquisition of potential acquisition opportunities in both the accused available space as well as you know organic capital investment can I describe a few of those in my opening comments and again particularly I think on the acute side I think that the extraordinary volume growth they were experiencing is a function at least in part some of these really well placed capacity additions and are growing market so we feel good about that strategy the problem with potential acquisitions as we look at a whole lot it's always hard to tell what will pay off and what won't and what we'll see that happening I mean I think from our share repurchase perspective we talked about buying back something like $700 million or $800 million worth of shares for the year and I think we're sort of on that on pace to do that I think we respond to what we consider to be buying opportunities as they arise certainly earlier in the year I think we responded to some softness in the stock price that we thought was driven by also recalled to factors like concern over Medicare for all or some of the sort of you know regulatory concerns your legislator concerns that we thought were sort of not work very well played so you know we continue to do that and again I think if you look back and I think the metrics that I described in my opening remarks are reflective of the fact that over the last 4 or 5 years we've got a very steady buyer of all our shares and I think we'll continue to do so and accelerate that activity where it seems like you know there's an opportunity in the market for us to do so. UnidentifiedAnalyst: All right, thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Josh Raskin, your line is open. JoshRaskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I'll admit it's probably a little bit of a number of questions I'm not sure there's a great answer but just the volatility in the acute segment earnings that seems like volumes have been relatively strong the whole time your rabbit you know all your revenues but that sort of in and out to the quarters I guess I'm just curious what's creating that sort of EBITDA fluctuation I don't know if there's been big benefit design changes or slower seasonality or if there's something else in the market or is it just it's a relatively small number of hospitals and you know quarters or short periods and any thoughts on that would be helpful. SteveFilton: I don't think it's an unfair question Josh and if there has been certainly more volatility particularly in Q-Care business this year that I think we've been accustomed to historically in the first half of the year we talked a lot about so the best service line mix that the year started with really rather soft surgical volumes and that we found it late in the first quarter and continued into the second quarter and that sort of stealing medical procedure in the first quarter and surgical procedures in the second quarter created that level of volatility in the third quarter I just described you know what I thought were the main matrix being kind of a slightly lower than expected pricing or revenue per unit I don't really know what to say I mean it's you know volatility of sort of what it is about to the degree that that these sorts of things but her you know I think that the business will be a little bit longer than we expected. I think what we view as most encouraging particularly in the Q-care business is how strong the volumes are and sort of how relatively consistently strong baseband and I think we have a point of view that as time goes on our operators will be in a position regardless of some of the volatility in expenses and some of the volatility in pricing there's a there's a real advantage to be able to deal with those strong valium and they're real efficiencies that can be garner from that and I think over time and over more than a single quarter will be able to do that. JoshRaskin: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Just within the line, you know, the foundations objects and worked out as expected did you did you give him the update on costs around the addiction treatment segment overall which is kind of more foundation specific or you think this is you know sort of industry trends the I'm working just with the industry transit just be curious to get your perspective on that segment specifically. SteveFilton: Sure. Well, you know, we made the point when we acquired foundations back in 2015 that. This was not a new entree for us into the addiction treatment the you know for as long as we've been in the behavioral health segment we've been in the addiction treatment there's as we had very dedicated I'll call the legacy facilities dedicated addiction treatment facility we offer addiction treatment services and units in many of our general psychiatric hospitals so. We were really just increasing our investment in the addiction treatment business and really acquiring a company that had a different model than what had been sort of our legacy model so the foundations model was really premised on a few different things. One was kind of direct to consumer marketing they had a very sophisticated infrastructure in which they you know advertised and on the internet and on media and would get patients to call and contact them directly and then they would process those patients for medical necessity and appropriate treatment locations etcetera so yes with their direct to consumer marketing there was a kind of a blend of the in and out of network pricing and there was a fair amount of travel for treatment for patients and I think what has really changed in terms of all call that got through the new style foundations model is that. All of those metrics have really been challenged by the tires over the last several years so there is much last out of network is really bad almost now a current you know a largely in network model there is much last year travel for treatment and there is also I think more and more control by the tires and less and less by the consumers themselves about where treatment can be rendered so it just made in the last 3 or 4 years that underlying kind of style model more challenging I will make the point that many of our legacy addiction treatment facilities and build the units within our general psychiatric hospitals have continued to function very well and respond to what yes I think we all recognize is the growing addiction illness issue in the US and demand. so the challenge that we've had and you know what we what we are responding to is how do we address that foundations model and we are very focused on doing that and doing it quickly reducing the drag on our earnings and I think you know in short order will either revise the model will invalid the temptations facilities more inserted into our legacy model but one way or the other I think we are committed to reducing the drag on our earnings and in a very short order. AlanMiller: Hi, there. That are for the first few years after the acquisition are we did very well in the business but then the nature of the business change as Steve pointed out how patients were contacted did contact level and we're making adjustments to the change of the business. JoshRaskin: Perfect, thank you both. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Fidel [ph], your line is open. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, thanks. First question, it might be helpful just given some of the different moving pieces in each of the segments just how in the third quarter shortfall broke down relative to the internal planned between the acute care and that the April business to grab sort of like a percentage breakdown of that. SteveFilton: Sure. So it sometimes will point out differences between our internal budget and the streaking times but on overall basis our internal planned this quarter was pretty close to the street consensus all right and so obviously we were short of planned okay that shortfall was probably predominantly in the behavioral segment maybe 2/3 of the shortfall in April one third in the queue on the acute side I think yes we were closer to our internal plan although that so the components of how you get there were a little bit different obviously our values a lot higher than we expect. Obviously our values a lot higher than we expected and as we discussed earlier you know our operating efficiencies and our pricing were a little bit lower than expected on the cable side as you know we talked about you know volumes and revenue took a slight in a lot of step back in the quarter but I think you know we're operating at a pretty high efficiency level they are so even with a slight decline in and revenue from volumes it just makes it tough to ring you know any further operating efficiencies out of the business you know obviously are run I'm you know prominent concern is the quality of care to our patients so you know we're not going to compromise that any way to put some pressure on the market. UnidentifiedAnalyst: God, that's awful, not just as my follow-up; yes, I know there were some recent changes in taxes than the uncompensated care call but I know that there's some question takes around how that sort of translate in that can you maybe to sort of walk us through you know how that increase will flow through and then then what some of the objects are and how you think about that and in that case thank you. SteveFilton: Yes. So I -- you know, I've been doing this a little bit of this remember he's got but I believe you know the sort of the headline news was that Texas was increasing they are cool uncompensated care funds what the next fiscal year by about 25% but when we were sort of ran through calculations in the allocations I think our perspective was that all our you know our own kind of daycare reimburse would increase by about 8% or 9% in taxes in the coming year. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve [ph], your line is open. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe I'll just ask a couple quick ones they this things that maybe one on strategy and I guess an acute could you give us a sense for what you think the impact of the new capital projects where Steve that you'd called out on adjusted missions and maybe just the extra business day do you think that had any impact there is anyway to think through that one. SteveFilton: Our topic the second one first the you know I know that lots companies talk about it after we tend to ignore these Calgary impact I think not because they're not we yell or they might not. You have a short term impact but I think our point of view is that over extended period of time you know extra week day point $0.25 an extra holiday unical whatever it is you know really doesn't make a difference and doesn't enter into the way we're managing the business you know it's part it's difficult to say sometimes precisely the impact you know I know all we were adding capacity were added your capacity exactly how many of our you know incremental your patients are related to the new pastor new bad your new cath lab your new all ours but I think we definitely have a perspective and I think we talked about earlier in the year you know I think in the first and second quarter people looked at the ramp up that we had in the back half of the year you know I question a little bit of the logic of why we were expecting you know stronger growth particularly acute side in the back at the beer and I think we responded at the time that we had a number of kind of local the medium size $25 million to $35 million projects coming on things like an expanded emergency room at our manatee Florida hospital or an expanded emergency room an inpatient capacity about Texoma facility that Dallas in Texas and again I think that you know the uptake in in their missions for the quarter is reflective of some of that but in terms of being able to precisely identify sort of exactly how much of the incremental emissions in the quarter are related to the capital and it's a little hard to do. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Fair enough. And then dish payments have -- where did this come in Q3? And in total -- and how that compared to year ago their swing there? SteveFilton: So I know you're among those most focused on the schedule that we have in the 10 Q. and 10 K. that describes our supplemental payments and so you know that could be more clear to see when we file our Q and a couple weeks. But I think that our supplemental payments increased by about $24 million in the Q3 of 2019 combination taxes, uncompensated care in California UPL that compares I think about a $19 million increase in the Q3 of last year so that net Caroline was about $5 million in this year's Q3 versus last year. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Perfect, thanks. And then one more maintenance than a new one question on strategies are but that the guidance system just to confirm re maintaining guidance revenue and adjusted EBITDA, there is a stand what's with that? SteveFilton: Yes, I think the category it's always been it's been our practice to kind of mid-year we revise our EPS guidance and we just sort of assume that people will arise revenue and EBITDA guides proportionally. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay. And then finally, just the last thing here sorry for the length there but I'm just with the overall trends and behavioral and kind of the reasons you decided in the release and the for the impairment charge and obviously just dollars often the cute continuing are your thing about capital allocation and expansion kind of between the businesses is there even a star prioritizing acute expansion or do you think it's early to make that determination is more strategically. I would appreciate that view thanks a lot. SteveFilton: Yes. Look, I've been doing this a long time and Alan is doing a lot longer than I have and I think you know we are sometimes in use because over the years the tone of questions change you know we've gotten questions for years you know why would we ever invest meek you care business David this is billing so much better and in recent years maybe the Taliban as it has changed a little bit I think we tend to view our two business segments on a much longer term basis I think we believe that they are both very sound growth oriented business is that yes I'll eat your face you know challenges in the short term and look I think that when you think about the behavior of business and you think about all our integration or joint venture strategy it's reflective of the fact when we started this process of talking to acute care hospitals about taking over there big hero this is as we kind of assumed that many of these not for profit acute care hospitals which is sort of turn over there keep your businesses I mean there's a real businesses to watching a lease on a bad still live sell their facilities to live and I think what we've found that they remain extremely bullish about these businesses even though they haven't done a great job of managing them and they haven't been terribly efficient they acknowledge that the demand for behavioral services is doing nothing but growing and they are seeing more and more behavioral patient and they are quicker. So instead of just you know leasing bags and taking over these here that so many of these projects have turned into new joint capital projects now building new hospitals and building new bad would argue care hospital partners to build new behave real bad and I think it's just a reflection of their and our bullishness about the idea that this business is just the demand for this is going to continue to grow for the foreseeable future so we have no desire to in any way sort of reduce our exposure to this business which certainly doesn't mean that we're not going to make selective decisions to reduce our exposure to businesses model may not be working like a nation's an increase in other areas but overall we aren't remain very bullish about the paper. AlanMiller: Yes, let me just add. We make our investments basically for long run and. The nonprofit sector and ourselves all looking long term for population health and I think that created a great need all of their park poor ability behavior in health sector which they haven't had so we have a number of opportunities for joint ventures and Steve has a numerator if you in the in his opening remarks and I just see that continuing. UnidentifiedAnalyst: Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from AJ Rice, your line is open. A.J.Rice: Hi, everybody. Just a couple things still forget that some of the areas that have been out are you talking about but only Q-care obviously the top line was strong but there was sort of this negative expense leverage that hit the earnings from the division so if I think about the reasons that you get that kind of leverage I mean obviously could be expenses are growing more rapidly just in and of themselves doesn't sound like you're pointing to that so that you may be pointing a little bit to price it makes is an issue there but then there's also this adjusting for the increase in volumes and I love it anyway to break out or give a little more colors how much would be pricing makes versus the adjusting to the volumes but I'd also be interested whether when you look at that adjusting stabbing etcetera to the volumes do you think that is just the way it goes in a while of period where the numbers are bouncing around from quarter to quarter or you look and say, \"Hey, maybe we don't have the time with day that coming up our operators that we need and we need to do some investment there or maybe our operators are all flat-footed responding\", I guess I'd be interested in your perspective on how you access that. Is that -- is something you just got to live with or is there thing you can do to adjust for it? SteveFilton: Yes. I think fundamentally, A.J., the reason that the hospital business has always been one, where there's a decent amount of operating leverage as volumes and revenues increase, is because ultimately, and I think it's particularly true, I mean an acute business, a good chunk of our expenses and cost structure is fixed and semi-fixed. So when a new patient -- an incremental patient comes to the hospital, in theory, the only really valuable and incremental cost is the nurse at the bedside and whatever specific supplies and drugs that that patient consumes. And so as a consequence, in theory, there's a great deal of operating leverage that should be available as you get more and more incremental business and we've gotten a lot of incremental business in the last quarter, and frankly, over the last year.  The challenge has been, we're getting that business in a pretty well-bust economy with very low unemployment, basically full employment and I think in our markets maybe even more well-bust employment than in the national average. And as a consequence, we're feeling a lot of that valuable cost with a lot more expensive valuable cost, with overtime, with temporary nurses, registered nurse pay et cetera. And even low-income positions and all that sort of stuff. And so you're, I think mitigating a lot of what would be the traditional benefit. Over time and I don't think it's an over extended period of time, but over time, we'll solve that problem by filling vacancies more permanently by negotiating with vendors more effectively et cetera, but yes, that's the challenge. That's the short-term challenge is that what we do think, what would otherwise be the traditional operating leverage with a lot of premium pay and sort of delayed expenses. But over time, we should be able to solve that problem. And I think, our operative have demonstrated the ability to do that over one period of time. Yes, great, many times. A.J.Rice: Okay. And then on the [indiscernible] side, obviously it's not a huge swing from approaching 3% comparable growth, same time growth to 2%, but obviously it had a meaningful impact on the trajectory of the profits of the business. So I guess I'm wondering there. We heard about things like Medicaid disenrollment, the Medicaid numbers are down and I know they will get some decent amount from state programs, I know third quarter -- can be a while of seasonal quarter for behavioral, is this maybe just a -- more a broad swing and seasonality than normal? I guess, you've talked about for a couple quarters now in link to stay stabilized, you need to be more aggressive and getting the admissions through and that's a little bit of an offset there they're going to need you to compensate for. Any flavor on those other items and how much they may have -- I mean, is this just an unusual seasonal swing that sometimes you get or is Medicaid [ph] have any impact? SteveFilton: So look, I think you're making a decent point. On third quarter, I think particularly in Behavioral tends to always be our softest quarter, particularly in the adolescence business when kids are not in school, we tend to get fewer referrals from adolescence business. But that's through -- every third quarter. Look the challenge you sort of described as you framed the question is, revenue growth dropped from 3% in the first 6 months to 2% in the third quarter. It's a pretty small decline. I highlighted a few items earlier in the call that I thought contributed to that decline, the currency impact in the U.K. and the foundations business and the Panama City facility. But other than that, I mean, there was nothing that, I think, we or our operatives could identify in the quarter that was really a specific negative trend in the quarter et cetera, which is why, I think, we have a point of view that we'll rebound more in the next few quarters to the levels we had been running. Operator : Your next question comes from Sarah James. SarahJames: You mentioned that there was some increase denials from payers on the acute side. Can you provide more color on that? Was there a pattern for the type of service that was being denied and is that just a few payers or is that more of a widespread trend? SteveFilton: So I would say and again, this is necessarily not the first time that we mentioned the fact that our payers on frankly, both sides of the business have gotten more aggressive in the last several years about admission criteria and medical necessities et cetera. I would say that probably the most common area of denials on the acute side is over the issue of inpatient status, those are observations. So it's really not so much an issue of whether a patient belongs in the hospital as it is an issue of whether they should be categorized as an inpatient or an observation patient.  Obviously, as an inpatient, they would have a high reimbursement. I don't know whether the third quarter activity is really reflective on the change and behavior on the part of payers or just sort of a -- kind of a coincidental thing. I will say, Sarah, it is not specific to a specific payer or a specific geography. It is something that we're seeing relatively widespread. To be fair, it's not terribly new and we have a lot of infrastructure in place to deal with the issue of proper classification of patients. We engaged third-party expertise to create to -- lend some objectivity to the process and some weight to our -- to the degree that we're having disputes with our payers. So we continue to be focused on that. But as I was just describing a little bit of the softness and pricing to the quarter, I thought that the elevated level denials did contribute at least partially to that. SarahJames: That's very helpful. And one more clarification need. You talked a lot about the mechanics of bringing on temporary staff on volume growth. I'm wondering if you could help size the impact it might have had to expenses in the third quarter because you also talked about it subsiding in the next couple of quarters. I'm just wondering, how impactful it was on the third quarter, specifically. SteveFilton: Well, I guess -- just broadly, I will point to the fact that the expectations would be that and revenues are growing by 9% or over 9% as they were in the third quarter. You would expect your expenses to be growing at a slower rate and particularly, I think, on the salary and the other operating-expense line cause that's where you have a lot of your fixed and semi-fixed cost, I think supplies tend to be much more variable. And if you look at quarterly result, those expenses are growing as fast, if not faster than revenue. And I think, again, the main reason for that or the main reason we're not able to drive more efficiencies are the dynamics I described before. I don't know that I can size it any more precisely than that. I think it's just kind of that broad impact that you'll see on the financial statements. Operator : Your next question comes\u2026 Steve Filton : Let me. Yes, before that question comes in, let me tell everyone a couple of things that I've been thinking about. Number one, the whole question of the DOJ logs we've completed and we've had very few to no questions about that. Steve discussed addiction treatment and he discussed a little bit about -- in the U.K., the value of the pound et cetera. There is a -- the government reports in the U.K., a shortage of behavioral health beds and we're growing it. So that's very positive and in addition at some point, Brexit will be resolved, I'm sure and that will stabilize the currency. And the other thing is that, we have about $1 billion available for stock we purchased and if I suspect we have a buying opportunity, we'll certainly employ that. So I just want to cover those things. Operator : Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe. Your line is open. RalphGiacobbe: Thanks, good morning. Steve, could you just remind us what percentage of admissions are uninsured at this point. And then just any general thoughts on what you do attribute that sort of creep or jump in the uninsured too at this point? I know A.J. asked about sort of the re-verification and redetermination on the behavioral side. Do you think there's any sort of impact on that as Medicaid roles maybe are under some pressure as it relates to sort of the acute care side of the business? Thanks. SteveFilton: Yes. So I mean I think I said earlier that our admission growth was 7% to 8% for the quarter. I think uninsured admission probably grew by 8% or 9%. I think it's largely driven by emergency room activity, which tends to be a little bit more skewed to the uninsured. I think most uninsured patients enter the U.S. healthcare system through acute care emergency rooms. So to the degree that our activity is increasing, I don't think we find it surprising that we're seeing more uninsured patients. The other thing is there's been a fair amount of speculation and it seems reasonable that since the elimination of the individual mandate, there are fewer people who find it necessary to have insurance, particularly exchange insurance under the ACA. So I think there is - there probably is an uptick nationally in the number of insureds who are no longer concerned about the individual mandate, and that's being reflected a little bit in our premix. RalphGiacobbe: Okay, that's fair enough. And then just clarify, I just -- I was hoping you can give us just the percentage of admissions that are uninsured. So what percentage of your admissions are uninsured at this point? Not necessarily the growth, just what percentage is. SteveFilton: Yes. So I think -- we're just not connecting here, Ralph. What I said - I think probably somewhere in the 7% or 8% range of our total admissions are uninsured. RalphGiacobbe: Okay, sorry about that. Okay, all right, fair enough. SteveFilton: No problem. RalphGiacobbe: And then a little bit of a -- maybe an unfair question because we're less than a month into the fourth quarter, but you did this sort of in the first quarter -- you did a [indiscernible] sort of mention any indicators on either the surgical volume, or the uninsured or just general mix at this point? SteveFilton: Yes, I mean the comments in the first quarter I think we're a little bit different because the main issue was this sort of \u2013 the main issue that was a sort of I think drag in the first quarter was this negative medical surgical mix, and I think we were simply indicating that towards the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter the surgical mix had clearly strengthened and was continuing to strengthen into the second quarter. I would say there's nothing extraordinary in our early view of October, which is almost exclusively on a volume basis. I think the trends have largely continued to involve businesses, but I think it's way too early to make any judgements about the ultimate direction of the quarter at this point, three weeks into October. RalphGiacobbe: Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Pito Chickering. Your line is open. PitoChickering: Good morning, guys. If I can go back to A.J.'s question on behavioral, so I understand the headwinds from FX and Panama City in the addiction treatment programs. But then for FX, the other two issues already embedded in the second half growth are -- in the second half growth rates. So trend is definitely down and a move from 3% to 2% isn't a big move, neither is a move from 2% to 1%. So can you give us a little more detail on why you're confident it will bounce back? Do you have good visibility on new staffing being added so you don't need to turn patients away? Do you have new bed coming on-line? Can you just sort of give us more reasons why you're so confident? SteveFilton: Yes. Look, and Pito, I mean it's a fair comment but I think our perspective is we had been growing the behavioral business in that sort of 3%, 3.5% range for a relatively extended period of time. So I think we're viewing the third quarter performance as more anomalous. But to your point, I mean we certainly can't guarantee that but our expectation and our confidence as we move forward is based on looking back on the last five or six quarters where more often than not we were hitting that 3%, 3.5% mark than the lower 2% mark. PitoChickering: Okay, fair enough. On talking about payments, he talked about Texas. As you think about sort of fourth quarter and 2020, any changes in California or other states we should be aware of? SteveFilton: Yes, I mean that will again be clearer when we file our Q and have the schedule, but I think we're expecting a slight increase in supplemental payments in Q4, not a terribly material number. PitoChickering: Okay. And the last question; if stocks are off today, have you guys ever considered doing an accelerated share repo? SteveFilton: Yes, I think we consider sort of all the alternatives. Again, I think one of the things that make us a bit reluctant to pursue sort of a big bang kind of a strategy like that is we do like to keep our flexibility to respond to other external opportunities as they arise. But I think we're always open to consider what we think makes the most sense. Again, I think we've done pretty well. We view it as an opportunistic purchase of a substantial number of shares over the last several years. PitoChickering: Great, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Costa. Your line is open. SteveFilton: And Operator, we're going to make this the last question. PeterCosta: Good morning, everyone. SteveFilton: Go ahead, Peter. PeterCosta: Outpatient seems stronger. It's hard to tell given gross to net and also related to sort of the ongoing movement of services there, or maybe perhaps the insurer denials, or the ER volumes or the new capacity adds. But one of the things that I'm curious about is could you tell, was there any kind of an increase related to patients being over their deductibles such that you might see that accelerate into the fourth quarter? SteveFilton: Yes. So Peter, it's a good question. The challenge for us that's difficult information for us to really kind of synthesize in a meaningful way. I think the payers are in a much better position to kind of be able to answer that question. I will say that historically I think this issue of patients sort of accelerating activity as they satisfy their deductibles tends to be more of a fourth quarter issue. But again, we tend to have to speculate about those trends because we just don't have enough of a database of information to be able to really sort of be able to evaluate that in a meaningful way. PeterCosta: Okay. And then the second question : you outline new openings from you capital expenditure programs and also higher labor costs due to agency from the higher volumes. I'm curious if some of those new openings from your capital spending programs were operating below capacity, and so as you fill capacity there, they will come online, or is really the labor cost issue all tied to agency and then -- and just new hires? SteveFilton: I think it's more the latter, Peter. I think just as the volumes increase, obviously we've got to have the qualified clinical personnel to treat this bolus of incremental patients, which is quite significant and it's just expensive to do so because we're paying a fair -- in overtime and registry pay again is what we call a premium because it truly is often times, a 50%, or 60% or 70% premium over base pay. To the degree that you're using that sort of pay it can eat up your margins pretty quickly. PeterCosta: Okay, thanks. And then the last question just more for Alan. You talked about Brexit a little bit as it impacted currency, but there's been so much uncertainty over there tied to Brexit right now. Is there any kind of slowdown in volume or slowdown in referrals that you're getting or your business there, and could that accelerate if there is a Brexit decision in the short-term, and then would that get worse down the road as the \u2013 sort of the issues kind of become more clear? SteveFilton: I'll answer the question, Peter. I mean I think the reality is that I think that demand for behavioral services in particular is really pretty insensitive to what's going on with Brexit and that seems relatively intuitive. The sort of issues that create demand for behavioral services are really going to be pretty independent of those sort of exogenous factors. I do think the way in the theory the business does get affected is if there's a change in the labor environment as a result of Brexit or if there's a change in NHS funding as a result of Brexit pressures, that's kind of a different story. But in terms -- and we don't necessarily anticipate those things happening. But in terms of demand, I think we've seen really no impact as a result of the overarching Brexit uncertainty in the country. PeterCosta: Thank you. Steve Filton : Okay operator, we would like to thank everyone for their time and look forward to our fourth quarter call in February. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead, sir. Steve Filton : Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full-year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends, before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $9.13 for the full-year of 2019 and $2.79 for the fourth quarter. As reflected on the supplemental schedule included with last night\u2019s earnings release, there were no significant adjustments made to our reported net income attributable to UHS during the fourth quarter of 2019. After adjusting the 12-month period ended December 31, 2019, as indicated on the supplemental schedule, adjusted net income attributable the UHS increased to $891.8 million, or $9.99 per diluted share, as compared to $894.4 million, or $9.53 per diluted share during the full-year of 2018. Included in our reported and our adjusted net income attributable to UHS during the fourth quarter of 2019 is a pre-tax unrealized gain of $16.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, resulting from an increase in the market share of shares of certain marketable securities held for investment and classified as available for sale. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019, included a pre-tax unrealized gain a $4.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, recorded in connection with these marketable securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, as reflected on the supplemental schedule, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS excluded an unfavorable after-tax impact of $14.6 million, resulting from an increase in the DOJ Reserve and related income taxes, the unfavorable impact of an after-tax $74.6 million provision for asset impairment, which reduced the carrying value of a tradename intangible asset and certain real property assets recorded in connection with Foundations Recovery Network and a favorable after-tax impact of $12.2 million, developing from our adoption of ASU 2016-09. On a same facility basis in our Acute Care Division, net revenues increased 7.9% during the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding our health plan, same-store revenues increased 7.5% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The increased revenues resulted primarily from a 2.1% increase in adjusted admissions and a 5.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our Behavioral Health Division increased 4.5% during the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year, increased 0.8%, while adjusted patient days increased 0.9% during the fourth quarter of 2019, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.9% during the fourth quarter of 2019 over comparable prior year quarter. Included in our Behavioral Health Division\u2019s operating results during the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately $8 million of pre-tax insurance proceeds recorded in connection with business interruption losses incurred and property damages sustained at one of our facilities located in Florida. This facility, which sustained substantial damage during the fourth quarter of 2018, in connection with Hurricane Michael, has been repaired and reopened. Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.438 billion during the full-year of 2019, as compared to $1.275 billion during 2018. We spent $634 million on capital expenditures during the full-year of 2019, as compared to $665 million during 2018. Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined to 50 days during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 51 days during 2018. At December 31, 2019, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 42.0%, as compared to 42.6% at December 31, 2018. During 2019, we completed and opened approximately 250 new beds in our existing acute and behavioral hospitals. We also developed four new freestanding emergency departments and acquired two more in 2019 to bring our total number of FEDs to 14. There are three more FEDs under construction, which are expected to open in 2020. We also continue to grow our behavioral health joint venture portfolio, with three new facilities already operational; seven under construction or announced, which are expected to open in 2020 and 2021; and over 40 opportunities in the pipeline. During 2020, we expect to spend approximately $775 million to $825 million on capital expenditures, which includes expenditures to capital equipment, renovation, new projects at existing hospitals, and construction of new facilities. In conjunction with our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2019, we purchased approximately 1.29 million share of our stock at a cost of approximately $181 million, or $141 per share. During the 12-month ended December 31, 2019, we have repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $706 million, or $131 per share. We believe share purchase is a prudent use of our financial capital, and we plan to continue to return value to our shareholders in 2020. Consequently, our 2020 operating results forecast assumes approximately $800 million of share repurchases. Last night\u2019s press release included our 2020 operating results forecast for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our estimated range of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization net of controlling interest is $1.823 billion to $1.902 billion. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $10.30 to $11 per diluted share. Its adjusted EPS guidance range represents an increase of approximately 3% to 10% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $9.99 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019 as calculated on the supplemental schedule. During 2020, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $11.96 billion to $12.12 billion, representing an increase of 5.1% to 6.5% over our 2019 net revenue. We are pleased to answer questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Andrew Mok : Thanks. Good morning. This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. The first question on 2020 guidance. At the midpoint, revenue guide is up almost 6% and EBITDA growth is closer to 3.5%. Can you provide some color on the underlying components embedded in the guide between the segments? Is there any meaningful change in the behavioral volume outlook for 2020 that you would highlight? Steve Filton : Andrew, I think that the elements that underlie the 2020 guidance are not terribly different than those that are under live the 2019 guidance, as well as, quite frankly, our 2019 results. And that is in the Acute Division, I think, revenue growth in the mid to upper single-digit range and commensurate EBITDA growth and on the behavioral side, revenue growth in the sort of 3% to 4% range with EBITDA growth in sort of a 1% to 2% range. And then obviously, we make some adjustments to that based on non-recurring reimbursement items, et cetera, that we expect in 2019, 2020 rather. Andrew Mok : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. On the quarter, your acute volume decelerated from the exceptionally high volumes in 3Q. Is there anything you would call out driving that volume number lower? Can you speak to the challenges in managing labor expenses, both temporary labor and position volume commitments in this type of choppy volume environment? Steve Filton : Sure. And then we should move on to our next question. The \u2013 not only did our acute results decelerate in Q3, but we\u2019ve really had industry-leading and what I would describe as historically extraordinary acute care volume growth for several years now. And I think, we\u2019ve been preparing ourselves and investors as well for the notion that at some point, our volumes would moderate to sort of more historically normative levels. And I think you saw some of that in the fourth quarter of 2019. The only sort of specific market or hospital that I would point to is Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas. We\u2019ve talked any number of times over the last few years about the explosive growth and the extraordinarily fast ramp-up at Henderson. That hospital is now operating at pretty much full capacity around the clock. So growth there has slowed. And on an overall basis, that has muted the overall growth of the Acute Care Division a little bit. Otherwise, I think, we just saw kind of a normative step down in the quarter. As far as the labor pressures, I think, again, nothing new there. We continue to see labor pressure in both of our business segments. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprising development. And it\u2019s not a not a new development, given the extremely robust and low unemployment rates in the country. The challenges have seemingly sort of reflected themselves differently in the two divisions in the Acute Division. It continues to press on both our salary and benefit expense and our other operating expense, where we recorded some of our contract physician labor, as we replace or fill the vacancies with temporary hours of over time or premium pay or locums, physicians, et cetera. And on the behavioral side, we \u2013 we\u2019re challenged, because a lot of the labor vacancies resolved in an our having to cap beds or turn away patients. Again, nothing new in either of those instances, but it continues to be a challenge that our operators are very much focused on. Andrew Mok : Great. I appreciate the color. Steve Filton : Next question? Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Matthew Borsch : I was hoping maybe you could just talk a little bit about the near-term outlook for the first quarter, given obviously you don\u2019t need to tell you there\u2019s a calendar to be a little bit of a calendar weight to utilization and the backdrop maybe it\u2019s unimportant to the flu season is then a little bit strange and it\u2019s plotting. And then finally, if there\u2019s anything you can say or want to say on coronavirus? Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure, Matt. I think 2019 was a year in which we experienced a fair amount, particularly in the acute business of quarter-to-quarter volatility. That was, I think, somewhat unexpected, in some cases, difficult to explain and different than sort of traditional seasonal patterns. Now, I think at the end of the year and for the full-year, the results of the division played out not terribly differently than our overall expectations. But I think, as we go into 2020, and even though we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance and don\u2019t intend to epic, our expectation would be absent any information to the contrary that the annual progression, the cadence of the quarters is sort of more traditional. Last year, we had a very solid first quarter in acute and then a much stronger second. I think this year, we\u2019d expect a cadence that\u2019s a bit more ratable. But hard to predict. And, quite frankly, it\u2019s part of the reason, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. As far as the coronavirus, like everybody else, I think, any commentary that I would give at this point would be purely speculative. It\u2019s impossible to know what the impact would be specifically in the first quarter, but we\u2019re certainly prepared. Our hospitals are prepared as best as they can be. If the coronavirus becomes more widespread, but \u2013 I think virtually impossible to predict the financial impact. Matthew Borsch : Do you \u2013 sorry, let me just follow-up quick on that, which is I realized speculative, but in a certain scenario where there is a lot of travel disruption, disruption in general, because people are afraid of this spread versus necessarily having lots and lots of patients that are being hospitalized. Do you think that, that actually could be a retarding effect on volumes as you get a cancellation of elective procedures and so forth? Steve Filton : I mean, again, I would repeat, Matt, that it would be speculative on my part. Matthew Borsch : Okay. Steve Filton : I think, the only thing we can sort of fall back on is respiratory ailments that we\u2019ve experienced before either very busy flu seasons or SARS, or whatever it was. And I think, generally, we have found that our elective procedures have really not been impacted by a busy respiratory ailment season, et cetera. Now, again, this is extraordinary. I think, all bets are off the table\u2026 Matthew Borsch : Sure. Steve Filton : \u2026but that has not been the historic experience. Matthew Borsch : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Eugene Kim : Good morning. This is Eugene on for Justin. Just as a follow-up to Andrew\u2019s earlier question. It appears a temp staffing costs remain high in Q4, despite the moderate volume. How should we think about these costs in 2020, if volumes remain more normal? And also, can you comment on the meaningful improvement behavioral pricing in the quarter? Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure. So I think in terms of temp staffing in the acute business, one of the reasons why I think it was more of a drag even than it has been in the fourth quarter is that, as our volumes, as I alluded to before, I\u2019ve been so strong for such a long period of time. I think that our hospitals and our hospital operators have been making longer-term commitments for temporary staffing, both for nurses and for physicians. So not just for a day or a couple of days in advance, but sometimes for weeks and months in advance. And as a consequence of that, when the volume softened a little bit in the fourth quarter, it was a little more difficult to adjust as quickly as we\u2019d like to those sort of lower volumes. I do believe that if the lower volumes persist into 2020, and I\u2019m not certain that they will, but I believe that we\u2019ll be able to respond. And you\u2019ll see those labor expenses, which get recorded in the case of nurses mostly on our salary line, in the case of doctors and many cases on that other operating expense line, I think you\u2019ll see us get better control over those. As far as the pricing on the behavioral business, obviously, it\u2019s helped by the insurance proceed recovery that I mentioned in my remarks. But also I think \u2013 and I think pricing has not really been a terribly challenging element for the behavioral division, but the improvement, I think, in Q4 is reflective of a little bit better payer mix that our control over our denials from payers, et cetera. So, I think some incremental improvement on those fronts help the stronger net revenue in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fishbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fishbeck : Great, thanks. Wanted to see what you were thinking about, it looks like length of stay in the behavioral side has been kind of firming up, I guess, versus some of the pressures that we\u2019ve seen the last few years. So wanted to get your outlet for what was driving that and how you\u2019re thinking about that into next year? And then maybe just a follow-up on that last point about pricing being relatively solid. You are looking for next year\u2019s growth to be below Q4, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything in there that you would highlight besides the insurance recovery? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So I think, your comments about length of stay, Kevin, are certainly accurate. Length of stay in the behavioral division has been pretty flat in 2019 after a couple of years of fairly consistent decline. We identified the reason for that decline many times as almost primarily a shift from traditional Medicaid patients to manage Medicaid patients, where the managed Medicaid payers are more aggressive in managing length of stay. I think the reason \u2013 the main reason for that stabilization in 2019 was, we just saw a slowing of that shift. We still believe there\u2019s a chunk of patients in some states that will ultimately move from traditional Medicaid programs to managed Medicaid programs. It\u2019s difficult for us to predict the timing. But we have an expectation that, that will occur at some point. In terms of how our 2020 behavioral guidance, particularly from a revenue per admission or from a pricing perspective relates to the fourth quarter performance, I think that we were basing our 2020 guidance more on the full-year performance of pricing. And when I talked about sort of 3% to 4% revenue growth in behavioral, it was really based on something like 1% volume and 2% the 3% pricing, which I think is more in line with what we ran for the full-year and that\u2019s \u2013 that was the basis of our 2020 guidance. Kevin Fishbeck : Okay. Thanks Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just to go back to behavioral of the focus, obviously on just the last question, drives at home has been on stabilizing length of stay and volumes overall on the behavioral side. But I know you\u2019ve got a new President of that division and coming in and looking at some different initiatives. Can you just sort of update us on where the focus is? It doesn\u2019t look like any of that \u2013 any change in trend is really in your 2020 forecast at this point. But when could some of those initiatives really have an impact? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think there\u2019s a bunch of different sort of questions wrapped up in what you\u2019re asking A.J. I mean, what I would say, in as brief away as possible, in terms of impact and the approach that our new Behavioral President, Matt Peterson is taking is, I think, as most people know, Matt comes from a strong managed care background, spending the last decade or so with United Optum. And I think that he, as a consequence, has a perspective that there are real opportunities for us to partner with some of our managed care payers and create arrangements that are mutually beneficial to both the payer and the provider. In other words, help the payer control their utilization, but create a structure whereby when there is utilization, we are the beneficiary of that in a primary way. So those conversations, I think, are underway. They\u2019re not necessarily ones that can be affected immediately. But I think over time will yield kind of a more collaborative sort of relationship with payers that, that should again be mutually beneficial and a win-win for both. I think the other thing that Matt brings to the table is a rigor and a discipline around process based on his experience, both in the managed care world, as well as in the military. He\u2019s got a lifelong career in the Air Force reserves. And in that sense, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s identified terribly new issues or different issues, a lot of things that we\u2019ve talked about before, things like denial management, the process of how we intake and evaluate patients, et cetera. But I think, Matt is bringing some, again, level of rigor and discipline to those processes that we haven\u2019t necessarily had before. And I think ultimately, that will certainly be helpful. In terms of how that translates to the guidance. I think we took the position a couple of years ago, that it was difficult for us to predict when the behavioral business would inflect or when it would turn, we have firmly believed for some time that it will. We continue to believe that. We continue to believe that the underlying demand will support an increase in our same-store admission growth at some point. But I think we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been committed over the last certainly year or two to the idea that we\u2019re not going to try and get out in front and predict when that\u2019s going to happen. When it does, we\u2019ll alter our projections and our guidance at that time. A.J. Rice: Okay. Maybe just one follow-up then. There\u2019s a lot of focus on the recontract and it\u2019s gone on in your biggest acute market in Las Vegas. You had a view that is that contract with the biggest payer opens up, then you have better pricing. It might be offset with volume. Can you maybe flesh out a little bit what \u2013 has that played out as you expected so far in the first quarter? And what have you assumed in guidance sort of there in terms of the year-to-year impact on that? Steve Filton : So the assumption that we\u2019ve made in guidance? Well, first of all, the way this has played out is that, we\u2019re talking about the commercial Sierra, United contract in Las Vegas in which HCA has been out of network for over a decade, beginning and effective with January 1 of 2020. They are back in network. The nature of our contract is such that, we had an opportunity once that occurred to renegotiate our rates with Sierra, which we have done and have we\u2019ve now signed a new contract with Sierra, which is also effective January 1 of this year. Our expectation is that, there will be obviously a decline in volume, as some of the Sierra patients that have historically come to our Las Vegas hospitals will now go to HCA hospitals. But we believe that over the course of a longer-term, that negative impact will largely be offset by increased pricing that\u2019s effective, both January 1 and there are other scheduled increases that we already get over the next year-and-a-half or so. As far as the very early signs of it, not surprisingly, A.J., the shift of patients at the very outset of 2020 has been relatively slow, which is a good thing, obviously, from our perspective, but we certainly are not naive. And we understand that there\u2019s a real effort on HCA to promote the change in the contract and they\u2019re new in network status, their billboards and commercials in the market. So over time, we assume that, that shift of patients will accelerate. But, again, I think in \u2013 over an extended period of time and over the year, we assume the result will largely be a push. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Great. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. On the acute guidance for 2020, it\u2019s in a relatively consistent over the past couple of years. But you mentioned that there\u2019s some headwinds in the fourth quarter due to the slowing impact from Henderson. So I guess, how much does Henderson affect 2020 revenue growth? And what are you doing to \u2013 in Vegas to expand the market to build towers, new hospitals, kind of what\u2019s your plan for Vegas at this point? Steve Filton : Sure. So, again, as I think I noted when I made the Henderson commentary earlier that that\u2019s certainly not the single driver of the slowdown in volumes. It\u2019s probably got about a 40, 50 basis point impact on the volume slowdown. But I think the remaining components out of their spread pretty evenly throughout the rest of the portfolio. The Vegas problem of facilities running at capacity is a good problem to have and one which we\u2019ve been addressing. We\u2019ve, I think, commented on any number of occasions in 2019 that we have had expansion projects at virtually all of our six major Las Vegas facilities, new towers, new beds, ER expansions, the surgical expansions, et cetera. We\u2019ve got at Henderson, specifically, a whole brand-new tower that\u2019s being developed, and that, that project is underway, but it will be sometime before that new capacity is open. Pito Chickering : Okay. Got it. And then on the acute margins, what percent of your SMB costs come from temp labor? Maybe I missed that. And can you break that out by nurses versus physicians? And how should we beating that sort of that labor pressure in 2020 versus 2019? Thanks so much. Steve Filton : So I\u2019m not sure I have all that sort of precise information, Pito. I will say this. I mean, I think what we would sort of strive for, if you will, is something around 2% of our nursing hours to be premium pay. I think if you have 0% of your nursing hours that\u2019s premium pay, you probably would argue that you\u2019re somewhat overstaffed. But 2% is sort of probably kind of close to maximum efficiency. I think over the last several years, we\u2019ve been running more in kind of the mid single digits, given the labor shortages, et cetera. From a physician perspective, I think, our general target is not to really have any temporary physician costs. It\u2019s much more efficient to have permanent physicians in both contract and specialty services, et cetera. So I don\u2019t exactly know what the numbers are. But clearly, the contract labor, both in nursing and in physicians is probably the single biggest operating challenge that the acute division has faced. And I just want to go back and add one thing on to my comments about Las Vegas and really just add on, one other major expansion that we have is, we are building a new hospital in Reno, that should open in 2021. And obviously, it will enhance our statewide presence in Nevada significantly. So I think that\u2019s very much related to the expansions that we have in the southern part of Nevada as well. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Sarah James : Thank you. I was hoping that you could update us on any talks on expanding your JV with Baylor Memorial Hermann? And then just more broadly, how discussions are going on behavioral JVs? Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure, Sarah. So, as I noted in my comments, we have a number of projects that are under development. One of them is with Baylor in Temple, Texas. That\u2019s a facility that will open or scheduled to open at least in late 2020. As far as any of the other projects that are in our pipeline, I\u2019m not going to comment on any of those conversations, specifically. We, again, as I commented in my opening remarks, we\u2019ve got, I think, up to eight projects under way that will open either in 2020 or 2021. Those are obviously completed negotiations, et cetera, and then another 40 in the pipeline. Obviously, I think, it reflects a very active pipeline. It reflects real interest on the part of a large number of geographically first not-for-profit acute care hospitals who are interested in these joint ventures. But we\u2019re really not going to comment on any of those discussions until they are executed. Sarah James : Okay. And acute supply cost came down this quarter as a percent of revenue. Can you talk about any efforts that are going on there for negotiating pricing and how you think about that trending forward? Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, I think that, that\u2019s \u2013 so the answer, first of all, is the effort to manage our supply costs find the most effective suppliers from above the quality and pricing standpoint is ongoing. There are initiatives to all the time, there\u2019s none that I would highlight specifically, but I can assure you, it\u2019s a main focus of our operators. I think part of the reason for the supply costs coming down is just some of the strong revenue \u2013 revenues out, because the surgical mix is up, because denials are down, because uncompensated care is down some. And I think the supply costs, particularly in relation to our other labor costs on which I think there is greater pressure, appear to be controlled better and I think they are. So that\u2019s I think what\u2019s happening. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Steve, just a question on sort of outpatient development and maybe tying into CapEx. I know you guys have been pretty active on the freestanding ED side. But any other facilities or types, whether that\u2019s urgent care all the way to surgery centers. Any \u2013 anything else that you see more and more investment going into, as part of that $700 million issue of CapEx? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, I think it\u2019s sort of really, Josh, the full continuum. I think we are committed to the idea as an acute care provider that successful acute care providers really need to be kind of have a presence across the full continuum. And I think, so up on the front-end, that includes, as you described, urgent care centers, which we have a few, the FEDs, which we have several, and I highlighted in my comments, primary care physician offices, which we have a great many of, et cetera. And then, I think on the back-end, obviously then, in the hospital, we\u2019ve got extensive outpatient facilities, both in and out of the hospital. We have \u2013 We do own ASCs in our markets as well. And then on the back-end, things like home health and long-term care and rehab, et cetera. So in all of our markets, we sort of take a different approach to these things. And we are either buying or building or partnering those capacities and those services. But we could talk about any single one of our markets. And I think, we would be able to describe a narrative to you, that reflects a much greater presence along the full continuum. And some of that obviously is reflected in our CapEx as well, some of its reflected in joint venture arrangements, et cetera. But in some form or fashion, we are building that presence along that continuum in all of our markets. Josh Raskin : Gotcha. And just quick clarification on Vegas with the HCA contract change. Did I read into it right that you\u2019re assuming Vegas as a market in totality from a 2020 guidance perspective. Is it sound like it\u2019s kind of a non-event in terms of the pluses and the minuses? Josh Raskin : Well, I would say, non-event in terms of the bottom line impact. I think, cosmetically, what you would expect or what we would expect in Vegas was \u2013 is to see our admissions go down some, but our revenue per admission to go up. But I think, our EBITDA as a result of this change in the Sierra network to be relatively unchanged. Josh Raskin : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Baird. Matthew Gillmor : Hey, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a bit more specifically on the key pricing. Steve, I think, you mentioned that the surgical mix was better this quarter and that helped? What did you see from a payer mix perspective or an acuity perspective? Steve Filton : Yes. So one of the things I think that we have really experienced all year is sort of an inverse rule on the acute side and inverse relationship between volumes and pricing. So earlier in the year when volumes were extremely high and, in particular, ER volumes were particularly high, that generally suggest that our medical-surgical mix was a little bit more skewed to medical, that our uncompensated burden was a little bit higher because of the ER volumes, et cetera. In the fourth quarter, as volumes came down a little bit, I think, we saw the opposite of that phenomena. We saw a little better surgical to medical mix. We saw a slightly lower uncompensated care burden. And that helped to drive the extremely stronger revenue per admission or pricing in the quarter, whereas volumes were a little bit lower than they\u2019ve been. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. And then one follow-up on coronavirus. I know it\u2019s really hard for you to predict any volume impact. I was curious if you\u2019re seeing any supply issue, especially with respect to surgical masks that could impact your other operations? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, I think that and this has been broadly reported, and I don\u2019t think it had anything specifically to do with UHS. I think that in the early phases of this process, the issues have been \u2013 it\u2019s been a little bit difficult to get testing done on patients who are suspected to have the virus. I think, originally, the testing was only being done by the CDC. Now, there are more places, but I think testing at least so far has been a little bit cumbersome. My presumption is that, as the country gears up for this, that will become a more effective process. And then I think it has been widely reported things like gloves and masks are in short supply. We\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure that we have an adequate supply of those things, as well as an adequate pipeline. But as you might imagine, I suspect most hospitals in the country are doing similar things. So, that\u2019s something, I think, to be seen, but certainly we are making every effort to be as prepared as we can. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Gary Taylor : Hey, good morning, Steve. A two-part question. The first one, I apologize. I just heard the tail end of Sarah\u2019s question. So just stop me if I\u2019m overlapping here. But on the JV behavioral facilities that you\u2019ve got underway, the seven projects or eight projects, do you have a total ballpark bed count that you think that adds over the next couple of years? And have you \u2013 can you just refresh us on UHS sort of typical ownership position is what, like an 80% or help us think about that? Steve Filton : Yes. So I mean, I don\u2019t have the precise data in front of me, Gary. But generally, all of these new hospitals are in the 100 to 120-bed range size. And then in terms of structure, I think, most of them are probably in that 80-20 range. There certainly are a couple that are a little closer to 50-50. We would not enter into or I think it would be highly unlikely that we would enter into a joint venture in which we had less than a 51% share and basically the management control of the facility. But each deal is negotiated separately, but I think the 80-20 model is probably normative. Gary Taylor : Gotcha. And then just my one follow-up on the headwind you\u2019re contemplating next year on the Medicaid dish, if Congress doesn\u2019t do anything and another sort of 10 to 15 of supplemental payments. Even those supplemental payments that would all be impacting your acute EBITDA projection, I think, is there anything material at all with respect to that on the behavioral side? Steve Filton : Yes. So the the ACA dish that Congress has deferred those cuts through May, in our guidance, we presume that Congress will not defer them after May and that\u2019s about a $10 million headwind in 2020. I think what you\u2019re otherwise referring to is in our broader supplemental payments that includes dish and uncompensated care and provider taxes, et cetera. And frankly, that \u2013 it does cross both divisions. We get that reimbursement in both our divisions. Gary Taylor : Okay. Steve Filton : We\u2019re expecting a $10 million or $15 million decline next year. And I don\u2019t have the specific breakout in front of me, but I think that\u2019s actually split between the two divisions. Gary Taylor : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with UBS. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Steve, we\u2019re seeing there\u2019s a number of states that are pursuing 1115 waivers to provide behavioral treatment for adult fee-for-service patients with substance use disorders. I think probably 30 states since last fall have looked to see state plan options. Just wondering, do you have any thoughts on this? Presumably, this opens up some market for you, but who really knows. Just curious if you have any insight? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, I think it\u2019s hard to predict. And, obviously, it\u2019s not exactly analogous. But the IMD exclusion being lifted was something that we thought would have a more immediate impact. And when I say we really are making sort of an overall industry comment. I think that freestanding industry felt like we would see more of those adult Medicaid patients just shifting relatively quickly from the acute care setting to the freestanding setting. I think, you might expect sort of something similar from the 1115 waiver. But what we saw, I think, from the IMD exclusion is that, the acute hospitals were not necessarily all that anxious to part with those patients. And as a consequence, I think, we see those JV conversations being much more active and much more robust. But the actual shift of patients, not as quick. And so I would wait and see how these 1115 waivers really resolved, or what the result is in terms of potentially more patients. Whit Mayo : Is there any chance that you could see this develop as a headwind? I guess, I\u2019m trying to think, is there any negative consequence as a result of this? Steve Filton : We haven\u2019t seen it yet. So I think, it\u2019s a little too early to tell. Whit Mayo : Yes. Okay. And I haven\u2019t looked at your 10-K yet, but maybe if you could just comment on your malpractice experience in 2019. And any comments around professional fees, any pressure building on contract management subsidies as you think about 2020? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So our malpractice experience has not really changed much over the last several years. It\u2019s been pretty stable. As far as contract fees, I would say pretty much the same thing. Again, I think the bigger pressure for us has been on vacancies in some of our contract position services, as well as other specialties, where we\u2019re having to either pay a vendor for some of those vacancies or we\u2019re having to pay locums costs, et cetera. But in terms of our kind of regular contract service arrangements for things like ER doctors and hospitals, et cetera, I think those costs have remained fairly stable. Whit Mayo : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Anton Hie : Hi there. It\u2019s Anton Hie on for Frank. I know we had the recovery \u2013 insurance recovery there, but I\u2019m not sure I heard an actual update on kind of how Panama City is trending back. I believe that\u2019s been reopened. Can you just refresh us on that? Steve Filton : Yes. So Emerald Coast, which is the name of the facility in Panama City has reopened, I believe in September and has ramped back up to, I think pretty sort of normal pre-hurricane level. So I think for 2020, the operating recovery in that facility should provide a bit of a tail wind maybe in the neighborhood of $5 million to $10 million for the behavioral division in 2020. Anton Hie : Okay. And then the drag on the addiction treatment, can you give us an update on that? Steve Filton : No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real significant change. I mean, we\u2019ve seen some incremental improvement in that standalone addiction treatment business, but remains one, where we\u2019re trying any number of initiatives to improve the results there and making some progress, but it\u2019s incremental. Anton Hie : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to labor quickly. Certainly understand the the temp staffing and contract labor pressures in the context of what\u2019s been, obviously, really strong volume backdrop. What about underlying wage growth in your market, Steve? What\u2019s that running? Is there sort of incremental competitiveness or rate pressure there for both nursing? And we are starting to hear a little bit more around sort of non-clinical staff. So any help in frame in that? Steve Filton : Look, I think that wage inflation has certainly picked up over the last several years. And we\u2019ve probably gone from 2.5% to 3.5% annual wage increases a few years ago, I think, a little lower in the behavioral division, a little higher in acute to probably 3.5% to 4.5% or at least 3.5% to 4% in today\u2019s environment. But again, I still think that the biggest pressure really has come on the two businesses, not so much on the hourly wage pressure itself, but on the premium pay, in the acute division and in our inability to serve all the patients that we like to on the behavioral side. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, fair enough. And then just\u2026 Steve Filton : Go ahead, Ralph. Ralph Giacobbe : \u2026yes, just one quick sort of follow-up. And I apologize if I missed this. I know you noted better acuity and I think payer mix. I was just hoping you can give us a little more of a sense of the CMI increase and maybe commercial versus Medicare versus Medicaid, just the volume trends there? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So I mean, I think that the acuity really manifested itself in surgical volumes. I think, inpatient surgical volumes were up 2% or 3% in the quarter, which is probably one of the better increases we\u2019ve had in the last several years. And I don\u2019t have the exact uncompensated care numbers in front of me. But I know that the number of uncompensated patients as a percentage ticked down somewhat in Q4. Ralph Giacobbe : And then payer mix? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, that to me was the uncompensated care. I mean, I think most of our other payer percentages remain similar. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. Steve Filton : Okay, we thank everybody for their time and look forward to talking with everybody again in a couple of months at the end of the first quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Universal Health Services First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Stephen Filton. Please go ahead, sir. Steve Filton : Thank you. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO; and Marc Miller, our President are also joining us on the line this morning. We welcome you to this review of the Universal Health Service\u2019s results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. During this conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections, and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.64 for the quarter. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule as included with the press release, most notably a $7.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share unrealized loss on shares of certain marketable securities held for investment, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.73 for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. During the first two and a half months of the quarter, volumes in our Acute Care segment were tracking modestly ahead of the prior year. In the last two weeks of March, however, the incidents of COVID-19 and suspected COVID cases increased dramatically in our facilities and correspondingly, the volume of non-COVID patients declined. Consequently, we experienced a 29% decline in admissions in that two-week period at our Acute Care hospitals. This significant decline in patient volumes at our Acute Care hospitals continued into April. The decline in admissions during the second half of March, as well as even more precipitous declines in emergency room visits, and elective/scheduled procedures resulted in a significant decline in income during the first quarter. The behavioral health segment was similarly tracking ahead of the prior year volumes until mid-March when admissions declined 25% during the last two weeks of the quarter, resulting in a significant decline in operating income during that period. The significant declines in patient volumes experienced at our behavioral health facilities have also continued into April. In addition to the volume decline, both business segments had to deal with other material operational challenges, including constraints on COVID-related testing and a lag on results, as well as a shortage on personal protective equipment. Our paramount concern when the COVID crisis first developed was taking all the necessary steps to keep our patients and employees as safe as possible. We did recognize the severe financial stresses created by the COVID crisis and by the end of March and the beginning of April, we undertook steps to mitigate the dramatic revenue declines and to protect our capital structure, including one, cost reduction initiatives across all of our expense categories, two, a significant reduction in planned CapEx spending, and three, a suspension of our share repurchase and quarterly dividend programs. Given the uncertainties and projecting when shelter in place directives will be lifted and hospital volumes will return to more normalized levels, we've withdrawn our earnings guidance for 2020. Congress has recognized the severe financial strains being placed on hospitals and has passed a number of coronavirus bills specifically providing relief to the hospital industry. UHS's hospitals have received funding grants pursuant to the CARES Act, which are subject to meeting certain qualifications, aggregating approximately $198 million to-date. In addition, we have received accelerated Medicare payments totaling $375 million now as thus far and we're hoping to receive additional Medicare accelerated payments in the near future. Before giving it back to recede of these additional funds as of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.2 billion in unborrowed capacity under existing loan facilities to provide insulation against the decline in operating cash flow. We'd be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Steve Altek with Barclays. Andrew Mok : This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. Appreciate all the comments and everything you\u2019re doing as an organization. My question, can you compare and contrast the impact that the pandemic had on your two business segments and highlight any differences in baseline expectations between those segments during the recovery phase? Alan Miller : To me, the biggest difference is that on the acute - in the Acute Division, you have the increase in COVID, or suspected COVID patients, and effectively that increase in patients displacing a significant number of non-COVID patients coming through the emergency room and displacing a very large number of elective and scheduled procedures. So effectively, you have this very unfavorable shift - negative shift in service mix. So, you've got many more medical patients who are a little bit more expensive to treat because of all the isolation and other protective steps that we're taking to protect our patient and our employee population. And then you're losing a lot of this higher profitability, higher margin business, again, for those last couple of weeks of the month - of the month of March.  On the behavioral side, while we lost not an insignificant amount of volume in those last two weeks of March, you don't have that same negative what I would describe as service-line mix shift. In other words, the patients that we lost were not necessarily any more profitable than the patients that we retained. And that's why, I think, that the operating income results and the operating income decline in the Acute Division was more severe than it was in the behavioral division. Andrew Mok : Great, thanks. And then just a quick numbers question. Are you able to quantify the impact from the delayed dish cuts and Medicare sequestration? Steve Filton : Yes, I would - we estimate, Andrew, that combined, and I would also include in that the EFMAP relief, that's probably about $35 million to $40 million of additional income over the balance of 2020 from what we would have originally anticipated. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Eugene Kim : This is Eugene dialed in for Justin. I wanted to ask about how we should think about the margins on lost revenues going forward. In Q1, acute revenues and EBITDA missed our pre-COVID numbers by roughly the same dollar amount? And, obviously, with cost-cutting, that should improve going forward and wanted to get some color on how to think about that for both acute and behavioral from this point. Thank you. Alan Miller : So, as I indicated, Eugene, in my comments, we really - the decline in volumes and the shift in business in the last two weeks of March occurred so suddenly that we really didn't have time to implement any significant cost-cutting measures until the very end of March and the beginning of April. But since then, we've aggressively looked at our cost structure across the portfolio, across all of our expense categories and are making as - as many reductions as we think are prudent, given the significant decline in our revenue stream. But I think it's fair to acknowledge that the nature of the hospital business and the hospital business model is that given the dramatic decline in revenues, it is impossible for us to reduce cost at a level commensurate to the reduction in revenues. So, difficult to project, but I would say that if we can reduce our cost at sort of half the rate that revenues are declining, then we've probably done a pretty thorough job. We'll continue to evaluate that as time goes on. Obviously, our hope is that some of this lost business will be restored and we are in the process of measuring what the appropriate cost structure is for volumes, literally on a daily basis. But in our business, as it would be in any business, revenue decline that has occurred as dramatically and as suddenly as this one has is difficult to deal with purely on a cost-cutting basis. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Eric Glenn : This is Eric Glenn on for Matt Borsch. A quick question on - incentivize the COVID-19 impact on the behavioral side and you mentioned a modest increase in admission year-over-year in both January and February, obviously, before the falloff in mid-March. Are you able to give any indication if the magnitude of that year-over-year increase in January to February prior to the virus impact? Steve Filton : Yes, I think it was in the lower single-digits like 3% or 4%. We were tracking 3% or 4% ahead of the prior year. Eric Glenn : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And on the acute side? Or is that\u2026 Steve Filton : I'm sorry, I think that was true on both sides of the business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Thanks for taking my questions. Couple ones here. On the behavioral side, can you talk about the different trends that they saw at the end of March and April between residential and acute? And within acute, are there any segments like substance abuse that's had more impact than others? And have you seen any rebounds of the segments at this point? Alan Miller : So, it's difficult to make really broad generalizations here, Pito. I think what we saw in the behavioral business was, I'll call it the downstream effects from our referral sources. So, when schools closed around the country, we definitely saw decline in our adolescent business in a number of markets. We certainly saw decline in outpatient revenues, which tend not to be quite as emergent, either outpatient treatment tends not to be quite as emergent. We've tried to replace a lot of that outpatient capacity with telemedicine capabilities and other things like that. You mentioned substance abuse and again, I think substance abuse treatment can be, or tends to be, a little bit more discretionary than some other psychiatric diagnosis. So we saw a decline in that in some of our markets. But it did vary by market. We saw - as acute hospitals, I think, around the country were overwhelmed with COVID and COVID-suspect patients, we were definitely seeing fewer behavioral referrals from acute emergency rooms as well and I think fewer behavioral patients were going to acute emergency rooms. So again, across the board, I think we've seen that but the hope is that as the incidents of COVID patients stabilizes around the country, we'll return to kind of a more normalized pattern of referrals from our various referral sources. Pito Chickering : Great. Then on the expenses side, there are a lot of moving parts. Can you walk us through the P&L statement for each segment and help us think about what is the mix of variable versus fixed cost for S&B, other OpEx, et cetera, et cetera? Alan Miller : You can start with supply expense, because I think that tends to be the most variable of our expenses, it's almost 100% variable, not quite. And now, I will say that obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the supply chain items for the coronavirus patients including personal protective equipment, et cetera. So, we've really tried to stock up on those sorts of items where possible. I think salary expense tends to be sort of semi-variable or semi-fixed, however you want to look at it, maybe on 50% level. And I would say the same thing about operating expenses. I think those expenses tend to be flexed on a step level. So, as volumes decline in larger chunks, we start to make more reductions in costs that are not sort of directly variable. So in other words, as patient volume goes down, we're obviously going to reduce the number of nurses at the bedside because there are fewer occupied beds. But as volumes go down, we're also going to reduce headcount and other expenses in more overhead departments like ancillary departments, and general overhead departments like dietary and housekeeping and billing and collection, et cetera. So, that's the exercise our hospitals are going through literally at this point on a daily basis, and I think are being pretty effective and pretty conscientious about doing this in a responsible way so that we're still providing the highest level of quality care for the patients that remain and that we're also prepared to provide that level of care as those volumes sort of return to more normalized levels. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Frank Morgan : I guess I wanted to focus in on what you're seeing today right now. And then maybe some more color around your plan to kind of restart the business, what you're thinking about the timing there and what kind of feedback are you getting from either state regulators or from physicians that operate in your hospitals? And then, finally, how much more accelerated payments do you expect to receive? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, so let me tackle the last question first. The payments that we've received so far, the sort of the outright grant payments are from the first two tranches off the CARES Act, the $100 billion dedicated to hospitals. So, first two tranches were $50 billion, and that's - the $195 million is our share of those first two tranches. So the government has identified three more tranches at $10 billion each for rural hospitals, for hotspots and for uncompensated care of COVID patients. We don't know exactly how the government is going allocate or what methodology they'll use to allocate those dollars. So, it's a little difficult for us, or it's difficult for us to project what our share of that will be. The remaining $20 billion on the original $100 billion has not really been identified in anyway by the government as to how they're going to distribute that. And then there was the fourth coronavirus bill that was passed that includes $75 billion of relief for healthcare providers and there's been no indication how those funds will be distributed. So, we really can't estimate that. As far as your first question, Frank, about sort of how the volumes and the business has trended since the end of March. I think it's fair to say, I think - before one of our peers indicated, things got a little bit worse in the first half of April before they seemed to plateau and in some cases, start to get a little better. We've seen a number of states already lift their ban on elective and scheduled procedures Texas for us, being probably the most notable state to have done so. And in some of our hospitals in Texas and some ambulatory facilities, we've actually started to see the resumption of elective and scheduled procedures. I think in most of our other states of consequence, Florida, California, Nevada, the general expectation is that the states will lift their bans sometime in the first half of May and we would expect, and we are certainly working very closely with our own employees and with our physicians, to be - to do everything we can to be ready for that resumption so that we can begin to treat those patients as quickly as the bans are lifted. And again, our hope is that that will occur in most of our geographies by early May. How quickly that's going to occur, I think is sort of beyond our control. In a lot of cases, I think it will be dependent on how patients themselves feel. We're certainly doing everything we can from a procedural perspective to make sure that patients feel like the hospital and - is a safe place to come and they can be protected. They'll be tested before they're treated and therefore, we can make sure that people are not being unnecessarily exposed to the virus, et cetera. So, the hope is that things begin to improve in late April and early May, but again, the trajectory of that and how quickly it occurs is very difficult to say, at this point. Frank Morgan : And just on the Medicare accelerated payment request, did you say there was also some additional dollars there you were expecting to receive? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes I mean our applications for those funds would indicate that we've only received about half of them. There's been some reporting that the government has slowed down those payments, I think mostly to Part B providers, which in theory, should not be - have an impact on us. But we're waiting to see. And we've been told, at least informally, that those applications and those requests that are in the queue will be paid and all requests were filed timely, et cetera. So, our hope is that we will receive an amount similar to what we have already received, but we're waiting to see how that plays out. Yes, I think we'll take the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fishbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fishbeck : Just wanted to try and understand I guess when you think about the procedures that have been delayed or - as deferred I guess. What percent do you think will end up coming back into the system and then if you could - in both segments? And again after you say that, can you spend a little more time on the psych side? Because it\u2019s not very clear to me, I understand elective procedure deferred - reschedule it. That makes sense on the acute side, but how does pent-up demand if at all, come back into the system if most of your volume is coming from ERs and things like that? I guess - I don't know if there's the same elective deferred process there. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes so look Kevin, the world has changed. And if you had asked me two months ago how much of our elective and scheduled procedures were sort of discretionary or deferrable. I would have told you that I think it's a relatively small percentage. And obviously, in the context of this pandemic, I would have been wrong. I think a lot of what's being deferred are things like cardiac procedures, basic cardiac procedures, stents and pacemakers, cardiac caths, surgeries like oncology surgery, neurosurgery, heavy duty orthopedics where patients are in a significant amount of pain. And I think generally, I would have described those procedures as not very deferrable. And I think our point of view is that over a period of time, and I think it's difficult to define exactly what that theory is, but I think our perspective is that most of those procedures will wind up getting done. We don't do a lot of what I would again describe as purely discretionary sorts of procedures, cosmetic procedures and ophthalmology procedures and things that certainly really are absolutely discretionary. We still do those kinds of procedures in the hospital and haven't done them for years. So, I think our point of view is that most of these procedures that have been postponed and deferred will ultimately take place. I mean that's the feedback we get from our physicians. And that's the sense we get as we ourselves analyze that on the acute side. On the behavioral side, we struggle a little bit with the same question that you posed. We don't exactly know where these patients are at the moment. We don't believe they're being treated in other forums, et cetera. And again as a consequence, we believe that ultimately behavioral volumes will return to normal. As a matter of fact, I think it's not unreasonable to speculate that we're in an extremely stressful environment for the vast majority of people and that folks who are - have a chronic mental illnesses are more likely to struggle with some of those illnesses in this environment and with these stresses than they might be in a normal period. So ultimately, I think we feel like, again, behavioral volumes will get back to normal. I'm not sure - that same sort of sense of recapture that there is in the acute side. But I think there's a sense of being able to get back to normal volumes once, I think, the majority of our referral sources start to resume some level of normal activity. We're spending a lot of time - in our behavioral business trying to understand where these patients are at the moment, where they are in the system. If there are efficient ways for us to capture them without them going through the sort of traditional referrals, but then again, I think we've made some progress. And as my earlier comments indicated in the latter half of April, I think we're seeing some glimmers of hope that behavioral volumes are now being at least in an incremental way. Kevin Fishbeck : And just maybe last question, if you think about this pent-up demand concept - in both businesses. How do you think about the margin, I mean I guess we can model things coming back to normal pretty easily, but if there's pent-up demand, does that come in at normal margin, higher margin, lower margin because you have to hire more nurses or temp staff? How do you think about what the probability of that business looks like if there\u2019s an above-average amount of pent-up demand coming back in the second half of the year? Alan Miller : My sense is it would come back at sort of the traditional margin. The reality is, the staff that historically treats those patients is there and available. They've largely been the ones that have had hours reduced just because there's a lack of patients. So, maybe there is some element of, over time or some temporary labor required if we're going to run the ORs over the weekend or later hours during the day. But I think for the most part, those patients get treated under a cost structure that very much resembles the traditional cost structure they would have been treated under. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from the line of Matthew Gillmor with Baird. Matthew Gillmor : Steve, I was hoping you could talk about the behavioral length-of-stay metric. It seemed to improve a little bit in the quarter. I was curious if you're seeing payers sort of reduce some of the utilization restrictions? And how that's been trending? Steve Filton : Yes, I think that's a tough one to answer, Matthew. It's hard to know whether that's kind of a meaningful change in the way payers have approached the business or it's just as the rest of the world was focused on COVID patients. There was just less attention. And I think we also have always had the sort of perspective that when volumes drop some in the behavioral businesses, there's a little bit less pressure to turn patients over as quickly. So, I think you saw some of that. I saw the last couple of weeks of the quarter and even into April are so different and unusual from anything we've ever experienced; I'm reluctant to draw any conclusions from trends and statistics like length of stay. Matthew Gillmor : Fair enough. Then Steve, could you quantify the reduction to CapEx. I think you had been talking about $800 million previously. Can you just give us the sense for how much you think you can reduce it going forward? Steve Filton : So, I think that it\u2019s at least a twofold sort of approach on our part, and one is obviously, as we're seeing our revenue stream and ultimately, obviously, the cash flows that will decline commensurate with that revenue reduction. We're trying to conserve our capital and make the capital investments that are sort of most necessary. Most impactful from a return perspective in the short run. And I think ultimately, we have a point of view that over the course of 2020, we'll probably wind up spending a quarter to a third less than what our original projections were. At the same time, and I think this is relevant to the bigger construction projects that we've been contemplating, and that included in our CapEx for the year and for several years, we've been experiencing several years\u2019 worth of escalating construction costs and pricing pressures, et cetera. And certainly have a sense that one of the benefits of this downturn is that those construction providers will be under some pressure as the demand for their services lessens. So, I think we feel there's an opportunity for us to reprice, recast, redid many of our projects, et cetera, at more reasonable prices. So, we're going to certainly make the effort to do that. And if we have to delay or elongate the timeline for some of those projects, I think we're willing to do that in this period. So, I think we're focused on accomplishing both of those objectives over the course of the next several months. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David Cohen with JPMorgan. David Cohen : My question relates to the inpatient sides of both of your segments. I wonder if you can frame for us what percentage of normal census you're running at, say, currently or for the month of April, whatever comes to mind, as a percentage of sort of normal for this time of the year? Thank you. Alan Miller : So, my prepared comment indicated, I think, that acute care admissions were down about 29% in the last two weeks of March and behavioral were down 25%. I think acute census and patient days and admission activity has sort of settled in around that number in April. I think the behavioral numbers have gotten a little bit better. But those numbers are kind of reflective of again, the declines we saw in March into early April. In both cases I think they're getting a little better in the back half of April. But they're reflective of the level of decline we've seen. David Cohen : Okay. Thank you. Alan Miller : We haven't heard from AJ. Steve, have you been in touch with him? Steve Filton : Yes, I have spoken with AJ. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Whit Mayo with UBS. Whit Mayo : Steve, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about payer mix and how you're working on identifying Medicaid coverage and triages from a process standpoint? It might be helpful to hear what you're doing operationally. I would think that the presumptive eligibility rules may help you, but just from a registration process standpoint, could you talk a little bit about your revenue cycle? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, Whit, in the short run, again, over the last I'll call it six weeks, we haven't really seen our payer mix change a great deal. Or see in particular a significant uptick in patients without insurance. Obviously, maybe not obviously, but I think a lot of employees who are not working have been furloughed, and I think a lot of furloughed employees are retaining their health benefits in many industries, et cetera. Obviously, the expectation is that going forward, to the degree that unemployment rises significantly as I think it's expected to do, we'll see an uptick in uninsured patients. Unlike the recession from a decade ago, there is some greater cushion here. Obviously, there's Medicaid expansion in a number of our states that should sort of help insulate some of that increase in uninsured volumes. There's some talk that Congress will provide extended COBRA benefits that obviously are the state and federal exchanges, which should provide an additional outlet for some patients. And so, our admitting folks and our folks who deal with coverage issues are prepared to make sure that our patients and prospective patients use every tool available to them to get the coverage they need. This is not the first time we've gone through this drill. I would say that a recessionary sort of environment is something that we're at least accustomed to working with. And that there are models for us and procedures that we employ. A little bit different than the COVID crisis, where I think we're sort of rewriting the playbook almost from scratch in certain cases. Whit Mayo : That's helpful. Maybe just two clarification questions. The Medicare-accelerated payments, did you give a number for what you expect to receive? And the $20 million malpractice increase in the quarter, any more color on the trends driving that would be helpful. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So, what I said previously was, we received the $375 million and have filed for and expect to receive a similar amount in the future, as long as CNS doesn't change their approach or change the rules in midstream. As far as the malpractice adjustment, it was really based on some - a relatively small number of large cases that sort of had negative outcomes over the course of the last quarter or two, and in our minds, required an adjustment to our reserve. I think it's a little too early for us to make a judgment about how that will affect our going-forward expense provisions, et cetera. So obviously right now, we feel like the $20 million adjustment gets us to where we need to be, but it's a - an area that we'll continue to monitor as we go forward. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Sarah James of Piper Sandler. Chris Neamonitis : This is Chris Neamonitis on for Sarah. I just wanted to check in, Steve. I know you mentioned expanding capacity in the OR for when procedural volumes do come back, can you clarify or maybe quantify just how much capacity you'd be able to add to meet some of that pent-up demand? Steve Filton : Yes. Look, I think it's fair to say that most of our hospital enlargement, and most hospitals enlarged, in general, they're not operating anywhere close to 100% capacity. And they operate from early in the morning, usually, until sometime mid-afternoon or so. So, we've certainly had the option to operate later into the day and on the weekends, et cetera. I think a lot of that is dependent, quite frankly, on surgeon capability and their capacity to operate safely, et cetera. I think we have the employees and I think we have the physical capacity to expand our capacity if there is a sort of a catch up or pipeline of demand that\u2019s greater than our normal volumes. But a lot of that, again, I think is going to be dependent not so much on any gating mechanisms we have in the hospital, but on patient perception and patient willingness to come back to the hospital, et cetera. And it's incumbent upon us as hospital providers to make our patients feel like it's a safe place to come and they can come and be treated in a safe environment. I think we have a whole host of procedures in place to do that and we're doing everything we can to make our patients feel like they should not have any significant concerns about coming in to be treated. Chris Neamonitis : Great, thanks. And then just a quick one. You also mentioned a decline in adolescent psych, but any chance you can maybe kind of clarify here, too, just how much of the behavioral business is dependent on referrals coming from schools? Steve Filton : Yes. So, that was a comment, particularly I think, about the residential business. Our residential behavioral business is probably in that 15% of our overall behavioral revenues. We certainly had adolescent patients in our general psychiatric hospitals, but I was specifically referring to the residential business before, and that's about 15% of our overall revenues. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Maybe a couple of things. One on the protective equipment, I know you said that that was something that was a little bit more costly now, but I wonder, because it seems like that's also a gating factor on when some of these locations are willing to - or some of these public health officials are willing to allow people to reopen. How are you standing in terms of your supply of that? And do you think that the public health officials in your markets are starting to feel comfortable that there's enough of a supply of that to allow for some of these procedures to come back? Alan Miller : Yes, A.J. So, I, again, in my prepared remarks, I had talked about two of the challenges that our hospitals have faced thus far, operational challenges have been tested in capacity and the supply of PP&E. And I think you're right. I think that in order to resume elective and scheduled procedures in a meaningful way, you have to be able to test all those patients in advance. And, obviously, get their results in a timely fashion. And obviously, also have to be assured that you have adequate personal protective equipment for those cases. And also in reserve if there is a second wave or resurgence in COVID patients, et cetera. So, I think that we have worked very hard over the last several weeks to ensure that the supply chain is adequate for the various items of personal protective equipment and that the testing capacity and testing timeliness has improved. I think in both cases, we feel like we've made progress. But I think that both of those items will continue to be - the issues as we move forward. And I agree with you. I think that to some degree, our ability not just for UHS, but our ability as an industry to resume kind of a normal schedule elective procedures will require us to continue to make progress on both of those issues. A.J. Rice: Okay. Obviously, labor was a challenge late last year on the acute side. And obviously, you're implementing cost reduction efforts now. But I wonder if more broadly, it maybe just too early for this, but obviously the uncertain economic backdrop, what's happening with procedures. Has that in anyway sort of adjusted expectations around labor that might be something that - will help you on that side going forward? Even beyond just some short-term cost reductions that you're pursuing? Steve Filton : I mean certainly what we've seen, again, in the last six or seven weeks, there is a dramatic reduction in our use of overtime and temporary nurses and registry personnel. And I think as long as we're both in a period of somewhat muted demand as well as a period of higher unemployment, that we will struggle less with those issues. Because I think they tend to be issues that are reflective of a much tighter labor market. So yes, that is certainly a side benefit of the revenue decline and decline in demand that we've seen. A.J. Rice: Okay. And I know there was all this discussion before about what was happening in the Vegas market with HCA getting back into the network with UNH. And you had some expectations around what that would do. Obviously, maybe it's hard to understand whether that's playing out as you thought or not. But at least maybe up to the last two weeks of March, can you comment on what you were seeing there, whether that was progressing as you had expected? Steve Filton : Yes so, the comments that we made on our year-end call were that our expectation was that the dynamic of HCA getting back in Sierra United Network would largely be a push for us. That is, as we would see a decline in volume as some amount of market share shifted to HCA's hospitals. But that would largely be offset by an increase in rates that we were getting from Sierra/United on those patients. I think, again, for the bulk of the first quarter, we were able to satisfy ourselves that that was the case. Obviously, in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, we saw a decline in Sierra patients as we did in all of our other patients. So, it became a little bit more difficult to do that analysis in March and certainly for the last half of March. But I think, we're of the mind that our original contemplation of the impact of this was correct and this is - at least in its initial stage is turning out to be either a wash or a very slight benefit to us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe : I hopped on a little bit late so apologies if it was asked already. But I was hoping you could talk a little bit more, Steve or Alan, about the sort of the current backdrop. And if it changes, sort of your forward views on the business in terms of strategy or positioning whether that sort of investing more downstream, taking more risk, partnering more? Just any sort of thoughts around that and potential for structural changes in the industry? Steve Filton : Ralph I think, I would make a couple of broad comments. I mean we - again in our prepared comments, we made the point, as I think a number of our peers have made. That up until the middle of March et cetera both businesses were operating in a pretty robust environment. They were tracking ahead of the prior year. I think they were meeting our own internal expectations. The business was good, the demand was good. And I think in our own minds, none of that has sort of fundamentally changed. I think that the COVID crisis has altered patient practice patterns if you will, in the short term, and I'm not exactly sure how to define the short-term. But ultimately, I think that demand as I've said before on the call will return. And so, I don't know that we're thinking about the business fundamentally differently because of the COVID crisis. Some of the questions that you asked about are we thinking about sort of taking more risk and partnering with others to do that, et cetera. I think we've talked on a number of occasions about the things that we're doing to do that well before the COVID - the COVID crisis. We're doing that through Medicare Advantage products in a number of our markets, we're doing that through our insurance subsidiaries. We have accountable care organizations established in virtually all of our markets. And so, I think we were employing and implementing many of those strategies and recognizing how the healthcare landscape is changing again, long before the COVID crisis. So I don't know that the COVID crisis has really altered that trajectory at all. Alan Miller : This is Alan Miller. Our business is in good shape. Our facilities are modern, we are well located. We have a nice division between behavioral and acute. And we've just been interrupted in what was on the way to be a very strong week. We are financially strong, our reputation is excellent, and we just got interrupted. I am thankful that at this point, it seems that COVID-19 is on the way down or is down. Our business will open up and I fully expect that by some point, June, July, end of May, our business will return. As a matter of fact, all of the elective surgery that have been not completed will come to the hospitals and I expect given time, we'll pick right back up. I\u2019m very positive about the future, whenever we start again. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. That's certainly helpful. And just my last one, sort of along those lines I guess as you consider the competitive backdrop then, in your market specifically and perhaps potential fallout even if things sort of come back. I mean, do you see or buy into the argument of share gains or M&A opportunities stemming from all this? Or do you think it's sort of - it\u2019s bounced back from an industry perspective and within your market you don't see that competitive dynamic really changing to create opportunities for you? Thanks. Steve Filton : Ralph, I think you know, and I think Alan articulated this and I tried to say it to some degree again in my prepared comments, I think we feel like we're well positioned, we're conservatively capitalized. And so, I think we have every expectation that we can deliver and continue to deliver high-quality care and efficient care in - even in this difficult environment. And while we hope that it rebounds quickly, to the degree that it doesn't. I think we're in a position to operate and survive in this environment better than most of our peers in our geographies in which we compete. So yes, I mean I think that anytime that there is a crisis, it also becomes an opportunity for those companies that are stronger and better positioned - and while I don't think we relish the notion that others will suffer in this environment, we're prepared to step in if they do. And if others can't provide the level of service and the level of capital investment that's required in our market, we certainly feel like we can do that. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We show no further audio questions at this time. Steve Filton : Okay, we thank everybody for their time. Hope everybody stays safe and look forward to talking with everyone next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call.

Please go ahead, sir. Steve Filton : Thank you, Natalya. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of the Universal Health Service's Results for the Second Quarter ended June 30, 2020. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections, and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.95 for the quarter. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.93 for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2020, we have received approximately $320 million of funds from various governmental stimulus programs most notably the CARES Act. Included in our reported income for the second quarter is approximately 218 million of net revenues recorded in connection with these stimulus program. Approximately 157 million of these revenues were attributable to our acute care facilities and 61 million were attributable to our behavioral health facilities.  In addition, during the second quarter of 2020, we received approximately $375 million of Medicare accelerated payments, which had no impact on earnings during the quarter.  As previously discussed in our first quarter conference call, beginning in mid-March, the incidence of COVID-19 and suspected COVID cases increased in our acute facilities. And correspondingly, the volume of non-COVID patients declined significantly. These declines in patient volumes generally continued into the first half of April.  Beginning with the second half of April, our admission in patient day metrics began to rebound. By the first half of May, local authorities had lifted restrictions on elective surgeries and other procedures, and those volumes began to rebound sharply as well. ER visits while also gradually improving have been the volume units slowest to recover, but the increased acuity of our patient population suggests at least in part, that the more severely ill patients who tended to return to the emergency rooms, and the less acute patients were the ones continuing to avoid that level of care.  In late June and continuing into July, most of our hospitals experienced the second wave of COVID cases. Although to date this second wave has not been accompanied by the same magnitude of non-COVID case declines that we experienced in the first wave in the March and April timeframe.  Generally, our hospitals were better able to prepare for this second wave with greater ICU and isolation room capacity, as well as more ample inventories of PPE. Obtaining timely COVID test results, as demand has increased, does remain a challenge in certain instances. The behavioral health segment experienced a similar pattern of volume changes with patient day metrics hitting a trough in early April and incrementally recovering for the rest of the quarter. Despite a number of headwinds including a decline in referrals from acute care emergency rooms and from schools which mostly remain closed and from travel restrictions on potential patients. Behavioral patient days returned to close to pre-COVID levels by mid-June prior to the late June second COVID wave.  As we noted in the first quarter, our paramount concern throughout the COVID crisis has been taking all the necessary steps to keep our patients and employees as safe as possible. We did however, also recognize the severe financial stresses created by the COVID crisis and we undertook a series of steps to mitigate the dramatic revenue declines and to protect our capital structure including one, cost reduction initiatives across all of our expense categories. Our approach in this regard, especially as it relates to labor expenses has been a balanced one, reflecting our expectation that the dramatic declines in volumes would in many instances be temporary in nature, and also recognizing the severe strain that the crisis has created on our employee caregivers.  Two, a reduction in planned capital spending. This effort was somewhat transparent in the second quarter as most of our existing and committed projects continued on schedule, but we expect the pace of spending to slow in the second half of the year, as newer projects are repriced and possibly postponed. And three, a suspension of share repurchase and quarterly dividend program.  As a result of these actions, as well as the funds received during the second quarter in connection with the governmental stimulus programs, and Medicare accelerated payment, the company has close to $1.4 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity as of June 30 2020, along with almost $600 million of short-term cash investments on the balance sheet. While we are encouraged by the improving volume trends in the quarter. We acknowledge the potential material COVID-19, potential impact COVID-19 could have on our future operations and financial results. And since the nature of these future COVID developments are largely beyond our ability to control we have continued to withhold any further earnings guidance for the balance of 2020. Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Natalya whenever you're ready. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Andrew Mok with Barclays. Andrew Mok : First, can you put some numbers around the acute and behavioral volume trends exiting June and how they've performed so far in July against the backdrop of rising cases? Alan Miller : So Andrew, I think that in terms of patient days as an example, I would say in mid-June, both our acute and behavioral patient days, were averaging something like 95% of pre-COVID level. I think there were some days where we were even higher than that. Same thing with elective and elective surgical and other procedures have climbed back for those levels. ER visits, as I noted in my remarks, we're still probably 25% short of pre-COVID levels. But then, as we saw the second wave hit in the last maybe 10 days of June and into July. So both of those metrics took a step back, I would say that for instance elective procedures were now running in the July timeframe, maybe 85% to 90% of pre-COVID level, behavioral patient days, we're running, let's say 90% to 95% of pre-COVID level. So a bit of a step back from where we were, but not that dramatic decline that we saw in the March, April timeframe. Andrew Mok : And then just wanted to follow up on the behavioral segment, you mentioned that your behavioral patient days rebounded in mid-June to near pre-COVID level. Even though ER volumes were still down meaningfully and schools were closed. What does that say about underlying demand for behavioral in this environment? And what are your expectations for volumes once all the referral sources are open and that full strength? Alan Miller : Sure, I think it says a few things. I mean, one is that our facilities and our operators took steps during the crisis to reach out to our potential patient population, who might have had concerns or anxiety about going to hospital ERs. And try to deliver the message to that population that there were other ways that they could enter the system and get care, get the assessments that they need and the ultimate care that they need. And I think that as the quarter went on, those efforts were more and more successful. But also, I think, as your questions sort of alluded to, I think, it suggests and I tried to say this in my prepared remarks that despite the headwinds that existed, fewer referrals in the ERs, schools being closed for the most part across the country, travel restrictions that behavioral demand really was restored to something close to pre-COVID levels. And I think it suggests that we had that underlying behavioral demand is quite strong. And I think our belief is that we'll continue to face some of these same headwinds including incidents of COVID to COVID virus amongst both our employee population and our patient population, but that their fundamental demand for behavioral services across the board and all sorts of diagnoses and illnesses, seems to be growing. And that seems to be consistent with what one might expect. It's an incredibly stressful environment for all of us. And so if you are someone who is predisposed to having a chronic behavioral illness, you can only imagine how difficult this environment is and the fact that a lot of those patients are being stressed now and need some extra care is not surprising, at least in my mind. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Eugene Kim : This is Eugene now for Justin. Just a quick follow up on Andrew's question earlier. What is July declining volume? Are these declines driven by a few states testing level of COVID or just more broad based and in your facilities? Alan Miller : Sure, well, the reality is that in our kids division, almost all of our facilities, the vast majority are located in hotspots in Florida and in Texas and in Las Vegas and in Riverside County, California and South Texas. All those areas have been hotspots. And so we've experienced this, the trends that I noted, really across the acute division. Our behavioral division is more geographically disparate, but obviously, the fact that there's been a resurgence in COVID cases across the south and the west means that we certainly have a large number of facilities that have been affected in the states that I mentioned also in Arizona, and in a number of other places as well. So it's been pretty broad based this second wave, although certainly not in every single facility. Eugene Kim : And I want to quickly ask about margin lost revenue for the quarter. It appears definite margins have improved quarter-over-quarter but still remain pretty high and north of 50%. Can you give us a little more color and how we should think about going forward? If there's room for to first move in the back half, if the volume doesn't fully recover? Alan Miller : So the margins in the first quarter and I think we discussed this at some length on the call were really dramatically impacted in a negative way I think for two reasons, one is we saw the rise in COVID cases in mid March, but saw this dramatic commensurate decline in non-COVID business. The cessation of elective surgeries, the decline in ER visits, the decline in behavioral patient day, et cetera. I think the other issue in Q1 was because it happened so suddenly and happened so late in the quarter, there was very little cost adjustments and cost reductions that took place in Q1.  In Q2, I think margin certainly looks sequentially better, as you know, for a variety of reasons, excluding the government stimulus funds, obviously, but, volumes rebounded during the quarter elective surgeries came back and the acute side, we made a significant amount of adjustments to our cost structure. But I think, we said this at the end of the first quarter, the nature of the hospital business is such that because so much of our costs are fixed and semi fixed in nature, it's almost impossible for us to reduce costs at the same rate that revenues are being reduced, particularly in this sort of environment where revenues have been reduced by a fairly dramatic amount. So as long as that's the case, we're going to face that margin headwind. Obviously, if volumes are restored, to sort of pre-COVID levels, we would have every expectation that we should be able to get back to a margin profile that also looks like the pre-COVID margin. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Can you talk a little more about expense management? Walk us through the main actions you've taken in acute during 2Q talk about premium labor will use paid for in 1Q versus 2Q and as you roll into the back half of the year. Are there any areas for additional cost savings on acute and/or behavioral? And at the same time, can you talk about any stress points that could actually lead to increased expenses for both in the back half of the year? Steve Filton : Pretty broad question, so I'll try and cover all the points. But I think when the COVID crisis first began, and we saw this dramatic reduction in revenue, we tried to take a broad look across all of our expense categories, and reduced expenses wherever that was possible. Obviously, you're looking to reduce expenses first. And those places where expenses are more naturally variable supply expenses being obvious. Labor being kind of the next obvious one, and it was a little bit difficult because, what we saw was a very uneven pattern of demand. So in other words, our emergency room volume was down, but it was high with COVID patients and suspected COVID patients. Our ICU volumes tended to be down. But the activity and a lot of the elective and procedural areas were down significantly. So we tried to make labor adjustments where that was most appropriate. But also, as I noted in my prepared remarks, I think we did start with the notion that in relatively short order, that demand would be restored and we wanted people to be able to come back to work, has that occurred, et cetera. So I think we were fairly cautious and how we reduce labor hours, et cetera. As your question alludes, one of the early things that we did was try and reduce the amount of premium labor and that includes things like overtime, the use of temporary nurses, the use of traveling nurses, and those we're significantly reduced in the second quarter and I think contributes to a lot of the labor reduction in the quarter. As we looked at the back half of the year, the biggest challenge, I think, is in predicting, and in planning for what the level of volumes will be. And again, these COVID surges and the ebbs and flows make it a little bit more difficult than predicting and preparing for a sort of a normal hospital season, which in and of itself tends to fluctuate some. So that's a challenge, but we'll continue to deal with that. I think our operators are doing a really remarkable job in the face of these challenges. And then finally, when you ask about potential stress points, I really think it's in the labor force. I don't think, it's possible to overstate how difficult this environment is for folks working on the front lines in hospitals, clinicians, support staff, et cetera. It's an incredibly stressful environment, they're being asked to do a great many things. They're responding in my mind magnificently. But the longer this goes on, the more challenges that creates, in terms of their ability to continue to work in that stressful environment, employees have been exposed to the virus, they need time to recuperate and quarantine and all those things. So that probably is the single biggest stress point that we worry about, in terms of the continuation of the virus. Pito Chickering : Because my last question was pretty broad, my follow up will be a lot more targeted. Behavioral demand has been pretty robust relative due to COVID. Can you give us any breakout of geographical differences you seen across your portfolio? Or maybe more importantly, what specialties are you seeing elevated demand and where are you seeing lower demand? Alan Miller : We talk I think a little bit about this in Q1, I think our residential business was less impacted by the COVID crisis, that's why I think in large part our length of stay appears to be longer. Our residential business carries a much longer length of stay. The acute business the acute behavioral business, which tends to rely more on emergency room referrals, et cetera has been more impacted. The addiction treatment business, particularly the legacy foundation, addiction treatment business which involved and depended on a lot of travel for treatment, and as you might imagine, that sort of aspect of their business was diminished significantly. So, that came under some pressure.  But generally, as I sort of, I think answered in my last question or in my last response, we're seeing demand for behavioral services across all diagnoses to the fairly robust and I think it's because as I said before, I think if you are predisposed to having a chronic behavioral illness, whatever it might be schizophrenia, severe depression, addiction illness, and you're under the kind of stress that most people are under in this environment, the likelihood that you're going to suffer some sort of traumatic episode or require incremental care, et cetera, I think is much greater. And I think we're seeing a lot of it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fishbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fishbeck : So I guess, obviously the rates were quite strong, because we have that higher equity volume staying in and the lower equity volume was delayed, I mean, how should we think about modeling that? I guess the pent up demand in theory is probably going to be lower acuity, so that would mean that when volumes come back rate should be lower. Is there any way to think about what impact that should have on margins when we have this pent up demand? Is it more about that? Or is it more about revenue growth which going to determine the margin expectation? Steve Filton : So you didn\u2019t specifically say Kevin, but I assume this is mostly an acute care question because things are pricing on the behavioral side, what I'd consider to be pretty normal or historically normative. Yeah, so, as your question sort of I think presumes, the revenue per adjusted admission on the acute side of the business was historically strong in the quarter. It's a reflection again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the high acuity of our patients, which I think is a combination of a couple of things. One is the COVID patients themselves that we are seeking seeing are quite sick many of them. Particularly, as everybody reads, the elderly and those with chronic underlying conditions tend to have a longer length of stay, they tend to have a lot of complications. And I think that's being reflected in the revenue numbers and the pricing numbers that you're seeing. I think the other issue as we've talked about in my commentary about ER visits, the less acutely ill patients are tend to be sort of staying away from the hospital in greater numbers. And therefore, they're not sort of creating that balance in pricing that has existed normally. In terms of how to model that is difficult to do. I think it's one of the reasons why we're reluctant to give any sort of precise guidance as we move forward? Because I think it very much depends on the level and the amount of COVID patients we see, the kind of COVID patients we see are they going to be sort of the older cohort, more elderly that we saw in the first wave, kind of a younger cohort that we saw in the second wave? How sick are they going to be? How comfortable are people going to be to come back to hospitals and emergency rooms, for what I would describe as a little bit more normal care? All these things are difficult to predict. I would think that overtime, our Acute Care pricing will return to more normal levels as the COVID crisis even et cetera. But exactly how quickly that occurs and over what period of time. Again, difficult to predict without knowing sort of what the trajectory of the virus is going to be. Kevin Fishbeck : And then I guess on the, on kind of that dynamic. If we have a situation where for the next few quarters kind of core volume, if you will, or 90%, 95% and COVID volumes are 5% or 10% for that period. Your occupancy overall is kind of normal. Can you get normal margins on payer mix, for patient mix like that, or does it need to be really more kind of core volumes that you will? Alan Miller : Look, I think that we were headed in June to an experiment or however we want to think about it or a month, I think, in our own minds that we felt was going to closely resemble again, it's not the greatest term, but I call it a normal, volumes will return into something close to pre-COVID levels and I think if we had finished June, without the second wave of COVID cases, that would have been the experience, we would have would at least probably have exited the month at something close to pre-COVID levels. And I think that would have been a good test and I'm in my own sense is that we would have gotten back to something approaching that pre-COVID kind of margin profile. We didn't get a chance to really experience that because of the second wave. So it's difficult for me to say that with great or precise certainty. But my sense is if we can get most of our volumes, patient days admissions, on the acute side, elective procedures and surgeries and behavioral side patient is back to something approaching pre-COVID levels. There's no real reason why we shouldn't get close to pre-COVID margins. There's some amount of incremental expense associated with treating COVID and COVID suspected patients, but I don't think it's really what's moving the needle. What's moving the needle in terms of that margin shortfall again, is the sort of notion of COVID cases pushing out. We're squeezing out to a degree, non-COVID cases, which happened in great numbers early on in March-April timeframe, and in much smaller numbers in May-June timeframe. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brent Kasser with JPMorgan. Brent Kasser : Maybe as a follow up to Pito\u2019s question and you mentioned the length of stay impact and the mix of the residential business but how do you also continue to see a relaxing of managed care policies in terms of controlling length of stay? And when do you think that sort of normalizes? Steve Filton : Yeah, I think probably the biggest impact has been the shift in business. And as I said, the residential business tends to have historically a much longer length of stay than the acute business. So, we're having the volume declines focus on the acute side of the business, I think just naturally is created that with greater the growth and length of say. But you're right, I mean, I think we see in some of our other payer categories length of stay has crept up a little bit and it's hard to say whether that is a reflective of a somewhat more acutely ill population or a relaxing on the part of managed care companies that some of their utilization review procedures in the crisis. I think ultimately, the payers will behave the way, they always behave which is trying to manage as efficiently and effectively as they can their medical spend. So I don't think that whatever benefit that is, and I don't think it's that great. I don't think it's sustainable over a long period of time.  But again, I think what's driving the increased length of stay is probably other factors for relaxing on the part of the payer to. If you follow, because I know, everybody in the call does, their earnings, et cetera they're quite good. So they've been pretty successful at controlling their medical utilization rather than actively or just naturally in this COVID crisis. Brent Kasser : And then, I guess at a higher level, I'd be interested in sort of your updated views of sort of telehealth as it relates to the behavioral health strategy and how COVID has sort of obviously changed the environment as it relates to ultimate and how you're thinking about utilizing that moving forward? Steve Filton : I think from our perspective, the biggest impact on telehealth in this last few months has been to provide an alternative access point or portal into the system, particularly for patients who are anxious about entering the system in a more traditional way going through an acute care ER or a community mental health center or kids who are not in school, whatever it might have been. And what telehealth did was enable our facilities and our clinicians to access patient population in another way, and asses them if they needed assessment and direct them to the sort of care that they needed or in some cases to provide an outpatient therapy session to a patient needed outpatient therapy. But again, was reluctant to receive that therapy in an person setting. So I don't think, telehealth really replaced in any way our core business of inpatient care. But what it did and I think what we've done very effectively in a short period of time, is creating a much more robust telehealth infrastructure that gives the potential patient population more optionality about how to enter the system, how to be assessed, how to receive outpatient treatment in a broader way than they had four or five or six months ago. Operator : Your next question is from on the line at A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice : Just a couple quick questions if I could ask. On the 477 million that you highlighting is Medicare accelerated payments and deferred government stimulus. Is there any way to disaggregate or saying how much of each of those and the part that the stimulus grants has been deferred? When did you expect to recognize that what's the gating factor on that? Steve Filton : So the 375, which I alluded to in the script, A.J. is the Medicare accelerated payments. Those are just what they say they are. They were meant to be pre-payments for Medicare patients. They begin to get repaid and we believe, I think as early as August and then we paid over sometime, there is some conversation in Congress about altering the payment terms et cetera. The other issue which we talked about in Q1 is that we did not receive all the Medicare accelerated payments that we had applied for and we believe have been appropriately approved for it. So it's conceivable that there is more of those to come.  The other roughly $100 million, are stimulus funds that we've received, but have not recorded into income yet, because we could not attest for the fact that we had either incremental COVID expenses for lost revenues as a result of COVID that would justify those and now we have some time to do that. In other words, if, as this crisis continues, we incur more incremental expenses or lose more revenue, we may be able to justify some more of that. It's also possible that some of that will ultimately be returned. We're being very sort of prudent about how we treat these things that are only recognizing the fund that we believe can be clearly justified in terms of the criteria that CMS has set forth. A.J. Rice : And my other question was, and this understand if it\u2019s all been put on hold. But last fall, you may have brought in new management in the behavioral business. And I know there was some discussion about potential initiatives looking at re-contracting, and managed care somewhat maybe using the leverage of the market strength or even the national strength, you have to try to get some advantage better advantages than you had historically there was also discussion about better use of data. Is that moving forward and how much of that is done or did it all get the most of it got put on hold because of the COVID crisis? Alan Miller : So I think the answer is a little bit of both. Matt Peterson started with the company back in September. And I think, in that September to March timeframe created a number of initiatives, including some of what you talked about, which is sort of entering into conversations with a number of large payers about different ways of sort of approaching the business in a way that would create sort of a win-win for both the payer and also the provider.  I think, as your question sort of alludes to however, a lot of those conversations, a lot of those initiatives were put on pause and beginning into mid-March with the COVID crisis, and while I think we continue to have some conversations with our payers in that regard, the focus has primarily over the last several months been on just sort of blocking and tackling running facilities in a very, this very difficult sort of COVID environment. So the hope, obviously, is that we will see, and using these COVID cases at some point in the next few quarters, and those conversations and initiatives can be restored. But I think they've largely been on put on hold over the last three or four months. A.J. Rice: Maybe just another aspect of the behavioral business, and I'm sorry I get a little late on them, but did you talk about it already, don't worry about it. But you obviously got the schools closed which were a referral source for you. A lot of the acute care guys are reporting to ER volumes are down. You see some pressure in your behavioral business, but it holding maybe better than you might expect, given those other two variables. Is there any way to sort of give an assessment of is this crisis resulting in more in demand for the service on an underlying basis. And if you see those other two start to come back, you might end up coming out the other end, stronger demand environment, if you have any view on that? Alan Miller : Yeah, I will share my view. And I'll caveat it by saying, I'm not sure that it's entirely supported by objective evidence. But, as I think about an environment where emergency room visits across the country are down 25% or 30%, and schools are closed, and travel is severely restricted. And still, I'm able to say that to the previous second wave on COVID, our behavioral volumes were back to something pretty close to pre-COVID levels. I think and I did say this to somebody earlier. I think that's a reflection of the fact that the underlying demand for behavioral services is rather robust because those are some pretty significant headwinds.  Now, some of that is a credit to our operators and our facilities who I think have worked very hard over the last three or four months to work around those headwinds, and to reach patients who were not in entering the system through acute care emergency rooms and reach adolescence who are not necessarily in schools, and they've done a good job of that. But I think, the mere fact that, volumes have climbed back to the level that they had is a reflection that they've revised, you would think would be as strong pre-COVID and post COVID. And I think there's a legitimate argument to be made and both intellectually and intuitively I believe the notion that behavioral demand has increased in this crisis is not hard to speculate, and I think we've seen that and I think we'll continue to see it grow as the COVID patients are stabilized and are dealt with. Operator : There are no further questions. Steve Filton : Okay. Well, we thank everybody for their time and hope that everybody stay safe and look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Steve Filton. Please go ahead sir. Steve Filton : Thank you and Good morning. Alan Miller and Marc Miller are also joining us this morning and we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the sections on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30th, 2020. We'd like to highlight a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.82 for the quarter. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.88 for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, we have received approximately $396 million of funds from various governmental stimulus programs, most notably the CARES Act. Included in our reported income for the nine months and three months, respectively, is approximately $213 million and negative $5 million of net revenues recorded in connection with these stimulus programs. For the nine months, approximately $161 million of these revenues were attributable to our acute care facilities and $52 million were attributed to our behavioral health facilities. In addition, during 2020, we received approximately $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments, which had no impact on our earnings during the first nine months. As previously discussed in our first quarter conference call, beginning in mid-March, the incidence of COVID-19 and suspected COVID cases increased in our acute facilities and correspondingly, the volume of non-COVID patients declined significantly. These declines in patient volumes generally continued into the first half of April. Beginning with the second half of April, our admission and patient day metrics began to rebound. By the first half of May, local authorities had lifted restrictions on elective surgeries and other procedures, and those volumes began to rebound sharply as well. ER visits, while also gradually improving, have been the volume unit slowest to recover, but the increased acuity of our patient population suggests, at least in part, that the more acutely ill patients tended to return to the ERs and the less acute patients were the ones continuing to avoid that care. In late June, and continuing throughout the third quarter, most of our hospitals experienced the second wave of COVID cases, although to date, this second wave has not been accompanied by the same magnitude of non-COVID case declines that we experienced in the first wave in that March-April timeframe. Generally, our hospitals were able to better prepare for this second wave with greater ICU and isolation room capacity, as well as more ample inventories of PPE. The Behavioral Health segment experienced a similar pattern of volume changes, with patient day metrics hitting a trough in early April and incrementally recovering for the rest of the quarter. Despite a number of headwinds, including a decline in referrals from acute care emergency rooms, from schools which have not fully returned in-person learning and from travel restrictions on potential patients, patient days at our Behavioral Health facilities improved during this year's third quarter to approximately 97% of the volume realized during last year's third quarter. As we noted in the first quarter, our paramount concern throughout the COVID crisis has been taking all the necessary steps to keep our patients and employees as safe as possible. We did, however, also recognize the severe financial stresses created by the COVID crisis, and we undertook a series of steps to mitigate the dramatic revenue declines and to protect our capital structure, including cost reduction initiatives across all of our expense categories. Our approach in this regard, especially as it relates to labor expenses, has been a balanced one, reflecting our expectation that the dramatic decline in volume would in many instances be temporary in nature, and also recognizing the severe strains that the crisis has created on our employee caregivers. As the crisis has continued, it has increased the pressure on our ability to staff our hospitals at competitive rates and to meet current demand levels. We've also implemented a suspension of our share repurchase and quarterly dividend programs. As a result of these actions as well as the funds received in connection with the governmental stimulus programs and Medicare accelerated payments, the company had closed to $1.45 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2020, along with approximately and cash equivalents. While we are strongly encouraged by the mostly stable volume trends in the quarter, we acknowledge the potential material impact that COVID-19 could have on our future operations and financial results. And since the nature of these COVID developments are largely beyond our ability to control, we have continued to withhold any further guidance -- earnings guidance for the balance of 2020. We would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Andrew Mok with Barclays. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow-up on the strong pricing in both segments this quarter. On the acute side, can you give us the surgery statistics for the quarter and give us a sense for how acuity trended on a comparable basis, excluding COVID patients? Steve Filton : Sure, Andrew. So, I would suggest that the drivers of the really strong acuity on the acute side are number one, the acuity of the COVID patients themselves. COVID patients, I think, on average, have a case mix that is about 50% higher than non-COVID patients. So, that's a driver. Our non-COVID case mix is also up. And one of the things, I think, that we note and hear from our hospitals is that at least a portion of the patients who come to our hospitals have delayed or deferred their care during the pandemic. And so when they come to the hospitals, they tend to be more acutely ill than they would have been had they come sort of on a more timely basis. And then finally, consistent with what I said in my prepared remarks, I think that the absence of -- the decline in emergency room visits, we believe, is largely concentrated in the lower acuity patients. So, the mix of patients we have is, by nature, are a higher acuity mix because so many of those lower acuity patients are absent from the emergency room. Andrew Mok : Great. And on the behavioral side, the length of stay moderated on a sequential basis but revenue per adjusted admission remains strong. What supported the strong pricing there? And how should we think about the sustainability of that in Q4 and in 2021? Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure. Because the behavioral revenue per adjusted patient day was as high as it was, we certainly did a deeper dive ourselves to try and understand. I don't know that there's one particular element of explanation. I think we found that we are getting the benefit of some higher contractual rate increases. We're seeing the impact of a little bit more leniency on the part of managed care companies in terms of things like denials and concurrent utilization management. There were small amounts of positive reimbursement adjustments in this quarter and also some negative adjustments in last year's third quarter. Again, none of these were material. My gut, Andrew, is that, that number at 5% to 6% revenue per day growth will moderate some next quarter and probably more into that 3%, 4% range. Andrew Mok : Got it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Matthew Borsch : Realize that you're not wanting to give guidance here, but would you be willing just to tell us what are maybe some of the headwinds and tailwinds that you're thinking about as we contemplate 2021? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean the way that I think we're thinking about the business, and I think our results in this quarter are emblematic, is that on the acute side, broadly, and I think our peers have seen very similar trends. We are seeing some more moderated volumes than we were seeing pre-pandemic, but those lower volumes have largely been offset by higher acuity. The reason I think we'd be reluctant to give any further guidance is we don't know how the COVID trajectory is likely to play out over the course of the fourth quarter and into next year. And until -- I think some of those trends are more stabilized, it would be difficult to say. But I think that, again, what we were able to demonstrate in the third quarter is that we could produce acute care bottom line growth with lower volumes and higher acuity. I think our sense is that as the COVID crisis stabilizes some, volumes will increase and acuity will decline and will start to approach metrics that look a little bit more like what they look like pre-pandemic. But the cadence of that and the trajectory of that is what, I think, we find challenging to project. On the Behavioral Side, I think what we have found is that, there are a number of hospitals, several of which I tried to enumerate in my prepared remarks, that are preventing our behavioral hospitals from getting back to pre-pandemic volume levels. They're a little bit short of that. But they've largely made up for it through, again, higher revenue per day, as well as strong cost-cutting initiatives. Again, I think we have a perspective that as the COVID crisis stabilizes, behavioral volumes will increase, the timing and cadence of that is what's difficult to predict. Matthew Borsch : If I just, 1 follow-up on the behavioral volumes. Do you agree with the characterization that COVID has perhaps created a larger bolus of people needing mental health services, or is it just too much of a mix of things to make that call? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think -- again, what I tried to say in my prepared remarks, Matt, is that, I think, COVID has created some practical headwinds for the behavioral business. The decline in emergency room visits has clearly affected our referrals from emergency rooms, which are a significant source of behavioral patients.  The intermittent sort of return to schools has certainly affected our adolescent referrals from school systems. Some of our hospitals rely reasonably heavily on travel, patients who are traveling, and, obviously, that's been diminished. So we're actually encouraged by the fact that our behavioral volumes are as high as they are, given these other dynamics because as your question suggests, we do believe that the COVID crisis has created a significant amount of incremental stress on the entire population and obviously, particularly on those who are predisposed to have behavioral issues. So again, I think we have a view that as the country returns to sort of more normalized patterns of work and school and travel, and I'm not exactly sure when that will be, but when that occurs, I think we believe that there is a reservoir of behavioral volumes still to be satisfied. Matthew Borsch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask if you could give a little color on the Las Vegas market. I wanted to see if you're seeing anything substantially different in the trends there as far as the economy goes or volumes and payer mix? Steve Filton : Sure, Kevin. I mean, I think, that it's fair to say that almost all of our acute care hospitals, certainly all of our larger acute care hospitals, whether they're in District of Colombia or South Florida, Vegas, Texas, Riverside County, California, were in geographies that were considered COVID hotspot in the third quarter. So the dynamic of more COVID patients when we clearly saw an acceleration of COVID patients in the third quarter in virtually all of our markets, we saw an increase in acuity that we've already discussed. But again, I think that was largely all across the board. Many of the markets that I enumerated are also experiencing higher levels of unemployment than the national averages. I don't think that at least at the current moment, we've seen a really significant impact of that yet in these geographies, I think, in part because -- and I think our peers have mentioned the similar dynamic a lot of the decline in ER volumes seems to reside with those poor paying or lower patients with a lesser ability to pay so -- I mean our payer mix remain relatively stable despite the fact that we're in markets, including Las Vegas that are experiencing some higher unemployment. Obviously -- specifically to Las Vegas, how that economy rebounds and how quickly it recovers, I think, is dependent in large part on travel patterns and particularly airline travel patterns. I think that the Vegas market reports, for instance, that casino volumes amongst the local population, people in Las Vegas and Nevada and California and Arizona are pretty strong, not all that far off from pre-COVID levels, but these are, for the most part, people who are driving to Las Vegas. I think those tourists who are coming by airline to Las Vegas are down much more significantly. And how quickly that rebound will be, I think, determinant of how quickly the economy recovers in Vegas. But again, at the moment, I think that's a little hard for us to speculate on. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. And then I guess, when we think about the acuity improvement, are you actually seeing then just a lack of low acuity patients -- that low acuity is dropping faster than high acuity is dropping, but high acuity is also still dropping? Steve Filton : Yes. So as I said in an earlier response, I mean, I really think it's three things, and you enumerated two of them. The COVID patients themselves are much sicker and more acutely over the non-COVID patients. The absence of the lower acuity patients sort of mathematically drives up acuity. But we are also finding that non-COVID patients are coming in generally more acutely ill, and we attribute that dynamic to the idea that many patients are delaying and deferring care so that when they do come to the hospital, maybe a month or two after they've started to experience whatever symptoms they're having, they may well be sicker than had they come on a more timely basis. Kevin Fischbeck : So, you would say that your actual -- that high acuity patients are actually up year-over-year despite total volumes being down? Steve Filton : Yes. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, all right. Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody and I want to wish best wishes to Alan and Marc as they transition roles there. Maybe to look at your cost management, which looks like meaningfully positive there. I guess the rate increase -- or the relative rate increases, pricing helps on that. It looks like labor and other operating expense did show a nice year-to-year trend. Is that also a function of some of the cost initiatives? Can you tell us where that stands? And I noticed that was true for both acute and behavioral that you saw similar -- or you saw improvements in labor and other operating expense? Steve Filton : No, I think that's accurate, A.J. I think you have to put all this in context. So, in mid-March, when the COVID crisis really first began in earnest and we saw this dramatic decline in non-COVID visits and ER visits in elective and scheduled procedures on the acute side and behavioral patient days almost sort of complete sort of lockdown across the country. It was very difficult to predict where business was going, what we would be dealing with, et cetera. And so both our business segments and our operators, I think, took dramatic and prudent steps to try and right-size the labor force and right-size our hours in response to the demand declines. And obviously, we were fortunate and both businesses have recovered relatively quickly, and demand has come back. But I think, again, both operating managers in both segments have been prudent in restoring the labor that had been sort of rightsized. And so I think we benefited that from clearly in Q3. I think as the demand continues to increase, I think labor will continue to also increase and be rightsized. But one of the dynamics are, it's difficult to make dramatic cuts to labor in the hospital business because after you adjust for the immediate demand, now you're cutting into fixed and semi-fixed costs and overhead costs, et cetera and that's difficult to do. But once it's done, I also think that there's a sustainability kind of aspect to it. And we saw this during the recession -- The Great Recession 10 years ago, where there were some pretty dramatic cuts made at the beginning of the recession and they were relatively slow to be restored. And I think you're seeing some of that same dynamic here today A.J. Rice: Okay. And then a follow-up one would be around your ER volumes, I guess, or down 26% above that right? Two things, I guess, on that is, you're saying it's mainly the low acuity. So the percentage of those ER visits that end up on the inpatient side? Are you seeing that increase and sort of validate the thoughts that the people that are showing up were sicker what it would be in a normal environment? And then on your outpatient volume in general, is that also still lagging substantially in terms of coming back or is that doing better than what you're seeing with the ER? Steve Filton : So, in response to your first question, we are clearly seeing what we describe as a higher conversion rate of ER visits. That is a much higher percentage of people who are coming to the ER, are being admitted to the hospital. And I think that's a function of exactly what we've been talking about, which is the lower acuity patients, the scrapes and bruises and ear infections and strep throats are not necessarily coming, but the cardiac patients and stroke patients are coming and so they're being admitted at a greater frequency. As far as the second question goes, I think a big -- at least on the acute side, the decline in ER visits is what's driving a lot of the outpatient decline. Obviously, there's a lot of attendance sort of revenue that goes along with an ER visit could be pharmacy, it could be radiology, it could be lab. And so to the degree that ER visits are down 25% to 30%, we're going to see outpatient revenues in that other -- in those other areas down as well. Outpatient surgeries and scheduled and elective surgeries have remained pretty strong. They're not at pre-COVID levels, but they're pretty close and stronger than ER volume certainly. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Sarah James : Hi, thank you. I was hoping that you could update us on where you are on catching up on delayed procedures. And it would be really helpful if you could break that out into procedures that were delayed from the first half versus the third quarter. Steve Filton : So Sarah, what we said last quarter was elective and scheduled procedures had come back by the middle of June to something pretty close to pre-COVID levels. And then with that second wave that began in late June and then certainly carried into July and for most of the third quarter, we saw a moderate step back in those elective and scheduled procedures. And it is varied by market because in the markets that go through particularly significant COVID wave, you see more pressure on those sorts of things. But generally, I would say that for the third quarter, across the portfolio, elective and scheduled procedures have been in that 90% to 95% range of pre-COVID levels, although it does vary by market and it does vary by the markets that are experiencing COVID surges. Sarah James : Does that mean that the delayed procedures have been rebooked? So I'm just trying to parse between the surgeries that were for a specific quarter going through versus the catch-up being completed? Steve Filton : Yeah. So I think it's difficult. And I know some of our peers have given some pretty precise numbers about that. I think it's difficult to say -- when we schedule a surgery or we schedule a procedure, it's difficult for us to know when that patient was originally seen by their doctor, whether they were sort of in the pipeline, whether they were deferred, et cetera. We don't really become aware of the patient until they are at their hospital procedure schedule. So I would say our experience in large part has been that -- in that mid-April to mid-May timeframe as physicians returned to more normal practice patterns that they did just that. They returned to their more normal practice patterns. If they did surgeries two days a week and office hours, two days a week, that's largely what they did. Some physicians certainly made more of an effort to catch up and get through the backlog than others. But I think we have a feeling just generally that we haven't really seen a bolus of catch-up and that the rate of surgical procedures that we're experiencing certainly sustainable. It's not like, I think, we have a sense that there's been a bolus and now we're going to see a real dip just because we've worked through that bolus. Sarah James : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Going back on behavioral demand. Can you give us a little more color on what segments you saw strengths and weaknesses during the quarter? Any geographic areas or strengths and weaknesses? And any color on where you exited the quarter on behavioral demand? Anything you can tell us about October would be great. Steve Filton : It's a little hard to answer the question, Pito, about the behavioral division only because the geographic dispersion of our behavioral facilities is so much more to piece than it is on the acute side. What I will say just sort of generally is our behavioral hospitals in markets where there was a COVID surge tended to be impacted more than in markets where there weren't. So -- and again, through some of the reasons that I enumerated earlier, ER volumes would go down in a market where there was a COVID surge. People were staying at home or they didn't want to necessarily, again, go to what we would consider to be the normal access point to hospital ER, mental health center, private psychiatrist office and so we were challenged there. We're also challenged in our behavioral division, when we get a COVID patient or COVID patients because we're not as prepared necessarily as we are in the acute care hospital. So we'll create and isolate a unit, a 10-bed unit or 15-bed unit for COVID patients. But if we only have 1 or 2 COVID patients, it's more inefficient, quite frankly, than it tends to be on the acute side. So other than making the point that, I think, probably the most variable sort of element that we're seeing in our behavioral volumes is the incidence of COVID patients in the market and in particular facilities, that's sort of the one overarching observation I make. Alan Miller :  It's -- Steve, it's well agreed that COVID has had a very detrimental effect on general mental health. Number of suicides, number of depression, alcoholism has all gone up. And as the COVID-19 gets better treatment, which we'll see in the future, I think we're going to see a volume of these patients come to the hospitals, which they have been avoiding now because of the COVID-19 threat. Pito Chickering : Okay. And actually, my next question is either for Mark or Alan. Relative to your peers, the balance sheet is definitely running under-levered versus everyone else. I understand there are a lot of issues going on with COVID and Medicare Funds and Grant Funds going around. But in general, how should we think about leverage ratios going forward? Are there any minimum levels where we can assume the excess free cash flow goes to share repurchases? I'm just trying to understand how far sort of deleveraging can go before it finds a floor? Steve Filton : Peter, let me respond quickly. And then certainly, Alan and Mark can add their perspective. We certainly acknowledge that we're in a very favorable capital structure position and leverage position at the moment, and we feel comfortable with that. We still feel like there's a significant amount of uncertainty in the business, obviously, not just for UHS, but broadly for the country and the hospital business in general. There's lots of speculation that things could get worse from a COVID perspective as the winter progresses and with the holidays come around and people are less strict about their social distancing, etcetera. And I'm not wanting to tell you how that's all going to play out. But I think from our perspective, we'd like to probably get to the other side of the New Year at least and then sort of take a step back and recalibrate where we are, et cetera. But certainly at the moment that we're in a really strong position. And if that continues, I think that we would have every intention to resume our share repurchase and dividend programs early next year. But certainly, Alan or Marc further thought, they can weigh in. So that means that we have a relatively consensus view of things. Alan Miller : We have always been conservative. We've never had or sought to have a problem with regard to funding. And that's the case at the moment. So that will continue. That will \u2013 I don't always be universal. I mean we will be prudent with regard to our cash and our cash expenditures. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. Steve, can you give us a sense of COVID admissions in the quarter and maybe revenue contribution? And then just give us a sense maybe more broadly of the month-to-month volume trend and any early for October within the acute segment? Steve Filton : Yes, Ralph, I mean, COVID admissions in the third quarter were about 12% of our total acute care admissions. That was a significant increase over the second quarter where, I think, it was probably about 5% was an equivalent number. The trajectory of it was that July was clearly the peak and then we saw the COVID cases come down in August and then come down again a little bit in September. Data for October is a little bit harder to give you with precision because we got the complication of the cyber attack that occurred late in September and our recovery was ongoing for a good chunk of October, and we continue to backload some of our data, et cetera. So we don't have as sort of good information as we would at this point in a month as we might otherwise have. But, I think, our general sense is that COVID volumes are relatively stable in October with the exception of a couple of hospitals that have seen pretty significant surges. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then\u2026 Steve Filton : And you think about the \u2013 just on that revenue \u2013 I am sorry, Ralph. You asked about the revenue contribution. I think I mentioned before in a previous response that the case mix index of COVID patients was about 50% high than the non-COVID patients. I don't have the exact revenue \u2013 sort of the commensurate revenue information. But, I think, order of magnitude, you would expect revenue to be similar. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I wanted to go to the just general sort of rate backdrop. First on the Medicaid side. Obviously, some fairly hefty cuts in Nevada, I believe. So, I guess, what's the outlook for rates in Medicaid next year? And then if you could just touch on the commercial rate backdrop as well. Just give us a sense of maybe how much you've locked in for 2021 and 2022? And maybe a rough range of what those rates are and if there's still generally three years in length? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I think the percentage of long-term contract is not as great as it was a few years ago. I mean, I think, we're largely locked into our 2021 rates, although it's fair to say that we're always working with our payers where we think our rates might be under-market or there has been a long time since we've gotten what we believe to be reasonable rate increases. Particularly on the government side of things, I think on the commercial side, that process tends to be a more sort of regular and scheduled process. When I said the government side, I'm talking about managed Medicare, Medicaid, and particularly, Medicaid. Look, I think we have a point of view that the managed care companies across the board are doing quite well, and they're doing quite well in large part because of a reduction in provider payments during the pandemic. And so where we think that our rates are not so competitive, we're going to use that particular data point as yet another way of working with the payers to get what we think are at a rate. And obviously, that's a two-way process. So, we'll push forward, they push back, and hopefully, the end result is one that's fair to both parties. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Josh Raskin : Hi thanks. I think you've talked to a couple of points here that may be part of the answer. But the basic question is, do you make money fee on low acuity patients? It just seems like the low acuity is disappearing. I understand there's a little bit more high acuity patient mix. But EBITDA doesn't appear to be impacted by this, or is it just significant cost-cutting is kind of hiding the impact and you do make money on those low acuity patients? Steve Filton : Yes. Look, I think it's a pretty broad question, Josh, and maybe difficult to answer in a pervasive way. But I think we've always made the point that low acuity patients in the ER are probably not very profitable. And again, I cited the bumps and bruises and strep throat and ear infections before. But I think we've always had the view that those patients for a variety of reasons are probably more effectively treated somewhere else in the system, in large part because the overhead in the hospital -- and the overhead in the hospital ER is much more significant than it would be in a lower acuity setting like an urgent care center or a retail pharmacy clinic, that sort of thing. At the end of the day, I think we have a point of view, however, that we are probably able to earn a reasonable profit on any patient that is insured, whether they have Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. The real challenge with hospitals and with emergent -- acute care hospitals and emergency rooms, in particular, is that uncompensated burden. And again, one of the interesting things in this sort of pandemic environment seems to be that those lower acuity patients who are not coming to hospital emergency rooms tend to be also the lower paying Medicaid and non-insured patients. And I think that's partly why that decline in volume has not been as costly to hospitals as you might have otherwise expected. Josh Raskin : That's perfect. And then just taking a step back, as the pandemic made you think differently about your geographic concentration, specifically in the acute care segment, is there sort of an opportunity to juxtapose that with the balance sheet conversation to help struggling systems in other urban areas? Is this a time where you should be thinking about your financial strength being able to help others? Marc Miller : So I'll take this. This is Marc. Our development activities have continued throughout the year, almost at the same clip as they had pre-COVID. That said, a lot of the deals aren't closing right now. There's a lot of conversations. You read a lot of articles about systems all over the country that are struggling. But most or many of them are not at the point where they're making determinations to change from their current situation to something new. That said, I do think we're laying groundwork for the future near and longer term, where something like that could happen, either within current acute care markets, which we're most familiar with, or other markets, either markets where we have behavioral presence, but not yet acute care or markets that we don't play in right now, but we track for different reasons, mostly because there's opportunities there, possible future opportunities. So I do think that, that rate happen, but we're not seeing that happen right at this time. Josh Raskin : Sounds like it's more on their end than your end. It sounds like you guys, Mark, are well prepared and sort of waiting for those systems to figure out where they are? Marc Miller : Yes. And it gets back to that cash issue on the balance sheet, we are -- we always take a conservative approach. I think we're in a great financial position to move when there's an opportunity. So we want to remain in a good financial position so that when that does happen, we can make decisions quickly. So yes, I would agree with you, though, that a lot of those things are on the other side. And when they -- those health systems do make their determinations, we'll be ready to act. Josh Raskin : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Gary Taylor : Hey good morning. Most of my questions answered. But I just wanted to go back for a moment, Steve, just on the acuity again. And I missed just the first couple of minutes, but did you actually break out on that net revenue per adjusted admission, the acuity versus the payer mix contribution? And you talked about the COVID CMI being higher. Do you have the actual change in your overall your non-COVID CMI in the quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think that the CMI for COVID patients in the quarter was something like 2.4 and for non-COVID patients was 1.6, and I talked about it being about 50% high, but those are actual numbers. As far as the payer mix acuity, I don't think we touched on that other than, I know that some of our peers have talked about their higher revenue in the quarter being driven by sort of a combination of higher acuity and improved payer mix. I think for us, it is more an acuity issue than a payer mix issue. I did say in an earlier response, I forget exactly what context, that our payer mix was sort of stable in the quarter. And I think, as best as I can speculate, the reason that we didn't see some of the improvement that our peers saw is because of our elevated level of COVID patients who, I think, tend to be more Medicare and less commercial. So with a higher percentage of COVID patients, we didn't necessarily see the same improved payer mix that some of our peers saw. Gary Taylor : Got it. And is there anything \u2013 and I'm sorry if I missed this and just move on, if I did. But on the IT sort of system attack that you had, is there anything contemplated where you feel like there's some additional spend in terms of IT infrastructure going forward? Alan Miller : Yeah. I mean, I think, that at this point, we're still going through forensic audit to make sure we understand exactly what happened here. We have a robust security apparatus here. And even with that, we did get hit. We are reviewing everything having to do with our cybersecurity. We've got a very strong internal cyber team, and then we work with various external partners, some of which are nationally known names that others work with as well. So we're reviewing all aspects at this point, and we have not made any determinations as of yet as to how we might want to spend dollars, either differently or enhance our spend. But we will be continuing to review this to make sure that we are as secure as possible going forward. Gary Taylor : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Nicolas Sopant [ph] with PNC. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Thank you for the call. Given the increase in unemployment under insurance and non-insurance, have you made any changes to your provisions on collectibility or allowances? Steve Filton : Yeah. So we have, and I think as most hospitals have over the last several years, enhanced our revenue recognition or conversely, our bad debt or charity care recognition to make it more precise, more accurate so that in real-time, as patients are presenting to our hospitals, we're identifying their ability to pay their insurance or lack of same, et cetera. So those have been in place for quite some time. I think that, therefore, if payer mix deteriorates as a result of higher unemployment, as we move forward into continued levels of higher unemployment, we're in a position to recognize that from an accounting and financial reporting standpoint in real time, and we'll do that. What I was saying earlier is, I don't think, we're seeing that yet. And I think, there's a variety of reasons for that. I think while some employees are being furloughed, but they're keeping their health benefits. Some employees who are being laid off were able to access COBRA. Some employees who were laid off deferred their procedures, if that's possible, if they're not emergent. What we have seen, if you go back and you look at the experience in The Great Recession 10 years ago, for instance, is that unemployment increased pretty dramatically, but the impact on hospitals in terms of elevated levels of uncompensated care increased more incrementally over a two or three-year period. Now, obviously, the unemployment created by the pandemic occurred probably faster and more \u2013 in a more accelerated manner than it did back in The Great Recession. But to some degree, I think you're seeing that same delayed effect. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see more uncompensated care in the future, but it will probably be a more gradual incremental sort of impact. But I believe our reporting systems are well-established to be able to do that properly. Any other questions, operator? Operator : The next question will come from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. First question, just interested in your thoughts on the latest CARES guidance that came from HHS in October, I know that the guidance from HHS has really been a moving target. But just, Steve, interested in terms of, first, which is the guidance you were using in terms of accounting for the third quarter? And then whether directionally that did seem to become a little bit more accommodating as it relates to booking loss revenues relative to the prior September guidance? Steve Filton : Yes. Scott, so you raised a good point. So first of all, I think we took the position along with our outside accountants that the way that we recorded the CARES grant revenues in the third quarter was based on the HHS guidance that was effective as of September 30. And as you pointed out, and I saw you had a note out this morning about one of our peers, HHS has made a couple of changes to that guidance subsequent to September 30. I think there are still things that we'd like to clarify with HHS or have a better understanding with HHS before making any firm decisions. But, I think, we have a point of view that there's a reasonable chance that when we take into account the revised HHS guidance and clarify some of the things that we think are not absolutely clear today, we'll be able to properly record more CARES revenue and incremental CARE revenue in Q4. Scott Fidel : Got it. That's helpful. And then just had a follow-up question and would be interested in just your perspectives on the labor dynamics right now in the acute care hospital side. Just as it relates to \u2013 there have been some headlines more relating to some of the peers around the unions and some contentious situations that have risen relating to demands there. And just interested in your perspective on whether you see this as just the typical noise or if the pandemic just continues to drag on, whether those types of situations could ultimately drive increased wage pressure over time? Alan Miller : Yes. I mean, we're certainly watching what's happening with our colleagues, I think, at our hospitals. We try to pride ourselves on having open lines of communication and making sure that our employees understand what our thought \u2013 what our thinking is for the decisions that we're making. So as far as we're concerned, I think we're in a good position right now. I do think that there are some cost pressures on the labor side, where some systems that are struggling are throwing dollars at this. And so you do see anecdotally in certain specific areas where you have some people jumping for a couple of bucks here and there. But as far as labor strike and some of the other things, we've been fortunate that I think that because of the way we manage and communicate with our employees, thus far, we've been able to avoid some of the things that we see happening at some of our competitor facilities. Scott Fidel : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just kind of a couple of other quick follow-up numbers questions for you. Steve, I think yourself as well as most of your peers during the third quarter, you were at a conference and things like that, were talking about my recollection was kind of mid- single-digit declines in patient admission. It looks like you were closer to the high single-digit. Just curious how inpatient admissions overall kind of trended through the quarter and in October did September take a step down or am I recalling that incorrectly? Steve Filton : Yes. So -- and just have a little trouble hearing you. So if I don't answer your question on point, you clarify. But I think you were asking about our overall absolute admission numbers. We do disclose for the quarter in our selected statistics table, overall admission decline, which I think on the acute side was about 9.5% versus the 17% on the adjusted side. And obviously, the difference is the decline in outpatient volume, which I think, again, based on the earlier questions was driven by that emergency room decline more than anything else. As far as sort of the trajectory of cadence during the quarter, I talked about a little in the context of COVID. COVID definitely peaked in July and then declined for us in August and September. And I think our non-COVID volumes sort of have the opposite trajectory. I think our overall volumes were relatively consistent during the quarter. Justin Lake : Okay. And into October, you're seeing similar? Steve Filton : And again, I'm going to have to take a little bit of a path on that as I sort of indicated in an earlier question. Because of the cyber attack, our information on October is still not perfect. But my gut is that, we saw a bit of an interruption in our volumes in the early part of October, some ambulance diversions and some canceled surgeries. But I think by the end of October, things were largely back to normal, but it's just difficult to be a whole lot more precise than that at the moment. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Whit Mayo with UBS. Whit Mayo : Hey thanks. Just one question on the cybersecurity development, and I appreciate comments on the robust IT infrastructure. I'm more curious what this really means sort of out in the field with your operators. I presume that you've got contingency plans that you've put into place to periodically take hospitals off-line, work on paper and so your clinicians and operators are probably well prepared for this. But just any color on the contingency plans and thoughts about just the field level disruption that perhaps this may have or may not have? Thanks. Steve Filton : Well, you actually said it right there. I mean we go off-line often for different maintenance updates and things like that. So our plans are \u2013 have been put into practice many times. That said, when you're in a regular downtime and you know it's going to be for a period of time, I don't think there's the level of stress that you get when something like this happens, where you don't know how long it's going to last for. But saying that, we've all been incredibly impressed, not just with the leadership from our IT folks, but from all the leaders on both sides, both divisions right down to the folks on the patient care level right at the bedside, how they've handled this. They really worked diligently to keep perspective, make sure that we were able to treat patients in a safe and efficient manner. If we were worried at all that, that was not the case, then we slowed things down, we delayed procedures where necessary. But I do think that our preparations for things like this really paid off for us because most of our hospitals were able to act in a fashion that we would have hoped would have happened, but you never really know until something like this happens. And I think that was another reason why we saw just the ability to get back up and running so quickly because we did things in a very organized and efficient manner. So I do think that all of those policies and procedures played out well. And all of that said, I hope it never happens to us again, but we'll continue to enhance those protocols just in case we have to deal with that again. Whit Mayo : Okay. Thanks. Good luck on the new role Marc. Marc Miller : Thank you. Operator : We show no further audio questions. I'll hand the conference back for closing remarks. Steve Filton : Okay. Thank you. We thank everybody for their time and look forward to our call early next year. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, CFO, Steve Filton. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Steve Filton : Good morning. Thank you, James. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.60 for the fourth quarter of 2020. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected in the supplemental schedule as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.59 for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had received approximately $417 million of funds from various governmental stimulus programs, most notably the CARES Act included in our reported and adjusted income for the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2020, which is approximately $20 million $200 million, excuse me, and $413 million, respectively, of net revenues recorded in connection with these stimulus programs. For the full year of 2020, approximately $316 million of those revenues were attributable to our acute facilities and $97 million were attributable to our behavioral health facilities. In addition, during 2020, we received approximately $695 million of Medicare's accelerated payments, which had no impact on our earnings during the year. We have commenced the repayment process and anticipate the $695 million of funds will be repaid to the government in March or April of 2021. As previously disclosed, on September 27, 2020, we experienced an information technology incident, which resulted in the suspension of user access to our information technology applications in the United States. Our information technology applications were substantially restored, our acute and behavioral hospitals at various times in October 2020 on a rolling and or staggered basis, and our facilities generally resume standard operating procedures at that time. We estimate that this incident had an unfavorable pre-tax impact of approximately $67 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of lost revenues, incremental recovery expenses and delayed coding and billing. We estimate that approximately $12 million of the unfavorable pretax income impact was experienced during the third quarter of 2020 and approximately $55 million was experienced during the fourth quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we also continue to experience a material unfavorable impact on our operations and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic, before giving effect to the revenues recorded in connection with the CARES Act and other governmental grants. Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of COVID patients in December 2020 and which peaked in the first half of January of 2021. The negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of accompanying declines in elective and scheduled procedures, declines in both acute and behavioral patient days, along with increased expense pressures, particularly on salaries and wages. Our cash generated from operating activities was $2.36 billion during the full year of 2020 as compared to $1.438 billion during 2019. Included in our 2020 cash provided by operating activities was the $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments, which we plan to repay to the government very soon. We spent $731 million on capital expenditures during the full year of 2020, as compared to $634 million during 2019. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 55 days during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 50 days during 2019. The increase was due in part to the coding and billing delays caused by the information technology incident. At December 31, 2020, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 37.9%, as compared to 42% at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we opened 439 new beds in our existing acute and behavioral health hospitals and opened Canyon Creek Behavioral Health hospital, a new 102-bed hospital in Temple, Texas. We also opened three new freestanding emergency departments, or FEDs, and expect to open five more in 2022, to bring our total number of FEDs to 22. We continue to grow our behavioral health joint venture portfolio and recently announced the opening of two more de novo facilities, the 102 bed Southeast Behavioral Hospital, a joint venture with Southeast Health located in Southeast Missouri and the 134 bed Clive Behavioral Health hospital, a joint venture with MercyOne located in Clive, Iowa. During 2021, we expect to spend approximately $850 million to $1 billion on capital expenditures, which includes construction of a new 170-bed acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada, which is expected to open in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2020, we had a little over $1.2 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity, pursuant to our $1 billion revolving credit facility and our $450 million accounts receivable securitization program. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In light of our expectation that the COVID volumes are likely to continue a downward trajectory in 2021, as more vaccines become available and the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results ease, our Board of Directors have approved the resumption of our regular quarterly dividend with the first quarterly payment of $0.20 per share to be made on March 31. We also plan to resume our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021 pending Board of Director approval. Similarly, our 2021 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, assumes that the negative impact of the COVID virus will diminish in 2021. The pace of that recovery from the pandemic is still difficult to predict with precision. But we assume the COVID impact will generally ease an increasing cadence throughout 2021. Marc and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Mok with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. When I compare the 2021 guidance to the pre-COVID plan for 2020, revenue is tracking ahead, but EBITDA is tracking behind, resulting in margin compression of about 80 basis points. I would think that margin should be more resilient given the cost structure that didn't rebase lower. So can you walk us through the drivers of that lower margin profile and how you expect margins to evolve as COVID abate? Steve Filton : Yeah. I think, obviously, it can be a more nuanced answer. But I think at the 20,000 foot level, the best explanation is that we presume that demand will recover faster than some of the accelerated pressures we\u2019ve been feeling in our expenses, particularly salaries and wages. I do \u2013 we do believe that as the volume of COVID patients declines, those labor pressures will ease. But I think we have a point of view that they \u2013 they may take longer to ease than demand will to recover and that's I think why you're seeing that margin compression, which I think will likely occur more in the first half of the year than the second. Andrew Mok : Got it. That's helpful. And I have a follow-up. CapEx is expected to meaningfully accelerate to a range of $850 million to $1 billion this year. How should we think about the CapEx spend across the segments? Are there specific service lines or geographies targeted for 2021? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So I tried in my prepared remarks to highlight some of the significant increases. We are building a new hospital in Reno, Nevada, where we have an existing hospital. But obviously, this will expand our presence in that market as well as in the state wide market of Nevada. That's probably $150 million of capital spend in 2021 by itself. I also highlighted the joint venture activity we have building a number of new de novo behavioral hospitals with mostly not-for-profit joint venture partners. That's consuming, I think, some incremental capital. And then FEDs and I think more broadly investment in ambulatory services on the acute side are also consuming some incremental capital. Those, I think, are sort of the big areas where there's increased spending. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Maybe I wanted to follow back up with that earlier question about kind of margins. I guess, as we think about 2020, obviously, volumes were depressed, but pricing was quite strong. As the volume comes back, it would be lower acuity volumes and it seems like maybe Medicare volumes and some of your Medicaid volumes have been more depressed than commercial. So, I might think that the volume comes back also would have maybe a negative payer mix coming with it. So I guess would like to kind of hear about how you think about incremental margins on that volume return given that potential? And whether you think maybe that's not the way it would play out? Steve Filton : So Kevin, I mean, I think broadly, the really unfavorable pressure from the COVID dynamic has been the idea that in both of our business segments, the presence of COVID patients have crowded out other non-COVID patients. And as a consequence, emergency room volumes are down and elective and scheduled procedures are down from pre pandemic levels and patient days in both acute and behavioral are down from pre-pandemic levels. And the business that's missing were absent, if you will, from the hospital is essentially, I think, the higher-margin business and the COVID business is lower-margin business that is temporarily replaced in 2020. I think as the as the COVID volumes ease in 2021, as we expect they will. And I think as they have started to do so, I think you'll see more of a return to kind of a normal medical-surgical mix. On the acute side and more of a return or a rebound in behavioral patient base on the behavioral side and revenue will begin to increase and margins will begin to increase. But as I noted in my previous comment, what we have experienced, particularly later in 2020 is really accelerated pressure on our labor force and that pressure, I think, will ease slowly in 2021. But I think the revenue mix of patients will clearly be better in 2021. And as the labor supply sort of equalizes, I think our margins will also improve as the year continues. Kevin Fischbeck : So I guess, historically, I think of higher acuity equaling higher profitability, but your point is that, that might be the case normally that, that might be the case normally, but surgical versus medical weighs that? Is that... Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, what really drove the higher acuity in the acute segment in 2020 was COVID patients. And to your point, historical thinking about higher acuity doesn't really apply to COVID patients. They're medical patients. They're sick. They're often older. Their length of stay is quite a bit longer and they're just certainly not as profitable as surgical or procedural patients. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. And then just on the behavioral side, obviously, understand the dynamics of COVID putting pressure on that, but obviously, your peers showing much stronger volume growth than you. So how do you think about your market share, I guess, over the last year? Do you feel like you've been able to sustain market share? Or have there been market share losses across your businesses? Steve Filton : Yeah. So market share data is not as widely available in the behavioral space as it is in the acute space. But I think to the degree that it is available. We believe, for the most part, that we have maintained our market share. I think the other important metric that we look at internally, Kevin, is the amount of sort of express demand we measure that in a number of ways. But we measure it in the primary way by sort of incoming inquiries, telephone calls, Internet inquiries, etcetera. And what we have generally noted in 2020 is that the level of intake or inquiries has remained rather strong. And what has really occurred, particularly, I think, later in the year, is more challenges for us to meet that demand either because of COVID patients in our behavioral facilities, that preclude us from admitting non-COVID patients proxy for them on their units on their floors, whatever, or because we've got a significant chunk of our labor force that either has been exposed to the virus or has the virus or is out for some other alcohol virus related reason, and we simply can't operate all of our beds in a particular hospital or a particular geography at a point in time. To your question about comparing to our public peer, difficult for me to do that because I just don't know what their experience has been with COVID patients in their markets, what their protocol is for treating and isolating and keeping their COVID patients and their employees safe. I just don't know. So really, all we can do for the most part is look at what's impacting us internally. And I think we have a strong belief that the biggest impact on our behavioral volumes in 2020 has been COVID and COVID-related dynamics. And when those dynamics ease in 2021, behavioral volumes should resume to pre-pandemic levels. And quite frankly, we believe potentially higher than pre-pandemic levels because we think that the underlying demand for behavioral care has been increasing. Kevin Fischbeck : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citibank. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. Steve, maybe a little bit more on that last part of that question. Can you help on maybe guidance or how you're thinking about it between the segments, maybe just volume and pricing assumptions embedded in for, sort of, both? And maybe any differences on the margin side in terms of either greater improvement or degradation, one versus the other? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, honestly, Ralph, I think what we commenced the process of developing our 2021 budget or forecast. We did so with the basic underlying presumption that 2020 was a lost year that we were mostly focused on dealing with the pandemic, keeping our patients safe, getting them well, keeping our employee base safe and well. Those were all extraordinary challenges. And in many ways, I think 2020 was otherwise a lost year in terms of business development, really taking advantage of capacity expansion, service line expansion, that sort of thing. And so when we began to think about a 2021 forecast, we really kind of started with our original 2020 value and what our forecast has been for 2020 and I think that's really largely true for both business segments. So I think we have a point of view that both business segments will grow off of, if you will, a 2019 pre-pandemic base at kind of mid-single-digit levels, et cetera. Although it will be in a trajectory that I think is different from what's the normal or historical trajectory, so that historically, Q1 is our biggest earnings quarter. And we earn more in the first half of the year than we do in the second half of the year, I think we have a point of view that 2021 will look differently because of this dynamic of COVID volumes declining as the year goes on. And revenue increasing and labor pressures easing and margins increasing as the year goes on. So I think the two business segments sort of grow in that historical mid-single-digit range, although in sort of a different cadence and a different trajectory than we would normally expect. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. Fair enough. And any early read on the first couple of months of the year? I know, obviously, limited data, but is it tracking similar to 4Q? And then maybe anything specific to some of the storms and impact of weather more recently, particularly for you in Texas? Steve Filton : Yeah. So on the first point, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw a significant surge in COVID volumes in December on a percentage basis we had more COVID patients in December of 2020 than any other month of the year. And that surge continued in almost all of our hospitals into the first half of January. I think COVID volumes tended to peak for virtually all of our hospitals in the first half of January. And have been declining and declining rather rapidly, and I think we view that as an encouraging sign since then. But again, one of the things that we've noted several times during the year and during the ebbs and flows of the pandemic is as COVID volumes surge and that pressures crowds out other business when the volumes drop, that other business returns, but it's not an immediate and instantaneous sort of thing. So I think it takes \u2013 depending on the hospital and the service line, et cetera, weeks maybe month or two for that to happen. That's the expectation. And again, I think we're encouraged by the fact that the COVID volumes seem to have peaked. In the first half of January, and the hope is that, obviously, as the vaccine becomes more widely available and distributed, those trends will continue. To your question on the storms, and I would make the point that I think the storms affected a broad swath of the country, not just Texas, but in our case, Texas and Oklahoma and Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee. I think the good news is that because these storms were sort of widespread, unlike things like the cyber incident where we face the risk and face the actual dynamic of during a relatively short period of time, business went elsewhere because we were struggling with our systems. During the weather event, everybody in our geographies was struggling in much the same way. And so I don't think we lost business to anybody else. I think because it occurred in the middle of a quarter, the likelihood that the business sort of recovers a week or two or three weeks later is more likely and my guess. And it's clearly a guess at this point is that when we get to the end of the first quarter, the weather event. Other than some incremental expenses and things which \u2013 and many of which will be covered by insurance, shouldn't have a big impact. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe first, just thinking about some of the negotiations with managed care coming out the other end of the pandemic. I think on the behavioral side, you said that some of the pressures you were feeling for managed Medicaid and length of stay and all - and other issues on the behavioral side that may be eased up. Have you seen any of that reverse itself? Or what are your discussions like with managed care, really on both sides of the business in terms of any changes you're seeing? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, I think the dynamic that you are alluding to as it relates to the behavioral business, A.J., is that really since the pandemic began, our revenue per adjusted day has been up in the kind of 5%, 6% range as compared to sort of maybe 2%, 3% increases pre-pandemic. And we've attributed that, at least to some degree, to a change in behavior on the part of some of our insurers and managed care companies. Clearly, and this trend certainly continued into the fourth quarter, we see the level of charity care and the level of denials down about 10% from prior year comparisons. And there may be a number of reasons for that, but I think to some degree, it certainly is attributable to less aggressive utilization management behavior on the part of some of our insurers, at least. We also have negotiated during the year some measurable contractual price increases, particularly in our managed Medicaid portfolio. These are not big increases, but I think they come on top of a number of years of relatively suppressed price increases in that space. So that's been helpful as well. And I think, by the way, much needed, again, we've gone, at least with some payers, for a number of years without increases, that can be a difficult population to treat with some incremental expenses, et cetera. So, I think they are -- those increases are justified, but that's been helpful as well. I would say on the acute side, not as much changed during the pandemic in terms of our managed care or insurance behavior one way or the other. Not in terms of renegotiating prices or in terms of utilization management behavior, et cetera, I would say it's mostly business as usual. A.J. Rice: Okay. And maybe a follow-up question around the 2021 guidance. There's obviously some debate about things like the public health emergency and how long that will stay in place. I know that the 20% - the COVID DRG add-on for Medicare relates to that timeframe. There some map funding as well. And then there's also some debate about the Medicare sequestration timeframe, which I guess now would expire at the end of March. Have you -- have you factored that into your guidance? Or what are you assuming on those two issues or any other variables like that? Steve Filton : So, as to the Medicare sequestration, as you noted, we've assumed that it's waived through the first quarter, but then our guidance presumes that it is restored for the balance of the year. As far as the public health emergency timing, but more so the sort of the 20% DRG add on. I'll make the point that we've benefited from the DRG add-on, but only to the degree that it's covering increased cost. So, I think we've not made an explicit assumption about it in our 2021 budget. But what we really assume is that as COVID volumes decline, COVID expenses will decline. And we assume that as that occurs; the government at some point will lift the 20% add-on. So, we haven't really, again, made an explicit assumption about that. It's really more built into our broader assumption that as the year progresses, acuity and revenue per adjusted admission will come down, but so will expenses. A.J. Rice: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A question for you on guidance again. You mentioned that margin pressure should ease in the back half of the year. Looking at past years, as you referenced, about 52% or 54% of EBITDA comes in the first half of the year. Can you just help us quantify what that should be for 2021? Steve Filton : So, I guess, the short answer is no, Pito. I mean, I think we have historically not given quarterly guidance. And if I start throwing out percentages, it's effectively given quarterly guidance. And I think given our historical reluctance to do it, 2021 will certainly not be the year that we would choose to say that we had a much better -- much better visibility and are prepared to do it. So I think I tried in an earlier question to, certainly, talk about the fact that we would expect the cadence and the trajectory of 2021 to look differently and not to have that front half weighting that you alluded to. But we're not prepared to give specific percentages because, as I said in my opening remarks, what this is really all premised on, for the most part, is the pace at which the COVID virus eases and how that affects our labor force, etcetera, and those things are just very difficult to predict. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. I have to give it a try anyway. And then to follow-up on the behavioral admissions. It's still a 10% delta versus -- in fourth quarter versus your largest public peer. Can you quantify, as you define it, the express demand from your referral sources like ER and other sources? And can you remind us what percent of those admissions come from those referral sources? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, again, I'm referencing what we would describe as sort of call volume, which is kind of inbound inquiry volume, which is, again, telephone calls and Internet inquiries, et cetera. And those really haven't declined during the pandemic. Our conversion rate, or the rate at which those inquiries or inbound calls turn into admissions, has fallen. And I think we attribute that in large part to our inability to literally put the patient in a bed, either because the bed itself is unavailable, because it's proximate to a COVID patient or to multiple COVID patients or, because we don't have enough qualified clinical staff to staff those beds. So we've not historically given out our call volume, et cetera. I don't know that any of our peers do anything like that. But I will say, repeat again, the notion that the call volume itself has not declined. And that's what leads us to believe that the underlying demand hasn't really changed. Our biggest challenge in 2020 has been meeting that demand and I think we'll just be in a much better position to do that in 2021, as we become less and less focused on the COVID virus itself. Pito Chickering : All right. And then one more quick follow-up here, on the average length of stay. A follow-up on AJ's question. When you talk to managed care about mental health and the denials they're doing today. Do you think that the focus of mental health post the COVID means that these level of denials will stay at these current levels for 2021 and beyond? Or you get sort of -- you revert back to normal as the world returns to more of normal utilization rates? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, that's a difficult question, obviously, for us to answer, Pito, because I think it's really the behavior of the managed care companies that have changed. It's difficult for us to ascribe rationale to that. I mean, obviously, I think, broadly, the managed care companies have done quite well and prosper financially during the pandemic. Because of the lower utilization and lower volumes that we've been discussing as providers, I guess my gut reaction is that as utilization and volumes return to something approaching pre-pandemic levels, while we would hope that their behavior remains more reasonable and rational. It certainly would be make intuitive sense that they return to a more aggressive posture. But I really think that question is better posed than that. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First, just, Steve, I apologize if I missed this, but I'd love to hear some more detail on the cost side, specifically around labor. Anything you could share with us in terms of specifics between the acute care business versus behavioral, specific markets? Is the temp nursing that you're having the good money on? And why do you think it's transitory? Steve Filton : Sure. Well, again \u2013 and I think this has been true for some time. I think we had talked for the last several years about the fact that labor shortages have impacted the two divisions somewhat differently. On the acute side, the impact has been what I would describe as more traditional, that is elevated labor costs, we're spending more money on overtime for our own employees. We're spending more money on temporary and traveling nurses and those things and paying shift differentials and sign-on bonuses and all that sort of thing. And I think it's really been exacerbated during the last year because the COVID has created all sorts of different and new dynamics and pressures. First of all, it has created a number of instances where employees, nurses and other clinicians are out sick. They have the virus, and they've been exposed to the virus, although that's often -- they're often being exposed and contracting the virus outside of the hospital. But they're either way, they're on the sidelines for a period of time or they don't have the virus, but they've been exposed and they're quarantining or there's certainly been some element of burnout that we've all read about. It's been a very trying and difficult environment for clinicians to work in, and some have just, I think, decided to either step aside or try and work in less risky, less stressful environments. And then at the other end of the spectrum, we know that there are significant numbers of employees who have been chasing premium work dollars. Nurses who want to and are willing to relocate and willing to work six ships a week or whatever can make four or five times their regular salary and some nurses have certainly taken advantage of that opportunity. So all those expenses are reflected, I think, in our increased salary and wage expense on the acute side. On the behavioral side, as I've mentioned, I think, a number of times already on the call, the impact manifests itself somewhat differently. We do have a somewhat elevated level of labor expense. But the real impact is just the sheer inability to find sufficient numbers of clinicians, especially nurses, and therefore, an inability to accept as many qualified patients as we could either wise. And so it's reflected in kind of lower volumes rather than in elevated expense. And the notion is that, obviously, as the COVID virus eases in 2021, the dynamics that I talked about all start to reverse themselves. We don't have nearly as many nurses out. Many of our nurses and other employees are being vaccinated in realtime, so that should be helpful. The level of burn out should ease, the ability of nurses to chase premium dollars elsewhere we'll diminish. All those things should get better as COVID volumes decline. And that's why we believe that the current labor pressure is somewhat transitory. Although again, as I noted, particularly about our first half 2021 guidance, it will take some time for that to develop and occur. Justin Lake : Thanks for all the detail. And just a quick follow-up on capital deployment. You talked about getting back to share repurchase in the second quarter. You reinstituted the dividend, but it doesn't look like you put any real - it didn't look like your share count was down much for the fourth quarter and the guide. Maybe you could talk about the timing and magnitude of that share repurchase. And just give us a kind of reset on kind of where you ended the year in terms of deployable capital? Steve Filton : Yeah. So we - again, as I sort of referenced before in a different context, we went into 2020 with a guide towards an elevated level of share repurchase. Prior to 2020, we have been repurchasing about $400 million a year in shares. A couple of years before that, we went into 2020 with a guide towards doubling that and said we would repurchase $800 million worth of shares in 2020. And in fact, we repurchased $200 million in the first quarter before we suspended the share repurchases as the pandemic broke down in mid March. I think much like our operating forecast, we're sort of going back to those assumptions in 2021. And assuming that share repurchase, again, will be at that sort of elevated $700 million to $800 million level. Justin Lake : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just first one, just a clarification or, I guess, confirmation on your guidance. 2021 excludes any potential impact from CARES Act, but is there a rough range in terms of potential payments that you guys think you could collect in 2021? Steve Filton : So we did disclose in our 10-K that we've received subsequent to December 31 another close to $200 million of CARES Act funds, but we have made no estimation of whether any of that or any portion of that could or would be taken into income and we're not prepared to do that. But we did disclose that we've received another slightly less than $200 million. Josh Raskin : Okay. So that's a starting point for the potential... Steve Filton : To your point, Josh, just to be clear, there is no -- there are no CARES funds in our operating income forecast for 2021. Josh Raskin : Right, right. Okay. And then the second question, just, I'm curious on your views on sort of physician and provider connectivity. I'm thinking more specifically on the behavioral health side. Do you think this movement towards sort of virtual visits downstream in the behavioral health segment, is that having any impact on inpatient trends? Or are you seeing anything there? Do you feel a need to sort of think more strategically around some of those changes? Steve Filton : Well, I think what the expansion of telehealth capabilities and behavioral reflects, as I think the expansion of telehealth capabilities more broadly reflects is that during the pandemic, people were reluctant to access the system to seek assessment, to seek alternatives of care kind of through the traditional means. ER boxing visits went down, visits to private psychiatrists were down, referrals from school systems were down in large part because in-person schooling was down significantly. And telehealth helps, I think, to augment some of those other activities. I think at the end of the day, the fundamental services that we provide, however, are not competitive with telehealth. If somebody calls at telehealth line and speaks with a clinician and expresses suicidal ideation or homicidal thoughts or just sort of a lack of functionality in daily life. They're going to \u2013 if it's the person on the other end, the clinician is in any way a responsible clinician, they're going to refer a person to more intensive care, whether that's inpatient care or partial hospitalization or outpatient care, but something more intensive than a telephone visit. And so we've spent a lot of the past years standing up our capabilities and building out our capabilities in telehealth so that we our self can offer those services, but also partnering with others who do, and I don't think we have any objection to the fact that others are doing it, but really trying to make sure that patients who are identified as needing further intensive care get it in the appropriate place. And obviously, we feel like our facilities, both in and outpatient are terribly appropriate. And most telehealth providers just are not in a position to really provide a significant amount of care beyond that initial assessment or kind of a traditional a 50-minute therapy session that you get in a private psychiatrist or therapists office. And those things are obviously going to continue. And they've existed before the pandemic, and they'll exist appropriately afterwards. Josh Raskin : Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. I wasn't insinuating that telehealth could supplant inpatient care or anything like that. It was really again more on that provider connectivity. Is there a chance you're missing out on the sort of new path for patients is to kind of move from downstream to potentially upstream, but it sounds like you've got some plans in there? Steve Filton : Yeah. Look, I think it's a fair statement. I mean, we said it in the beginning. Look, I think it has definitely had an impact that acute care emergency down across the country by somewhere between 20% and 30% routinely during the pandemic, and we do get a measurable number of referrals from acute care hospital emergency room. So I think that's an issue. Now again, I think telehealth to a degree, has replaced some of that activity. And we've done a lot to reach out to our communities to make sure that, if people are reluctant to go to an emergency room or community mental health center that they will reach out in some other way that they feel more comfortable, again, with a telephone call, et cetera. But again, I don't think \u2013 which I think was in the question, or I don't think we believe that the increased presence of telehealth has really put a damper on that overall demand. Again, I'll go back to what I was saying before, we think the demand is there. Our biggest challenge, and we think it will ease some in 2021 and is meeting that demand, having sufficient beds and sufficient beds and sufficient personnel to meet that demand. Josh Raskin : Perfect. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Your line is open. Jamie Perse : Hey. Good morning, guys. I love your thoughts just real quick on how you're thinking about deferred care these days, just how much is out there, how much of that might come back over the next few years? And just what's in guidance for impact from deferred care on volumes this year? Steve Filton : Yes, Jamie, it's a great question. We have said throughout the pandemic that we do believe sort of both anecdotally, we hear this from lots of positions. But also objectively, as we look at our service line volumes that there are people who have deferred care during the pandemic, and there's also evidence. And we've talked about this before, that there are people who when they come to the hospital are sicker and more acutely ill than they would have been had they come on a more timely basis. We're also hearing anecdotally from a lot of physicians at the current time they've got patients in their practice who are sort of queued up for elective sorts of procedures who are just waiting to get vaccinated. And as soon as they get vaccinated, they're willing to have that hip implant or an implant or other surgery that they may have delayed now to be perfectly fair, Jamie, we're unable to quantify that in any sort of specific way. It's not that I can tell you that we have x amount of this specific kind of surgery queued up for 2021. But what our 2021 guidance broadly assumes is that, again, as COVID volumes decline in 2021, non-COVID volumes increase. And elective and scheduled procedures get to pre pandemic levels by the back half of the year. And maybe there's even some catch-up and behavioral and acute patient base get to pre pandemic levels as the year goes on. And so that I think implicit in that assumption is that some of this deferred demand from 2020 resurfaces and is satisfied. Jamie Perse : Okay. Thanks. And then just touching on Vegas for a minute. I know you don't guide to markets or anything like that, but curious how you're thinking about that market and the cadence of potential recovery relative to other markets, is it faster? Is it slower? Just any thoughts on how that market might impact your business over the next year would be great. Thank you. Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, look, obviously, the Las Vegas market has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic because the gaming industry has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic and I think particularly is hit by the decline in airline travel, both domestically and internationally. We've been encouraged when the \u2013 the gaming properties reopened, I think, in the June time frame, mostly to local business, meaning people in Nevada and Arizona and California who would drive to the properties. I think they reopened at 50% capacity. And there were many days when they were reaching those limits. And I think more recently, a number of the gaming properties I've read have expanded their capacity and are opening more days and then opening more services, restaurants, shows, whatever. So I think there is, again, I think all the comments that I made about our business and the gradual improvement in 2021, likely apply to the broader gaming and travel and leisure industry in Las Vegas. I'll make the same comments, however, that I made before that that precise pace of recovery is difficult for us to predict. I think broadly, we would say that we're still incredibly bullish on the Las Vegas market. We continue to invest new capacity in that market. We opened a tower at our [indiscernible] tower at our Centennial Hills Hospital this past year. We continue to expand our capacity in Henderson infection of the Las Vegas market, which has been a significant boom for us. So we're very bullish on the long-term prospects in Las Vegas. Whether the next three months are difficult or six or nine months, that's more, I think, difficult to say. But every confidence that that market will fully recover and that our investment in that market will fully recover. Jamie Perse : All right. That's great. Appreciate the comments. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with UBS. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. Whit Mayo : Hey. Thanks. Steve, I know we've talked about this in the past. But looking at the non-same-store segment, if you will, for behavioral, you've got roughly 20 facilities sitting there burning $20 million a year now. And what's - just remind us what's in that bucket? What's happening? It's kind of a moving target. Can we get these back to breakeven? Do you need to shut facilities down, sell them? Just feels like there's this persistent cluster of assets that are just kind of dragging you down, so just wanted to get a little bit better perspective. Steve Filton : Well, I think the dynamic with is as we -- most of these new facilities are these joint ventures, when they open, as with most new openings, there is a period of ramp up and usually sort of diluted earnings it does vary by market. But as this sort of becomes a rolling program, I think the good news is that the comparison will not be as negative because we'll have just a number of facilities that are opening at any time. But I think more importantly, we're starting to see the first of those facilities mature and really get up to division wide or segment wide margins and in some cases, even better than that. And I think over the next few years, those projects will be a bit less of a drag and a bit more of a driver of growth. But you're right, in the early stages of the openings of these that they've been a drag. And again, there is just some element of ramp up that we do everything we can to get started get these projects started as quickly as possible, but there is some ramp-up that's just unavoidable. Whit Mayo : Yeah. But I mean, there is 22, I think, hospitals you have that aren't in the same-store category, and I don't think there are 22 new hospitals that you've opened. So is there not a group of hospitals that have been in the non-same-store category for some time that have either been underperforming? Or it just feels to me like there are some underperforming hospitals here that you could probably do something with. Steve Filton : No, I think that's true with. And I think part of the reason they're in the non-same-store is they've been closed. And so there has been an ongoing effort over the last several years to evaluate the portfolio and prune those underperforming hospitals. As we go through the process of closing them, they get put in same-store. So you're right. There are some hospitals that are either in the process of being closed or are close, but still incurring some expenses. There are some run out that are in those members as well. Whit Mayo : So if we've got minus $20 million of EBITDA in 2020, does that number -- does it break even this year? Does it \u2013 is it down 10%? I'm just trying to think over the next maybe year or two, what's the right way to think about those losses turning into earnings. Steve Filton : Yeah. I think that overall number will come down, and I apologize, what -- I mean, I don't have that detail in front of me, so my answer by definition is going to be a little bit broader. But I think they'll come down. I think some of those -- both of those newer openings, as well as the closures where their drag was exacerbated by the pandemic. So I believe that those numbers will come down in 2021. So again, I'm going to say from a $20 million run rate to let's say $10 million. But I'll take a more detailed look after the call and try to provide more color. Whit Mayo : We can talk later on. But my last one is just still sticking just with behavioral. And I mean, we've been \u2013 you guys have been whacking at this for some time now. You've got some new leadership. I mean, are there any new investments that need to be made? I mean, there's not a lot of technology. There's no EMR around behavioral. As you approach just the overall strategy, has anything evolved that you would care to share or anything that we should look to hear about over the next year? I don't know if Marc has any views on this? Marc Miller : Yeah, I can tell you, I mean, there's a lot \u2013 I'm not sure how much I want to share on this call right now, but we're changing up a lot of the way that we look at, especially our behavioral segment, and we're doing a lot more on the project management side, trying to ramp up some of our current and existing programs and then really get into some new areas that we think will provide greater revenue opportunities going forward. So I'm not going to go into detail on this call, but there's a lot happening, especially on the behavioral side that we're excited about right now. Whit Mayo : Okay, great. Look forward to hearing more. Thanks, guys. Steve Filton : I will just say, Whit, I mean, I think we touched on this before. I mean, I think some of that investment is on the ambulatory side, I think much like on the acute side. There's a notion that payers, in particular, are looking to see if services can't be delivered in more efficient, lower cost settings. And so I think we're focused on providing, or providing at least the alternative or the optionality for more ambulatory care on the payroll side. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Filton. Steve Filton : Okay. Well, we thank everybody for their presence and look forward to speaking again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker's presentation there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Felton, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services Results for the First Quarter ended March 31, 2021. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.43 for the first quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2021, we received approximately $188 million of additional CARES Act grant funds. While we continue to experience residual effects from the COVID-19 virus, the net impact on lost revenues and incremental expenses in 2021 has not been nearly as severe as it was in 2020. And consequently, we have begun the process of returning these $188 million in CARES Act funds to the federal government and expect that process to be completed shortly. As previously disclosed, we also returned $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments to the federal government in the first quarter of 2021. As I noted, during the first quarter of 2021, we continued to experience certain unfavorable impacts on our operations and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of COVID patients in December 2020, which peaked in the first half of January 2021. The negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of accompanying declines in elective and scheduled procedures in both acute and behavioral patient days, along with increased expense pressures, particularly on salaries and wages and shortages of clinical personnel. Our cash generated from operating activities was $72 million during the first quarter of 2021, as compared to $502 million during the same period in 2020. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the aforementioned repayment of $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments. We spent $247 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2021. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to 55 days in the fourth quarter of 2020, as we recovered from the billing and collection delays, we experienced in the fourth quarter as a result of our previously disclosed information technology incident. At December 31, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 35.7%, as compared to 41.3% at March 31, 2020. In light of our expectation that COVID volumes are likely to continue a downward trajectory in 2021 as more vaccines become available and the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results ease, our Board of Directors approved the resumption of our regular quarterly dividend with the first quarterly payment of $0.20 per share made on March 31. The Board also approved the resumption of our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021. We are pleased with our first quarter 2021 operating results, which were just slightly ahead of our internal forecast. The pace of the recovery from the pandemic is still difficult to predict with precision, but we assume the COVID impact will generally ease at an increase in cadence throughout 2021 and we remain comfortable that we will achieve our full year 2021 earnings guidance. We are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Perry Wong : Yes, thanks. This is Perry Wong going in for Justin. My question is around pricing. It looks like your pricing was up about 26%, which is notably higher than your peers. I was wondering if you could give any color on what's driving that increase? Was it mostly due to a higher acuity from COVID cases? Or is there any benefit from better commercial mix there? Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure. Well, obviously, we've seen during the entire pandemic, our pricing was above - well above historical levels. And the main driver of that has been the higher acuity of our COVID patient, to a lesser degree, our non-COVID patients as well. So I think some deferred care, et cetera, is driving higher pricing. I think our pricing and particularly, our acute care pricing in quarter one was particularly high for a number of reasons. In the fourth quarter, we talked about the fact that as a result of our IT event, our billing and collection activities were delayed. We saw an increased aging in our receivables, and that resulted in higher bad debt expense and lower net revenue based on our regular accounting conventions. We anticipated that we would recover some of that as we caught up on our billing and collection. And I think that did, in fact, occur in Q1, and I think we probably benefited to the tune of maybe $10 million or $15 million in that regard. I think that we also benefited from the presence of personal reimbursement. This is the government - the federal government's reimbursement of non-insured or uninsured patients with the COVID diagnosis, I think - which really there was very little of that in Q1 of last year, and that's another probably $15 million or $20 million. And then there's a small amount of state and local supplemental payments that we received in Q1, mostly related to the treatment of COVID patients, maybe $5 million to $10 million. So I think those items are the sort of non-recurring, or I should say non-recurring, but items that we had in Q1 that we didn't have in Q1 of last year. Perry Wong : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I guess, maybe start off by asking how Q1 shaped up versus your internal expectations? I guess, it was a bit above the street, but it sounds like you're only reaffirming guidance even though you continue to expect things to progress well through the year. So just, I guess, how did Q1 shape up? And then are there any mitigating factors or things you're watching as the year goes on? Steve Filton : Sure. So Kevin, I did actually say in my prepared remarks that the Q1 results were just slightly ahead of our internal forecast, which is partly why we've chosen not to make any changes to guidance, we feel like we're largely on track. The things that we're watching are the obvious things. We assume that as the year progresses, and this is what our guidance assumed as well that COVID volumes will continue to decline. Non-COVID volumes in both business segments will continue to recover. And also, I think, quite importantly, labor pressures will ease, and those pressures will be manifested in lower wage rate increases, as well as the ability to treat more patients, particularly on the payroll side. Kevin Fischbeck : And then, I guess, just a follow-up there. As we think about that volume returning back to normal, I guess it's one of the things that we're hearing conflicting information from it seems like the hospital companies generally expect labor pressure to ease. But I guess some of the staffing companies continue to expect labor shortfalls, et cetera, as volumes return, putting upward pressure on demand there, and we see nurses potentially, look to leave the workforce. I guess, how are you thinking about margins on that volume as it returns back to normal, you normally think about lower acuity volume be coming in lower margins and then that wouldn't take on the labor side? Steve Filton : Yeah, look, I think, Kevin, that the notion is that the things that have driven the pressure on both our wage rates and just on the overall availability of mostly clinical, but in some cases, non-clinical personnel are things like the actual virus itself. During the last 12, 13 months, at any point in time, we've had employees who are sidelined either with the virus itself or because they are being quarantined, because of exposure to the virus. We've got employees who have suffered burn out, and there's been a lot written about that. We've got employees who are, quite frankly, chasing premium dollars elsewhere, where hospitals are paying really for the extraordinary amounts because of the pressures of the pandemic, et cetera. I think our point of view is that, again, as more of our employees get vaccinated, we'll have fewer and fewer of them out, as more and more of the general population gets vaccinated, we'll have fewer and fewer COVID patients. There will be less burn out, there'll be a willingness of nurses and specialty nurses to return to the workplace. They won't have the opportunities to chase those premium dollars elsewhere, et cetera. To your, sort of, the crux of your point whether we return to the same sort of supply and demand balance of labor that we had pre-pandemic, hard to say. But certainly, I think we have a view that the labor pressures that we've experienced over the last 13 or 14 months should certainly ease measurably as we continue to recover from the virus. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Steve, any weather impact to call out in the quarter? And maybe if you could just give a sense of how you exited March, and if you're willing to just discuss early trends you've seen so far in April? Steve Filton : Yeah. So I talked about the COVID trends in my prepared remarks, Ralph, saying that in almost all of our hospitals, volume of COVID patients peaked in the first half of January and continued to level-off as the quarter went on. And then I would say kind of, late February, early March, we started to see measurable recovery, particularly in the acute business in elective and schedule procedural volumes. I think the good news about the weather is while it certainly had an impact in a broad geographic swath of our markets that included Texas and Oklahoma and Arkansas and Tennessee. Because it occurred largely, I think, in the middle of the quarter, and because I think it was so widespread, it's not like we were really losing market share to competitors during that time, I think people were just staying home or stuck at home. And I think because they had four or six weeks to recoup whatever procedures they had missed. I think by the end of the quarter, the impact was not really significant. So at the end of the day for, I think, both the reason of the COVID - decline in COVID volumes and the recovery from the weather events, clearly, March was you know, we exited the quarter in March a lot more profitably than we began the quarter in January. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. Steve Filton : I am sorry, and I would say those trends have continued into April as well. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the guidance, obviously, you're reaffirming, you've talked about the cadence of earnings improving sort of as you move through the year, generally sort of sounds like in line with your initial expectation. But what about sequestration, can you size the benefit of that? And why doesn't that flow through the number or are there offsets any help there? Steve Filton : Sure. It's a good question, and I think it was asked on the fourth quarter call as well. And I think what we said at the time was, we really didn't make a specific assumption about sequestration in our budget forecast, because this year was so difficult to forecast in terms of volumes and acuity and how they would both kind of trend as the year went on, et cetera. We were much more focused on those issues than we were on these specific reimbursement issues. So we have said that having the sequestration waiver extended is a benefit to us of $10 million or $11 million a quarter. But I wouldn't describe it as a pickup of $10 million or $11 million, per se, in our guidance. I would describe it more sort of accurately as a bit of a cushion in our guidance, because we didn't really make a specific assumption about it. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay, all right. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Marco [ph] on for Josh. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had a quick one. It seems like UHS is seeing a larger spread between admissions and adjusted admissions than some of its peers. So is there any reason why you aren't seeing those outpatient volumes coming back quicker? And did the weather events of the first quarter impact outpatient volumes differently than on the inpatient side? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So I think - and we've talked about this in previous calls. I think the dynamic - the single dynamic that probably most separates our experience from our public and acute care hospital peers is the percentage proportionately of COVID patients that we've treated. We've talked in the last few quarters about the fact that something like the low to mid teens percentage of our admissions on the acute side have been COVID diagnosed patients. And I think our peers are either in the high single digits or maybe 8%, 9%, 10%. So that's a pretty significant difference. That affects a lot of things, that I think it affects our cost structure, it affects our length of stay. And to your point, I think it also affects outpatient procedures and schedule, particularly scheduled and elective procedures, and it affects emergency room volume as well, which obviously a lot of that is outpatient ultimately. So I think that's probably the single biggest reason why our outpatient hasn't recovered as much. And then your question about the weather is correct. I mean, I think weather events tend to affect outpatient more than inpatient because, obviously, if you have an urgent procedure, if you're having a heart attack or a stroke, you're still going to find your way to the emergency room. As opposed to, if you're having hip surgery or knee surgery, whatever it may be. But again, I'm going to make the point that I think in the end, we recovered most of those deferred outpatient procedures by the end of the quarter. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jamie Perse : Hey. Good morning. Just first question on the quarter, I wanted to talk about COVID patients for a second. I know the question was asked a few times last year and basically, the response was that, COVID patients aren't very profitable. I'm wondering if that's changed at all, because you've had all these learnings over the last year. It's maybe a healthier patient population, lower length of stay, things like that. So can you comment on the impact of your COVID census in the quarter on revenue per adjusted admission and also the EBITDA impact? Steve Filton : Yeah. So the point that we've made historically, and I would repeat because I think it's still valid is that medical patients in general are less profitable than surgical or procedural patients, COVID patients or medical patients. And therefore, I think that's equally true of them. The other issue is that COVID patients tend to be sicker. They're more acutely ill. They clearly have a longer length of stay than our regular medical patients, and that means that the costs associated with them are higher. To your point about, I think, kind of developing treatments and protocols, I do think that clinically, we and I think all hospitals have gotten more adept and more efficient at treating COVID patients over the last 12, 13, 14 months, as you might expect. I think we learned a lot about what the right things and the wrong things are to do. But unfortunately, a lot of those more efficient and better clinical treatments are also very expensive. So things like remdesivir, one of the main drugs that are being used to treat COVID patients are very expensive. And so, again, this dynamic of the profitability of COVID patients versus non-COVID patients, I think, still exists, that is COVID are simply less profitable than the surgical and procedural patients that they have generally crowded out during the pandemic. Jamie Perse : Okay. That's helpful. And then just one on surgical volumes, I know you don't report those. But maybe you could comment on what you saw across the month of the quarter, both on the inpatient and outpatient surgical side. And any categories or sites of care that are recovering after or slower than others? Steve Filton : Yeah. And again, I mean, I think what we have found and we have found this again throughout the entire pandemic period, is that as COVID volumes rise and they peak that our volumes of elective and scheduled procedures and non-COVID business tends to decline, and I think we certainly experienced that in Q1. So in the January time frame when COVID volumes were peaking, I would say that surgical and elective procedures were probably at 75% or 80% of pre-pandemic levels. I think by the end of the quarter, as COVID volumes have declined pretty measurably, we were at 95% plus of pre-pandemic elective and surgical volumes. And I think those trends have continued into April as well. Steve Filton : All right. Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Frank Morgan with UHS [ph]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Frank Morgan here. Yeah, I have a cost question. You talked about some of the severe labor pressure where people are chasing, working are chasing those rates. Is that more of an issue on the acute side or the behavioral side? And are there any particular markets where you see that as being worse? And I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is it fair to say that the limiting factor in behavioral health care is, in fact, still labor. The demand is higher than what you can serve given the labor pressure. And if that is true, do you - how do you balance just sacrificing margin to get that incremental revenue in that higher levels of top line? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So I think, Frank, you accurately frame the question. We've talked about pressures on labor really from the beginning of the pandemic. And I think most of our hospital company peers have done as well. I'm not sure we're all experiencing it in the same markets and to the same degree, but I think it certainly is a macro issue. Interestingly, we have said throughout that the labor shortage has manifested itself differently in our two business segments. I think on the acute side, we certainly have seen an increase in wage rates themselves. We see an elevated usage of over time and shift differential and usage of temporary traveling nurses, all of which are measurably more expensive than our base wage rate for nurses and other clinical personnel. On the behavioral side, if you measure it by salaries and wages per adjusted patient day, which I think is the right way of measuring, you'll see that the cost of labor isn't going up all that much. The real challenge is we just simply can't pay enough to get sufficient personnel in at least some of our hospitals in some of our markets. And so I would say that on the behavioral side, and I think you alluded to this in your question, shortage of appropriate clinical and in some cases, non-clinical personnel are probably the single biggest obstacle and headwind to getting back to pre-pandemic volumes and quite frankly, even above pre-pandemic volumes. And I can assure you that it's probably the - I'm not saying probably, actually, I would say, most certainly, the single biggest focus of our operators as we turn our attention to what we need to do to both recruit and retain the proper amount of nurses, and that obviously includes proper pay rates that we're constantly doing, compensation surveys to make sure that we're remaining competitive. We're looking at our processes for recruiting and hiring and our processes for mentoring new nurses and new graduates, all those sort of things are a focus of ours. And we've made some progress. And I think as my earlier comments indicated, there's an expectation and then a hope that as the pandemic eases and the pressures of the pandemic ease, the labor pressures will ease as well and then some of the initiatives that we've been implementing will gain more traction. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Pito Chickering : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A question for Steve and Marc, if you want to jump in, if we step back a minute and look at the behavioral market, do you think that you guys are growing in line faster or slower than overall demand? And if slower, can you give us color on why you're growing slower and what should change during 2021? Steve Filton : Marc, do you want to comment first? Marc Miller : No, you can go ahead, Steve. Steve Filton : Okay. So, Pito, I think my response to Frank, to some degree, he covers this, and I've said this before during the pandemic, every one of our internal data points and metrics indicates that volume continues to - or demand, I should say, continues to increase at least at pre-pandemic levels, if not in many cases, above pre-pandemic levels. So we measure that by the amount of incoming or inbound call traffic, telephone calls, Internet inquiries, et cetera. And I think there is also macro information out there that suggests that the number of diagnose behavioral illnesses have continued to increase, and there's been a lot written about the fact that mental health stress, et cetera, has been greater during the pandemic for a variety of reasons. And again, our biggest challenge throughout has really been our ability to satisfy that demand. And again, labor has probably been - labor shortages have probably been the single biggest impediment to doing that. Now that tends to be very geography specific, so that there are hospitals in which we do not have those issues, and we're seeing demand growing and volumes increasing. And then there are markets and geographies where we clearly see that taking place. I think it's worth noting that in the markets where we tend to experience those problems, every, again, data point that we have suggests that our peers are experiencing those same issues in those geographies. So where we've had to cap or close beds because unavailability of clinical personnel, we know that there's evidence that our peers have had to do the same thing in those same geographies. Marc Miller : And I would just add to what Steve said, we have been dealing with certain staffing issues for a while now. We are taking new and different actions to try to combat some of this with just improvement in some of our internal processes that we think, and we have confidence we'll have a different outcome for us going forward. So when the specific market eases up a little bit, we will be probably more ready maybe than we've been in the past to capitalize on that, by improving operationally, some of the things that we are doing to attract staff, keep staff and so on. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then, two quick follow-ups on the premium labor comments that you've talked about. Can you help us quantify how much the impact of cost in the first quarter, looking at premium hours as a percent of all nursing hours? Where did it peak during 1Q? Where do you guys exit in March? And as you look to 2Q, is it fair to think about margins improving due to lower premium labor despite a reduction of the strong pricing seen in 1Q? Steve Filton : Yeah. Pito, so I would say this. At the beginning of the quarter, the way we measure sort of the impact of the labor pressures on wage rates, as we measure the percentage of our nursing hours, in particular, that are being paid at premium rates, things like overtime and registry and traveling nurses, et cetera. And I would say, in the beginning of the quarter when our COVID volumes really peaked, the percentage of our nursing hours that were being paid at premium rates were in the low double digits, 10%, 11%, 12%, something like that. By the end of the quarter, I think those rates were maybe half of that. And while that doesn't necessarily - you know, a shift of 500 or 600 basis points doesn't seem huge, I think that it's worth making the point that, those premium hours are often being paid at two or three times the rate of our regular hours. So the changes in the number of hours don't have to be all that significant to really start to drive volume changes. So, to your last point, I think that we think that as those pressures ease and as the percentage of premium hours come down to more normalized historical levels, they should have a beneficial impact on our margins, because while I think our revenues will also come down, because acuity will come down, I think that the incremental rate pressure is greater than the decline in revenues that we would anticipate. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great. And then my last quick question here. You talked about sort of monthly trends for acute. Can it be same for behavioral, how do patient days track sort of in January in the peak of the COVID surge, sort of how did exit March? And any comments on April? Thanks so much. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, again, I think behavioral patient days were about roughly 4% below last year for the quarter. I think at the beginning of the quarter, when COVID volumes were at their highest, that was probably more like 6% or 7% down, and at the end of the quarter, more 2% or 3% down. And again, the expectation, it may not be a steady progression like that, but I think our expectation is, those volumes will continue to improve as the year progresses, both because the COVID pressures will ease, and on a related note, the labor pressures will ease as well. Pito Chickering : And then one clarification on that, when you're saying exitings are down 2%, 3% sort of March and April. Is that on 2020, which the comps got very easy for obvious reasons? Or is that versus 2019? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So when I say pre-pandemic, we generally are using 2019 as that pre-pandemic measure. So that's what I'm referring to. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. A couple of quick questions, hopefully. One, obviously, you are reinstating the share repurchase. And I know - I wondered on capital deployment elsewhere the M&A pipeline, both - it sounded like there might be a few things that you were looking at last quarter. Any update on whether those still remain in play? And it also there's been press reporting about some larger deals that private equity has on - that I would broadly describe as behavioral that might be in the market. Any - just any update on your thinking about whether there's likely to be meaningful M&A this year from your perspective? Marc Miller : Yeah, I'll answer that, A.J. It's Marc. We continue to look at deals on both sides. I would not categorize it as likely because we're in the middle of a lot of this investigation. But there are, and it seems like there is a little bit more activity happening right now on both sides. So I'm always optimistic that we're going to hit on something, but hard to say likely at this point. A.J. Rice: Okay. That's great. Thanks. Steve, you made an amount of comments about what's happening with labor and how that's a constraint on volume growth on the behavioral side. The other two metrics that have impacted pre-pandemic, the growth trends in behavioral have been sort of the pricing dynamics and also the length of stay pressures that have generally been driven by a Medicaid managed care. Can you give us your updated thoughts? You've been doing better on pricing. I don't know whether you think pricing like what you're seeing now will continue, but any thoughts about that? And then also where we are with the whole length of stay issue relative to Medicaid masked care? Steve Filton : Yeah. So I mean, I think what we've said over the course of the last several quarters is that sort of pre-pandemic, I think our behavioral pricing was increasing, on average, at about a 2% to 3% rate based on revenue per adjusted day base. During the pandemic, that increase has been more like in the 5% or 6% range. I think some of that elevated level of pricing increase is due to a bit of an easing of pressure on the part of our managed care insurance payers. We're seeing fewer denials, less charity care during the pandemic. While we love if that behavior continued post-pandemic, I suspect that managed care behavior will become a little bit more aggressive as the pandemic eases. On the other hand, some of that increase, I think, is more permanent in that we've gotten - we've been, I think, much more focused and aggressive about obtaining increases from particularly from some of our managed Medicaid payers from whom we have not had increases in quite some time, et cetera. And obviously, those are more sustainable. So my gut is that once the pandemic eases some more that, that behavioral pricing increase will settle in somewhere in between the sort of two numbers that I gave before, maybe in that 3%, 4% range. So that will be a little bit higher than historical, but a little bit lower than where we've been running over the last several quarters. And I think the same is generally true of length of stay. We've not seen a lot more transition to managed Medicaid during the pandemic. I don't know that it was an appropriate time for states to make big changes in their Medicaid programs. But also, as I think we've disclosed before, the vast majority of our Medicaid patients, you know, certainly something like three quarters of them are already in managed Medicaid programs. So I don't think we think that the impact of incremental or additional patients migrating to managed Medicaid will be that significant in the future. And I think we made this point in late 2019 and early in 2020, in January and February of 2020, what I would call pre-pandemic, length of stay has been leveling off, labor shortages had been leveling off, et cetera. And then the pandemic hits in mid-March of 2020 and the bottom falls out. But I think we felt like we had made a lot of progress on those couple of issues prior to the pandemic really beginning to impact those. A.J. Rice: Okay. Maybe one last very specific question. And this may be too granular tell me if you want to just take it up offline. But if I look at that corporate expense item, it was sort of 1consistent this year versus last year. But I noticed last year tended to drop off by about $20 million to $25 million in the second and third quarter. And it seemed like that was a bigger drop-off than you traditionally did pre-pandemic. Is there - should we look for something seasonal pattern more like last year, or is - was that somehow driven by what happened with the pandemic and therefore, maybe it doesn't have the seasonal drop that we saw last year, but it's more muted going forward? Steve Filton : Yeah. So honestly, A.J., it's a question that you asked us yesterday, and we continue to look at it. I will tell you that I think potentially, probably the biggest swing factor may be our own health benefits, which, like everybody else, I mean, started pre-pandemic at a normal level and then drop down as people had deferred care and not nearly as much care and now are increasing back up to increasing. So we will look at that, I think, further and try and give people a better sense of how they should model it in the future. But it strikes us that, that's the biggest swing factor. A.J. Rice: Okay. All right. Well, that's interesting, incremental. Thanks for that. Steve Filton : Sure. Operator : Your final question is from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open. John Ransom : Hey, good morning. One for Steve and one for Marc. Steve, just want to just get you to confirm some math, if you would, on all of the 2021 one-timers, including bad debt recovery, HRSA sequester and anything else that you think we should pull out as we think about our '22 comparison. So just, kind of, a total good guy EBITDA number would be great? And then for Marc, we know there's a big psych deal in the marketplace. They want a big price, something like three times revenue, it's a premium asset. So when you guys look at something like that and think about running your returns, how do you put that through the filter of analysis? Thanks. Marc Miller : Do you want me to go on that, Steve? Steve Filton : Sure. Marc Miller : Okay. So when we're looking at any deal, I mean, you're mentioning one particular one. But when we look at any deal, it's fairly consistent as far as our approach goes. I mean, if we think that the possible acquisition has merit, we're, obviously, going to do our diligence to figure out pricing and what we're comfortable at. And there are a lot of factors that go into it, which I won't go into everything here. But certainly, an asset on the behavioral side, we would consider the markets where the seller is already doing business, and how that overlaps with our markets, and that will play a big part in determining how interested we are. So, same thing on the acute care side, if we see something on acute, we would actually probably be more interested if there were synergies in markets where we already play, as long as we didn't have FTC issues, because we could build up our markets a little more. It's different on the behavioral side. But that consideration is a big one for us. And then, obviously, the pricing and who else is in the market competing against us. So, we continue to look at a couple of different opportunities on the BH side, and when it all comes to fruition, we'll - you'll certainly know about that. Steve Filton : And then I'll just very quickly recap the sort of extraordinary, for want of a better word, particularly acute care revenue items in the quarter. I think we quantify the IT event impact, that is the recovery and collection of our aged receivables from Q4 in the sort of $10 million to $15 million range, state and local COVID-related reimbursement in the $5 million to $10 million range and the HRSA reimbursement of non or uninsured COVID patients in the sort of $15 million to $20 million range. I think those are the items we're talking about\u2026 John Ransom : No, I'm sorry. I got that. I was thinking for the full year, as we think about full year '21 I know the bad debt recovery won't recur, sequester goes away. Thanks. I was trying to get an annual number. I got the quarter number. Steve Filton : Okay. I'm sorry. So, yes, the IT event really is a one-time thing. The state and local that reimbursement is difficult to project. And the HRSA money is at the moment, are sort of slated to go through the national emergency date, which I think is currently July. I think the administration has suggested that they anticipated going through the end of the year. But technically, at least at the moment, it only goes through July. So we'll have to see what that benefit is. John Ransom : Okay. Thank you. Steve Filton : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to presenters for closing remarks. Steve Filton : Okay. We just like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody again next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead, sir. Steve Filton : Thank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, and we both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the Company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.79 for the second quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.76 for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. In last night's press release, we identified three specific items, including supplemental Kentucky Medicaid reimbursements, an increase to our self-insured professional and general liability reserves, and the receipt of insurance proceeds. On a combined basis, these items had a net favorable impact on after-tax earnings of approximately $30 million during the second quarter of 2021. Even if one chooses to ignore the favorable impact entirely, our earnings during the quarter still exceeded our internal forecast by a wide margin. For most of the second quarter, we experienced a continued decline in the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in our hospitals and a corresponding recovery in the number of non-COVID patients. As a result, most of our key volume metrics, including acute and behavioral patient days, emergency room visits and surgical cases grew to levels approaching those that we were tracking before the pandemic began. This robust recovery in volumes exceeded the pace of our original forecast and drove the favorable operating results even in the face of continuing labor pressures in both of our business segments. Our cash generated from operating activities was $119 million during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $1.45 billion during the same period in 2020. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the previously announced early repayment of $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments, which were received by us during 2020 and repaid to the government during the first quarter of 2021. We spent $482 million on capital expenditures during the first six months of 2021. At June 30, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 35.7% as compared to 38.3% at June 30, 2020. As previously announced, we resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021 after suspending it in April 2020 as the COVID volume surged for the first time. During the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.21 million shares at an aggregate cost of $350 million. And yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, leaving $1.2 billion remaining authorization. We were extremely pleased with our second quarter 2021 operating results, which we noted were well ahead of our internal forecast. As a consequence, we also raised our full year earnings guidance, including an approximately 6% to 8% increase in our full year forecasted adjusted EBITDA. I would note that during the past four to six weeks, many of our hospitals have experienced significant surges in the number of COVID patients, and it is not evident that this surge has yet reached its peak. Given the uncertain impact of this most recent surge on non-COVID volumes and on labor shortages, we based our guidance for the second half of the year, primarily on our original internal forecast. Marc and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Just wanted to follow up on the labor issue. It seems like a lot of companies are talking about difficulty in getting staffed. And I guess really interested mostly on the psych side that's been kind of a gating factor to growth for you guys. What are you seeing now? And how do you expect that to play out over the next year or so? Steve Filton : Sure. Well, Kevin, we've certainly discussed it for some time. I think we felt like before the pandemic began that the labor situation in our behavioral hospitals have largely stabilized from some of the challenges we've been having in the years before that. Obviously, the onset of the pandemic that have exacerbated and kind of created new challenges in terms of -- are finding sufficient numbers of therapists and nurses and mental health technicians who are nonprofessionals. For a variety of reasons, competition from telehealth providers, for therapists, nurses who were either burn out or contracting the virus or quarantining because they've been exposed to the virus or mental health technicians who we were competing with employers like Amazon or FedEx with. So a whole bunch of challenges, I think, during the pandemic. Again, I think as the pandemic eased in from its peaks early this year, I think the labor situation has been improving. And I think you saw that in Q2 with sequential improvement in our volumes and just a sort of a general stabilization of the behavioral business. Obviously, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen an uptick in COVID patients in the last four to six weeks. I think it's a little too early to tell what sort of impact that's going to have on our ability to fill all of our open labor positions. And it's why, as I, again, made -- commented in my prepared remarks, we've been a little bit cautious about our guidance in the back half of the year. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That makes sense. And I guess maybe just a little more color on the psych volume improvement. I guess you've got a different number, different service lines in psych. Are they all returning uniformly or some doing better than others? Steve Filton : It's very geographic specific. Number one, Kevin, I mean, I think it really depends about the competitive environment in the market. So, we have some markets where it is frankly not an issue and others where it's a significant issue. I will say that again, in May, June, July, we were setting internal records for how many people we were hiring at all levels as a result of some very focused equities on our part to increase our recruitment activities, et cetera. We were also focusing a great deal on increasing retention rates for those people we do hire, but again, express some level of caution and concern with the rise in COVID volumes in the last month or so only because every other time we've seen an increase in COVID patients, it does create an exacerbated pressure on those labor issues. Kevin Fischbeck : And maybe just another question. It looks like your cyclones are still down, I guess, maybe versus 2019. Is that the right way to think about it? And when do you think you can get back to those levels? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean I think as we've commented many times over the course of the pandemic, the underlying demand by sort of every way that we measure it for behavioral care is as strong as it was pre-pandemic and quite frankly, probably stronger, whether we measure that on inbound increase calls, internet inquiries, et cetera, or the amount of patients that were required to deflect because we don't have beds or we don't have sufficient staff, et cetera. Every indicator that we have both on a sort of macro industry-wide basis and a micro UHS basis indicates that the demand is still growing. As I indicated, I think we felt that as the pandemic eased, a lot of those pressures were easing, not necessarily disappearing by any stretch, but easing. We didn't have -- nurses weren't as burned out, nurses weren't chasing those premium dollars. It just became easier to hire and to retain people. So I think that the COVID resurgence makes it a bit more challenging. But ultimately, we have a view that these shortages are temporary and transient in nature and when they get resolved, which I think will happen as the pandemic eases over time, we'll be able to get back to pre-pandemic volumes and ultimately see pre-pandemic volumes. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Marco Criscuolo : This is Marco on for Josh. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just provide a bit more detail on the cadence of volumes through the quarter relative to the pre-COVID baseline? And would also appreciate some color on the trends you're seeing through July and thoughts around what is baked into guidance for the second half of the year? Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure. So I think we commented in Q1, we reached our -- the peak of our COVID levels, the third wave of COVID patients was sort of in late December 2020 and into January of 2021. Those were our highest COVID levels at almost all of our hospitals that we experienced during the pandemic. I would say beginning in the second half of January and then pretty steadily from there, COVID volumes declined and non-COVID volumes have recovered and rebounded. And as I indicated again in my prepared remarks to the point that by the time we exited Q2, for most of our volume metrics, we were back to sort of pre-pandemic and were sort of using 2019 as our measure of pre-pandemic levels of volumes. As I also indicated, we've seen COVID patients surged again beginning very late June and certainly well into July, and they don't appear to have peaked. Now what I will say is that our operators seem to be managing through this fourth wave of COVID very effectively. We certainly have seen a financial result since the COVID surge has resumed. But just from a volume metric perspective, we don't see that level of decline in things like elective surgeries or other activity that we've seen with other COVID surges. I think our operators are just much more accustomed to dealing with this, all of the sort of gating factors that have proved problematic in earlier surges, lack of PPE, lack of beds, lack of ventilators, those things, at least at the moment, don't exist. So we're coping much better. I do think probably the single biggest issue we will have with the resumption of COVID is just exacerbated pressure on labor. Every time that COVID frequency has increased, there's been more and more pressure on labor, and that's tough to measure. I mean, I think we know that we're using more temporary labor in July, but what the ultimate impact of that will be will have to play out. But at least so far through July, we seem to be coping reasonably well. However, as I indicated again in my prepared remarks, because we're sort of uncertain as to how this plays out and what the cadence will be, we've been cautious and haven't assumed that our financial results will sort of exceed our internal forecast in the back half of the year the way they did in Q2. And we've just sort of presumed that we'll meet our original guidance for the back half of the year for the most part. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Ralph Giacobbe : Steve, can you talk a little bit more about utilization by payer just across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid, and also if you're seeing differences in acuity between them as well beyond sort of utilization? Steve Filton : I mean I think what the second quarter results are emblematic of -- and I think this is -- seems to have been true for at least our two acute care public peer who also have already reported this quarter is that there is a very favorable mix of patients as COVID has declined, and the non-COVID patients have recovered, the payer mix of those patients is skewed to commercial and to Medicare. We're seeing in a lot of our markets, fewer Medicaid and uninsured patients. We're seeing higher acuity of the patients we are treating. We've said, I think, from the beginning that the patients who sort of reluctant to come to the hospitals, driving softer emergency room activity, et cetera, tend to be lower acuity, Medicaid on insured patients. And so that mix obviously is reflected, albeit at lower volumes and higher revenue per unit, per adjusted admission, per adjusted patient day on both the acute and the behavioral side and increased earnings. So I think that's been generally a positive development and so positive that quite frankly, it has outweighed and even, I think, arguably overwhelmed the increased labor pressure that we've experienced. Now again, I'll caution that we may see a different dynamic in Q3 with higher levels of COVID patients, the mix may not be quite as favorable, but I think it was very favorable in Q2. Ralph Giacobbe : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I was hoping you could help frame what you are seeing specific to COVID. Maybe just baseline it for us, what percentage of admissions were COVID in the second quarter? And then obviously, obviously, you talked about the increase in just the last kind of few weeks. I was hoping to get sort of a quantification of what percentage of admissions you've seen of late that are COVID of the baseline? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So I think in the second quarter, the percentage of COVID admissions to overall admissions had dropped into the sort of mid-single digits. I think throughout the pandemic, our average has been more like the low double digit, 12%, 13%. And I think at its peak in, let's say, January of 2021 or the first half of January 2021, we were at that maybe 20% of our admissions were COVID. Our COVID volumes today are similar to what they were a year ago in the sort of June, July time frame from a year ago, which, again, I would suggest we're in sort of the low double-digit percentage, 10%, 11%, 12% of our overall admissions. So not near the peak of where we were in January, but either close to or exceeding where we were in the second wave last summer. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : They're getting closer to the 2019 levels, but not there yet. As you think about the back half of the year, should we be thinking about admissions accelerating sequentially from here and exiting the year at or above 2019 levels for fourth quarter? Steve Filton : So Peter, I think our point of view was, when we gave our original 2021 guidance, we had a point of view about declining cadence of COVID patients and frequency of COVID patients and a corresponding recovery in non-COVID volumes. I think the fact of the matter is, and I think our second quarter results reflect this that the decline in COVID patients was more rapid than we originally anticipated and the recovery of non-COVID business was also correspondingly more rapid. And obviously, it led to second quarter results that were well ahead of our expectations. I think as we think about now the second half of the year, again, the most recent COVID surge sort of complicates that, and I don't know that where any of us are really insightful enough to know exactly how that will affect the ultimate trajectory for the rest of the year. But I think we have a point of view that some of the catch-up and recovery of those deferred procedures, et cetera, were realized in the second quarter that maybe we had anticipated would occur later in the year. And so, I think we were thinking about a little bit more seasonality in the back half of the year. So I think, for instance, as I look at The Street estimates, I think The Street was projecting just steady improvement in volumes sort of throughout the year, which was sort of defied the traditional seasonality. And at the beginning of the year, that seemed to make some sense. But I think now that we've had such a strong second quarter, presuming that the COVID volumes decline relatively soon. I think we think the second half of the year will look a little more seasonal -- traditional seasonally than maybe we expected originally. Pito Chickering : Okay. Fair enough. And then on behavioral margins, they increased 100 basis points sequentially after we pull out the $55 million from Kentucky. I guess how should we think about behavioral margins progression throughout the year? And can you walk us through the sort of the hires in June and July? And how do you think about hiring versus top line growth versus margins? Thanks so much. Steve Filton : Yes. I think that a lot of the strength in behavior and the increase in margins that you alluded to is being driven by strong pricing or revenue per adjusted day. And we talked about that quite a bit in the last few quarters. I think it's driven by lower level of denials, less uninsured patients, a number of other things, including some negotiated price increases with some of our managed care payers, particularly our managed Medicaid payers. It's been a little bit difficult to sort of predict how sustainable those levels are. I think some of that improvement is based on a little bit less rigorous utilization management behavior on the part of payers. And I think there was a view that at some point, as we emerge from the pandemic, the payers would become sort of more aggressive than they have been during the pandemic. We'll see how that occurs. But I think we have a point of view that as pricing moderates some, our volumes will continue to recover. And that's really based on the labor sort of dynamics that you talked about. And again, I mentioned that we've been seeing from our own internal perspective, very impressive hiring numbers for the last few months. What is difficult to measure in real time is exactly how our turnover rates are doing for a while. I think they had stabilized, the concern is with the resurgence in COVID that turnover rates could increase because we've seen turnover rates increase every time that COVID volumes increase. So that's the piece that's a little bit difficult to peg with precision. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Jamie Perse : I wanted to start with EBITDA and just thinking about 2022 and given where your guidance is for the rest of this year. How are you thinking about the longer-term growth of EBITDA, again, just given where you're going to exit this year relative to where Street is for 2022? Steve Filton : So I think our point of view is that the underlying fundamentals of both of these businesses have not really changed in any significant way. And the way that we've always thought about the long-term model for both of these businesses is that, they could and should grow from a top line perspective in the mid-single-digit range, 5%, 6%, 7%. And all other things being equal, if you were able to achieve that, that EBITDA growth would meet or exceed that and margins would expand, et cetera., because this is still a largely fixed and semi-fixed cost business. Obviously, during the pandemic, that sort of traditional model was significantly disrupted because of an overemphasis on COVID patients who tend to be sicker, less profitable and a decline in non-COVID business, whose patients tend to be more profitable. But I think our point of view and again, we're not smart enough to know exactly what the cadence and frequency of the COVID patients is going to be. But I think our longer-term point of view was as the COVID volumes declined. And again, I think Q2 was a perfect example of this. We sort of returned to a more normalized model where volume growth was in the low single digits. Pricing growth was in the low single digits, on a combined basis, revenue growth was in the mid-single digits. EBITDA growing, margins were expanding, et cetera. And I think at this point, that's how we think about 2022 with the sort of caveat that we presume that 2022 will be a relatively quiet year from a COVID perspective, but that's probably more helpful than anything else at this point. Jamie Perse : Okay. That's really helpful. And then share repo and dividend, obviously both back now. Just how are you thinking about other legs of capital deployment, specifically M&A, just your interest level there and what you're seeing out there in the market? Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure, and Marc can certainly weigh in on this subject as well. But I think we have -- we saw about interest level. I don't think our interest level in M&A has declined. I think somebody asked Marc the question specifically in the first quarter call, and he talked about the fact that we continue to look at and explore and perform diligence on a whole host of opportunities in both business segments at the end of the day other than some relatively small opportunities, which we pursue things like micro hospitals and freestanding emergency departments, et cetera, that we've acquired. These are transactions in the $40 million, $50 million, $60 million range individual transactions, there really hasn't been real significant opportunities of size although we continue to explore them and would pursue them if they made economic sense and more compelling from a financial return perspective. In the absence of those opportunities, and again, I think the second quarter was a good example of this. We just became a more aggressive acquirer of our own shares. We're buying back our shares even with sort of the strong recovery in our share price in Q2. We're buying back our shares, arguably somewhere in the 8.5x to 9.5x EBITDA range. And honestly, we're hard pressed to find an opportunity to buy external EBITDA at those same multiples. So we view the opportunity to buy back our own shares as still pretty compelling. And I think we'll continue to do so. And our original guidance for 2021 was that we would buy back $750 million worth of stock over the three quarters. We bought back $350 million in Q2. So, we're obviously ahead of that pace. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Frank Morgan : Steve, I wanted to go back to the hiring on the behavioral side of the business. It sounds like you've had some success there. But where are you now versus what you actually need? And what would that translate into in terms of incremental capacity to bring on more volumes? Steve Filton : So Frank, it's a great question. I mean I think we have a point of view that if we could wave a magic wand and hire all the staff that we need, again, at the therapist nurse, tech levels, our volumes would exceed I'll call it pre-pandemic baseline or 2019 volumes by mid-single digits at least. I think the demand is sufficiently there that, that would be the case. Now I don't want to leave the impression that obviously, we don't have a magic wand and there's just -- instead a lot of hard work that remains to be done and focus. But I think we have a point of view that these things are -- these issues and these obstacles are overcomeable, if that's a word. And we will meet these targets, especially, again, as the virus received, obviously, the frequency of the virus and sort of multifactorial kinds of pressures that puts on our labor is the one thing that, as you might imagine, so they're completely out of our control. There's nothing we can do about that. But don't believe the virus is going to last forever. And we believe that as it proceeds, it will become much easier for us to meet our hiring and retention targets. And I think fundamentally, we believe that demand will return to not only pre-pandemic levels, but will be growing in the way that I described the model earlier to somebody by mid-single digits every year above pre-pandemic levels. Frank Morgan : Got you. And maybe going back to your guidance, and you called out you're thinking more of a seasonal pattern, but could you help us maybe if you had to give a weighting and attribution for the second half of the year. Is it -- are you thinking maybe 40% of the balance of the year will occur in the third quarter and 60% in the fourth? Any kind of color in terms of weighting over the second half of the year? And then, are there any incremental buybacks included in that guidance? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, we made this point in Q1, which is, I think UHS has very intentionally not ever given quarterly guidance. And I said if there was ever a year when I think we would never have changed that practice and be more precise, I think this was the year. I still believe that obviously, some of the cadence and some of the trajectories this year are much harder to predict than ever before. What I will say, and I think I referenced this in an earlier comment is as I looked at The Street estimates for the year, it just seemed like they were a little heavy in the fourth quarter compared to what our expectations were. And I think that's because I'm really not being critical, The Street in creating their expectations for the year sort of ignored the normal seasonal patterns, said volumes would continue to recover because you had all this pent-up demand, et cetera. I think we have a point of view that because volumes have recovered earlier than our expectations a lot of it sort of became front-end loaded. You see that in the Q2 results, not only for us but our peers that the fourth quarter will be -- have some of the more seasonal softness that we've seen historically because of the holidays, et cetera. So that's the only observation I'd make about the cadence and particularly The Street trajectory for the balance of the year. Frank Morgan : Got you. One last one and I'll hop. Just in terms of the COVID surge you have experienced, any particular geographies you called out, certainly, we've read about Vegas, but is Vegas the biggest source? Or any color around any other geography? And I'll hop. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, so on the acute side, I think we've all read that states that have seen a significant increase in Texas and Florida and Nevada. And unfortunately, from an acute perspective, that probably covers of our acute care revenues. So, we're seeing that increase in all of our markets, but I think probably Vegas is the most acute at the moment. And then on the behavioral side, it's pretty spread out. I mean, we do have again, a pretty big presence in Florida and Texas. From a behavioral perspective, we have some hospitals in Missouri, which has been kind of a focal point of the COVID resurgence, et cetera. So, we're feeling that tension in a number of different markets on the behavioral side as well. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : You have Ben filling in for Matt Borsch. Thanks for taking my question. So I would like to touch upon price transparency. With the announcement of the proposed rule to increase fines to hospitals, I was just wondering how your team plans to handle compliance with these possible changes going forward? Steve Filton : So we have a point of view that our hospitals have been compliant with the price transparency regulations since January 1 of this year when they originally went into effect. Occasionally, we will sort of be critiqued by users or other groups who sort of kind of tested and will say that they have difficulty navigating uncertainties, et cetera, and we make tweaks to it. But we very much feel that we currently comply and will continue to comply. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. A.J. Rice: First off, with respect to the change in reserve that you recorded in the second quarter, can you flesh out a little bit? Is that part of a normal review process? Was that an unusual update? And does that have any impact on forward accruals? Steve Filton : Sure, A.J. So, the nature of the malpractice reserves are such that we conduct -- or we have a third-party actuary conduct in-depth actuarial analysis twice a year. So this was part of our kind of midyear review of that reserve. And the nature, unfortunately, on the malpractice reserves because they have such a long tail and cases are often being settled five, six, seven or even more years from their actual occurrence. It's probably the single most difficult kind of an accounting estimate that we make and is probably subject to the most change. I think what our actuary reported to us in the current period, and we, I think, affirmed with a number of other outside observers in this area is that the general trend in the country is for not necessarily more free malpractice cases, but more severe and more sort of dollar intensive cases. And that's been our experience as well. So given that those results, they determined that we needed an increase in our reserves, we concurred. We recorded that. We'll record, I think, a relatively small increase in our provision form malpractice going forward. I don't think that will have more than kind of $20 million impact annually going forward. And obviously, we'll continue to do these biannual detailed reviews by the actuary, but that's the color behind that. A.J. Rice: Okay. And then the other question I was going to ask, you talked a little bit about different aspects of what you're seeing on the commercial side. But is just there an update on where you're at and re-contracting. Is that happening at a normal pace for this year, next year and beyond any change what you're seeing in terms of rate increases or in terms of terms, all the value-based talk and so forth, anything there that's new or different that you're seeing? Steve Filton : No, I think the reality is that commercial managed care contracts continue to be administered contracts and negotiated throughout the pandemic. Obviously, I don't know that all -- those sorts of negotiations were held in person or face-to-face historically. So I don't think that changed a great deal during the pandemic. I did note earlier and have noted, I think, in previous calls that we really made a concerted effort, particularly on the managed Medicaid side of the behavioral business to negotiate price increases and in some cases, we haven't had for years. And I think that's helped to drive that really strong behavioral pricing that we've experienced throughout the pandemic. So, that's the one change that I would highlight and suggest is certainly sustainable. Other than that and other than, again, I think a comment that I've made before that our managed care payers, particularly on the behavioral side, seem to have been a little bit more lenient on utilization management and denial like the stay during the pandemic. I think broadly, we haven't seen huge changes in our relationships with managed care payers on either the acute or behavioral side. A.J. Rice: And just maybe a final thing. On the public exchange volume, we're hearing some -- obviously, there's growth again of note this year with the changes in subsidies and the changes in the extended period of enrollment. Has that moved the needle? I'm assuming you book that in commercial, if I'm right. Steve Filton : Yes. So sometimes it's difficult to identify what patients have an actual exchange product, et cetera. But what I do think and I said this again in an earlier comment is, despite all the economic disruption and particularly in the beginning of the pandemic, people losing their job, setting reduced hours, et cetera. We didn't see the accompanying increase in rates of uninsured the way that we have in previous sort of economic downturns. And I attribute some of that to the fact that obviously, the ACA was in place, and so for instance, in a state like Nevada, where we've seen a significant amount of weakness in the gaming industry, again, particularly early in the pandemic. We've seen an uptick in Medicaid utilization and I think that's generally been a good thing because I think these people would have been uninsured other than being able to fall back on expanded Medicaid benefit. So that sort of thing, I think, has been helpful. I think the presence of the ACA, Medicaid expansion in some of our important states like California, Nevada. The greater ease in terms of being able to acquire commercial exchange products, I think all that's been helpful to keep that better payer mix that we seem to be experiencing, our peers seem to be experiencing during the pandemic. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to management. Steve Filton : Okay. We'd just like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Steve Filton. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.60 for the third quarter of 2021. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.67 for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. For most of the third quarter, we experienced an escalation in the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in our hospitals. In our acute segment, this COVID surge resulted in measurably increased revenues due to the higher acuity and incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients. Unlike previous surges, however, non-COVID volumes, including emergency room visits and elective and/or scheduled procedures were not crowded out. And in fact, generally, we are running at or near pre-pandemic levels. As a result, acute care revenues in the quarter were higher and managed to offset the premium labor costs and increased supply expense associated with the COVID patients, leading to an acute care EBITDA result in the quarter that was above our internal forecast. At the same time, the most recent surge created significant challenges for our behavioral segment. Volumes were pressured throughout the quarter due to the capping of bed capacity, in some cases, to properly isolate COVID patients and in other cases because of a shortage of appropriate patient care personnel. Generally, behavioral patient days during the quarter ran 4% to 6% below comparable pre-pandemic levels. The effect of the reduced volumes combined with higher labor costs led to a behavioral EBITDA result in the quarter, measurably below our internal forecast. Our cash generated from operating activities was $442 million during the third quarter of 2021 as compared to $767 million during the same period in 2020. Included in our cash generated from operating activities during last year\u2019s third quarter was approximately $400 million of additional funds received in connection with various governmental stimulus programs, most notably the CARES Act. We spent $667 million on capital expenditures during the first 9 months of 2021. At September 30, \u201821, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 37.4% as compared to 37.7% at September 30, 2020. During the third quarter of 2021, we opened 157 new beds in our Las Vegas market, including 69 new beds at Henderson Hospital. We acquired 88 new beds through the acquisition of the Las Vegas Specialty Hospital, which will serve orthopedic and surgical patients. And we acquired Elite Medical Center, micro-hospital, offering emergency and in-patient care adjacent to the Las Vegas strip. In addition, we continue to grow our freestanding emergency department footprint with 19 sites expected to be operational by the end of the year in 2021 and an additional 5 approved and under construction, which are expected to open in 2022. Construction also continues on Northern Nevada Sierra Hospital, a 170-bed acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada, which is expected to open in March of 2022. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2021, we continue to be an active acquirer of our own shares based in large part on our view that the underlying patient demand for our services and particularly in our behavioral segment remains fundamentally strong and that our ability to more fully \u2013 to meet that demand will incrementally improve as COVID volumes continue to decline. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.78 million shares at an aggregate cost of $419 million. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchased more than 20% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. We will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joanna Gajuk : Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. So, thanks so much for taking the question here. I guess, first clearly, you just said that the acute care segment results were better than expected offsetting a site which came in lower than your internal expectations. So how does the quarter I guess stack up versus internal views overall as it\u2019s been and also I am asking in the context of any comment on your full year guidance? Steve Filton : Yes. So, the adjusted EPS of $2.67 which we reported last night was very much in line with our internal forecast overall, obviously, as noted in my comments, with the acute care segment outperforming and behavioral underperforming and largely offsetting each other. As far as our full year guidance, our customary practice, which was true this quarter as well is with \u2013 absent any comments to the contrary, we are just maintaining and reaffirming our guidance. Joanna Gajuk : Okay. I appreciate that comment. And I guess I have one question here, in terms of the issues you are seeing in the site segment. So obviously, where you have the \u2013 a lot of COVID activity and the virus activity in the community and you have to have hold on that, but then I guess you also mentioned some of the labor shortages there? So, can you talk about any actions you are taking to kind of try to sort of stick that trend there? And also, what happens to these patients, if you cannot take them or they are staying in the hospitals longer? And also, any color you might have on the labor shortage whether there is any difference between different product lines or geographies? Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes. So, you asked multiple questions there. I will try and answer them. But some of them I suspect will be clarified by other people as well. So, as far as the labor shortage in the behavioral segment goes, to the degree that it is caused by the COVID surge itself, as you know, that\u2019s largely out of our control. On the other hand, we are extremely focused and have a great number of initiatives to increase the efficiency of both our recruitment and retention functions. We are actually hiring employees, nurses as well as other personnel at record levels over the last several months. The challenge is that the churn or the turnover or the number of employees leaving at the same time for us as well as I believe most other hospitals is also quite large and I think driven in large part by the COVID surge as well, because many nurses, in particular, have the opportunity to work in a more acute setting, in an ICU and ER, etcetera and earn 400% or 500% of their salary if they are willing to travel or to work in a COVID environment. And so that challenge I think is difficult for us to overcome, although we are certainly trying, but I think that it will naturally abate as COVID volumes decline and those opportunities for nurses to earn those premiums or to dollars will decline. And I think most nurses will ultimately return to their home both literally and figuratively, geographically as well as back to their original jobs. And many of our nurses have told us that. So, we continue to be extremely focused on those activities. To the degree, I think that you had other questions I will wait and allow others to follow-up. Thank you. Joanna Gajuk : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Marco Criscuolo : Good morning. This is actually Marco on for Josh. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick one, I was wondering if you had seen any impact from the vaccine mandates on the healthcare workforce in your markets? And then you talked a little bit about the trends in labor and behavioral care, but I was wondering if you could provide a little more detail on the staffing and wages within the acute care segment? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So, we had a number of geographies in the state of California, the state of Oregon, the city of Philadelphia and there are others that have vaccine mandates. I think for the most part, we have found that those vaccine mandates have not had a material impact on the labor situation in part because the mandates are pervasive. So, it\u2019s not like if an employee wants to continue working and doesn\u2019t want to get vaccinated, they can work in somebody else\u2019s facility rather than ours. We have not on our own mandated the vaccine in any of our facilities where it is not mandated by a government authority, in part because given the shortage of labor personnel, we are not anxious to give people a reason to go elsewhere although we certainly are encouraging our employees as strongly as we can to become vaccinated. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been a real significant factor. As far as staffing in the acute side, I mean, I think we are feeling these labor pressures that I alluded to certainly in both business segments. But I think what we have found and I think this has been true throughout the pandemic is that on the acute side, the labor shortage tends to manifest itself in higher premium hours and premium pay. So, in other words, we are able to fill most of our vacant, mostly nursing hours, but we fill it with premium pay that could either be over time from our own employees, shift differential, temporary nurses, traveling nurses, etcetera. It\u2019s a very expensive alternative, but for the most part, we are able to fill most of our hours. And the good news on the acute side is, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, the higher acuity, the higher revenue, the higher volumes has been effectively offsetting those higher labor costs. The challenge on the behavioral side is that we are unable to fill a lot of those vacant hours even with premium dollars. We are certainly spending some premium dollars. But in some cases, we are just unable to fill the hours. And as a consequence we are having to turn patients away and therefore, we have got lower volumes. Again, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, 4% to 6% below pre-pandemic levels and not enough revenue to offset the higher labor costs, so different manifestation of, I think, the same sorts of broad dynamics in the labor shortage in the two business segments. Marco Criscuolo : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Steve, I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on the revenue and volume trends in the behavioral business by geography. In geographies where COVID was present, but not surging, can you give us a sense for revenue performance there? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, I think what we have found, Andrew, is that the pressure on labor, in particular, but therefore, the pressure on volumes is very much tied to the level of COVID. I mean there is not \u2013 I actually have tried to sort of see if there is an absolute formula and I don\u2019t know that there is, but I think there is a very close correlation. And so we are \u2013 we have got behavioral facilities in 37 states all around the country, etcetera. It would be difficult for me to sort of tick off literally geography by geography where we have seen kind of above average levels of COVID, etcetera. But where we see above average levels of COVID, we tend to see the labor pressures and therefore softer volumes. And in those markets where we don\u2019t, we tend to see demand being manifested strongly. We are able to satisfy that demand, etcetera, which is why we remain pretty bullish about the idea that as COVID volumes overall recede as they have started to do, I think in the last 4, 5, 6 weeks, we will start to see some easing of those labor pressures, maybe not immediately, because I do think there is a time lag associated with a lot of these commitments of traveling and temporary nurses. And I think we saw that in Q1 where even as COVID volumes declined as early as mid-January 2021, it took a while for us to really sort of enjoy the benefits of that. So, we still struggled some in Q1, but then Q2 with lower COVID volumes saw upticks in volumes and not nearly as much pressure on the labor side. And I think we are hoping that\u2019s sort of the same trend we are likely to see now. Andrew Mok : Got it. Thanks for the color. And just a quick follow-up, we are now 20 months into the pandemic, have you had an opportunity to formally assess market share shifts in the behavioral segment, whether it\u2019s geographical or by side of care? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, so market share data on the behavioral side is not, I think, as robust or precise as it is on the acute side. But our sense and both objectively to the degree that objective data is available and subjectively to the degree that we are able to talk with our competitors and the nature of the hospital industry is that employees, particularly nurses and patient care employees tend to move in many cases from one facility to another. So, it\u2019s relatively easy to keep track of what\u2019s happening in the market. And I think what we find is that in markets where we are struggling for labor, it seems like all of our peers are struggling in the same way and vice-versa. So while we are very focused on the things that we can do to improve and be more efficient from a recruitment and retention perspective, we acknowledge that these labor pressures are sort of more broad and more comprehensive than we have control over. But certainly, from a wage competitiveness issue, etcetera, we are always following what the market conditions are and literally changing and adjusting if not on a daily basis, on a weekly basis so that we are being as competitive as we can possibly be. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning guys. Quick guidance question for you, for fourth quarter guidance, can you tell us what needs to happen or if the low versus the high end of guidance? And what do you direct toward the Street models to sort of focus towards the mid-range for the fourth quarter? And as you think about 2022 guidance, any color of how much you believe you can grow in 2022 off of your 2019 EBITDA? Steve Filton : So Pito, I think that the commentary as already indicated in today\u2019s call, the most difficult aspect of projecting future results is understanding the pace of COVID decline. And frankly, if in fact, COVID continues to decline, we suspect that it will, it has been certainly at the moment. So how quickly the COVID volumes recede and therefore, how quickly the labor pressures ease. And again, with the notion that I think there is some delay of at least a couple of months, etcetera. So my sense is because we\u2019re probably \u2013 it will be difficult to sort of have a full recovery in Q4 from the labor pressures, it would be difficult to sort of have an outperformance in both of our business segments in Q4. As a consequence, I think getting to the high end of our range would certainly be a little more challenging. But \u2013 and I think the fact that we\u2019re reaffirming guidance is indicative of the fact that we feel like getting into the lower to mid-range of our guidance should be achievable as long as we continue to see the COVID trends and the labor trends that we\u2019ve started to see at the very end of September and into October. As far as 2022 goes, even in what I would describe in quotes is the normal year, we wouldn\u2019t be giving guidance for the following year as part of our third quarter call. And so in an environment that is as uncertain as today is, we\u2019re certainly not going to do that either. But I will say this, I mean I think as we think about creating our 2022 guidance and think about what the business looks like next year, we tend to use 2019 as a base, 2019 being a pandemic-free year. And even though we don\u2019t expect 2022 to be COVID free, we just think that 2019 is kind of a more meaningful base. And I think we \u2013 as we would in any normal year, we would expect to grow off that base. And the question sort of becomes, do we expect to experience sort of cumulative 2 or 3 years growth off of that base? Or do we expect to get just 1 years\u2019 worth of growth? And I think that\u2019s ultimately, where we\u2019re going to spend a lot of our focus when we do sit down and do our 2022 forecasting with more precision. And my gut is somewhere in between. We will expect 2022 to grow more than just a year\u2019s worth over that 2019 base, but certainly not the full sort of 3 years\u2019 worth of I think that there has been some development activity and growth activity that we\u2019ve just lost during the pandemic and won\u2019t be sort of recapture-able. So I\u2019ve seen some consensus numbers, which I don\u2019t look at in great detail that show us in the sort of the high single digits, 7%, 8%, 9% above 2019. And levels and at the moment can certainly change, but that doesn\u2019t feel unreasonable. Pito Chickering : Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up one here on the labor side for both acute and behavioral. How much of this pressure do you think is short-term is from COVID or do for long-term pressure? Do you believe it normalizes in 2022? If you had to quantify, we think that inflation would be for nurses in 2022, not your premium labor but just your full-time employees, sort of what type of inflation you see versus a year later? Thanks so much. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, so \u2013 again, I would make the point that I think the underlying wage inflation is not what is mostly driving the wage pressure. It is the premium pay. It\u2019s \u2013 the use of over time it\u2019s the payment of temporary nurses and traveling nurses and sign-on bonuses and that sort of thing. And to your point about the outlook, is this temporary or structural, I think the honest answer is something in between. I do think there is no question that a lot of this demand, heightened demand has been created by the COVID surge itself. Again, if you can go online, and look for nursing opportunities, not that any of this call is necessarily going to do that. But if you did, you\u2019d see that those opportunities are working in COVID units, in ICUs and ERs, etcetera. And I think as the virus recedes and just become sort of settled in at what they described as endemic \u2013 rather pandemic levels, we just think a lot of those opportunities will naturally sort of fall away. And nurses, again, will sort of retreat back to their original jobs, if you will. So that part, I think, is certainly temporary. I do think there is some structural changes that have been made. I think there are some nurses that have permanently left the workforce, either to take new jobs, and they have been retrained in different specialties, or they have just been burned out, etcetera. And I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us. And quite likely, I think, hospitals in general will come up with, as a result, new patient care models that rely less on RNs in particular and other caregivers, LPNs and tech and EMTs, etcetera, as well as more \u2013 relies more on technology that allows us to deliver the same level of patient care without necessarily the same number, particularly registered nurses. So part of I think this issue is structural, and we will address that. And part of it is temporary that I think will naturally get better as the virus numbers recede. Pito Chickering : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Perry Wong : Hi, this is Perry on for Justin. Steve, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on your thoughts around 2022. It seems like high single digits isn\u2019t totally unreasonable. I was wondering if you can sort of break down what that growth will look like between behavior and acute? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to get into that level of detail on today\u2019s call. And again, I think a lot of it depends. We won\u2019t give our formal 2022 guidance until the end of February in our year-end earnings announcement. So it\u2019s a good 4 months from now. And in this pandemic, 4 months feels like a lifetime in the sense of how things can change, etcetera. But I think \u2013 how we think about the two business segments, how we think about overall growth is, again, going to very much depend on whether the cadence of virus frequency continues to recede as it has been doing over the last month or so, whether there are any new variants or upticks in the wintertime, etcetera, which some people expect there might be and then how the labor shortage is really affected. And sort of getting back to the previous question, we will have a better feel for how much of this labor pressure is really temporary and gets better and how much we have to, sort of, address in a more structural way. So again, other than the comments that I\u2019ve already made, as I said, we wouldn\u2019t be giving precise guidance in a normal, predictable year, and this is far from that. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get into any more detail than we already have. Perry Wong : Okay. Maybe just one more question. I think earlier this year, you had said during the high that the pandemic contract nursing was about 12% of your total nursing hours. Can you give us an idea of what percentage that was this quarter? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So again, those numbers vary by business segment pretty dramatically. I would say on the acute side, the percentage of premium hours in this surge was probably in the high single digits, 8%, 9%, getting close to 10%. Not quite as high as it was back in the January \u201821 period because I think the COVID numbers themselves were not as high, but still pretty high. On the behavioral side, I think our premium hours are only around about 2% of our overall hours and harkening back to comments I\u2019ve already made, it\u2019s because we can\u2019t get enough of those premium hours to satisfy the need that we have. We wish we could, quite frankly. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s been more of a challenge on the behavioral side because filling those hours is more difficult. Keep in mind that employees in the behavioral setting, particularly nurses, are generally making less than they would otherwise make in an acute setting. I think that has always been true. And when there is been a small differential, I think there is always been sufficient reasons why many nurses prefer to work in a behavioral setting. It\u2019s very different, and every nurse has sort of a different view of what they are looking for in a patient care experience. When a nurse has the opportunity to make 400% or 500% of her base salary, all of a sudden, I think a lot of those other factors become less important, and the financial dynamics just overwhelm everything else. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in this current surge. And I think the other thing that\u2019s worth noting is the current surge related to the Delta variant is the first surge we\u2019ve seen during the pandemic in which many of the nurses are vaccinated. And so pursuing these very lucrative financial opportunities, I think nurse\u2019s view is a less risky proposition than they might have a year ago or 18 months ago before they were vaccinated. Perry Wong : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Frank Morgan : Good morning. Just on the topic of the COVID volumes as a percentage of total admissions in the acute side of the business, could you talk a little bit about how that affected the rest of your business in terms of in and outpatient surgeries or overall payer mix, ED volumes, those kind of things? That\u2019s my first question. And then the second one is just with regard to all these issues since the end of the quarter, have you seen any incremental changes in anything like \u2013 or COVID, are you seeing COVID volumes going down? Are you starting to see the use of temporary labor start to change? And are you seeing any kind of changes in the overall mix of your patients from a payer standpoint? Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure, Frank. So the percentage of our acute care admissions that had a COVID diagnosis during the third quarter was around 14%. Keep in mind that because the length of stay is probably, on average, about twice for a COVID patient than a non-COVID patient. That\u2019s something close to 30% of our patient days were represented by patients with a COVID diagnosis, so pretty significant impact. But as I indicated in my earlier remarks, we did have that same crowding up dynamic for most of the quarter. For most of the quarter, ER traffic, elective and scheduled procedures were really have recovered and rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, maybe a little above, maybe a little below. September, we saw some surgical and elective deflections and postponements. It feels like \u2013 and I don\u2019t have all the data, but it feels like we\u2019ve already recaptured a lot of that in October. So it doesn\u2019t feel like there is a real, sort of, permanent loss there. And again, in the sense, as I\u2019ve now said a few times, is COVID volumes have clearly been declining for the last 4, 5, 6 weeks. We\u2019re seeing some early indications of that leading to some also easing of the labor pressures, although again, I\u2019ll repeat what I\u2019ve also said again a number of times. I think there is a time lag there. And because a lot of these commitments \u2013 both that we make to nurses, traveling nurses and temporary nurses and that nurses make to other facilities have a sort of time lapse associated with them. We don\u2019t feel the impact of those declining COVID volumes on the labor pressures immediately. But we\u2019ve certainly seen the first early signs of it, and I think they\u2019ll certainly continue during the quarter if the COVID volumes continue to decline. Frank Morgan : And anything you would call out on surgery inpatient versus outpatient? Did you see any more impact on one versus the other? And I will hop. Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean \u2013 so when we talk about postponements and deferrals, they have tended to be on inpatient surgeries. Because the concern has always been, do we have enough beds if there is kind of an unexpected surge in COVID patients. I\u2019m sure that anecdotally, we canceled or postponed an outpatient surgery here or there. But for the most part, to the degree that there were postponements and deferrals, and I don\u2019t think there was a material amount of them in Q3, but to the degree there were, I think they were mostly in the inpatient area. Frank Morgan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bosch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. Ben Rossi : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You have Ben Rossi filling in for Matt here. Regarding payer mix, would you talk a little bit about utilization by payer across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid and whether you\u2019re seeing differences in acuity or utilization between them? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean the interesting thing, I think, is that payer mix has remained relatively stable during the pandemic. Obviously, there is some government assistance there. So first the program pays hospitals for uncompensated patients or patients who have COVID that are uninsured and that\u2019s been helpful to keep down uncompensated volumes and bad debt expense. We\u2019ve seen, I think, as most hospitals have reported, a shift in COVID patients in this most recent surge to a bit of a younger cohort, because I think such a large proportion of the Medicare age population has been vaccinated and because so many of the COVID patients now are unvaccinated, they tend to be younger and more patients in their 40s and 50s. They tend to be a little bit more commercial than Medicare. But again, honestly, I don\u2019t think the payer mix and \u2013 I mean the stability of the payer mix has been helpful. But the slight improvement in the payer mix is, in my mind, not what\u2019s driving the strong acute care results. It\u2019s the combination of the acuity, the reimbursement, etcetera, associated with the COVID patients, combined with the relative strength and recovery in the non-COVID volumes, I think has much more of an impact than actually a slightly improved payer mix. Ben Rossi : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please, go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Two quick questions here, I guess. First of all, the debt-to-EBITDA is down below 2x, which is, obviously, stands out in this sector to see someone dropping that low in leverage. Can you comment \u2013 I know you guys were active on the share repurchase in the quarter. As you\u2019re articulating that you think this is an unusual situation that converged to depressed results a little bit, especially on the behavioral side, and you see that turning around, any thought on doing anything even more aggressive in terms of share repurchase to take advantage of what sounds like, at least in your mind, hopefully a temporary pullback in the shares? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think it\u2019s worth noting, A.J., that our original guidance for the year and then even our revised guidance, we presume we\u2019d be repurchasing about $750 million worth of our stock pretty much ratably over Q2, Q3 and Q4. Through the end of Q3, we\u2019ve already repurchased over $750 million of stock for the reasons that we articulated in our opening comments. I suspect we will continue to be an active acquirer, particularly if there is any sort of weakness in any further weakness in the stock, etcetera. We remain pretty bullish on the prospects of both of the business segments and are very comfortable investing in our own shares, and I think we will continue to do so unless the dynamics change in some measurable way. A.J. Rice: Okay. There have been some discussion \u2013 obviously, you have the firepower to do it about the potential coming out of the pandemic to both on the acute and even potentially on the behavioral side, there might be increased deal opportunities as people look to maybe align with someone with deeper pockets on the acute side and then obviously not only acquisition, but JVs with acute care players on the behavioral side. Can you just comment on \u2013 have you seen any pickup in discussions or dialogue around any of that? And any reason to think you will see an accelerated pace coming out of the pandemic here? Steve Filton : Yes. And so on the acute side, I actually think in retrospect that the significant amount of infusion of government subsidies, reimbursement, mainly in the form of the CARES Act funds, has helped support not-for-profit hospitals that might have otherwise felt more financial duress during the pandemic. So, I don\u2019t think you are seeing a real robust deal flow of not-for-profit hospitals looking for an exit strategy or partner, etcetera. But there are deals that we are always looking at. I mean I highlighted in, again, my opening comments, we have done a couple of smaller deals like buying a micro hospital and specialty hospital in Las Vegas, continuing to invest in our freestanding emergency room development. And I would add that those freestanding emergency rooms have really performed very well. I think they have performed very well from the outset, but I think have done particularly well during the pandemic. There seems to be the willingness of patients to potentially get their care at a freestanding ED and feel somewhat safe or less threatened than they do in a large hospital emergency room. So, all of that\u2019s good stuff. I think on joint venture initiative side of behavioral, we didn\u2019t talk about it this quarter, but I think we mentioned last quarter that we have opened joint venture hospitals with acute care partners in Iowa, in Missouri this year. We are scheduled to open in the next few months in Michigan, in Wisconsin, our first behavioral hospital in Wisconsin. So, that deal flow of these joint venture opportunities continues. And I think \u2013 we think, is a source of significant growth for us. So, we will continue to pursue those. And then there are other deals out there in behavioral. I think we view it as an indication of the fundamental strength of the behavioral business that these deals attract a lot of interest, both from strategic players as well as financial sponsors. So, there can be pretty frothy auction processes. But we look at a lot of those as well and we will continue to do that. A.J. Rice: Alright. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jamie Perse : Hey, good morning Steve and Marc. I wanted to follow-up on some of the comments on the acute care side. It sounds like you said in a number of categories you are at or near pre-pandemic levels, and there wasn\u2019t a big crowding out from COVID this quarter. So, I wanted to dig into that a little bit. It does seem like adjusted admissions took a slight step back versus 2019 compared to the second quarter. So, where are you seeing some of these at or near pre-pandemic levels by setting or by category versus where are things still lagging a bit? Steve Filton : Yes. So, I do think Jamie, that the higher the COVID levels, the more challenging we are in sort of backfilling that non-COVID business. And to your point, I think we have less issues with that in the second quarter, which was probably our lowest COVID quarter certainly for several quarters than we did in the third quarter, which I think is probably our highest COVID quarter. And so that dynamic and I mentioned it before that even though we mostly ran at pre-pandemic levels, we did have some deferrals and postponement in \u2013 particularly in the September timeframe and particularly on the inpatient side. I think our point of view is that as COVID volumes decline, the demand for non-COVID activities will be able to backfill the sort of the loss of COVID with those non-COVID activities as long as the labor situation allows us to do that. I think again, in both of our business segments, I think we are more focused on our ability to meet the demand than whether the demand is really going to be there. We have every indication that demand for both business segments remain quite strong. Jamie Perse : Okay. Thanks for that. And just switching over to the behavioral side, you talked about the capping of bed capacity and the clinical and other labor as two components driving the \u2013 the pressure in the quarter. Just wondering if you can tease apart those two, I mean which was more impactful in the quarter. And more importantly, looking forward into 4Q is it fair to assume the first one, the bed capacity improves a little bit and the labor stays kind of where you are at? Just would love any thoughts on the progression of those two factors into the fourth quarter. Steve Filton : Sure. Well. Jamie, first, I would make a point that to a degree, although we sort of talk about these factors as being discrete and separate, they often sort of interplay on each other. So, when we have a COVID surge in a facility, we are likely to have more COVID patients. We are likely to have more of our employees who are either out with the virus or out because they have been exposed to the virus. And so \u2013 and whenever there is a COVID surge, we are going to face incremental challenges. And sometimes, we will say that we have capped the beds because we have got COVID patients and sometimes we say it\u2019s because we can\u2019t find enough staff. Often, it is both in a combined way. But again, as I think we have said multiple times, I think what we find and have found every time in the second quarter, I think it was reflective of this, that as the COVID volumes decline, both of those pressures tend to ease. But if I have to say one was more prevalent than the other, I would say that the labor shortage has been a more pervasive, impactful issue than the actual, sort of, isolation of the patient\u2019s issue. Jamie Perse : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Hi. Thanks. So, you guys rarely talk about your health plan, which I think is in Reno, maybe I am incorrect or your ACO. Are there any trends or developments, any changes in network coverage that we should be aware of? And I believe the performance of the MSSP ACO has been pretty strong in prior year. So, just wondering if this is something that you guys think differently about strategically, maybe more broadly across the portfolio? Steve Filton : Yes. Thanks Whit. It\u2019s a good question. I mean I think the reason that we don\u2019t specifically address our ACO activity, or the activity of our insurance plan, is because I think we view it as integrated very closely with the overall strategies of our hospitals in their markets. So, we don\u2019t operate the insurance plan anywhere where we don\u2019t have hospitals. We have some sort of accountable care organization in every acute care market in which we operate, in some cases, a majority equity ownership as in Las Vegas, in other cases, some equity ownership. But we view sort of an ACO strategy, sometimes the presence of a Medicare Advantage insurance product as integral to those markets. And I think they have been very helpful. And again, we don\u2019t really talk about our insurance company sort of as a separate entity because at the end of the day, it largely exists as sort of an adjacency or a corollary to the strength of our kind of fully integrated delivery network in a market and we tend to talk about the markets themselves rather than the individual components, same thing really with our freestanding EDs. We mentioned them today because I think it\u2019s a worthwhile. But for the most part, we view them again, as an integral component of a broader integrated network. Whit Mayo : Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And Steve, I think you recorded a few million dollars of the Kentucky Medicaid program in the quarter. Is that a prior period number? And then just maybe refresh us on expectations for CMS approval. And then maybe any comments around Texas DSH? Steve Filton : Yes. So, just to remind everyone, we recorded in the second quarter, $55 million of special Kentucky Medicaid reimbursement that was approved during that quarter. As the state did it\u2019s sort of final calculations, etcetera, we have realized that there was an additional $7 million to be recorded as part of that program, which went from July of 2020 to June of 2021. So, we have recorded that additional $7 million in Q3 that related to the previous state fiscal year program. We are expecting the state has applied for CMS approval for a similar program, which will cover the period from July of \u201821 to June of \u201822. We are expecting that program to be approved by CMS. We are expecting the benefit for our Kentucky hospitals to be something comparable to what we have recorded in the previous fiscal year. But we will wait to record that until the final CMS approval is granted. We are hoping and maybe expecting that, that will be before the end of the calendar year. But no guarantee of that, but we will record it when we get it. As far as district goes, I think that Texas DSH program will either \u2013 it\u2019s either going to continue for a period of time or will be replaced by a comparable program. And therefore, I think the amount of DSH dollars should not really change significantly going forward. Whit Mayo : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ralph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Excluding COVID Steve, do you think underlying acuity is still up? And I only ask because when I look at the absolute dollar of revenue per adjusted admission, it was up, but obviously, there is a lot more COVID this quarter. So, just interested in, I guess your thoughts on sort of core acuity and how you think about the pricing stack going into next year? Steve Filton : Yes. I think it\u2019s a reasonable point, Ralph. I mean I think what we have seen throughout the pandemic is that the lowest acuity procedure is that we would tend to have as part of our emergency room traffic, etcetera, with those that fell away early on and to a degree, I think remain those that have not returned. So, while I think the increase in acuity is driven mostly by the COVID patients themselves, I do think that when you look at the non-COVID cohort of patients, that acuity has also increased slightly. And I am not sure it\u2019s because we are seeing more acute procedures as much as we are seeing, sort of the absence of some of that really lower acuity stuff. And honestly, I am not sure we know exactly where that\u2019s gone, but it seems to have fallen away from the hospital emergency rooms. Ralph Giacobbe : Yes. Okay, fair enough. And then just maybe can you talk about the pricing backdrop with payers? Maybe remind us of the average rate increases you have been getting, I guess on the acute care side? And whether you would think you can sort of price up more going forward, given sort of just the labor and inflation dynamics. And I guess both for acute and even behavioral, we don\u2019t talk about it a lot on the behavioral side, but maybe if there is any leverage there, given the current circumstances? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean I think that our contractual managed care or insurance contractual activity has sort of continued at around the same levels. I would say our average price increases on the acute care side are in that sort of 4% to 6% range annually, on the behavioral side, 2% to 4%. And we have \u2013 I think specifically talked in previous quarters about having had some success on the behavioral side in getting some managed Medicaid contractual increases, in some cases, on contracts where we have not seen increases in multiple years, we continue to sort of work at that. But I don\u2019t envision that the managed care pricing dynamic has really changed a great deal during the pandemic or is likely to change significantly coming out of the pandemic. Ralph Giacobbe : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. I wanted to go back to paying premium in-site leading to record hiring. We sell out in our research tracking your shifts and bonus strategy. But are you saying that because of churn, the net headcount of site nurses isn\u2019t higher. So, we wouldn\u2019t see higher patients being served or bed openings in 4Q as a result of the strong 3Q hiring? And then bigger picture-wise, when you think about recruiting new grads into site as opposed to acute, do you think the hourly wage gap between those two segments has to shrink? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean again, I am going to make the point that I have made before. I mean I think that the COVID crisis has created an opportunity for nurses, both acute and behavioral nurses, to earn wage rates that are just beyond anything that has been previously comparable. Again, it sounds like you have done a lot of research, you know you are going to have to do a ton. But if you go online and look for nursing opportunities, you can see that there are nursing opportunities in which nurses can easily earn $10,000 a week working in a COVID environment. So, these are nurses who maybe are earning $70,000 or $80,000 a year, maybe $80,000 or $90,000 a year. But now they are earning at a rate of $500,000 a year. So, when you have those sort of opportunities, there is no way we can close that gap. That gap will be closed by the elimination of those opportunities. So, that I think is the issue. And again, I think the comment that we were making before, I was making before, is while we have hired a record number of \u2013 and not just nurses, by the way, this includes therapists and mental health tech, etcetera, we are seeing quite a bit of churn. And again, as you know, I mean I think the American labor force in general is seeing quite a bit of churn. Obviously, I think it\u2019s more exacerbated in healthcare in hospitals. But it is a bit of a dynamic that we are seeing across the labor landscape. So, we continue, in every market, we have always spent time making sure that our wages are competitive and performing compensation studies, etcetera. We are more attuned to that now and are doing it more frequently than we have ever had before. And we certainly acknowledge that. Particularly, we have got to be competitive with our peers, with other behavioral hospitals, etcetera. But behavioral nurse is always going to be able to make more money in an ICU setting in an ER setting than in a behavioral setting. Again, I have talked to many, many nurses, both acute and behavioral, over the years. And I think for the most part, they work where they work because they enjoy the patient care dynamics in the setting in which they work. And again, when there is a 10% or 20% pay differential, I think nurses can convince themselves that they want to work where they are happier. When there is a 400% or 500% differential that becomes a tougher argument to make. Sarah James : Okay. And then last question, can you speak to how we should think about cadence for \u201822, because some of your acute peers have been hinting at a back-end loading of \u201822 with some of the labor pressure lightening or COVID pressure lightening in the back half of the year. So, how should we think about UHS seasonality first half versus second half versus a normal year? Steve Filton : And again, Sarah, my apologies, but I think at the level of detail and precision that we are not prepared to talk about today. Not because we don\u2019t want to talk about it and we know how we are thinking about it, but because we don\u2019t know how to think about it just yet. Again, I think a lot of this is dependent on how the next few months unfold in terms of the COVID volumes and labor shortages. I think it\u2019s way too early to talk about cadence for 2022, at least from our perspective. To the degree our peers are comfortable doing that, more power too. Sarah James : Okay. Thank you very much. Steve Filton : Operator, are there any more questions? Operator : I am showing no further questions at this time. Steve Filton : Okay. We would like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking to everybody on our year-end call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Steve Filton. Please go ahead Steve Filton : Thank you, good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning, we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter ended December 31,2021. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections, and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the Company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3 for the fourth quarter of 2021.  After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule was included with the press release. Our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.95 for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, our operations continued to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of covid patients in December 2021, which peaked in January of 2022; the negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of increased labor scarcity issues, exacerbated by the large number of employees sideline by the virus itself, or quarantine due to exposure to the virus. In what was already a very tight labor market, these incremental labor challenges, in addition to pressuring our salary and wages expenses, also suppressed patient volumes and our acute care and behavioral health facilities while causing postponement of certain elective scheduled procedures at our acute care hospitals.  Our net cash generated from operating activities was $884 million during the full year of 2021, which includes the unfavorable impact of 695 million of Medicare accelerated payments that were received during 2020 and repaid to the government during 2021. We spent $856 million on capital expenditures during the full year of 2021, which includes the construction costs related to a new 170-bed acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada that is scheduled to be completed and open next month. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the year ended December 30th, 2021, as compared to 55 days during 2020. At December 31st, 2021, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization increased to 40.8% as compared to 37.9% at December 31st, 2020. As of December 31st, 2021, we had $854 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity, pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit this [Indiscernible].  In our acute care segment, our ambulatory care development continued in 2021.We currently have 18 operational freestanding emergency departments and partnerships with national third-party entities for further development of ambulatory surgery centers and home health operations in our existing markets. In conjunction with our ongoing development, of primary care physician networks. These initiatives are meant to create a more fulsome care delivery system in each of our markets. Our new hospital in Reno scheduled to open soon will enhance our statewide presence in Nevada. Bed tower projects, adding new capacities to hospitals in important markets are underway at Edinburg Regional Medical Center in south Texas, Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas and Inland Valley Medical Center in California. Planning is also underway on new acute care hospitals in West Henderson, Nevada, and Palm Beach Gardens in Florida. In our behavioral segment, two new De Novo joint venture hospitals opened in 2021 in Clive, Iowa and Cape Gerardo, Missouri. Marc D. Miller: Two more new hospitals have opened already in 2022 in Michigan, which is a partnership with Beaumont Health and Wisconsin. And another is scheduled to open later in the year in Arizona in partnership with HonorHealth. These Denova developments, along with an increased focus on outpatient development in telemedicine in our existing markets, is meant to also build out a more fulsome continuum of care in the behavioral segment as well. Steve Filton : In anticipation of a continued downward trajectory of COVID volumes from those experienced during recent surges, and relief from the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results; our Board of Directors authorized a $1.4 billion increase to our stock repurchase program. After the resumption of our share repurchase activity in the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of our shares during 2021, and close to $300 million more thus far in 2022. We currently have approximately $1.46 billion authorized for stock repurchases, after giving effect to the recent increase approved by our Board of Directors. Our 2022 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night's release, assumes that the negative impact of the COVID virus will diminish in 2022.  While the decline in actual COVID cases appears to be occurring rapidly, we believe the process of back stilling non - COVID cases and most importantly, the easing of workforce shortages, which dominated the healthcare landscape in 2021, will take place more gradually over the course of 2022. We have a host of active initiatives in place to increase the efficiency of recruitment and retention of our clinical staff. And also implementing innovative care models in recognition that certain changes to the healthcare staff in dynamic may last well beyond the decline in COVID cases. While the pace of recovery is difficult to predict, we remain confident in the fundamental underlying demand in both of our business segments. The early signs of which have already been emerging in the last few weeks. Marc and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I guess your guidance for this year looks like it has a margin degradation fee, talking a little bit about how you're looking for the margin outlook in both segments? Steve Filton : I think Kevin, as we the remarks, my opening remarks indicated. I think that's premised on the idea that the stabilization of the labor markets will be a more elongated process than the volume recovery. So, we have a notion that while or volumes and revenues will increase at a pretty decent pace in 2022. So, we'll salary expense, both the continued use of premium pay in the short run and then the underlying wage rate inflation. I think it's a bit of a trade-off. Obviously, we have hopes that we can do better and make more progress on the salary front than -- more quickly than our guidance has presumed, but I think at the moment that seems to be the most prudent outlook. Kevin Fischbeck : Are both segments seeing the same type of pressure or would you say one is seeing more of it and would you expect one division to kind of come out of this margin pressure earlier than the other? Steve Filton : I think we have made the point throughout the pandemic, that while both business segments see the impact of the labor shortage, it gets manifested in different ways. So, on the acute side, for the most part, we are able to fill most of our vacancies, but we have done so through the use of premium pay, significant amount of premium pay. As an example, I think we incurred about $120 million of premium pay in the acute division in Q4. Alternatively, on the behavioral side, I think we've only incurred about $25 or $30 million of premium pay expense for the full year. The bigger issue on the behavioral side has been just an absolute inability to fill some of those vacancies. And as a consequence, the labor shortage on the behavioral side really manifest itself on the volume side more so than in agile salary expense. And we expect that those -- both those dynamics continue into 2022, although they begin to recede as COVID volumes begin to recede. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Steve, can you walk us through the different growth outlooks between the segments for 2022 with respect to volume and price, and how much new store revenue it is contemplated in the guide? Steve Filton : Yeah. I think, Andrew, that the same-store growth in both segments, and sort of anticipated to be in the mid-single digits and that sort of 5% to 6% range, which quite frankly in a normal year would be relatively unremarkable. I think on the acute side, that's kind of a mix shift away from higher acuity COVID volumes, and more towards, again a backfilling of all this non-COVID activity, which has lagged somewhat. We've been running at levels that are 95% to a 100% of pre - COVID levels of emergency room visits, and elective, and scheduled procedures, etc. We presume that those percentages will increase in 2022 as COVID volumes decline. But overall, the impact on revenue mid-single digits and again, sort of hearkening back to Kevin's first question to the increase in salary costs outpacing that a little bit on the behavioral side, our volumes have been flattering in Q4 our patient days, I think we're relatively fat, compared to the previous year's Q4. I think we're assuming again that same mid-single-digit revenue growth.  But more of it coming from an actual increase in patient days rather than any sort of patient shift mix. As far as the amount of revenue growth that's coming from non-same-store. I think it's a couple of percentage points, and Marc ticked off, I think a lot of the major additions in the two business segments that are driving that. Andrew Mok : Great. And then as a follow-up, you did about $320 million of EBITDA in the [Indiscernible] business, but there are few out-of-period payments even beyond Kentucky, I think there might have been some $s from Florida there. So how did the core behavioral business perform in the quarter and is that a good run rate to think about for 2022? Thanks. Steve Filton : We called out the Kentucky Medicaid reimbursement, which was a little over $30 million in the quarter, because I think we thought that was one really extraordinary item in the quarter. There were other one-time [Indiscernible], but I think they largely offset each other. I will say this about Kentucky. We recorded $30 million roughly of Kentucky reimbursement in the fourth quarter. That represented two quarters of earned activity. In 2022, that reimbursement has already been approved for the full year. So, there will be a much more ratable recognition of being roughly $55 million or $60 million of that Kentucky reimbursement in '22. And that's included in our guidance. But other than the Kentucky item, I think we purposely did not highlight anything else in the quarter because we generally felt like they were offsetting puts and takes. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J. Rice: Hi, thanks everyone. First of all, just maybe looking at the pace of the share repurchase activity rounding $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. You're generating good cash flow, particularly as now you get past the repayments to the feds. But that still is probably a faster pace than you're generating free cash flow. Can you just comment, do you think you'll continue at that pace? And then also, I assume if you do that the leverage will tick up over the course of this year. How -- I mean, you ended at 2.2 times debt to EBITDA. How much are you willing to let leverage sort of creep back up to fund the repurchase? Steve Filton : Sure, A.J. So, as you indicated, we repurchased about $1.2 billion of shares in 2021. That was over the course of just three quarters, since we didn't resume our share repurchase activity until April. If we continue with that pace, we will be repurchasing somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion, which is the amount of share repurchase authorization increase that our Board granted yesterday. And that's our plan and that, quite frankly, is what's in our guidance. Obviously, we're doing this on an opportunistic basis, as we have historically done. So, we are leaving ourselves the flexibility to respond to market conditions and other capital deployment opportunities, etc. But our current plan is pretty much as the board authorization increase would indicate over the course of the next year and to your point, it would certainly we'd be buying back shares at a pace above our free cash flow generation. So, our leverage, we'd go from approximately the low 2's, 2.1, 2.2 at the end of 2021 to the high twos of 2.7, 2.8 at the end of 2022. Marc D.Miller: I'll just make the point, I mean, we're very comfortable with that if the stock remains undervalued and that's the calculation that we've made. So, depending on where the stock is, this we believe is the right amount at this time, certainly at this level of our share price. A.J. Rice: No, that's great. I think Gerald is obviously, I appreciate that. Maybe my follow-up question. We all see about geography were there any differences? And I will ask you that again about the acute business where we usually asked. But I would also ask in the dynamics, you're seeing in the behavioral business, is the labor challenges particularly acute in specific geographies where for some reason you have a little more of a challenge than in other geographies. So, anything about the geography, despair differences across regions for both sides of the business. Steve Filton : The way that I would answer the question, A.J., is first by saying that I think what we have experienced, certainly in the most recent, I'll call it six to eight months, is that the most significant labor pressures are closely correlated to the level of COVID frequency in the market. Markets that are hard hit by COVID clearly feel greater labor pressures for a variety of reasons. Particularly with Omicron, more of our own employees out sick, etc., and on the sideline. But also, employees are leaving in -- particularly in the behavioral space to work for premium rates and more acute settings, all that sort of thing. And I think what we have found in the last few surges again, at least with the back half of '21 and into '22, is that those surges have been pretty widespread geographically. Obviously, at any point in time, we may be getting hit in one market worse than another. But I would say broadly, the performance is pretty geographically diffused. Although from a tiny perspective, one market maybe under pressure one month and not so much in the next month. But it's really much more COVID related than any other sort of underlying geographic issues. A.J. Rice: Alright, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Matthew\ufeff Borsch: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You have Ben Rossi filling in for Matt here. regarding patient acuity on a same facility basis, you reported some good numbers for adjusted admissions, revenue per adjusted mission will also showing some sequential decreases in overall occupancy rates and length of stay in both acute and behavioral. Just curious if that is a reflection of the type of security caseload you saw this quarter and whether that trend is continuing in 1Q? Thanks. Steve Filton : Look, acuity is really an issue in the acute care segment. Not in the behavioral segment in the sense that, reimbursement doesn't change an also, acuity basis for the most part in the behavioral segment, I think on the -- in the acute segment, what we have largely experienced during the COVID surge is, in 2021, is that as COVID has surged, acuity goes up, the COVID patients are sicker. But for the most part, we've been able to maintain a reasonable level of non COVID business as well, which has really led to these really high acuity and revenue rates and the acute business, which for the most part, have overwhelmed or, offset the higher salary costs, which we alluded to earlier. That became more challenging, I indicated in the fourth quarter, we had about $120 million of premium pay in the acute business. That's the highest we've experienced today compared to just sequentially, I think we had around $83 million in third quarter of this year, and I think we had about a little over $50 million in the fourth quarter of last year.  So, gives you an indication of how much that premium pay has really pressured the margins in the acute business. I think the other dynamic that we've noticed or has been noticeable in the acute space, is that the Omicron patients, as has been reported, I think we are more broadly, are less acutely ill than the Delta patients before them. The problem is, I don't know that we've been really able to take advantage of that. You make the point that I would like to stay is remaining pretty stable. I think in theory, we should have been able to discharge some of those Omicron patients more quickly. The challenges as we try and discharge those patients, the sites to which we would normally discharge them long-term care, skilled nursing homes, home health are struggling with their own labor challenges and as a consequence, we haven't really seen the benefit of being able to discharge the less acutely ill patients faster. Again, I think all of that will tend to work itself out as COVID volumes declined will return to a more stable referral network and discharge pattern that's more reflective of what we historically been used been used to. Matthew\ufeff Borsch: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi. Jason Cassorla : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, you talked about volume and labor backdrop largely improving throughout the year. But is there any way to help frame the cadence for an EBITDA perspective. I mean, if you look back, you did about 425 million of EBITDA in 1Q '21. Is that the right bogey to think about 1Q, or maybe how you would frame that? Thanks. Steve Filton : So, look the UHS intentionally has never given quarterly guidance, and we're certainly not about to begin that this year, when there's greater uncertainty and is historically the case. We're looking at a cadence that is certainly not what it has been historic norm. Normally, the first quarter is our strongest quarter, we come out of the gate really strong in both business segments, etc. This year we come out of the gate with our highest COVID volumes to-date in the pandemic, now they decline pretty quickly and have been declining, and continue to decline and that's encouraging. but as I've alluded to in some previous comments, the labor pressures are declining more slowly, etc. I think broadly, we've tried to indicate that I think we think the first half of 2022 will certainly be more challenging, as labor pressures diminish more slowly than COVID volumes decline. I think the second half of 2022, we'll begin to look a lot more electric pre -pandemic year like the back-half of 2019 might have looked. Jason Cassorla : Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just go to your CapEx guidance, so CapEx at the midpoint just call like a 20% increase over '21, and where you ended up spending there. You made some comments in your prepared remarks amount from new towers, acute facilities in the like, but maybe could you just help flush out your CapEx priorities for both segments and where you're looking to invest those $s for '22? Thanks. Steve Filton : As Mark commented on in his remarks -- and I think also as we can see on to a response earlier, I think what really informs our whole approach in terms of what we're dedicating to share repurchase, and what we're dedicating to CapEx, etc. It's our view that the underlying demand fundamentally in our two business segments remains strong, and so from a CapEx perspective, we're going to invest in projects that we think make sense and are economically compelling. Marc alluded to our De Novo development in Reno. We have small community hospital in Reno, but this really, I think will position us as a much more competitive player in the Reno market, but even more broadly as the preeminent statewide player in the state of Nevada. Same thing, South Texas is an important market to us Riverside County, California. We've invested both in physical capital, we acquired a significant physician practice in the Southern California market.  So, we like our franchises in both our acute and behavioral segments, and we're continuing to reinvest in those. And then again, as Marc pointed out, we have a view that we think, and we understand why, but those investments and that underlying the strength of the underlying demand is somewhat unappreciated in the market. And while that's the case, we also intend to be an active acquirer of our shares, which we think are really well valued at this point in time. Jason Cassorla : All right, thanks for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning, guys, thanks for taking my questions. On the acute side, in the script, you quantified, referring to Kevin's question, you quantified about a $120 million of premium pay in fourth quarter. How did that track versus 3Q and sort of you for all of 2021? And if we think about converting that to us or more than normalized level, how much was premium pay costing versus normal full-time employee in the fourth-quarter? Steve Filton : Yes. So, I think actually mentioned Pito that a 120 million in Q4 compared to that 80 million in the previous quarter in Q3. And a little over 50 million in fourth quarter of last year. And the point that you raised is a good one, honestly, the rise in that expense is I think driven more by rate than by volume, meaning we're not necessarily using more nurses, more hours. We're using some greater number, but the rates are just going crazy as I think has been written about and then considered reported on broadly across the countries. So normally, I would say to you that we'd replace premium pay temporary traveling nurses with our own employed nurses who would make 50% less or something like that, but I think in some cases, we're able, however you want to look at it, either we're paying three times more for a temporary traveling nurse who would work for a base pay, or if we can replace that nurse with an employee, we'll be paying a third, the difference is quite significant. Pito Chickering : Having you seen the premium pay begin to reflect at all in those [Indiscernible] the year, but any color in terms of stakes and fees, where you're seeing on the hourly wage rates for those now as it was well as the hours you guys are using? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, look, I've made the point that the decline in COVID volumes has really been occurring on a really short period of time at this point. I mean, it was only in the latter half of January that we started to see those declines. So, we're into this for four or five weeks. And I think as the surge really worsened, hospitals were making longer term commitments to these nurses. We were making some longer-term commitments, but I think the other piece to this is that nurses themselves were making longer term commitments. Even if we weren't, they might have been making longer term commitments with others. The other issue is that nurses have made a lot of money. Those who had sort these premium rates in the last six or eight months. And as a consequence, I think they have some greater flexibility. And so, what we're seeing is that, some nurses are taking some time off, etc, before they return to work. And they are thoroughly entitled to that. But I think all those reasons are why I think it takes some time. So, I would say to you that I think we've seen -- again, as my remarks have indicated, we've definitely seen encouraging signs of volume recovery in both business segments in the last four or five weeks. I would say we've seen the earliest signs of labor pressures easing, but I think we've got a long way to go on the labor side. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great and then one quick follow-up there on the behavioral side is look at 2021. How much were revenues impacted by the lack of staffing? And how do you think that evolves in 2022? Do you think you can recapture for those loss behavioral being able to revenues in 2022 from staffing? Thanks so much. Steve Filton : As we've indicated, I think on a number of occasions, we think the single biggest reason that behavioral volumes and therefore behavioral revenues have lagged pre -pandemic levels, is the labor shortage. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the COVID volumes, and again, the idea that some subset of our employee population has been seeking these premium rates in a more acute setting. And by the way, as that's desired compel, and talking to colleagues and other service industries, etc., it's a pretty standard and widespread phenomena in any sub-acute setting, nursing homes, home health agencies, skilled nursing, long-term care facilities, are all saying the same thing. And as I indicated in the previous response, we're finding that on the acute side to be true because as we're trying to discharge patients, we're being told by all these sorts of facilities that they simply don't have the capacity because of a lack of staff.  So, the question about how do you quantify what the loss revenue is, it's difficult to do. What we have said before is that every indication we have of underlying demand it doesn't it's continued to grow. I would say the last several quarters, is our inbound activity, incoming phone calls, incoming Internet inquiries, etc, are up 15% or 20%. I don't think we've taken the position that we could satisfy all that demand. But there is certainly a significant amount of demand out there to be satisfied. And again, I think our guidance presumes sort of mid-single-digit revenue growth, which gets us back to sort of three or 4% volume growth just over the prior year. We certainly don't think that's the top end of the potential growth in volume. But we'd be pleased if so, we can get there and if the labor situation resolves as soon as we get there. Pito Chickering : Great thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Jamie Perse : Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to start with the Revenue per Adjusted Admission, if you can give any color on assumptions for 2022, and we're obviously way above the 2019 trended growth line. What's sustainable about that versus as things start to normalize in terms of payer mix and acuity? That's starting to come back down. Steve Filton : So, Jamie, I think the answer again is different in the two business segments. I think in the acute care segment, there certainly is an expectation that revenue per adjusted admission will come down from the very high levels, as there has been running particularly during the high COVID surges. But we believe that that will be replaced in large part by non COVID -- more traditional non COVID, surgical and other procedural admissions that have lagged, some during the pandemic. I'll also make the point that as that business mix shift occurs some of the cost pressures will alleviate as well because while the COVID patients had very robust revenue, they also had very high expenses generally, more ICU utilization, more supply utilization, all that sort of stuff, on the behavioral side there's not nearly, I think as big a shift or change in acuity, I will make the point just because I had this question last night. It looks like our revenue per adjusted day in the 4th quarter is quite high in the behavioral segment.  But if you would just [Indiscernible] the Kentucky reimbursement that we talked about earlier, I think you get to a much more historically looking reasonable number. Again, I think on the behavioral side, the general sense is that, as the labor situation eases, we'll simply be able to admit more patients. Patient days will grow over the previous year instead of a flat patient day, for instance, that we saw in Q4. Jamie Perse : Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up on longer-term margin expectations. It seems like there might be a lot of temporary costs in your cost structure for '22, in terms of premium pay and things like that. How should we think about the longer-term margin expectations? Can you get back to 2019 levels in a couple of years or as things start to normalize, or just any thoughts you can share on where things go after this, maybe transition here? Marc D. Miller: And again, I think we've said a number of times. I don't believe we feel like the fundamental economic model in either of our business segments has changed. Meaning, what the historical model has been is that if you can achieve revenue growth in the mid-single digits generally, you're going to see EBITDA growth and margin expansion over time. As you characterize it, I think we're viewing 2022 as a bit of a transition year, particularly the first half of 2022, that as volumes recover those labor pressures are not going to ease as near, as quickly and therefore we're going to see some margin compression at least in the first half of 2022. But I think over time we have an expectation that the models will work as they have worked in the past. And if we can achieve mid-single-digit growth, maybe inflation that's particularly wage inflation has increased by 100,125 basis points post-pandemic. But the model hasn't been turned upside down. And as a consequence, if that underlying demand is out there and there's been a significant amount of on-net postponed deferred demand in both of the business segments over the last several years which we firmly believe, then I think revenue growth -- I think beginning again towards the end of 2022 should be relatively robust. We should see EBITDA growth; we should see margin expansion after we get over these labor pressures and it'll look like the way it was. Can we get back to 2019 margins? The answer I think is yes, the question is how quickly. We're certainly not going to get back there in a year, but we certainly believe that we can get back there and go beyond that quite frankly. Jamie Perse : Okay. Thanks for the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the comments you both, you and Mark made on the outpatient development. And I'm curious what types of facilities do you think are most useful to UHS in the next couple of years? I'm thinking more specifically in the acute care segment. And maybe how does that outpatient development work in the broader segment strategy for the acute care segment? Marc D. Miller: Well, I think it's -- I mean, there's a lot of areas that we're looking at, specifically, freestanding emergency departments. We have had a lot of success with that and we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities on the FED that I think are going to be very positive as a standalone business, as well as what they can refer into the acute care hospitals. On top of that, we're doing a lot more work with physician clinics. And again, being able to open and drive business from those clinics in some part to the hospitals. And we see a lot of opportunity in a number of our markets. We had a significant acquisition in California earlier, I guess a few months ago, with a large physician group, which we had been working with for many years, but acquiring them now. And just increasing the synergies and the things that we're able to do with them, as an owner of the practice. That's been a little bit in Lightning to us. And so, we are looking for more opportunities there. In addition to that, I would say the traditional outpatient radiology services as well as surgical hospitals. It's been a little bit tougher for us to get deals that we like on the ASC front. But we are currently evaluating probably in all or just about all of our acute care markets right now. We've partnered with a large surgery center Company to do that for the last couple of years. And so, I think we're going to gain more traction with that as we go forward in the next three to four quarters certainly. Josh Raskin : And just to follow up on that Mark then the ASCs. I'm curious how you think about that shift from inpatient to outpatient care and how important you think that versus the what sounds like maybe not the most rational market, I don't want put words in your mouth, but it sounds like it's more of a pricing issue than a strategy issue; is that right? Marc D. Miller: Yes. I mean, as far as I look at it -- look, it's definitely a trend. It's definitely something that we're very cognizant of. As far as the desire to move certain business out of the inpatient setting to outpatient. And that's driven by the insurers and for a number of reasons, I'm not sure I categorize it the way you said, but I do think we have great opportunities to not only partner and create new outpatient surgery centered businesses that are advantageous on their own, but also to decamp some of the business that is taking up space in our inpatient settings and then have higher acuity, higher-paying business replaced that lower-end outpatient business. Josh Raskin : Got you. That's perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Hey, good morning. It's Austin on for Justin here. Steve, I was just curious on the full year, if you can maybe emphasize or give some color on the impact of the direct COVID reimbursement programs, the benefit from sequestration, that 20% bump and HRSA. And then, what is embedded in the assumption for '22 related to those programs? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, we've disclosed the impact of sequestration waiver and the Hersha reimbursement and the 20% add-on. I think historically, the last few quarters have been running in the sort of $30 million plus or minus mid-range. We've -- the way we've incorporated that in our projections or guidance for 2022 is based on the current knowledge the medicare waiver lapses in the first half of the year. The public health emergency which drives the 20% add-on, I think it lapses. And early in the second quarter, the Hersom money it seem to be running out. So, we've assumed all that. Again, the tricky part of this is, it looks like -- and this will be the thing. I mean, that reimbursement will largely tail off as the COVID volumes tail off. A month or two ago, we were concerned that maybe we'd be facing significant COVID volumes and the loss of that extra reimbursement. But it appears that the two will sink up more naturally. But yes, we've assumed those things go away relatively for the most part of the first half of the year. Again, that's things off with guidance which presumes that our overall COVID volumes go down in the first half of the year, that the expenses associated the really high expenses with those COVID patients go down, etc. So that it's really not a significant drag on our earnings. Justin Lake : Awesome. And maybe just a quick follow-up there, just curious maybe on a percent basis where COVID admissions that trended early in Omicron, where they're settling out here. And then maybe for the full year, is there a given range that you guys are assuming COVID volumes to continue to run out? Steve Filton : Yes. During the COVID surges, I think at the height of the COVID surges, on the acute side, I would say somewhere in the 15% of our admissions were COVID related during the Delta surge, and the Omicron surge, etc. And because the length of stay of the COVID patients is about twice of what our average length of stay is, our COVID patients were taking off one-third of our beds across the portfolio, and again, during the surges. So, it was a significant number. I think the assumptions that we've made for particularly the back half of So, 2022 is that will be in those kind of has been described endemic environment in which something like 3% to 5% of our acute admissions will be COVID-related and probably less acutely yield than we've seen in some of the earlier surgeons. Justin Lake : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with SVB Leerink. Whit Mayo : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I haven't heard about Cygnet or your U.K. operations and sometimes, so was hoping maybe to get an update. And I think that the broader question and maybe this is framed more for markets, just thinking about a broader portfolio review for behavioral. I mean, at some point does it make sense to get smaller, to get bigger? And maybe making some decisions during the pandemic is ill advised, but just any update strategically, operationally, anything that you guys are deploying internally, that's different this year that gets you excited that we should be probably paying more attention to. Marc D. Miller: I mean, I will start with the portfolio review. I mean, we do that all the time. And I will tell you, we've really done that during the last few years, during COVID. And to your point, we have scaled down a few places, some operations, a couple of leased facilities, and a couple of others where we just saw those changes in those markets. They weren't big players in the portfolio and we've jettison them. We should we continue to look to pare down if possible, wanted the same time. We're doing a lot to grow the division as well. So, we're trying to always improve the assets. One of the comments I'll make is our JV opportunities on the behavioral side continue to be robust. And I wanted to just make the point on that, all JV opportunities and all JV partners are not created equal. So, there are a lot of JV opportunities, situations that we look at, that we pass on, that others do, because we just don't see the merit of long term.  If you notice the ones that we do for the most part are recognizable nationally, no names, or they're very strong regional players, and that's purposely done. So, we're very excited when you say what could we offer as far as getting you all excited. We -- and Steve 's already mentioned this but, with the demand being where it is, we're very excited that when we get the staffing stabilized, and it is stabilizing, and it will continue to stabilize throughout this year, we should be able to pop because we know we track. Every week, we're talking very specifically about which beds are close due to staffing, due to COVID. And as we see that start to turn and it's already starting to turn, that's all upside for us. In regards to Signet, Signet's really been a terrific hedge for us. They are growing. There are a number. I speak with them very often. Weekly, in fact, our team over there is very strong, they are competing quite well against historical. In fact, larger players in that market. We're competing much, much better than we have in the past. Others are having some hiccups. So, we're very excited. The list of opportunities just in the U.K., is incredibly impressive. And along with that, we will look at things outside the UK, they present and we think they make sense but right now, we have a number of areas just within the U.K. that we think we can add beds, either to existing facilities or some new facilities. In our relationship with the NHS has never been stronger, so we're quite positive about that business and where it's going to go going forward. Whit Mayo : Great. That's helpful. Maybe just one quick follow-up for Steve. If you could maybe give an update on what you're contemplating for Texas [Indiscernible] UCC, as this program presumably will continue now and your 10-K has an update that there's -- I guess you guys expect $391 million from state supplemental payments and that number hasn't historically been that reliable. So, I guess I'm just trying to make sure that we're thinking about any of the major puts and takes with some of the state supplemental programs this year. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So first of all, I'll make a few broad comments, you alluded to in 10-K, which was filed last May. I do think UHS has a rather expansive disclosure on these state programs. So, people are really interesting the details. I would suggest that they spend some time reading our 10-K disclosure on this subject because I think it is rather informative. Broadly as it regards Texas, there are a couple of different programs in Texas. I think the one that is sort of most uncertain at the moment is the directed payment program, which the state and CMS are sort of into skewed over. We had about $12 million or $13 million of reimbursement related to that program, which we did not recognize in the last four months of 2021, although we remain hopeful that it will be approved and we'll wind up getting recognized retroactively in 2022. The uncompensated care program, which people have expressed some concerns over etc, looks like it is moving forward.  The next starting payment is actually scheduled to occur within the next week or two. I just saw communications in that regard from the HHS of the Health Department in Texas. So, it seems like that's moving forward. I'll finally make one last comment. Look, there is some choppiness associated with these state reimbursement programs. We tend to be conservative about how we account for them, tending to wait until they're approved either in the state and or the federal levels, and sometimes, that means that we're not recording the income or revenues rapidly. But if you look at the trends over time, the trajectory of those programs tends to be increased. And then I think they are because the hospitals really rely on these programs, and a lot of the hospitals that rely on these programs are safety net hospitals within each of the states, etc. And so, the program's really become an important part of both state and federal funding.  So yeah, there is some uncertainty and some volatility in how these things get recorded, but I think our general sense is that the programs will remain at or equal to historical levels. Again, with the one exception that I would know -- we didn't really get into it in detail, but we recorded on the Kentucky reimbursement, essentially 18 months worth of reimbursement in 2021. So in other words, six months or the reimbursement that we recorded really related to the last half of 2020. So that's a bit of a headwind going into 2022 because we will only record 12 months of Kentucky reimbursement in 2022. But that's clearly baked into our guidance. Whit Mayo : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Sarah James with Barclays. Sarah James : Thank you for squeezing me on. When you talked earlier about getting back to the pre - '19 margins, how much of that is cost control versus more of a change in the rate environment? Steve Filton : Honestly, Sarah, I think that the real driver, as I think Mark and I both alluded to, is volume recovery. Look, we're certainly looking at cost controls. And I think cost controls focused on the elimination of this really expensive labor component that we've been incurring for the last -- during the pandemic. But again, I don't think we anticipate sort of ringing efficiencies out of the business in order to get back to those margins. What I was saying before is, we're going to get back to this model of mid-single-digit revenue growth. And if you combine that with efficient operations, which we have historically always had that I think you sort of get back to that model, but no, I don't think where either cost cutting our way back to 2019 margins, nor getting there for some extraordinary rate increase. Although, we would hope that both from our government and commercial payers over the next year or two, there's more and more recognition of the inflationary pressures on labor and other costs. Sarah James : That's helpful. As you think about that recognition across your different types of payers. How do you think about the timing of that? Like which would Medicare act first or -- when you think about Medicare, Medicaid and the private payers, where do you think their recognition could start? Steve Filton : It's a great question, Sarah. And obviously, from a Medicare and Medicaid perspective, that's largely out of our control, meaning, there are bigger forces, bigger lobbying groups, both at the federal and state level. We're active participants in those groups, so we're not driving that. But again, I think the inflationary pressures put the not-for-profit hospitals in particular, at a disadvantage. And so there will be great pressure on that. As far as the commercial payers, we have a much more active role there, and I think we're playing that active role and pressing more and more of our payers for what we believe to be reasonable rate [Indiscernible]. And then if we don't get them, I think we're more willing today than we have been in some time, terminate contracts, to walk away from business that doesn't have a reasonable reimbursement rate. Sarah James : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the conference back over for any closing remarks. Steve Filton : We'd just like to thank everybody for their participation and look forward to talking again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you all for joining today's meeting. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Thank you, Mary. Good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022.  During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.  We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.02 for the first quarter of 2022. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the Supplemental Schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.15 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022.  During the first quarter of 2022, our operations continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as pressures on staffing and wage rates. Specifically a surge in patients with the Omicron variant of the virus, which began in December of 2021, tended to peak in most of our geographies in January of 2022. In our acute segment, we would note, in general, the Omicron patients were less acutely ill than the COVID patients treated in previous surges and thus display lower acuity.  Meanwhile, the amount of contract nursing hours used, and even more importantly, the rate we had to pay for those hours, increased significantly in the first quarter, both on a sequential basis as well as a year-to-year -- in a year-to-year comparison. Although in our behavioral segment contract nursing cost did not increase quite as dramatically, our inability to fit all of our labor -- to fill all of our labor vacancies had a notable limiting impact on our patient volumes and related revenues. We do note that our results were benefited in the first quarter from approximately $12 million of revenues net of related provider taxes from special Texas Medicaid reimbursements, which related to the last 4 months of 2021. Recognition of those revenues were deferred until formal government approval was obtained.  Our first quarter also included approximately $15 million of startup losses incurred by recently opened de novo acute and behavioral health facilities and $6 million of losses related to temporarily closed beds at 2 behavioral health facilities, which were impacted by natural disasters. Those beds have since been reopened. As disclosed in our last night's press release, our operating results for the first quarter of 2022 were unfavorably impacted by labor costs that were higher than anticipated and patient volumes at our behavioral health facilities that were lower than anticipated due to the continued uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as cost escalations related to the nationwide shortage of nurses and other clinical staff. Although we're not changing our previously released 2022 operating results forecast at this time, we may make reductions to our forecast at a future date if the unfavorable operating trends experienced during the first quarter of 2022 do not improve. Our cash generated from operating activities was $445 million during the first quarter of 2022 as compared to $72 million during the same period in 2021. We note that first quarter 2021 cash generation reflected the repayment of the Medicare accelerated payments. We spent $200 million of capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2022, our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 48 days during the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 50 days in the first quarter of 2021.  Due in large part to the continued repurchasing of our shares at March 31, 2022, our ratio of debt to total capitalization increased to 42.3% as compared to 35.7% at March 31, 2021. Marc Miller : Our first quarter 2022 operating results were behind our internal forecasts, and our internal forecasts were below the consensus estimates. The primary driver of the shortfall was the fact that the labor scarcity has not moderated as quickly as we were expecting. We believe, in part, this is because at the height of the Omicron surge, providers were entering into longer-term commitments for temporary or traveling nurses, not necessarily predicting that COVID volumes would decline as rapidly as they ultimately did. We do believe that the demand for this premium-priced labor will continue to gradually decline. In the meantime, we continue to invest heavily in recruitment and retention initiatives and have substantially increased the pace of our hiring. Where appropriate, we are also developing alternative patient care models that allow us to use a wider variety of available caregivers to render the most efficient and highest quality of care that we can. While the pace of the recovery from the current labor scarcity is still uncertain, we're comfortable that it will occur over time and combined with our confidence in the long-term baseline demand in both of our business segments, our bullish view of the underlying strength of our core businesses remains intact. Reflective of that sentiment, we remained an active acquirer of our own shares in the first quarter, repurchasing $350 million of those shares. At the same time, we continue to reinvest organically opening the new acute care hospital in the Reno market and behavioral de novo and/or joint venture hospitals in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin. At this time, we're pleased to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Marco Criscuolo : This is actually Marco on for Josh. Just to start with the behavioral side, it looks like volumes came in below expectations due to the continued capacity constraints. So I wanted to get your view what is the ultimate solution to attracting more staff to meet the strong underlying demand you're speaking about. I mean it doesn't sound like raising base wages is enough at this point. Or do you think this is just more of a structural impediment in behavioral care for the foreseeable future? Steve Filton : Yes. So we've talked about this at some length before. I think the solution and -- as I think our prepared remarks indicated, we don't think this problem gets solved overnight, but we do believe it will continue to gradually improve. Number one, I think the market dynamics -- and we've been through nursing shortages before in our tenure, although this one is certainly probably more severe than anything we previously experienced. But the system will generate more nurses and other clinical personnel because wages are going up and will become a more attractive profession. And that supply of newer nurses will be helpful. At the same time, and Marc alluded to this in his remarks, we've really upped our investment in recruitment and hiring initiatives, the number of people involved in those processes making sure that our wage structures in every market are as competitive as they can be. We're reviewing competitive wage rates in most markets, multiple times a year, whereas historically that's a process that took place maybe once every year, once every other year. We're changing patient care models, even Marc referred to that as well.  And again, we're seeing the beginnings of improvement in those areas. So you specifically were asking about behavioral. I think we've been on the behavioral side of things, hiring nurses and other clinicians at record rates now for -- record historical rates for us for well over 6 or 8 months. The real challenge is on the back end, where the turnover rates continue to go up and that's the challenge that I think providers around the country are facing. But I think the encouraging thing for us is at least in the last few periods, our net hires are actually positive. Now again, I don't mean to imply that the problem has been solved, but I think we think it will continue to get better. And as we continue to have net positive hires, it should allow us to treat more patients and that patient day number, which was slightly negative in Q1 compared to last year, should turn positive in the near future, that would be the whole and continue to improve from there because, again, as I think Marc indicated in his prepared comments, we believe the underlying demand is there. We believe that for a long time, not really -- that quarterly has not changed at all. Operator : We have a question from Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Benjamin Rossi : You have Ben Rossi here filling in for Matt. Just regarding the recent release of the Medicare IPPS proposal contract for 2023, I can appreciate that there are still some moving pieces, but I was curious if you could provide us with the projection for your rates from that proposal. And then more broadly, how you feel about CMS factoring this inflationary pressure? And whether you think that CMS will start to factor that in more accurately as we look out to 2024 and beyond? Steve Filton : Yes. So as you suggest, there are a number of moving parts in the release When we do the calculation for the best of our ability, we think that the net blended increase for UHS hospitals will be about 2.5%. That is pretty much the number that we included in our guidance for the year, beginning in October, which is the beginning of the federal fiscal year.  I think, along with the rest of the hospital industry, we were disappointed that Medicare and CMS did not seem to acknowledge the inflationary pressures and particularly the labor inflation the hospitals across the country are experiencing. I suspect that in this period between the preliminary and final rates, Medicare will come under significant pressure from lobbying groups across the country, representing hospitals of all stripes and sizes.  Now to your question, what impact will that have on CMS this year or next year? It's hard to know. But we certainly had feedback both I think formally and informally from peers, both for-profit and not-for-profit peers, both in our markets and in other markets across the country that hospitals are struggling, again, particularly on the labor side. And certainly, they will be making Medicare and CMS aware of that as acutely as they can over the course of the next week to few weeks and months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok from UBS. Andrew Mok : Steve, can you provide more detail for how labor expenses trended in the quarter relative to internal expectations in each of the segments? And exiting the quarter and into April, what level of improvement have you seen in contract labor rates? What are the expectations there for the balance of the year? Steve Filton : Yes. So the cadence of the year so far, Andrew, obviously, January still had very high Omicron volumes in many of our geographies. In some of those geographies, the Omicron volumes really didn't recede until the end of January, in some cases, even early February. And so labor was definitely an overarching issue on the first, I'll call it, 4 to 6 weeks of the quarter. I think what was disappointing in terms of our expectations was that the labor scarcity, again, I think we said this in our prepared remarks, did not recede or ease as much as we thought in the final 6 to 8 weeks of the quarter as COVID volumes receded relatively rapidly. And again, I think as Marc alluded to in his comments, we think some of that was that hospitals were making longer-term commitments. I know a number of our commitments to temporary or traveling nurses instead of being for 1 week or 4 weeks where in many cases, for 8 or even 13 weeks, and we've certainly heard of other hospitals making commitments for even longer than that. And so to some degree, I think we found labor issues to be kind of stickier and more difficult to navigate in the back half of the quarter than we were expecting. I also think it's complicated when you have a tight labor situation in March and April, going through Spring break and the Easter and Passover holidays and people, I think, resuming their normal kind of vacation plans and this and that for the first time in a few years, it made, again, sort of backfilling and getting back to sort of a normal labor supply and demand dynamic a little more challenging.  I think in both of our business segments, the hope is that in May, as the calendar sort of settles down, as we have more success in hiring more success in sort of trimming that turnover rate, become a little bit more aggressive and not entering into nearly as many longer-term commitments on the temporary and traveling side of things, rejecting the highest rates that those temporary and traveling companies are demanding, we'll see some relief, some measurable relief we will be getting in the May time. Andrew Mok : Got it. Can you help quantify the moderation in contract related rates that you've seen in the market thus far? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, again, the first quarter was a quarter of escalating, I'll say dollars especially. On the acute side, we talked about our premium pay in Q4 as being $120 million, that increased in Q1 to $150 million and compares to Q1 of '21 when it was $70 million. So the overall dollars premium pay certainly increased in Q1. We are seeing a reduction in rates at the very end of Q1 and into April, and we presume that will continue into Q2. But it's difficult to say the exact pace at which they're decelerating, but certainly, we're seeing decelerating rates. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : I wanted to start off following up on that question around labor. So Steve, you talked about $120 million going to $150 million. How do you expect that within the guidance to kind of play out through the year?  Are you assuming a pretty material decline there as we go through the year in terms of that temp labor? Steve Filton : Yes. So Justin, I think our commentary has been pretty consistent really beginning with our third quarter call in October of last year into our year-end call in February. And that commentary has sort of suggested that the labor recovery was happening slower than we expected. First of all, it was clearly set back by the Omicron surge in December of '21 and then January of '22. That definitely set things back from where our expectations were in the fall of last year. But even, as I said, even from our commentary that we made just 2 months ago when we issued our guidance and did our year-end announcement, I think the recovery is clearly slower than we expected. And obviously, I think that's been true at least for 2 of our acute care peers, who I think have made similar comments in the last week or so. Our original guidance always presume that it was certainly a different cadence than has been the historically normative cadence for our company that earnings would improve as the year went on. And then the fundamental driver of that sort of cadence in that trajectory is the idea that labor pressures would ease as the year went on.  I think it's worth noting in terms of the labor pressures being greater than we expected in Q1, we certainly acknowledge that our earnings missed our own internal forecast. Again, Marc suggested, we were off of our forecast. We were about 5% or 6% off of our forecast in Q1, we know that we were probably 11% or 12% off of consensus. But I think we have a sense that we may be able to recover that as the year goes on. Now again, as our press release indicated, if the labor recovery does not occur as fast as we think that it will, we may have to revise that guidance later in the year, but we're at the moment still hopeful that, that improving cadence will occur as the year goes on. Justin Lake : Okay. But is there a number you can give us, Steve, in terms of like -- it's really helpful, you're saying $120 million and $150 million in the last 2 quarters. Is there a number that you can anchor us to in terms of where you think this is going to go through the year? Steve Filton : Yes. I think what I would say is, look, I don't know that any of us know where it's going to go. I think what our guidance presumed is that by the end of the year, we would add a minimum return to kind of last year's pace. And like I said, in the fourth quarter of last year, the premium pay was sort of that $70 million range, et cetera. And it's really important to understand that, that incremental, let's call it, $50 million of premium pay is essentially it hit -- direct hit to the bottom line because we're not getting any more nurses for that. We're getting the same amount of nurses for the most part and just paying premium rates for them. So as those premium rates go down -- I mean, as the premium rates have risen, they've clearly put a real strain on our earnings and on our peers' earnings. But as they come down, you get that same benefit. You'll be replacing a temporary nurse with an employee nurse who's making maybe 1/3 of what that temporary nurse was making. Justin Lake : Okay. So to just put some math around this to finish it up, you're talking about $150 million going down to $70 million by the end of the year. But you haven't seen any -- actually, it sounds like you've seen a little bit of a moderation in the payment terms, but not much of a moderation in the hours, right, even through April. Is there anything you can point us to that's saying you've got visibility here? And if not, why not just take down the guidance and assume some more conservative path through the year? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean so honestly, Justin, I have to confess being a little bit frustrated, 2 months ago, we issued guidance that I think was more conservative generally than our peers. And at least from a number of quarters, I think we were wrongly criticized for that, that we explain but we express too much caution about how quickly this labor situation would resolve itself, et cetera. Now 2 months later, some people and you, in the moment, are saying, \"Okay, now you're being too aggressive.\" All we're suggesting, I think, and again, I don't mean to imply that we're saying that the labor situation has turned or where we have 100% certainty that it will or when it will. I think we're just suggesting that more time is not an unreasonable sort of request for people to have 2 months after that guidance was initially issued. I pointed to a number of metrics. I said our net hires, in the behavioral segment, it turned positive in the last few periods. I suggested that we're seeing lowering rates, et cetera, again, not needing to imply that there's a complete turnaround here. But I do think there's enough of these sort of early indicators that things are improving to a degree that makes us think that, that 6% shortfall from our own internal forecast that we experienced in Q1 can be maybe partially or completely recovered as the year progresses. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : I appreciate the commentary on the impact of behavioral volumes from labor. I was hoping you could help us think about a little bit operationally about what happened in the acute care business in the quarter? So when we look at it, I guess, against baseline levels, it does seem like the adjusted admissions took a step back versus where you've been running over the past 3 quarters. I guess those quarters also had some COVID impact to them. So just trying to understand, was there an impact on the volume side? And I guess if there was an impact on the volume side, it does seem like you're using a greater quantity of contract labor against that? What does that mean for how you maybe your retention rates are performing? Steve Filton : Yes. I think it's worth noting that the COVID volumes, again, and this is really acute care commentary, were so high in the beginning of the year that -- even though they declined fairly rapidly, our acute care segment finished the quarter with about 14% of their admissions for the quarter being COVID diagnoses.  And that's about as high as we've run during the 2-plus years of the pandemic. So I know people tend to have sort of recency bias and they think of COVID being behind us, et cetera, but COVID played a significant part in Q1. And on the acute side, that's challenging because it's challenging on the labor side, as we've discussed, it's challenging on our ability to have effective throughput with non-COVID cases and procedural cases, et cetera. I think by the end of the quarter, most of the operational sort of throughput in terms of patients, et cetera, have returned in large part to normal. But again, those labor pressures persisted late into the quarter, maybe in some cases, even into April, because I think of this phenomenon -- and I make the point that it's not only our commitment that we're locked into longer-term commitments for nurses but to the extent that the nurse is who we think will ultimately return to our facilities are locked into longer-term commitments at other facilities or other geographies that has to play out before those nurses will ultimately return to us. And while we certainly acknowledge that some of those nurses probably don't return anytime soon and are more committed to sort of that traveling or temporary or lifestyle, we do believe, and I think both our internal and external data suggests, that more and more of those nurses are not going to pursue that lifestyle indefinitely. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla from Citi. Jason Cassorla : I just wanted to go to CapEx quickly. Just in context of this continued kind of pressured labor environment, does it change how you're thinking about the pacing or timing for future capital deployment priorities, as it relates specifically to service line build-out or investment in equipment or otherwise at this juncture? Steve Filton : So what I would say is, we certainly have to take that into account on an episodic basis. Each project we look at and try to make a determination on market factors. So for capital equipment, things like that, probably no change. But for the larger projects, in general, we look at them specifically and taking into account each factor or all the factors in a particular market that might affect that project. And in some cases, we'll choose to hold at least for a period of time until we feel better about what's happening in a particular market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : A couple of ones here. With what you've seen in the first quarter, it looks like labor pressure is continuing in April before hopefully turning in May. And because you said that The Street first quarter estimates were 5% to 6% higher than your own internal estimates, any chance you can give us a range for how we should think about 2Q sequentially or percent of the annual EBITDA, just so we get this number right? Steve Filton : Yes. So I'm not exactly sure what you're asking. I mean we've discussed on many occasions, Pito, we don't give quarterly guidance and that's an intentional decision on our part. As I said, we were 6% short of our own internal forecast in Q1. And I think part of the reason that we particularly enumerated some of those startup losses and nonrecurring losses in our prepared remarks was we were potentially suggesting a reason why I think we budgeted for those things probably more accurately than The Street was able to. I don't know that for a fact. I don't know that that's the main difference between our internal forecast in Q1 versus the consensus, but I think it's a possible explanation. I think, again, our perspective is that EBITDA basically gradually increases as the year goes on, which again is different than what would be our normal historical cadence. But again, getting back to this idea, in order to make up that 6% shortfall in Q1, we have to be a couple of percentage points higher in each of the next quarters on average to still get to the midpoint of our guidance. Again, I don't think we think that's a certainty by any stretch. It's a difficult environment. But I think we certainly don't feel at this point that we would say with precision that we can't get there. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great. And then can you provide some of our gross hires as to net hires in the fourth quarter versus 1 quarter -- or first quarter. How is it tracking in April? And basically, any color on turnover? Is it consistent? Is it getting better or turning worse? And then the third tag on there is as I think about turnover, it means that your wages are uncompetitive and that you may need to increase those rates? Steve Filton : Yes. So I mean, as I said in an earlier comment, this question of whether wages are competitive is certainly far from a static question and literally we are doing competitive market reviews in all of our markets. In some cases, as frequently as quarterly, I mean, that's how quickly the supply and demand dynamics are changing. But again, the point that I would make is the labor or the wage pressure that we're feeling, I'll speak to the acute business, in particular, is not from the increases that we're giving from an underlying wage perspective, but it's from that premium pay. And as that premium pay declines, even if we're increasing our wages -- our base wages by 100 basis points or 150 basis points, the economics are such that we benefit greatly if -- again, the example that I was giving before, I think, in response to Justin's question, if our premium pay goes from $150 million that we spent in Q1 to the $70 million we spent a year ago, that benefit drops almost directly to the patient -- to the bottom line. Now again, it's not going to happen immediately. It will take some time, probably gets offset a little by underlying wage increases, but there's still an enormous amount of leverage that comes from being able to reduce that number. The challenge that all the hospitals, in general, have had is that number has been increasing. And the sense is, I think, at the moment, that we're getting pretty close to the peak if we're not there. And now I think the focus and all of our calculations are how quickly can it be reduced? I don't think there's a sense that, that number is likely to go up anymore in any significant way. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great. And then sort of 2 quick follow-ups here. Supply inflation, we're going to hear from suppliers about sort of pushing costs on the hospitals. I guess, what are you seeing from supplies? And then from medical devices, are you guys seeing inflationary pressures getting pushed to you on the supply side? Steve Filton : Yes. Look, I think like every -- both business and personal consumer, we're seeing inflation affecting all of our spend -- but the labor inflation -- and again, I'm not even sure I would describe it as inflation per se. But what I would describe as the reliance on this premium pay is so much denominating dynamic in the space that even with inflation -- 2 things, I think if we see those premium rates come down, we'll get a direct benefit from that. And I think as we see those premium rates come down, we'll also see our own hiring improve, and particularly on the behavioral side, that will allow our volumes to increase and that will provide a pretty significant offset to those inflation rates. So again, inflation is definitely a factor. But I think we have a point of view that if we can solve the labor scarcity problem that will more than overwhelm the pressures that we're feeling from increased inflation. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho. Ann Hynes : Can you let us know what is embedded in guidance for base labor wage rates and what that compares to on a historical basis? Is your estimate tracking in line with your estimates? And then how should we think about that in 2023? I know it's early, but just given wages as a big -- biggest cost structure, we probably want to assume the right pressure point for next year? Steve Filton : Yes. Sorry, and we talked I think about it, just a little bit, in the Q4 call. I mean I think if pre-pandemic our wage inflation was, let's say, on the acute side 3%, 3.5%; on the behavioral side, it was probably 2%, 2.5%, I think post pandemic, we're thinking those rates are up 100, 150, maybe even 200 basis points.  I think we think those rates ease some in 2023 for a number of reasons that we've already talked about. But again, I think when we do that math, if we're replacing nurses who were making $65 or $70 an hour with temporary or traveling nurses who are making $225 an hour, that's really the drag on our earnings in the current period. If we ultimately replace those nursing hours that we were paying $225 for $75, even though that's a reasonable increase from what we had been paying pre-pandemic, it's still an enormous improvement over where we're sitting right now. Ann Hynes : All right. And then just a follow-up question. When I think about the nursing issue, like the acute care seems very obvious. You have the premium rates, you had COVID spikes and that should come down. But I struggle more with the behavioral side and whether there are some structural shift in nursing going on? I guess, what is your view on that? And is there anything you can do to reduce your reliance on nurses. And if it is more structural in nature, would you consider portfolio rationalization, like in certain markets? Are you closing units right now? And maybe I know you've gotten a lot of nursing staff, but do you have like an absolute number of nurses you had pre-pandemic and what it is versus now in the behavioral business? I'm just curious to see how much your nursing staff has been reduced and what you have to overcome to return to growth. Steve Filton : Yes. So again, we've talked about this. The most difficult position generally to fill during the pandemic has been the registered nurse position on both the acute and the behavioral side. And we're experimenting -- more than experimenting, I think we're implementing newer models of patient care that rely less heavily on the RMs and more heavily on LPNs and LVMs and paramedics and all sorts of other folks who are rendering care. And not what the -- I always want to make this point very clear, we're not having people practice the phrase that gets used in the prevention is above their license. What we're trying to do is relieve our RNs from doing more clerical and administrative work than they need to do. Somebody else can answer the phone, somebody else could speak with families, somebody else can change the sheets in the room, whatever it may be, and let's allow the nurses to do the things that are at the top of their license, doing psychological assessments and behavioral care and delivering medication and all those sort of things. So that's really a big focus of ours. Now again, to be fair, those sorts of patient care model changes take some time to hire the other non-RN positions, takes some time to train people, takes some time for people to get oriented, et cetera. But we think we're making incremental improvement in those areas, and we'll continue to do so. As far as portfolio rationalization, no, we're not really -- I think we're closing down capacity temporarily when we don't have sufficient clinical staff to treat patients. But I think we've talked about this again in previous calls, we are, I think, rationalizing our capacity to a degree as we're negotiating our managed care contracts. If our managed care payers are not giving us sufficient increases to recognize this elevated level of labor cost, we're canceling some of those contracts. We're changing payer mix, et cetera. So I think we're rationalizing capacity of the portfolio in that way. And I think -- and I said this earlier, we're also saying no to some of the really, really egregious temporary and traveling rates, where we're just saying, \"Look, it doesn't make sense for us to pay XYZ for a nurse if we're only getting paid ABC from a payer.\" And so I think unlike some providers we don't have the point of view that we're going to pay whatever it takes for a nurse. I think in some cases, we believe that it just makes sense to rationalize using near term some of the capacity and just run a lower volume for a period of time until rates come into a more normalized range. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Barclays. Sarah James : I'm trying to run through some of the -- you said that you were 5% to 6% of internal forecast in behavioral [Technical Difficulty] $19 million to $20 million and acute premium pay went up 30%. Can you give us what site it was? I know last quarter you said it was about $25 million to $30 million in premium pay for the year. And then were there any positive offsets? Because it seems like they're -- there were to get to that 5% to 6% of the internal forecast. Steve Filton : Yes. So Sarah, I mean, what we've talked about before is that -- the premium pay on the behavioral side is much less of an issue than it is on the acute side. It's probably 1/3 or lower. And when you talk about premium pay as well as things like retention bonuses and sign-on bonuses, et cetera, the real issue on the behavioral side is insufficient volume and revenue growth. So in Q1, our adjusted patient days were I think 1% below the prior year. Our overall revenue growth was 3.5% to 4%. Clearly, those -- that level of growth in both volume and revenue is not sufficient to support the increased labor inflation and just the general inflation we're experiencing. But it's not -- the issue on the behavioral side is not to get rid of the premium pay, but that's certainly a goal as well. But the real issue on the behavioral side is to hire sufficient clinical staff and to change the patient care model to hire sufficient clinical staff so that our patient days are growing at least at their historical normal levels of 3% to 4% a year. Sarah James : Okay. And then earlier in the call, you talked about considering expanding into alternative care models. What do you mean by that? Is that like outpatient methadone clinics? Or can you be more specific? Steve Filton : Yes. So what it means, I think, are the folks who are delivering patient care are less RN intensive and more lower license level people, whether that's LPNs or LVNs or techs whatever. And again, what it's really designed to do is to allow the RN to practice at the top of his or her license and allow other people to do the more administrative and clerical activities, and as a consequence deliver the highest efficiency and best quality of patient care that we can in a way that allows us to treat as many patients safely as we can. Sarah James : Got it. And last question is just a follow-up to Ann. So when you mentioned canceling some payer contracts or shifting payer mix, is there any other details you can provide on that of what payers are there [Technical Difficulty]. Steve Filton : Yes. So you're breaking up a little bit, Sarah. I'll try and answer what I think you asked. Again, I think the detail that I offer around that is if you look at our Q1 behavioral results, our revenue per adjusted day is up 5-plus percent. I think that's reflective of the fact that we're doing a pretty judicious job of negotiating increased payer rates and choosing and trying to engineer payer mix so that -- where we're not dealing with payers who are sort of refusing to give us the sorts of annual rate increases that we would need to kind of replacement. And I think we're being very successful at that. I think we're very pleased with that 5-plus percent of revenue per adjusted day on the behavioral side of the business. Again, now the real challenge for us is to move from a negative 1% patient day growth to the historical normative 3% or 4% or even above that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Albert Rice : Maybe just a couple of questions. On the behavioral side, I know we're mainly talking about the labor component here, but I just want to make sure that you're still feeling like the underlying demand for the service is still strong. I know your biggest hospital peer, which has behavioral health units reported that they were actually down year-to-year, too, in behavioral. So I wonder if it's still so strong, where are these patients going? Do you have a sense of what's happening to them? Steve Filton : Yes. Look, I think the reality, A.J., is that -- in many cases, they're going untreated. In many of our markets, you have -- you definitely have a sense that where we're unable to take a certain number of patients because we don't have sufficient clinical staff, it's not like we believe that our peers in the market are able to do something we're not. So I think some of those patients wind up not getting the care that they really need. And so back to your point -- and we've made this point, I think, very consistently during the entire pandemic and that the ways that we measure the underlying demand, I think we measure them in a number of different ways, but one of the ways we measure the underlying demand is what we describe as inbound activity. These are the phone calls that we get to our 800 numbers, the Internet inquiries we get to our website, et cetera. And those -- the volume of those inbound inquiries have been doing nothing but generally consistently rising during the pandemic. And on conversion rate, the number of those inbound inquiries that ultimately resulted in admissions, that percentage has declined pretty dramatically during the pandemic, really, primarily because of the labor scarcity issue that we've been talking about. So to answer your initial question, which again, I think Marc addressed in a broader way in his comments earlier is, we have a lot of confidence that the underlying demand for both of our business segments has not changed in any fundamental way. Albert Rice : Okay. I know one thing relative to your other public peer in behavioral that you're a little different is that you have some markets like in Massachusetts and Texas where you have multiple behavioral health facilities in one metropolitan area or a cluster of them. When you look at that, are those presenting specific challenges? Do you have more labor issues. How do you manage the fact that one behavioral health facility is not competing against the other behavioral health facilities for labor? Do you coordinate that? Any thoughts? Steve Filton : Yes. I think the reality is, obviously, having multiple facilities in a market, which we do in a number of markets you mentioned, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, are all markets in which we have a pretty significant market share and a multiple facility presence. And obviously, that affords you some luxuries of being able to move employees amongst facilities that allows you to centralize some of the recruiting and HR functions and be more efficient in that regard, et cetera. So there is some benefit to that. But the real issue is that some geographies are just more challenging than others in terms of the labor scarcity. And I think what we find is that when a market is challenging, all the providers in the market are challenged, and that's just the way it is. Now again, I will tell you, we have certain facilities that are fully staffed, that are not struggling. We have other facilities that struggle to higher RNs. We have other facilities that have sufficient number of RNs but struggle to hire mental health technicians to unlicensed professionals. So it really varies. And I wouldn't say that having multiple facilities is even more or less difficult. I think it just really depends on the geography. Albert Rice : Okay. And maybe just one final question. So obviously, your step-up pace of share repurchase is an important part of the UHS story for this year. I guess, how should we think about that activity? You did about $350 million in Q1. On the one hand, the market's giving you an opportunity here where there's a significant sell-off in the stock today, and so you get an opportunity to buy it cheaper than you could yesterday. Alternatively, you're just talking about the fact that you've got to see some improvement or you may adjust guidance at midyear? Should we think that you would step up to try to take advantage of the pullback here? Or do you sort of hesitate until you get better clarity on whether there's going to be a need to adjust guidance. What's your thinking about share repurchase activity going forward? Steve Filton : Yes. So we indicated in our initial guidance that our plan for share repurchase for 2022 was roughly $1.4 billion with the $350 million in Q1, we're right on track to get to that number. To your point, obviously, the market has changed a great deal just in the last few days. And to be fair about it, we haven't made any firm decisions about how to think about that whether we'll try and accelerate share repurchase, et cetera. We certainly will think about that. But the comment, I guess, that I've made today is simply that I think we have every intention of fulfilling the annual share repurchase amount or something close to it that was in our original guidance. That's certainly -- our view hasn't changed. And again, I think for all the reasons that Marc articulated in his prepared comments are confident that the labor scarcity situation will get resolved and that the underlying demand is still quite strong in both of the businesses. Marc Miller : But just to go a bit further, as Steve said, we are going to look at this. And so we're right on track for our previous guidance. If our shares continue to be this undervalued, it would be a pretty fair bet that whether we go above that $1.4 billion, we haven't made a decision yet. But we're certainly going to look very carefully at doing something when our shares are so undervalued, given what, Steve, just said about our belief in the business. The demand is there. This labor issue will subside at some point. So we know that fundamentally we'll be in a good position. So we can take advantage of the undervalued share price, so we'll certainly consider that and probably do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs. Jamie Perse : Can you give us any color on profitability by month in the acute care segment? Even directionally, it seems like the labor environment was similarly challenged across all the months, but the big difference in January, you had a lot of COVID. March looked a lot more normal. And I'm just trying to understand the trajectory of profitability and that type of mix shift happens. Steve Filton : Yes. So I think as we have found throughout the pandemic the acute business benefits to some degree from the COVID surges. The COVID patients historically have been more acutely ill than that. I think that was a little bit different in this most recent surge. Obviously, we got the benefit of the 20% Medicare add-on for COVID patients. We had the benefit in the quarter of HRSA reimbursement for uncompensated or uninsured COVID patients, although that is pretty much been exhausted. So I think the acute care business weathers the COVID surge in December and January better than the behavioral business, where they really, on the behavioral side of things, there's no benefit from the COVID surge. There's only pressures that sort of a company is. I think the dynamic of the quarter is that we assume that as COVID volumes decline the labor scarcity issue would ease more than it did and would benefit both of our segments in -- more than it did. So I would say that acute profitability didn't change all that much during the quarter. I think our budget increased. So our budget shortfall increased as the quarter went on, although profitability only changed much. I would tell you that on the behavioral side, profitability was really challenged in January when the COVID volumes were as high as they were and got better to some as the quarter went on. Jamie Perse : Okay. That's helpful. And then just we've talked a lot about all the money you're spending on premium labor today. I'm just trying to think about as rates and utilization of premium labor come down, if that gives you an opportunity to redeploy some of that into base wage rates, just thinking about the recapturability of some of these excess costs right now, is it all recapturable or 2/3, half, just any thoughts on that would be helpful. . Steve Filton : Yes. I think that the reality is, there's not a lot of -- after just the term you used, there's sort of transferability between the 2. I've made this point before when the nurse comes to her supervisor to a hospital, the Chief Nursing Officer, whatever, and says that he or she is leaving to make $10,000 a week, which is probably 4 or 5x what his or her salary is, there's really no counter we can make to that. And raising base wages by 100 basis points or 200 basis points is not an effective counter to that sort of an offer. So that -- those opportunities really have to diminish in number in order for those nurses to come back. We're not going to entice those nurses to come back with, again, a 100 basis point increase in wage rates, which, again, I think is why the underlying base wage rate inflation, while it's up in both acute and behavioral, is not up by hundreds and hundreds of basis points, but just by 100 or 150 basis points because they're not really being changed to meet those -- that premium pay. We just can't do that. Marc Miller : I'll make one more point on this. What we're trying to do -- we're doing -- Steve already mentioned earlier, we do market surveys and we're doing adjustments like on a quarterly basis in a lot of our markets, trying to understand exactly what the correct base rate is for market. One of the things I want to make sure people recognize is that a lot of traveling nurses don't actually travel anywhere. So in certain markets, I've seen traveling nurses up to 50% of those \"travelers\" are people that live within 4 or 5 miles of where they're traveling to. So a lot of them are people that have actually not gone anywhere. They're taking traveler contracts in their home market. And what is happening now is going to continue to happen is that those opportunities for the traveling contracts are going away. And so hopefully, sooner than later, a lot more of those \"traveling nurses,\" if they want to stay in their home market, which they clearly do because they haven't gone anywhere, they're going to have to go back to the local hospitals at the local wage rates and not the traveling rates that they were getting for those contracts previously, and we're already starting to see that. And hopefully, that's going to accelerate in the next couple of months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Joanna Gajuk : Actually, this is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Thanks for just a couple of follow-up questions. So you mentioned on the psych business, the pricing is pretty strong, and I guess you are managing your contracts there. Can you talk about on the acute care side? Or are the commercial rates now contracting there? Are you pushing rates there also to get some -- after the inflation and what the success rate is and kind of any way you can frame it for us that piece of the business on the acute care side in terms of the commercial payers? Steve Filton : Yes, Joanna, I mean, I think we're doing the same thing on the acute side. I think it's a little bit harder to see on the acute side because I think on the acute side, revenue per adjusted admission tends to be impacted by other variables besides just pure pricing and especially during the pandemic, probably acutely has had a bigger impact on acute care revenue per adjusted admission than anything else, including the underlying pricing. But yes, I mean, we're making those same judgments and for the same reasons, quite frankly, if payers are unable to give us sufficient rate increases at a minimum to sort of absorb at least a portion of this inflation and particularly the labor inflation, that I think we're willing to cancel contracts, terminate contracts, move into trying to shift payer mix to other more reasonable players. Joanna Gajuk : Great. And I guess on the sites, when you talk about the 5% increase you experienced in the quarter, is that kind of how you think about this going forward? Is this kind of assuming your guidance in terms of the pricing? Steve Filton : Yes. So what we had said is that pre-pandemic our behavioral pricing for a number of years tended to go up about 2% or 3% a year. During the pandemic, we've seen it up in that 5% to 6% range, which is what we saw in Q1. I think it settles out as we emerge from the pandemic kind of in between in maybe that sort of 3% to 4% range because I think some of the payer behavior, which got a little bit less aggressive in terms of denials and things like that during the pandemic probably reemerges post pandemic. So yes, I think, again, I think we think behavioral pricing settles into more like a 3% or 4% range. Again, what's really needed to turn the behavioral segment around and start meeting our expectations is got to kind of increase those adjusted patient days from your negative 1% to up 3% or 4% or beyond that. Joanna Gajuk : Right, exactly. That's the bigger issue we talked for the last hour. But I guess in terms of the volumes on the acute care segment, so did I hear right, why do you say that the volumes returned to normal, I guess, towards the end of the quarter. Did you mean kind of the pre-COVID levels? Any kind of commentary in terms of the types of volumes and what are you seeing there on the acute care side? Steve Filton : Yes. So one of the most important metrics that we factor in the pandemic is surgical volume because it encompasses a lot of those elective procedures. Our surgical volume in Q1 was above our pre-pandemic surgical volume, to be fair, slightly above, not by a lot, but I think it was the first time during the pandemic that our surgical volumes actually exceeded the pre-pandemic or 2019 levels. So again, another encouraging sign that, again, once we get some of these labor pressures, at least partially behind us should help in the recovery. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Benjamin Mayo : Just one more question on premium pay, take the $150 million. What did it look like the very first 3 quarters of 2021? I'm just trying to get a better comparison here. Steve Filton : Yes. So I don't necessarily have those numbers in front of me, Whit. I think what we said, which I know last quarter, it was -- that in the fourth quarter of '21, it was $70 million. I think in the first quarter of '21, it was $50 million. So I think you could sort of bridge that gap. Benjamin Mayo : Yes. No, that's perfect. And -- just one other follow-up question, just the DRG add-on and the HRSA payments, can I get that -- those 2 numbers from you? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think we just have disclosed all along that the impact of those numbers, I believe, in 2021 was about $11 million a quarter each for HRSA and for the 20% now. And Mary, we're going to have to make that our last question because we have some other commitments here. Operator : Thank you. Steve Filton : So we'd like to thank everybody for their time. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Universal Health Services, Inc. Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Steve Filton, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, Mr. Filton. Steve Filton : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2021, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. We\u2019d like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported an adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.20 for the second quarter of 2022. As previously disclosed in our preannouncement on June 30, 2022, our acute hospitals experienced a significant decline in COVID-related patients during the second quarter of 2022. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 13% of total admissions in the first quarter of 2022, but only 3% in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in COVID-related patient volumes during the second quarter was not offset by an equivalent increase in non-COVID-related patients resulting in significant shortfalls in revenues and earnings compared to our original forecast for the quarter. And even though we did make progress in reducing premium pay in the acute segment, which went from $153 million in the first quarter to $117 million in the second quarter, overall costs did not decline sufficiently to offset the weaker revenues. Specifically, a surge in patients with the Omicron variant of the virus, which began in December of 2021, tended to peak in most of our geographies in January of 2022. In our acute segment, we would note that in general, the Omicron patients were less acutely ill than the COVID-related patients treated in previous surges and thus displayed somewhat lower acuity. Meanwhile, the amount of contract nursing hours used and even more importantly, the rate we had to pay for those hours increased significantly in the first quarter, both on a sequential basis as well as on a year-over-year comparison. In our behavioral segment, we also made progress in filling our vacant positions, but patient day volumes still does not recover as quickly as we originally expected. We do note that our reported second quarter results were benefited from approximately $10 million of revenues from supplemental Texas Medicaid reimbursements, which were not reflected in our estimates for the quarter in the preannouncement. These revenues were originally contemplated to be recorded in the second half of the year. So the $10 million represents a shift in timing only. The second quarter also included approximately $20 million of startup losses incurred by recently opened de novo acute and behavioral health facilities as well as a $16 million pretax charge incurred to increase our reserves for self-insured professional and general liability claims. Marc Miller : Our second quarter 2022 operating results were significantly behind our original forecasts. The primary driver of the shortfall was that non-COVID volume did not recover as quickly as we had anticipated based on our previous experience during the pandemic when COVID volumes declined rapidly. We believe there are multiple contributing factors to the slower demand rebound, most notably labor scarcity issues, which continue to constrain our ability to meet demand in certain circumstances. In the end, however, we believe that the majority of the demand shortfall has been simply delayed or postponed and that ultimately, it will be realized. We are encouraged by the progress made in reducing premium pay and filling vacancies, and we continue to invest heavily in recruitment and retention initiatives. Where appropriate, we are also developing alternative patient care models that allow us to use a wider variety of available caregivers to render the most efficient and high quality of care where we care. In reaction to the earnings softness and the fact that we are completing a refinancing during the quarter, we reduced the pace of our capital expenditure spend by about 20% or $100 million for the first six months of the year. Similarly, we moderated the trajectory of our share repurchases although we still expect to acquire approximately the same number of shares as in our original guidance. We are pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Marco from Nephron Research. Your line is now open. Marco Criscuolo : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, you spoke to some of the developments you saw on contract labor during the quarter. But I was wondering if you could provide a little more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the hourly rates and utilization, and how that\u2019s tracking into July? And also, is there any detail you can provide on base hourly nursing rates and how those compare today to last year or even two years ago? Thanks Steve Filton : Yes. So, what we said in the first quarter was that we had $115 million or $153 million of premium pay in the acute segment, and we said that our guidance presumed that, that number would be cut approximately in half by the fourth quarter, so that we\u2019d have something like $75 million or $80 million of premium pay in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re pretty much on track for that trajectory. As I said, we had $117 million of premium pay in Q2, which is about 20%, maybe a little bit more reduction. I think that reduction came from a combination of both rate declines and hours utilized, I think split pretty evenly in terms of their impact. And I think that\u2019s where we are. As far as underlying base wage rates, I think as we\u2019ve noted before, they have gone from sort of pre-pandemic increases also on the acute side specifically, from, let\u2019s say, 3%, 3.5% to something more like 4.5% to 5%. On the behavioral side, they probably started at somewhat lower. But again, something in the neighborhood of 125 basis point, 150 basis point increase in base rates, pre-pandemic, post-pandemic comparison. Marco Criscuolo : Great. Thanks. And then if I could ask one quick follow-up on the behavioral side. Is there any way to quantify the lost patient volumes from the lack of your ability to find the staffing? In other words, is there any detail you can provide on how many admissions or patient days you think you\u2019ve lost from that? Thanks. Steve Filton : We do track that internally. We don\u2019t disclose those numbers in part, because I think different hospitals track them a little bit differently, et cetera, and we don\u2019t view them as the most precise statistics. But we do know that we have turned away during the pandemic, a significant number of patients either because we didn\u2019t have the staff to treat them or because we had certain beds blocked because patients couldn\u2019t be exposed to other patients with COVID, et cetera. I think, what I would say is, we continue to believe that the historic levels of growth that we\u2019ve experienced in our behavioral business of mid-single-digit volume growth, 3%, 4%, 5% same-store patient day growth year-over-year, we believe there\u2019s certainly still achievable once we can get beyond the current labor scarcity. And I think the second quarter represents an incremental improvement towards that goal still a ways to go. But I think the trend is a positive one. Marco Criscuolo : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS. Your line is now open. Andrew Mok : Thanks, good morning. Steve, acute results missed internal plan by a pretty wide margin. Can you help parse out the impact from the health plan business within the acute segment. How much of an earnings drag was that? And is that expected to get better for the balance of the year? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean the insurance subsidiary was somewhat of a drag on earnings. It certainly was not the significant \u2013 most significant or even close to the most significant, I think, obviously, as we discussed, both in the preannouncement and our remarks again today. It was \u2013 difficulty we had in replacing COVID patients with non-COVID patients. The insurance subsidiary winds up being a drag because as we add new subscribers or establish new accountable care organizations in our markets, there are generally startup costs and losses associated with that. But that drag in the quarter was, in my mind, no more than $10 million. Andrew Mok : Got it. Okay. And then on the behavioral side, behavioral revenue per patient day had been trending 5% plus over the last seven quarters. That moderated to less than 2% this quarter. Is there anything to call out that\u2019s driving the slowing increases on the behavioral pricing? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean probably a chunk of that and probably the most significant chunk is if people recall and we did disclose, we recorded that special reimbursement, special Kentucky reimbursement, in June of last year. And in the comparison between years, at least some of that is included. So, as we\u2019ve noted, the recording of that Kentucky revenue is much more ratable in 2022. So, we\u2019re comparing a more ratable reimbursement rate in 2022 with that big chunk received in 2021. So probably that drives down the revenue growth rate more than anything else. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Stephen Baxter : Hey, thank you. It looks like about a \u2013 when you look at the acute care reported EBITDA and the same-store EBITDA, it looks like there\u2019s about a $20 million drag from non-same-store items. It sounds like, if I remember correctly, the insurance company results are not reported in same-store. Just wondering if you can confirm that or not? And then should we think about the balance of that as being driven by start-up losses or any other items impacting that? That would be helpful color to have. Thank you. Steve Filton : So the insurance subsidiary results are certainly included in our same-store acute results and always have been, obviously, except for when they first started. What I said in my prepared remarks was we had $20 million of startup losses at new acute care and behavioral facilities. The biggest chunk of that is our new hospital in Reno, which opened, I believe, very late March or early April. And one of the things that we\u2019re experiencing, just yet another difficulty of the pandemic, is a slower process in getting a new hospital certified and getting their Medicare numbers and therefore, being able to bill patients in a more timely way. Historically, that used to be literally just a few day process between opening and getting your Medicare number certified. I think in the case of our hospital in Reno, it took us almost a couple of months. And as a consequence, I think we suffered more significant losses than we really anticipated, and that\u2019s a big chunk of that $20 million that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. One of the significant improvements we\u2019re expecting in the back half of the year is that, that hospital will ramp up fairly significantly in our forecast of leases that it will be profitable by the back half of the year. Stephen Baxter : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up. It does seem like there \u2013 a little hard to tell what might be some pressure on the other OpEx line beyond the insurance company results. Can you talk about anything else you\u2019re seeing impacting that line item, whether it\u2019s physician staffing costs or anything or the like? Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean the acute care, other operating expenses appear to be going up fairly significantly. But as you pointed out, I think the biggest chunk of that is the impact of the insurance subsidiary. The insurance subsidiary records its medical losses or we record is medical losses in that other operating expense line, because their medical losses tend to run 85%, 88% of revenue as opposed to other operating expense at the hospitals, which tend to run at 20% of revenue, something like that. When we have an increase in subscribers and increased revenue on the \u2013 in the insurance subsidiary, it tends to distort that other operating expense line. So as an example, in Q2, if you exclude the insurance subsidiary from on our acute care reporting, our same-store revenue growth, which we reported 3% would be adjusted to 2%, but our other operating expense growth, which we report as 14% would be at 6%, which I think is probably much more in line or what would be an in-line expected number for that other operating expense. There\u2019s nothing else extraordinary in that other OpEx line that I can think of. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Benjamin Rossi with BMO. Your line is now open. Benjamin Rossi : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just going in for Matt Borsch here. Just regarding inflationary pressures for 2023. I know it\u2019s early, but how do you think we should be thinking about key inflationary pressures for 2023 versus historical trends? And with managed care negotiations and ability to pass some of these inflationary pressures through pricing, can you just give us some timing on how we should think about that? Steve Filton : Yes. Look, I think that by far, the biggest challenge is that our hospitals have faced have been on the labor side of the business. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s purely just sort of normal inflationary pressures. I think we have had a point of view for some time that as COVID volumes declined and settled into something more of an endemic level, the pressure, particularly on premium pay, would ease. We certainly saw that sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter. And as I commented in an earlier response, that\u2019s our expectation as the year goes on. That will \u2013 if that plays out the way that we expect, it will certainly significantly diminish the pace of our cost increases. Now, as you point out, we certainly are experiencing other inflationary pressures throughout the business in the same way that all consumers and all businesses are, and we\u2019re certainly doing our best to recoup them from our managed care payers. I\u2019ve mentioned in previous calls that we\u2019ve been aggressively giving notice of termination on contracts in both the acute and the behavioral business at a pace faster than quite frankly, I can really remember ever historically because as we identify contracts that simply in our minds, are not even remotely keeping up with inflationary pressures and labor pressures. And especially in places, whether it\u2019s behavioral or even in some of our acute facilities where we\u2019re already capacity constrained, we are willing to part with what we believe are inadequately reimbursed contracts and focus on patients and contracts that are, in fact, adequately reimbursed. I also would note that it struck me at least that there was a different tone from some of the payers, I think United in their quarterly earnings call acknowledge that they\u2019d be giving some level of price increases in 2023 to providers to acknowledge the increased inflationary pressures, which at least for me, it was the first time that a payer had acknowledge that. So, our expectation is that payers will be more receptive to it in 2023, but we\u2019ll also continue to be aggressive and try and grab the bull by the horns where we\u2019re able to and wrangle rate increases from reluctant payers where we can and where we can\u2019t. I think we\u2019re willing to reconfigure our business and rid ourselves with some of those lowest payers. Benjamin Rossi : Got you. Great. And then quickly on recruiting. We\u2019ve been continuing to hear about tight labor conditions for clinical staff, particularly LPNs. Just looking for a quick update on how your internal initiatives for recruiting retention are playing out? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean so the comments that I made at the outset indicated a roughly 20% decline in premium pay on the acute side sequentially from Q1 to Q2. On the behavioral side, we continue to have a number of months, five months or six months, certainly, at least, of continuous net new hires, meaning the number of people we\u2019re hiring is exceeding the number of people that are exiting the company. Our focus, quite frankly, is really now on that back end and reducing the number of folks who are leaving. And again, I\u2019ll repeat sort of what I said earlier, I think we have a view that as COVID volumes decline and we settle into sort of more of an endemic kind of an environment where there are not these extraordinary opportunities for nurses to chase premium dollars that are four times or five times their base salary that we\u2019ll see a bit more of a return to historic norms of nurses returning to full-time jobs, et cetera. I\u2019m not suggesting that there have been no changes during the pandemic. I think we are probably going to get used to a higher level, a higher normative level of temporary and traveling nurses maybe than we\u2019ve had in the past, et cetera. But I do think those numbers will continue to come down from where they are today to something approaching what we were used to in a pre-pandemic environment. Benjamin Rossi : Great. Thanks for your comments here. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi. Your line is now open. Jason Cassorla : Great. Thanks. Maybe just for the acute business. Can you discuss the utilization by payer across commercial, Medicare and Medicaid? And if there\u2019s any particular payer buckets where you\u2019re seeing outsized pressure on volumes. And then just a follow-up on mix. Acuity seems to remain elevated. But are you seeing any relative pressure on the medical versus surgical side of the business worth noting? And then maybe how we should think about those trends for the balance of the year? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I think, we have said throughout the pandemic that we have not seen dramatic changes in our payer mix. I think, for the most part, our acute hospitals have tended to experience higher levels of COVID during the surges than at least our public peers. I assume that\u2019s just a geographic sort of luck of a draw in that you get the COVID patients in your market, nobody sort of advertises or does anything to try and track those patients, you get what you get. And so we\u2019ve tended to have, I think, a slightly higher Medicare to commercial mix than some of our peers, particularly during surges. But other than that, I don\u2019t see that. The managed care companies, I think, otherwise, from a mix of business perspective, continue to talk about a shift from inpatient to outpatient. I think in our minds that\u2019s really just a continuing dynamic that has been present in the industry now for at least a decade, probably quite a bit more. And within our own hospitals, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve really seen that shift accelerated. But again, I\u2019ll get back to it. I think the fundamental challenge that we faced in our acute care business in Q2 was that as COVID volumes declined and they declined rapidly, we were unable to replace them at the same pace as we did, let\u2019s say, in 2021 with elective and scheduled procedures and the more acute and more profitable sorts of procedures that have sort of go missing during the COVID surges. So, I\u2019ll just remind everybody that in 2021, Q2 really proved to be the most profitable, most robust quarter of the year for both of our business segments after again, a very significant surge of COVID in January 2021, and we were really kind of built our original 2022 forecast off of that experience. And I think what we found is that particularly, again, on the acute side, that recovery of non-COVID volumes, which occurred earlier in 2021, it occurred in April and May and June 2021 has been just sort of extended out into the back half of the year. And I think that was the crux of Marc\u2019s opening comments that we believe that demand has really been postponed or deferred and not, for the most part, lost in any significant way. And so we understand that we have a pretty significant forecast in the back half of the year for increasing volume and continued decreases in labor. But that was our experience during the quarter. The quarter got better sequentially with each month. July seems to be getting sequentially better than June. And so we\u2019re encouraged. We know we have steep held decline, but we\u2019re encouraged that those should still be achievable forecast. Jason Cassorla : Got it. I appreciate that color. And maybe just a follow-up, just on the CapEx side. If I heard this correctly, it sounds like you\u2019ve reduced CapEx spend the expectations by about 20%. And I think last quarter, you discussed that you\u2019re taking CapEx spending in account on an episodic basis given the labor and volume backdrop. And perhaps, if you can give any more detail around the CapEx reduction and the developments there, that would be helpful. Steve Filton : Yes. So a significant amount of our CapEx is on large projects. Obviously, there was a significant amount of money spent in the early part of the year to open the hospital in Reno. Capital spending on new hospitals is back-end loaded in the sense that a lot of it takes place in the month or two before the hospital opens when most of the equipment is delivered and installed and that\u2019s a significant expense. But we also opened several new behavioral hospitals. We\u2019ve talked about our projects to build new hospitals in California. We\u2019re opening a new patient tower in Edinburg, Texas very shortly, et cetera. So those projects and all of our large projects, are difficult to really slow down or certainly stop in any efficient way. I think we\u2019ve learned this over the years. So most of that reduction that I referred to is really in sort of discrete equipment spending and smaller capital projects that can be postponed or delayed. And I think we just felt it was kind of a prudent course to slow those projects at a time \u2013 twofold when earnings were pressured number one, but also when labor constraints were such an overarching issue, why build new capacity or open new capacity if we were going to have difficulty staffing it. So all of that is, I think, sort of being done in real time, and we\u2019ll continue to monitor it. And if I think volumes begin to improve as we believe they have already begun to and believe they will continue to do so. We\u2019ll make our judgments about restoring the pace of capital. But I would say for the foreseeable future, the pace of our capital spending will be moderated below what our original forecast for this year were. Jason Cassorla : Got it. Thanks. Appreciate all the color. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with SVB Securities. Whit Mayo : Thanks. Steve, on the malpractice charge, is this a onetime prior year negative development? Or did you raise your estimates and reserves on a go-forward basis? I know we had a higher malpractice development last year. So just trying to understand kind of what you have in your plan now? Steve Filton : Yes. Whit, I mean, I think \u2013 and I think we said this last year, our malpractice experience is that we\u2019re not seeing an increased number of cases. And I think broadly, what our actuaries tell us is that this is the general experience across the country, but the value of cases that are being brought just is increasing at a fairly significant rate. So, you\u2019re right. We did have an increase to our reserves last year. We did have an increase to our reserves in the second quarter of this year. We view it as a onetime thing in the sense that I think otherwise our malpractice expense and provision from our practice in the back half of the year will be as we originally forecasted. Whit Mayo : So it\u2019s the size of the claims, not the frequency of the claims. Steve Filton : Correct. Whit Mayo : Okay. And maybe just two other quick questions. I\u2019m curious how the UK operations are performing now and if there was any sizable impact from currency in the quarter? And then if you could just talk a little bit about the surgical trends in the quarter, any service lines stronger, weaker than your expectations. Steve Filton : Yes. So sort of do it backwards and hopefully remember everything. Surgical trends, as I said, I mean, I think we\u2019re seeing what seems to be kind of a common theme, which is that our outpatient procedures tend to be growing faster than inpatient. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a new development nor as I said earlier, do I think we see that sort of trend or that gap accelerating, but it\u2019s certainly continuing. As far as within our surgical services, are they particularly strong or weak service lines within cardiology, orthopedics, et cetera, no, I don\u2019t think so. I think they\u2019re tending to all grow at around the same levels. As far as the UK goes, I think interestingly, with through most of the pandemic, I think our behavioral business in the UK has been a little bit more stable than the acute business, while they experienced many of the same issues, particularly with labor staffing because they tend to have a longer length of stay in smaller facilities, I just don\u2019t think that they were quite as pressured as we are in the U.S. on that issue. So they\u2019ve actually performed much closer to our forecast than the U.S. business. Now keep in mind, it\u2019s still a pretty small part of the overall business. It\u2019s about 5% of our consolidated revenues. As you point out, recently the UK economy has come under some significant pressure, the exchange rate has become unfavorable to us, again, because it\u2019s such a small part of the business, it certainly has had an unfavorable impact, but I think it\u2019s only a few million dollars in the quarter. And I think other than the sort of broad pressures on the UK economy and some of the taxes they\u2019re implementing and raising their corporate taxes, there is some macro, I think unfavorable sorts of issues, but I think the underlying business in the UK continues to do very well. Whit Mayo : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. A. J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe first, you mentioned, Steve, you\u2019ve seen progression throughout the quarter and July trends looked like there at least as strong as June, if not a little better. Normal seasonal pattern would have you stepped down in the third quarter, probably in both businesses and then have a strong finish to the year in the fourth quarter. When you\u2019re thinking about the way guidance lays out for the back half of the year, I know you don\u2019t guide on a quarterly basis. But can you give us any flavor for how you\u2019re thinking about the trajectory? Will it be a normal seasonal year? Or would it be somewhat different than that? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean I think almost by definition, if you sort of go through the math of our back half expectations for revenues and EBITDA, you have to see that we pretty much assume that kind of the normal seasonal progression that you alluded to. We\u2019re assuming it\u2019s going to be overcome by this kind of deferred and postponed demand. So we assume that the third quarter will be sequentially better than the fourth and the fourth will be sequentially better than the third and by a significant amount. And again, it\u2019s this idea that I\u2019m going to go back to what I was saying before, if you look at the recovery in 2021, the second quarter was the strongest of the year, which is, again, historically not the traditional seasonal pattern, but it was the emergence from the COVID surge sort of the pickup in volumes, the easing of labor pressures. We think all those things are occurring in 2022 as well. We just think they\u2019re occurring in a sort of more elongated and slower pace. So that a good chunk of that recovery, a good chunk of that labor improvement will take place in quarters three and four this year rather than the way they did in quarter two of last year. A. J. Rice: Okay. And then maybe I\u2019ll ask on the behavioral business. You had a sequential improvement in margin of about 200 basis points that was encouraging. And that really didn\u2019t come with a big rebound in volume or step-up in volume. Is that \u2013 how do you think then where do we go from here? Do you need volume to step up somewhat you get further margin improvement? Are there other things that are specific to the labor situation, whatever that suggest that you can see more margin improvement? And any sense of where you think that would ultimately settle out coming out of the pandemic? Steve Filton : Yes. So look, I think you highlighted, A. J., kind of an important point in the way that COVID surges sort of manifest themselves and impact the two business segments, and I think they\u2019re impacted quite differently. So on the acute care side; we have the COVID surge in January. And while COVID patients present a lot of sort of operating challenges for an acute care hospital from an earnings and financial perspective, there is a significant benefit to them. They\u2019re high acuity patients, there\u2019s very little bad debt or there had been very little bad debt because of government programs to cover the uncompensated COVID patients, et cetera. You\u2019re running very efficiently, all that sort of stuff. So as those patients decline \u2013 as the COVID patients decline on the acute side, now there\u2019s this sort of air bubble, if you will, created and you\u2019ve got to fill that bubble with non-COVID business. And as I said, for a number of reasons, that\u2019s been a more challenging and I think a slower recovery in 2022 than it was in 2021. As a result, the weakest month that we\u2019ve had this year on the acute side of the business is April, and it has gotten better since then, as I\u2019ve said, sequentially each month. Whereas on the behavioral side, the COVID surge is sort of immediately devastating. There\u2019s really no benefit to it. It makes our staffing challenges wildly exacerbated. We have a lot of challenges when we have to isolate COVID patients and close beds, et cetera. So the weakest month of the year for our behavioral business this year has been January when we have the biggest COVID surge and then we\u2019ve just generally seen a sequential improvement since then. But your overall point, I think, is well taken in order for us to meet our forecast that are out there, we clearly need an improvement in volumes, which again, I\u2019m going to say, we believe the underlying demand in both businesses is there, as the labor situation eases, as the COVID surges ease, it should be easier to execute on those volume increases. We thought we would do it earlier in the year, but our revised forecast has slower and some of it, quite frankly, not even taking place in 2022, but that\u2019s the crux of our revised forecast. A. J. Rice: Okay. Maybe I\u2019ll just slip in one last one because it hasn\u2019t been addressed. It seems like some of the specialty hospital peers, whether it\u2019s rehab or behavioral, they\u2019re talking about seeing an uptick in acute care companies or entities being interested in doing joint ventures as they\u2019re repositioning and trying to deal with their own labor challenges. Are you seeing that? Any update on discussions around potential JVs with other big health systems? Steve Filton : Yes. No. Look, we\u2019ve talked about this for some time that, yes, we think there are a significant number of acute care hospitals who have existing behavioral services either a dedicated floor or a discrete building in which they\u2019re offering behavioral services, but feel like they\u2019re not terribly efficient or focused on delivering those services and are looking for a partner who is more expert, more experienced in doing that. We mentioned earlier that we had a number of de novos open this year in Wisconsin, our first behavioral hospital in Wisconsin, in Iowa, in Missouri. We\u2019ve had the Iowa and Missouri hospitals are joint ventures with acute care hospitals. We have a number more in the pipeline. So I think it\u2019s an accurate comment that you\u2019re hearing from others, I think we\u2019re trying to measure that against sort of a real uptick in capital investment at a time when there are challenges in opening new capacity with labor, et cetera. So I think we\u2019re trying to create a pipeline that \u2013 of these joint ventures that can be absorbed in a sort of proper way without creating a drag in earnings. But yes, I think we have said for some time, we think that the opportunity to joint venture with some acute care hospitals and probably even more importantly, some acute care hospital systems to offer behavioral services. We have said for some time, we think that the opportunity to joint venture with some acute care hospitals and probably even more importantly, some acute care hospital systems to offer behavioral services is a significant opportunity over the next five or seven years. A. J. Rice: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Ben Hendrix : Hey, thank you very much. Just to follow up on the behavioral side. Certainly, you mentioned that the volumes have got sequentially a little bit better since low point in January, but they seemed to trend a little bit better than we had expected. It seemed to be a little bit better than some commentary for your peers on behavioral. I was just wondering if you could \u2013 are there any particular areas that you saw or were a little bit different from your expectations. And just how that\u2019s trending in general? And if there were any particular mix issues with payer mix or if there was any kind of patient mix that deviated from your original expectations? Thanks. Steve Filton : No, Ben, I think we tried to alluded to before, the main challenge for our behavioral hospitals during the pandemic has been a lack of staff. And as a consequence, we feel like we\u2019ve had to turn away significant numbers of patients because we didn\u2019t have adequate staff to treat those patients, mostly RNs, but in some cases, therapists, physicians, psychologists, family counselors, and in other cases, non-professionals, mental health technicians, et cetera. Progress in that area has been slow, but since the COVID decline in January, especially, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. And I think more than anything else that has allowed us to make incremental improvements in our volumes. And I think those have continued into July, and our expectation is they\u2019ll continue into the balance of the year. But I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s in any particular service line or payer I think, again, it is more than anything a reflection of the fact that we are slowly getting our arms around the labor scarcity issue, increasing our net hires, experimenting \u2013 maybe not even experimenting anymore, but implementing new patient care models that rely somewhat less on RNs and on other caregivers so that the ultimate total care that\u2019s given to patients and attention that\u2019s given to patients is the same and it\u2019s the same quality, but just not as reliant on registered nurses. Ben Hendrix : Thanks. And just a quick follow-up on the CapEx side. I know you talked about a reduction in CapEx and part of that going to discrete equipment spending. But is there any particular color you can give us on in priorities for those cuts kind of in the equipment side? Thanks. Steve Filton : No. I mean, it\u2019s really \u2013 I think we\u2019re making discrete decisions in \u2013 for each hospital and every market based on where are they sort of struggling, if we invest in new equipment, will they be able to have the staff to realize the benefits of that investment? Or should we wait until the staffing issues resolve themselves. But no, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s functionally we\u2019re not buying CTs, but we are buying MRIs. It\u2019s not that sort of thing. I think we\u2019re making these individual judgments about where it makes sense to postpone or wait on an investment until we are not as sort of capacity constrained from a labor perspective. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I apologize to some of these questions because sometimes it gets confusing to me about whether we\u2019re talking about acute or behavioral volumes. So maybe just to clarify, when you talked about labor being the biggest headwinds of volume growth you talked about the behavioral side more than the acute side? Because it sounded like in Q2 as more COVID dropped and then core didn\u2019t come back rather than a staffing issue on the acute it. Do I have that right? Or would you say labor is also a real gating factor to volume growth in acute? Steve Filton : Yes. So thanks, Kevin. It\u2019s a good question, and I probably should have been a little more precise in my commentary. I think absolutely from the beginning of the pandemic, we have talked about the major headwind or gating factor on the behavioral side as being the labor capacity constraint and shortage. But I do believe that in Q2, and I think on the acute side, through most of the pandemic, the issue has been \u2013 we\u2019ve been able to fill most of our vacancies, but we\u2019ve had to do so at an extremely high cost. And therefore, on the acute side, most of the focus has been on that premium pay rather than sort of an absolute scarcity or vacancy sort of an issue. I will say that in Q2, we did see that issue arise in the acute care segment. I don\u2019t know that we saw it pervasively. I don\u2019t know that it was the single biggest issue by any stretch. But for instance, I think our surgical volumes overall were impacted in some of our markets by a lack of anesthesia coverage, anesthesiologists and their assistance, et cetera, tend to be independent contractors, not our employees. So it\u2019s not necessarily something we\u2019re in direct control of. But we were hearing feedback during the quarter that we were having to limit surgery schedules, et cetera, in some markets because there simply weren\u2019t enough anesthesia \u2013 wasn\u2019t enough anesthesia coverage. Same thing in some markets, we had to go on emergency room divert because we didn\u2019t have simply enough staff in the emergency rooms, et cetera. Again, I don\u2019t know that it was a pervasive issue in the acute care space in Q2. But I do think it contributed to the Q2 weakness in a way that we hadn\u2019t necessarily seen before. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. I guess when we hear some of the other companies talk about how they think about managing their business during this labor shortage. Some companies that we\u2019ve just deemphasized certain business lines because it doesn\u2019t make sense from labor is $150 an hour. And therefore, are growing more slowly. I haven\u2019t heard you guys talk about that. I mean when you think about cutting back on CapEx because it might just be hard to staff to that growth, I mean, are you at all changing your model or your thought about managing through this? Or just trying to understand the thought process has changed and what, if any, implications are for volume growth or margin improvement from here over the next few quarters. Steve Filton : Yes. Look, Kevin, I think that the notion that where there\u2019s a labor scarcity, you\u2019re going to want to emphasize your high-margin service lines and deemphasize your low-margin service lines is sort of theoretically an attractive idea and something that I think we do and we do all the time to the degree that we\u2019re able to. I do also believe that in a business in which at least half of our patients or more than half of our patients, but about maybe half of our admissions come through the emergency room, I\u2019m sure you can understand that that\u2019s not an easy business to control, and you basically take what comes in and you treat those patients same thing. OB, as an example, tends to be one of a lower-margin service lines in most hospitals. But when a woman comes into the hospital in labor, there\u2019s really no option to do anything but to treat that women, and that\u2019s of course, what we do. So again, I\u2019ve heard what the other companies say, and I think we certainly try and do it to the degree that we can. But I also believe that in a hospital, there\u2019s really a limit to how much of that you can do. I think what we can do in terms of being selective in our business is what I alluded to before in terms of managed care contracting. We don\u2019t have to be in network with managed care payers who are not offering us adequate rates, et cetera. So I think in that regard, that\u2019s an easier sort of function to manage because you can sort of do that in advance. And if somebody is out of network, they\u2019re either going to pay a higher price or they\u2019re going to go to another hospital. But that\u2019s something that I think you can deal with in a more, in my mind, more sort of measured and rational way, and we certainly have talked about that now for several quarters. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Great. And then maybe just last question. I guess, on the psych side, demand has been strong for a number of years, and you guys have been growing slower than how we think about overall demand in psych even before the last couple of years during the pandemic. So just trying to think about, what it means when labor gets better from here, but maybe it\u2019s a little bit elevated than it was in 2019? So like what exactly does that mean from growth? Can you then grow from the way that we think about how this business should be growing in that type of labor environment? Or does that still create a situation where labor is still tight and so they\u2019re still going to be struggles to kind of get to where that business should be? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So Kevin, I go back to late 2019 right before the pandemic, I\u2019m going to say November, December of 2019; January, February of 2020. And you\u2019re right; we were coming off some challenging years. We had seen labor shortages back in 2015 and 2016 that I think we had largely overcome. We saw length-of-stay pressures in 2017 and 2018 from our managed Medicaid payers; I think we have largely overcome. And I would say that four, five month period, late 2019, early 2020; I think we were generally feeling like we were firing on all cylinders for the first time in a long time. And it certainly was still a tight labor market. But there\u2019s a difference between sort of a tight labor market and one in which there are extreme scarcity, which I characterized the way it was during the pandemic. So we had, I think, a four or five month period of kind of just a brief window to see what it would be like to be able to operate without any significant sort of overarching headwinds still in the tight labor market. And we were doing pretty well during that short period. And then, of course, the pandemic occurs in the middle of March of 2020. I think that\u2019s really kind of what we\u2019re shooting for. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to get back to that environment in the next month or the next quarter. But I think, we feel like it\u2019s not something that\u2019s so far away that we can\u2019t see getting there. And I think we feel like there\u2019s a lot of incremental improvement as we return to an environment where we ought to be able to grow the behavioral business revenues in sort of mid- to upper single digits, which we have done for a very long time for a decade and half or so before all this started. And I think that\u2019s the overall plan. And we\u2019re very focused on it. I think Marc alluded to all the money that we\u2019ve invested in recruitment and retention initiatives. We think that there\u2019s a real payoff to all those things over the next couple of years. And again, fundamentally, every measure that we have is that there\u2019s still significant demand out there for behavioral and that, quite frankly, demand for behavioral services is probably in the general population increase during the pandemic rather than decreased. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting in me here. A couple of quick questions. A follow-up question for A.J.\u2019s guidance questions. We said our models appropriately. \u2013 historically about 46% of your EBITDA in the back half of the year comes in 3Q and the rest in 4Q, which means that 3Q, EBITDA about 420 [ph] ballpark. Is that just the right range we should be focusing on? Steve Filton : Yes. So Pito, as you know, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. And I think, as I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times, we\u2019re not going to start doing it during the pandemic when I think there\u2019s greater uncertainties. But I think you\u2019re right. I mean I think in the sense that \u2013 those percentages are probably reasonable. I think what we\u2019ve \u2013 what I\u2019ve said earlier is, clearly, we\u2019ve back loaded more of our earnings into the back half of 2022 than we are in the normal year. And I think what you\u2019re suggesting is there still has to be some level of seasonality. The third quarter is when our patients and our physicians take their vacations, et cetera, during the summertime. So I\u2019m not going to say that those are the right numbers. But I think the thought process is certainly reasonable. Pito Chickering : Great. And then a multipart question for you just back on the labor topic. I guess the first one is, as you look at your RN hourly wage in January versus June or July; have those changed at all in 2022? Or are they stable? And then the same question for techs and LPNs. Are you hiring a lot more LPNs and techs than you used to? And are we seeing sequential labor pressures from those rates? And then finally, can you refresh us on what percent of S&B is RNs and non-RNs? Thanks so much. Steve Filton : Yes. So \u2013 the answer, I think, as I think every business in America is facing is we\u2019re having a harder time hiring just about everybody. And again, as \u2013 not like I follow other industries as closely as some of the folks on this phone but certainly, everything I read, everything I talk to peers, et cetera, indicates that hiring \u2013 quite frankly, hiring people even here in our corporate office is more challenging than it was pre-pandemic. So yes, I mean I think that\u2019s all a challenge. I think what we said a number of times, however, is that while there is certainly some upward pressure on nursing rates and RN rates, in some ways, the pressure has been so great and the opportunities have been so great for nurses to work in these temporary and traveling jobs that raising their rates has really not even been sort of an appropriate reaction. So if a nurse is leaving to take a traveling job in which she is going to earn four times or five times our base salary, there\u2019s really nothing we can offer him or her to compete with that. And so what we do is we try and look at the competitive rates in the market, base rates for RNs, et cetera. But we\u2019re not trying to match those sort of crazy opportunities that nurses are finding in the temporary and traveling area. And what we also have found is that as COVID surges decline, the number of those crazy opportunities decline pretty precipitously as well. So again, I believe back to this, I mean, I think that the labor situation will continue to be a tight one for some time. I think there\u2019ll be upward pressure on nursing rates for some time, but just not nearly the sort of crazy kind of opportunities and crazy pressures we felt when we were paying $225 an hour for a temporary nurse, et cetera, those rates, I think have come down almost by half since their height. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then the hiring of techs and LPNs. Does that sort of change today versus pre-COVID. Do you think that, that sort of this level of LPNs, techs versus RNs, do you think this is right level going forward? Steve Filton : Yes. Look, what I think is ultimately going to happen, and certainly, we\u2019re doing our best to encourage it is we\u2019re going to see more people enter the workforce as \u2013 what we do is we encourage our mental health technicians to go to school and become LPNs or some certified clinical person, we encourage our LPNs to get their RN degrees, et cetera. And obviously, we\u2019re providing help and support for them to do that. So hopefully, over the course of the next few years, not just UHS, but the industry will build a better pipeline. And what we found is that occurs sort of naturally when there is a nursing shortage. Obviously, I think what the pandemic did was it exacerbated that shortage and so made it occur almost overnight in a way that \u2013 that\u2019s not something we\u2019ve experienced before. But I think the overall reactions or focus on building a bigger pipeline of sort of nurse education, progression, et cetera. We\u2019ll start to have a real impact over the course of the next couple of years. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Filton for any closing remarks. Steve Filton : None other than we thank everybody for their time. And wish everybody a good rest of the summer. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. I would like to hand the conference over to your speakers today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Marc Miller, President and CEO. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter, ended September 30, 2022. During the conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2021, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended June 30, 2022. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.50 for the third quarter of 2022. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.54 for the quarter-ended September 30, 2022. Marc Miller : During the third quarter, we experienced a decrease in the number of patients with a COVID diagnosis treated in our hospitals as compared to the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID-diagnosed patients made up 16% of our admissions in the third quarter of 2021, but only 6% of our admissions in the third quarter of 2022. In our Acute segment, this declined in COVID patients resulted in reduced revenues due to the lower acuity and less of the incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients. While overall surgical volume tended to recover to pre-pandemic levels, there was a measurable shift from in-patient to outpatient, resulting in further overall revenue softness. And while we were able to continue to reduce the amount of premium pay in the quarter, which declined from $117 million in the second quarter to $81 million in the third quarter, there was insufficient revenue growth to offset the accelerated rate of wage increases and other inflationary pressures. The $25 million we received in quality incentive fund payments, in Texas, helped to narrow the gap, leading to an Acute EBITDA result in the quarter only slightly below our internal forecasts. At the same time, this decline in COVID activity allowed our Behavioral hospitals to continue to reduce their labor vacancies, resulting in a reduction of the capping of bed capacity. The effect of increased volumes combined with solid pricing increases largely offset higher labor costs, leading to a Behavioral EBITDA result in the quarter slightly below our internal forecasts. Steve Filton : We also note that the third quarter included approximately $8 million of losses related to startup facilities and $4 million to $5 million of losses related to the impact of Hurricane Ian, in late September. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we've incurred approximately $45 million of losses in connection with the startup facilities. Our cash generated from operating activities was $221 million during the third quarter of 2022, as compared to $442 million during the same quarter in 2021. The decline was largely due to the timing of payroll disbursements, the opening of new facilities, and the timing of certain -- or the receipt of certain supplemental reimbursements. We spent $570 million on capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2022. In reaction to the earnings softness experienced this year, we reduced the pace of our capital expenditures by about 22% to -- or $165 million for the first nine months of the year. Similarly, although we moderated the trajectory of our share repurchases, we plan to continue to be an active acquirer of our own shares. For the full-year of 2022, we estimate that we will acquire approximately 80% of the numbers of shares projected in our original guidance. During the third quarter of 2022, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $158 million. During the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased approximately $5.85 million share at an aggregate cost of approximately $704 million. Marc Miller : Yesterday morning, we announced the appointment of Eddie Sim to Executive Vice President and President Acute Care Division, succeeding Marvin Pember, who has announced his intention to retire. Eddie, who brings nearly 30 years of healthcare and leaderships experience, most recently served as Chief Operating Officer at Centura Health, in Denver, Colorado, where he led the system's three operating groups, clinical delivery and shared services, with annual revenues of approximately $5 billion. In this role, he was responsible for supporting improved care coordination, operational and clinical excellence, and alignment across Centura's ecosystem of 19 facilities, and more than 250 clinics. Prior to joining Centura Health, Eddie served in senior leadership roles of increasing responsibility for 11 years, at Baptist Health in Jacksonville, Florida. As president of physician integration there, he was responsible for an employed physician network of 380 physicians, and a clinically integrated network with more than 900 physicians. As we look forward to Eddie joining the company, in early December, we thank Marvin for his 11 years of service to UHS. Under Marvin's leadership, our Acute Care Division has experienced robust growth and expansion in key markets, as well as achieved a significant number of industry accolades and public recognition for quality and service. Marvin will remain with the organization for a transition period following Eddie's start with us, on December 5. We are pleased to answer questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. I guess everyone's starting to look towards 2023. I don't know if you're [hesitant to] [Ph] provide any comment in that direction, that would be fantastic, if not, most of your peers have given us kind of one-time items in 2022 to level-set the base we should be thinking about when thinking about 2023. Can you help us on either side of that analysis? Steve Filton : Sure, Kevin. You know, it has never been UHS' practice to give guidance for the following year until our fourth quarter earnings announcement in February. And we're not going to depart from that this year. I think we've been pretty clear about the non-recurring items in our financials for the year. I'll just sort of comment on the third quarter. The QIF, or Q-I-F reimbursement that we received in Texas, for $25 million that Marc mentioned in his opening remarks, we believe should be a recurring reimbursement item, which is why we did not suggest tossing it out of the third quarter consideration. Other than that, we've identified the startup losses; we've identified the impact of the hurricane, in theory, and they should not reoccur next year. And then finally, I know at least one of our peers described this DPP reimbursement, in Florida, another sort of special Medicaid program. We do not record any of those funds in Q3 of this year, although we expect to record something in the neighborhood about $30 million of those next quarter, in the fourth quarter, and a similar amount next year. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay, that's helpful. Are you thinking about like the government PHE money as kind of a headwind next year or was that tied to COVID volumes and therefore not really necessarily something we should be backing out of this year's numbers? Steve Filton : See, I think it's the latter, Kevin. I mean, those government programs that were meant to subsidize hospitals, whether it was HRSA or the 20% add-on or the sequestration waiver, all were designed to help hospitals deal with the higher acuity and higher expense of COVID patients. As there are fewer COVID patients I think there's less of a need for that. I think the real variable as we think about the Acute business is, particularly in 2022, as COVID volumes have declined, non-COVID volumes, electives and other procedures have been a little bit slower to recover and snap back than they were in 2021. I think we see them slowly coming back. And I think we think that will continue into 2023. But in my mind, the pace of that recovery is probably sort of the most important variable as we think about the performance of the Acute Division, in addition to the other prevalent item which, of course, is just the labor -- the tightness in the labor market. Kevin Fischbeck : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. Maybe on 2022 guidance, you didn't mention in the press release. Is that still a good gauge for this year? And directionally, would you prefer consensus estimates to go to the low-to-mid range given the first three months? How should we think about that for Q4? Steve Filton : Yes, and so I think, and consistent with our prior practice, as we don't mention guidance in the press release, we're affirming our previous issued guidance, which is what we're doing. I think, during the third quarter, and in some public appearances at conferences, et cetera, I think I conceded that the top end of the guidance was practically not a reasonable target. But I think we feel like as long as the trends that we saw in Q3 continue to a reasonable degree in Q4, some place in the lower half of guidance, it should be very achievable, especially with some of the non-recurring items, particularly the DPP moneys, in Florida, that I mentioned in my previous response. Ann Hynes : All right. And just one follow-up question, I think you said in your prepared presentation that you're reducing your expectations for share repurchase by 20%. Can you just talk about the drivers of that, and how we should view this for next year, and also CapEx for next year? I mean, I know you've reduced your budget by 33%, is that just a wait-and-see or do you think that will continue into next year? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, and so just to clarify what I said in the prepared remarks was our original guidance for the year presumed about $1.4 billion in share repurchases, obviously at a higher price than what we've been currently trading at. What I said is that we'd likely repurchase about 80% of the original number of shares. Probably from a dollar standpoint, that's more like 60%, $800 million-$850 million of the original $1.4 billion. Similarly, I think we've trimmed our CapEx forecast, from $1 billion originally, to something, again, more in like the $800 million range. In both cases, we've done that, I think, as out of an abundance of caution. Obviously, in an environment of rising interest rates and just on certain operating trends, we want to be appropriately cautious. We continue to believe that investing in our own EBITDA growth and our own earnings stream is still one of the most prudent investments we can make. So, I think we'll continue to be an active acquirer of shares into next year. We'll be much more specific about what our precise assumptions are when we give our guidance, in February. But I'd suggest it as people think about their models today, you think about CapEx and share repurchase in those sort of ranges of 2022, $800 million-some-odd for CapEx and $800 million-$850 million for share repurchase. Ann Hynes : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Comen with FactSet. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Noah, your line may be on mute. Okay, we'll go ahead and move to our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Austin Gerlach with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Hey, this is Justin Lake, at Wolfe. Thanks. A couple questions here, first on wages. Steve, obviously you guys did a great job of improving contract labor in the quarter. You're already kind of at your fourth quarter targets. So, one, do you expect that to continue moderating or does it stabilize here? And then to your point, a lot of appears to be offset by higher wage growth. Can you give us any color on what wage growth is doing for your permanent employees just so we can get an idea of how that's running in the next year? Steve Filton : Yes, Justin. So, I think on the first question, yes, I think we intend and plan to further reduce premium pay. Premium pay was running about $35 million a quarter in the Acute segment pre-pandemic. I don't think it's realistic to get down to those levels, but I think it's not a stretch to say that we should still be able to get down maybe another $15 million-$20 million at least in the next quarter. To your second point, yes, I mean not all of that reduction sort of falls to the bottom line because some of the cost of reducing that premium pay is increased wages that we're having to pay to recruit and retain talent. I think we've said a number of times over the last several quarters that probably base wage rate inflation in both segments has been running, I'm going to say, 175 to 200 basis points higher than pre-pandemic levels. So, I think, if in Acute it was 3%-3.25% pre-pandemic, it's closer to 5% now. And in April, it was 2%-2.5% pre-pandemic, it's closer to 4%-4.25% now. I think one of the reasons that we're not prepared to talk about specific 2023 guidance is we'd like to see how those trends sort out over the next several months. I think we have a perspective that, given some of the inflationary and other economic pressures out there, that it may actually contribute to somewhat of a lessening of the pressure on wages, and maybe we'll see that number, probably not return to pre-pandemic levels the wage inflation number, but maybe somewhere between where we are today and pre-pandemic levels. But I think that's to be seen over the next several months. Justin Lake : Got it. And you kind of already went to my second question on just inflation. One of your peers talked about inflation, and it seemed like they were talking beyond labor. Just curious, when you think about supply costs, for instance, professional fees, things outside of labor that could be impacted by inflation, are you seeing any kind of pivots there? Anything that's trending that we should think about into 2023? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean if you look at our income statement, clearly the biggest pressure is on the salary and wage line. But certainly we're experiencing inflation on an overall basis throughout our portfolio. As an example, utility costs, although it's a very small percentage of our overall costs, but they have clearly risen by significant numbers in many of our facilities. But again, that the key driver, I think, is wages as our focus is on, again, reducing premium pay, filling as many permanent vacancies as we can. And I think if we can do that, number one, that will drive higher volume growth which will help us offset some of this inflationary pressure. Operator : Thank you. And we will move on to the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jason Cassorla : Great, thanks. Good morning. Just on your prepared remarks around the measurable shift in surgical volumes, the outpatient setting in the quarter, do you believe this move is a sustained construct moving forward, or would you call this as more of a onetime consideration and you would expect a reversion back to a more gradual shift over time? Steve Filton : Jason, obviously in sort of the broader context for the industry this shift from inpatient settings to outpatient settings has been going on for an extended period of time certainly well over a decade. I think it accelerated during the pandemic. From a Behavioral perspective, people I think were in some cases more comfortable receiving care in settings outside of hospitals and hospital emergency rooms. We have seen that just as one example our free standing emergency department. We have about 25 of those today around the country. Have been extremely busy during the pandemic, and especially, I would say over the last six to 12 months. I think again for a variety of reasons people are just more comfortable receiving their care there. I think to a degree we will have sort of normalization back to a bit of a mean. People will return to the hospitals as we move further and further away from the concerns about COVID and COVID surges. But obviously there are other reasons why -- certainly the payors are taking advantage of this opportunity to continue to pressure more business to move to outpatient. And part of -- quite thankfully, we acknowledge all that. And we have been investing in outpatient development in both of our business segments for -- [technical difficulty]. I think the trend accelerated somewhat during the pandemic. But I think more broadly it\u2019s just a continuation of a trend that\u2019s been in place for some time. And I think our business strategy in both of our businesses takes that into account, and we are very cognizant of that. Jason Cassorla : Yes, okay, thanks. And then, just as a follow up here just as we think about the potential wind down of the COVID public health emergency early next year, you have talked in the past about some of the considerations on Medicaid re-determinations and on volumes, but I guess that the incremental dollars that is also rolled in the States are also coming to an end. I know it\u2019s early, but I was wondering what your outlook is for Medicaid rates next year for both side of the business. And if you think there could be pressure there just given the ending of SMAP? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean I think sort of mechanically the ending of SMAP probably creates some incremental headwind although I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily material. Again, I think at a sort of 20,000 foot level, it\u2019s going to be difficult for our reimbursement especially from the government at the Medicare and Medicaid level to fully offset inflation. I think the way we are presuming that the biggest offset to these inflationary increases will be a return to pre-pandemic volumes, and quite frankly, volumes above and beyond pre-pandemic levels, because to be perfectly frank, I don\u2019t think that pricing can account or can offset all of the inflationary pressures that we are going to face. Jason Cassorla : Got it. Okay, thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you and one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. A. J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody. First may be just to ask you about the Behavioral trends in the quarter. Obviously, that bounces back very nicely. Strong -- revenue up 8% and good margin leverage, I assume some of that is because COVID crowded out some psych cases last year and you're just against an easy comp, but any updated thoughts on where we are at in terms of getting back to a normal growth cycle mid single digits or a little better even in the psych hospital businesses and the mix between revenue and volumes? I know historically sort of describe that as about equal 2% to 3% of age. But any updated thoughts on that, given the strong quarter? Steve Filton : I think we have said a number of times during the pandemic, AJ, that our experience has been that during periods of higher COVID utilization, the Behavioral business has clearly struggled more than the Acute business, there's really no benefit to the Behavioral business, there's no increased acuity, there's no increased reimbursement, there's just the challenge of having to isolate COVID patients from the rest of the patient population, often resulting in some closed beds, et cetera. And then there's the pressure on labor. Whenever there's a COVID surge, we have more employees out sick, where even if it's only for a week or two, and it just creates more pressure in an already tight labor environment. So, I think what we experienced in Q3 is what we've experienced previously, like in the second quarter of 2021, in a period of relatively low COVID utilization, which is not nearly as many sort of patient matching problems, and the ability to fill more labor vacancies. And when we're able to do that, we're able to admit more patients. And we've talked about being able in a sort of post-COVID environment, or at least in an endemic environment, being able to achieve that mid-single-digit to upper single digit revenue growth, that we've been able to historically achieve pre-pandemic in the Behavioral business. And the third quarter, I think, was reflective of our ability to do that. The challenge is I don't know that we'll have a sort of straight line of that. We may see another COVID surge in the winter here. But I think as we've -- you said many times, we think the underlying demand for Behavioral services remains quite strong. And as long as we can continue to address and make progress on the labor issue, I think we're going to continue to see revenue growth that's more closely related to our historical trends. A. J. Rice: Okay. And maybe just a question on the Acute side, if I look at some of the metrics length of stay showed a meaningful improvement that obviously is a favorable benefit for you. Any comment on what was going on there? And then some of the companies are talking about even if not year-over-year, because last year had a lot of COVID. Sequentially, they're starting to see stabilization and metrics like payer mix, and in revenue per adjusted admission, particularly on the commercial side was some a little bit of optimism around rate updates for next year. Any comment on any of those metrics that you would want to give? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean I think as to the length of stay question is directly related to the metrics that Marc discussed in his opening remarks. Last year's quarter had 16% of our Acute patients is COVID diagnosed this year at 6%. The reduction in the number of those high acuity COVID patients, I think is sort of directly related to the length of stay decline. I would add that I think we believe that further reductions in length of stay are possible, and are actually maybe one of the most, if not the most significant opportunity, we have to be more efficient in control costs. For many of our patients, certainly for almost all of our government patients, and for even a significant chunk of our commercial patients, we're paid on a per admission basis. So, to the degree that there's an extra day or two of length of stay that is really unnecessary. We're just incurring additional costs without additional reimbursement. And we've struggled during the pandemic for a number of reasons, a lot of it has to do with the inability to refer patients to traditional subacute venues, because they're struggling with some of the same capacity issues we have, and other reasons, but we're very focused on the continued reduction in length of stay. As far as your other question, I don't think we've had a lot of volatility in payer mix during the pandemic. So, I would say it's probably as stable and then continues to be stable. Again I would say the same thing I've now said a number of times, I think what we look forward to, as more and more people just get accustomed to living and working and getting their healthcare in a COVID environment or an endemic environment, that more people will be comfortable seeing their physicians, getting a primary and specialty care that they've historically gotten and getting that care in hospital settings and hospital outpatient settings. And we think that that trend has started to manifest itself and will continue. A. J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow-up on Justin\u2019s labor question, Steve, I think you mentioned another $15 million to $20 million in potential improvement in the fourth quarter. Do you have visibility into that level of improvement today based on the current trend and anything else you would point to that\u2019s going to drive sequential EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Steve Filton : All I would say Andrew is, we\u2019ve obviously had a significant amount of success in the Acute division in reducing premium pay. It peaked at about $150 million in Q1. It was $117 million in Q2, as Mark said, and then $81 million in this third quarter. So, we\u2019ve seen that trending down and believe that we can continue to propel that further reduction. Obviously, there is some sort of level of fixed amount of premium pay that is appropriate. I was saying, of a $35 million pre-pandemic. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a realistic target at this point. But that\u2019s the basis on which we believe that we can continue to reduce that number. It\u2019s clearly a trend and it has not yet flattened out and I don\u2019t think it will. Andrew Mok : Got it. Okay. As a follow-up, I think, Steve, you mentioned earlier this year that you\u2019re starting to enhance your footprint in the Medicaid assisted treatment line. Can you update us on your progress there and how would you characterize the broader MAT opportunity over the next 18 months? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a -- at the moment, it\u2019s a relatively sort of fragmented process in the sense that really doing it kind of boots on the ground, developing some MAT facilities doing or pursuing some kind of small one, two, three off acquisition type areas. And I think as I\u2019ve mentioned before we don\u2019t necessarily see this as a huge driver of growth in the future as much as we see it as really enhancing our very fulsome continuum of care in the Behavioral space. We treat virtually all diagnosis across inpatient, outpatient settings. And MAT was just sort of a gap in that. So, we\u2019re going to continue to pursue the opportunity to do that at least in some of our markets. But it\u2019s really much, much -- part of a much broader strategy of being one of the more comprehensive providers or maybe the most comprehensive provider of Behavioral services in the country. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes on the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Yes. Hi, thanks for the question. Wanted to ask a follow-up on the pricing discussion earlier, I think you suggested that it might be challenging for your pricing yield to keep up with inflationary pressures, but just wanted to clarify that. Was that commentary specific to your government yield or your overall pricing yield? And I guess my actual question would\u2019ve been just wanted to get an update on your commercial rate negotiations for 2023. I guess what percentage of your commercial book will be in the first year of a new contract in 2023? And then what do you think the incremental yield would be compared to a typical update? Thank you. Marc Miller : Yes. So, I think my previous comments clearly called out the fact that because half of our revenue comes from government sources and we know that they\u2019re simply not at the moment keeping up with inflation. Although, I think we believe that we\u2019ll continue to get incremental increases from those government sources over the next couple of years that that was probably the bigger challenge. I think on the commercial side of things, we continue to seek higher rates and more acknowledgement from our commercial payers that we need greater reimbursement to operate in this sort of inflationary environment. On the Behavioral side that overall pricing has been stronger -- were strong in the quarter. We\u2019ve talked in previous calls about our relatively aggressive stance that we\u2019ve been taking with a number of payers in part because that\u2019s a business in which we\u2019ve been capacity constrained. So, it makes sense to us or for us to go to our lowest paying payers and either require them to come up to market levels of reimbursement or terminate those contracts. Because if we\u2019re going to turn patients away, it makes sense to terminate those that are sort of the most inadequate, if you will, payers. On the Acute side, and again, this idea of sort of how many of our contracts have been renewed, et cetera. I think is a little bit outdated in the sense that virtually all of our managed care contracts have short-term out that most of them have 90 or 120 day out. So, we\u2019re renegotiating contracts in both our Acute and Behavioral spaces where we think there\u2019s an opportunity, where we think that a payer may be under market, where we think that we might have an appropriate amount of leverage to press for greater rates, et cetera. So, yes, we will definitely get more relief on the pricing side, clearly on our commercial side of the business, and we\u2019re aggressively seeking that. And again I was sort of describing the shortfall clearly as being more on the government side. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with SVB Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on contract labor for just one second, Steve, how much of the improvement in the third quarter was utilization versus bill rates? And do you have an idea of what your exit rate was in the quarter? I\u2019ve got you pegged at around 10% of Acute SWB in the quarter, but just wondering if that trended maybe a little bit more favorably towards the end of the quarter. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean I think and in my mind, this is sort of intuitive that the improvement in premium pay is a combination of both rate and utilization. Obviously, as the demand for those temporary and traveling nurses comes down, the rates that are required or being demanded for them comes down as well. So, I would say it\u2019s a pretty even mix of rate and value coming down. I don\u2019t have the specific month by month premium pay numbers in front of me with, but as you know, I was sort of referring to in my -- in a previous response, I mean what we -- I think have seen is a steady incremental decline in premium pay since the beginning of the year when COVID volumes peaked. And so I think our exit rate in the quarter was certainly higher or how we going to view it a lower amount of premium pay or a greater reduction than it was in the beginning. Whit Mayo : Okay. And do you have a number for the contract labor spin in the Behavioral segment? I know and recognize that it\u2019s not as significant of a pain point, but just wanted to see if you had that. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean I think historically it\u2019s been about a third of what it is in the Acute side, but I don\u2019t have the specific number in front of me. Whit Mayo : Okay. Well, one last one just corporate overhead, I know this number bounces around, but came in lower than sort of where we thought it might shake out. Just any developments or anything to call out would be helpful. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I don\u2019t think anything terribly specific. I will say that the decline in corporate overhead in Q3 of this year was pretty consistent with what we experienced last year, but as we\u2019ve analyzed those numbers, there\u2019s nothing terribly material driving that. Whit Mayo : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gary Taylor : Hi, good morning. Just a couple quick ones for me, it doesn\u2019t sound like on the hurricane any material impact expected to continue into the fourth quarter, that was just a disruption, but nothing damaging that would be continuing? Marc Miller : That\u2019s correct, Gary. We didn\u2019t suffer fortunately any significant physical damage in any of our facilities. So, I think all the impacts were temporary and most should be recovered in the fourth quarter. Gary Taylor : And then on the Florida DPP for 4Q I know you\u2019d mentioned that earlier in the year. I just want to make sure I understand a $30 million, is that the EBITDA impact or is there I\u2019m thinking of the other companies have had like a gross revenue number or a provider tax number associated with it, and then a net sort of EBITDA? Steve Filton : Yes, so that $30 million is the EBITDA impact. Gary Taylor : Okay. And then last one, when I look at modeling the Acute segment, the line that really is most challenging for me I am just struggling to stay up it and perhaps understand is that other operating expense line that\u2019s up almost $100 million year-over-year. I don\u2019t think there is any contract labor in there. I think it\u2019s professional fees and utilities and insurance is like the most largest items cited in that bucket. Could you just maybe confirm that? And maybe just help us think about that up a $100 million year-over-year, what the two or three largest drivers of that are? Steve Filton : Sure. So, clearly and we have talked about this on previous calls the most significant driver and I think the biggest distortion is the insurance subsidiary where we record our medical loss ratio in that line. And because the medical loss ratio for our insurance subsidiary like any insurance subsidiary is 85 or 90% of revenues. And otherwise, that other operating expense line for our hospitals is more something like 20% revenue. And to a degree that there is a revenue increase in the insurance subsidiary, it sort of distorts that line. So, in the third quarter, there is about $30 million to $40 million increase in insurance subsidiary revenues and expenses. If you adjust that out of other operating expenses, I think rather than like a 15% increase quarter-over-quarter it\u2019s certainly like 10%. And I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable go-forward. I don\u2019t have the year-to-date numbers in front of me. But, we can certainly provide those. We will make a point I think when we give guidance for 2023 of trying to separate out the impact of the insurance subsidiary and those numbers. So, it\u2019s easier for people to follow. I understand the difficulty that creates. Gary Taylor : Yes. Steve, I have the three largest buckets of spend on the Acute other OpEx correct, when we think about professional fees, [utilities and share queue] [Ph]. Steve Filton : Yes, I would say after adjusting out the insurance, there is a bunch of miscellaneous things. Probably the other most volatile item in the most recent past has been physician payment. So, our payments to physicians including locum physicians and increased subsidies for hospital-based physicians et cetera would be recorded on that line. And so you are seeing some impact of that, and then just the impact of broad general inflation. Gary Taylor : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Three follow-up questions that is focused on Behavioral, number one, how did behavioral business track in September October? Is it fair to think about 3Q admission growth continuing in the fourth quarter? Number two, if 3Q margins Behavioral the right sort of run rate for the fourth quarter? And number three, thinking about 2023 behavioral if pricing is 4% to 5% range and wages in the low 4% range, is there any reason we should not think about margin improvement in Behavioral in 2023? Thanks so much. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean -- look, I think we made these comments broadly. And I think most hospitals have made these comments broadly. July volumes in both Behavioral and Acute were really rather soft. August tracked better. And I think September was sort of a reflection of the two month -- the two earlier months combined. So, I think the trend is upward. But I think what we have learnt during the pandemic is the trends are a bit more volatile than they have been historically. But again, I think the thing that we say with some confidence is that in periods of lower COVID utilization, Behavioral volumes will tend to trend upward. And that\u2019s been our experience. As far as the sort of question about if we continue to have mid single digit and upper single revenue growth as we did in Q3, should that be enough to allow for margin improvement? I think the answer is yes. I mean I think we saw that in the quarter. And I don\u2019t think there is any reason why we shouldn\u2019t continue to see that going forward. Pito Chickering : What\u2019s the follow-up on the Acute wages, are you seeing your competitors sort of raise full-time employee wages multiple times during 2022, like it did in 2021? Or are we just generally all coming with same levels and, hence, why you think the wage inflation in Acute should be less in '23 than in '22? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean we definitely saw our acute care peers raising wage rates, often multiple times during 2022, and again particularly during COVID surges. As I said, I mean I think that our hope is that with COVID volumes more stable, and hopefully without another really significant surge, like we saw in January '20 and January '21, wage rates will be more reasonable, and wage rate increases will be more reasonable in 2023. Look, the other issue is, I think as most people know, I mean I think most of our not-for-profit peers are struggling financially, and then that may be an understatement. So I think, again, the hope is that their willingness to give what we believe will be characterized as outsized pay increases, they're going to have much less of an appetite for that in 2023 than maybe they did in '21. Pito Chickering : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. You said in your prepared remarks that you were able to lower the previous admission cap in Behavioral due to filling the vacant positions. Can you give any color on what percentage of admissions you had to turn away in 3Q, and what that looked like [technical difficulty] pre-pandemic? Steve Filton : Yes, Sarah, we generally don\u2019t give those metrics because I think they're hard to measure across the portfolio consistently, not every hospital tracks it the same way, et cetera. We do try and track it, but internally. But I've been reluctant to give those metrics out publicly. And what I will say is what we do know during the pandemic is that the percentage of inbound call volume or -- we call it call volume, but it could be over the internet, et cetera, that we were able to satisfy was significantly lower than it was pre-pandemic. And the main reason for that was because of again, I'm going to describe it as capped beds. And the beds could have been capped either because we were isolating COVID patients in certain units or because we didn\u2019t have enough staff. And again, what we have manifested many times when COVID volumes decline is we know that the number of uncapped beds increase as COVID volumes come down. It's difficult to give a precise impact of that. But again, I think you can see it in the 8% same-store revenue growth in Q3. Sarah James : Got it. And given the, roughly, $200 million reduction in CapEx guide in conjunction with your commentary in 2Q that you're leaning on de novo openings this year related to staffing shortages. What impact does that have on openings going forward? And is it influencing your thoughts around what new builds might happen in '23? Steve Filton : I think it's mostly a timing issue. I think that we have a view that CapEx investments that make economic sense that pencil out to a reasonable return, et cetera, make sense. They may not make sense from a timing perspective to add capacity in an environment in which we're already having difficulty staffing the existing capacity we have. But ultimately, they'll get built. So, I don\u2019t know that there's any 2022 -- because the reality is 2023 large expansion projects that would be adding capacity -- scheduled capacity are probably already well-committed too. I think that our deferral or delay in CapEx probably pushes out some '24 projects to '25, and '25 to '26, it's that sort of thing, rather than, I think, an immediate impact in '23. Sarah James : That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Comen with FactSet. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Noah, your phone may be on mute. Operator : All right, I am showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Filton for any further remarks. Steve Filton : We'd just like to thank everybody for their time this morning, and look forward to -- Operator : Please go ahead. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Steve Filton : I\u2019m Steve Filton. Marc Miller is joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2022. During the conference call, we\u2019ll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. We\u2019d like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.43 for the fourth quarter of 2022. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, primarily an asset impairment charge associated with an acute care hospital in Las Vegas, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.02 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Marc Miller : During the fourth quarter, our acute care hospitals experienced a decrease in the number of patients with a COVID diagnosis treated in our hospitals as compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 7% of our admissions in the fourth quarter of 2021, but only about half of that percentage of admissions in the fourth quarter of 2022. This decline in COVID patients resulted in reduced revenues due to the lower acuity and less of the incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients. While overall surgical volumes tended to recover to pre-pandemic levels, there was a measurable shift from inpatient to outpatient, resulting in further overall revenue softness. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter, which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter was $85 million in the fourth quarter, similar to what it was in the third quarter. In total, there was insufficient revenue growth to offset the accelerated rate of wage increases and other inflationary pressures, leading to an acute EBITDA result in the quarter below our internal forecasts. At the same time, this decline in COVID activity allowed our behavioral hospitals to continue to reduce their labor vacancies, resulting in a reduction of the capping of bed capacity. The effect of the increased revenue largely offset higher labor costs, leading to a behavioral EBITDA result in the quarter more in line with our internal forecasts. Steve Filton : We also note that the fourth quarter included approximately $10 million of losses related to start-up facilities. Our cash generated from operating activities was $297 million during the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $322 million during the same quarter in 2021. The decline was largely due to the opening of new facilities and the timing of receipt of certain supplemental reimbursements. We spent $734 million on capital expenditures during 2022. Reaction to the earnings softness experienced during the year, we reduced the pace of our capital expenditure spend by about one quarter from our original plans for the year. Similarly, we moderated the trajectory of our share repurchases. For the full year of 2022, we acquired $811 million of our own shares pursuant to our share repurchase program. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchased more than 20% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2022, we had $886 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. Marc Miller : Our 2023 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night\u2019s release, Envision\u2019s 2023 as a year of continued transition into a post-pandemic world. We anticipate that volumes in both segments and acuity in our acute business will continue their recovery trajectory and gradually begin to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. Similarly, we expect to be able to reduce premium pay by about one-third in 2023 from 2022 levels as we continue to increase hiring rates and reduce turnover as a result of multiple recruitment and retention programs that have been implemented over the last few years. Again, we\u2019ve assumed these improvements will occur incrementally during the year. But will be partially offset by wage pressures created by a continued shortage of nurses and other clinical personnel and by broader inflationary pressures affecting our other expenses. We note that in our Acute segment, physician subsidy expense is specifically anticipated to increase by a substantial amount. Other headwinds that are reflected in our 2023 forecast are approximately $100 million in COVID-related reimbursement received in 2022, but phased out in 2023 as well as a reduction of about $30 million in supplemental reimbursement payments as disclosed in our 10-K. Finally, we will incur a significant increase in interest expense in 2023. About three quarters of which was due to rising interest rates and the remainder to increased borrowings. Despite these challenges, we note that some of the operating indicators in early 2023 have been encouraging, especially in our behavioral health business. During the pandemic, we have found the pace of recovery from several of the aforementioned challenges has often been slower than we originally anticipated and have reflected that gradual cadence of recovery in our forecast. However, we remain confident in the fundamental strength of both our business segments, given our well-positioned hospital franchises around the country. We are pleased to answer questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first call comes from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS. Your line is now open. Andrew Mok : Hi good morning. You mentioned softer revenue in the Acute segment due to lower acuity. Can you elaborate on the trends in surgical volumes and underlying acuity that you saw in the fourth quarter? And what do you have embedded in the guide for 2023? Or when do you expect that to normalize? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, Andrew. So, I think as Marc remarked in his commentary, and you can see in our press release metrics, revenue per adjusted admission was actually down for the quarter. I think attributable to a few factors. One is the decline in COVID patients, those COVID patients, particularly last year, particularly the Omicron patients tended to be higher acuity patients and the loss of those patients and the loss of their good reimbursement reduces our acuity in our revenue. In addition to that, Marc talked about the shift, the accelerated shift from inpatient to outpatient. Our surgical volumes in Q4 actually, we\u2019re probably 3% or 4% above what they were in Q4 of 2019, the last pre-pandemic quarter, full pre-pandemic quarter, but clearly, there\u2019s been an accelerated shift. I think that outpatient procedures are probably up 7% or 8% and inpatient procedures are sort of flattish. So, I think those are the main drivers of the acuity softness in Q4. As far as what we have built into the guidance for next year, I think, again, as Marc sort of comments reflected, I think we\u2019re projecting a gradual sort of return to normalcy. So for the year, I think our general notion is that acute care revenue per adjusted admission should increase probably in that 2% to 4% range, which would be much closer to sort of the historical norms. Operator : Our next call comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : [Indiscernible] least directionally by segment. Appreciating the color you gave on some of the onetime items in the acute care business. It sounds like that\u2019s likely the source of maybe some of the year-on-year pressure there, but it\u2019d be great if you could elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re expecting for year-over-year margin trends in both the acute and the behavioral business? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, Steve, I think we missed the beginning part of your question somehow. So if you wouldn\u2019t mind repeating it, I apologize. Stephen Baxter : Yes. Sorry about that. So yes, the additional color on EBITDA growth and top-line growth by segment would be great. Just trying to understand a little bit when we look at the year-over-year margin pressure, where that\u2019s coming from? It sounds like with some of the items you flagged on the acute side, it looks like that\u2019s probably it, but just a better sense on the direction of margin trends in both businesses. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So, I think on the acute side, there are specific headwinds, again, most of which I think Marc elaborate on, one \u2013 and probably the biggest one is $100 million of COVID-related reimbursement that includes the Medicare 20% add-on, the Hertz [ph] reimbursement and Medicare sequestration waver all of which get phased out at one point or another already phased out in 2023. I\u2019ll throw into that, although not COVID related, another $10 million or so of 340B reimbursement that\u2019s going to get recouped in 2023. In addition to that, there\u2019s \u2013 Marc noted about $30 million of supplemental Medicaid reimbursement that declines next year. That\u2019s about $20 million in the behavioral business and $10 million in the acute business. I think the other main issue is that even though, again, as Marc commented, we\u2019re expecting premium pay to decline another one-third, maybe another $150 million, $160 million in 2023, what our experience has been is that the savings from that, and there certainly are some savings, but the savings from that are offset to a large degree by increased base wages, recruitment incentives, sign-on bonuses, that sort of thing. I think what our guidance, particularly in the acute business implies or assumes is that all those trends sort of incrementally improve as the year goes on. But those are the headwinds, I think, specifically on the acute side of the business that mainly sort of tend to suppress the margins. And on the behavioral side, it\u2019s really more on the labor side. I mean I think we\u2019re at in both businesses is that at the moment, even though revenues are recovering, particularly on the behavioral side, salary expense or wage expenses still outpacing the growth in revenues. I think we believe that by the second half of 2023, that begins to sort of stabilize and we start to sort of get to a more normalized historical pattern of revenue growth exceeding salary growth. But in the first half of the year, that\u2019s not the case. And again, I think that\u2019s probably the main driver of the margin pressure next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi. Jason? Jason Cassorla : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the move to wind down in patient operations at your Desert Springs Hospital. Maybe just can you unpack that a bit more in the decision there? What the EBITDA lift could be on the go forward? And then anything else to note from a competitive perspective as we think about your Las Vegas market broadly? Thanks. Marc Miller : Yes, sure. I can answer that, for you. So, we obviously \u2013 that\u2019s a very important market for us. We\u2019ve been looking at the whole market \u2013 the market as a whole for many years. We continue to try to build where we can at current properties as well as some of our de novo projects. We have a new project that\u2019s going in that is really \u2013 we\u2019re looking at it as a replacement hospital for Desert Springs. Originally, we had hoped to keep Desert Springs operating longer into the future and closer to our opening date, if not all the way up to our opening date for our new West Henderson Hospital. But the market dynamics caused us to have to accelerate the plan there. So what we\u2019ve done basically is, we\u2019re moving that hospital to a glorified emergency services facility and we\u2019ll continue to run those services even after we have our new hospital in West Hendersonville, and we\u2019re really transferring just about all of those employees to other valley system facilities. So, we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s been misreported that we\u2019re laying off a lot of employees. In fact, we\u2019re really not. And like I said, just about every one of those employees is finding a home in another one of our hospitals, which has helped alleviate some of the staffing pressures that we\u2019ve had. So that\u2019s really the situation. I don\u2019t know the timing on the numbers. West Henderson won\u2019t be open for about another year and a half, I want to say middle to late 2024? Steve Filton : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. A.J.? A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Thanks. Maybe just two items. And when I think about your outlook, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re assuming an uptick in physician subsidy expense. I wondered what\u2019s happening there? I know in the back half of the year, your other operating expense in 2022 seemed to step up. Are you just assuming that continues? Or is there something else going on there and chances to mitigate? And then any update on your capital deployment thoughts? I know you probably got some share repurchase in the 2023 outlook. Can you just comment on that? And anything else that you\u2019re thinking about from a capital standpoint? Steve Filton : Sure, A.J. Yes, so physician subsidy expense, I think, has been kind of an emerging challenge for most of the acute hospital industry, I would say, for at least the back half of 2022, and I think most acknowledge it will continue into next year. So that\u2019s \u2013 when we talk about that, we\u2019re really talking about the generally, the contract service expense we pay to physicians who are providing services in our emergency rooms, anesthesiologists, radiologists, those are probably the major groups. And you\u2019re right, we have seen some increase in those expenses this year. I think we continue to assume that 2023 will probably result in another 15% to 20% increase in those expenses and the magnitude of that is probably a $45 million, $50 million increase in costs. Now I think long term, we have a number of strategies to deal with that cost pressure, including in-sourcing some of that activity to the degree that we can and competitively bidding contracts, et cetera. I think at the moment, we\u2019re caught in a tough situation because it\u2019s difficult to change those arrangements in the short term. But in the long term, I think a lot of those pressures are a result of some of the internal struggles that some of those larger staffing \u2013 physician staffing companies are having. And I think as those work their way out and the market adjusts, we will see some easing of that in future years. But we\u2019ve assumed, as Marc said, a substantial increase in 2023. As far as capital deployment goes, we\u2019ve got embedded in the budget about $600 million of share repurchase assumed. And we\u2019ve also got about $800 million of capital expense or capital expenditures assumed in the budget as we\u2019ve disclosed in the press release. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven? Steven Valiquette : [Technical Difficulty] Steve Filton : Steve, can I interrupt? You\u2019re breaking up. So unless we can get a better connection, I can\u2019t hear your question. I apologize. Operator : Would you please restate your question? Steven. Steven Valiquette : Not sure it\u2019s better or not. Steve Filton : Yes, that\u2019s better. Thank you. Operator : Please, go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Sure. I apologize [Technical Difficulty]. Steve Filton : Steve, I apologize. You\u2019re breaking up again. Maybe you can try to call back with \u2013 on a different line. Operator : Yes, Steven, you can reenter in the queue. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to our next questioner who is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Can you hear me okay? Steve Filton : Yes, we can. Justin Lake : Good, thanks. So Steve, I was hoping \u2013 it sounds like there\u2019s a very different trajectory between the acute business, given the headwinds there in the behavioral business, which seems to be acting better. So within the full year guidance, can you give us a little color on the growth we should expect year-over-year broken down between the acute business, the behavioral business and then maybe even the kind of corporate segment would be helpful as well.  And then, Marc, maybe you could give us a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing on the shift from inpatient to outpatient and what\u2019s driving that? How big an impact is it having? And how are you thinking about it into 2023? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So looking at the two segments discretely, I think as we\u2019ve suggested a number of times in the past, we thought that as COVID volumes declined, the recovery in the behavioral business would be more accelerated than in the acute in large part because there was never any benefit to increased COVID volume in the behavioral business. We didn\u2019t get paid anymore for patients. And quite frankly, it created more staffing challenges. It created more sort of patient matching challenges, that sort of thing. So what I think you saw in the fourth quarter, and I think a continuation, quite frankly, what we saw in the third quarter, was, as COVID volumes declined, I think Marc commented on this at the outset of the call, we\u2019ve been able to more successfully fill our nursing and other clinical vacancies and as a consequence of being able to incrementally improve our volumes, particularly as measured by patient days. And that continues into next year. With the challenges I indicated, I think, in the earlier call is the price we\u2019ve had to pay to fill those vacancies is higher base wages and some incentive payments and that sort of thing, which I think suppresses margins certainly at the beginning of the year, although hopefully, they improve as the year progresses. But probably, at the end of the day, the 2023 forecast assumes slightly increased margins in the behavioral business.  The acute business, a little bit different as we talked about, they have to replace the benefit of the COVID volumes that they had. They\u2019ve got to deal with the headwinds that we were specific about as such. So at the end of the day, I think that acute care EBITDA and is relatively flat in 2023, which means margins are down slightly. We have some increase in corporate costs, things like our equity, stock equity compensation or incentive compensation because we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019ll meet targets more fully in 2023 than we did in 2022, so that sort of thing. So I think slightly increasing margins on the behavioral side, slightly declining on the acute side and some kind of disparate sort of cost increases on the corporate side to get to the full budget guidance that we provided. Marc Miller : And with regards to your question on inpatient versus outpatient, I mean, I think we\u2019re seeing what many are seeing, which is a continued shift to outpatient that has been accelerated through the pandemic we\u2019re trying to continue to do a lot of the things that we\u2019ve been doing in the last few years, which is to ensure that we have the proper paste load in our inpatient surgical areas especially with the increases in costs for staffing those areas, we want to make sure that we have the proper acuity. We\u2019re not doing low-level cases, really outpatient cases in an inpatient setting where we can\u2019t cover the cost properly. So our shift, I think, is pretty similar to a lot of others. We are also trying to accelerate our development of surgical centers so that we have more opportunities and more platforms for all of our surgery cases in as many markets as possible. So we continue to develop those as we find opportunities to do so. Operator : Thank you. Our next call comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Behavioral \u2013 can you hear me? Operator : Yes. Steve Filton : Yes, we can hear you now. Pito Chickering : Okay. There we go. On behavioral, how many beds left that you can\u2019t staff? And how do you think that ramps or during 2023? And as staffing and behavior becomes easier post-COVID, I\u2019m wondering what areas of health care were the biggest source of those hires? And then finally, as you can start staffing again, do you increase your CapEx for behavioral beds to keep driving growth there over the next few years? Steve Filton : Yes. So Pito, it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a number. I mean, I think we\u2019re down to a few hundred beds in behavioral that we would consider capped on most days. Now to be fair, that number can change literally day-to-day, et cetera. So we do still feel like the patients are turned away in certain situations because we don\u2019t have appropriate staffing a lot of times that may be specific to, let\u2019s say, weekend or overnight staffing it really does differ by facility. But you\u2019re right. I mean that\u2019s probably been the single biggest headwind for the behavioral business during the pandemic in large part because we were losing employees, mostly nurses, but other clinical personnel, therapists, psychologists, et cetera to other settings where either they have the opportunity to work remotely or they had the opportunity to work in an acute care setting, making sort of premium dollars. As those opportunities have declined and I think telemedicine procedures have intended to decline as the pandemic has eased and certainly, the demand from acute care hospitals for COVID treating nurses, I think, has declined as well. We\u2019re seeing more of those nurses return to what I would describe as the behavioral fold. To your sort of last question, yes, I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve been more tempered, if you will, about behavioral capacity addition during the pandemic because the thought was what\u2019s the point of adding additional capacity if we\u2019re not going to be able to staff it. But as those staffing pressures continue to ease, I think we\u2019ve made the point throughout the pandemic that we think that the underlying demand for behavioral services across the full continuum is quite strong and robust, and we still believe that. And so yes, we are certainly looking and trying to gauge in individual markets where additional capacity may be called for because the demand is there and because we feel like we can adequately staff any additional capacity that we\u2019ve built. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next call will come from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin, please wait until you hear your name announced. Kevin? Kevin Fischbeck : Hey, so I guess on the call last quarter, you mentioned that I think that there\u2019s a tailwind this year from start-up losses year-over-year. Can you just remind us kind of how we should be thinking about that? And then you kind of in your opening remarks mentioned that this year is kind of still a normalization off of COVID. I mean do you feel like 2023 is now going to be a solid base off of which we should be expecting normal growth in acute and psycho. Do you feel like because of the way you\u2019re assuming progression through the year on these dynamics that even 2024 could see some year-over-year SKU comparisons? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So as far as your first question on start-up losses, Kevin, we mentioned in \u2013 or I mentioned in today\u2019s call that we had $10 million in the quarter, I think we had said at the in our third quarter call that we had $45 million of year-to-date start-up losses. So $55 million for the year. The biggest chunk of that is our acute care hospital that we opened early in 2022 in Reno, that\u2019s probably a $30 million, $35 million swing from 2022 to 2023, a positive swing.  The other $15 million, $20 million of losses are a handful, maybe three or four behavioral openings in the year, maybe four or five, and we probably have a similar number of openings next year. I think we believe we\u2019ll do a little bit better in emerging from the pandemic and getting these things ramping up faster. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe that as a material tailwind. So I think we\u2019ve got about a $30 million, $35 million tailwind in the budget for our turnaround in our Reno hospital.  As far as just sort of how we think about 2023, is it sort of kind of a clean post-pandemic year, Marc made comments in his opening remarks about the idea that, number one, I think we view 2023 as a transition year, and we do so because I think one of the lessons that we\u2019ve learned during the pandemic is that even as COVID volumes decline, there is this sort of transition period as nurses returned to their regular jobs and physicians return to their regular practices and patients return to their regular utilization practices, et cetera. So I think we think about that occurring gradually over the course of 2023. I would say probably the back half of 2023 looks a lot more like maybe the back half of 2019, the last sort of COVID-free half a year that we\u2019ve experienced. And then in 2024, I would imagine, unless there is some unforeseen development begins to look like a really true post pandemic year. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next call comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Jamie, please stand by. Jamie? Jamie Perse : Hey, good morning. Can you guys hear me okay? Operator : Yes. Steve Filton : We can. Jamie Perse : Okay. Great. First, just a quick numbers question. Can you provide the revenue base for the insurance subsidiary and what the margin looks like on that? And then my longer-term question is just for in this structurally higher wage inflation environment for nurses, given the tightness in that market, what can you do over the medium term to just get more efficient? What does that mean for care team design or investment in labor-saving technologies? Just anything you\u2019re doing to become more efficient on the labor front? Steve Filton : Yes. So in answer to your question about our insurance subsidiary in the Acute segment, it has roughly or will have in 2023, about $400 million of premium revenue and we\u2019ll run as we sort of discussed in the past, kind of a modest margin in the low single digits. The real motivation in operating that insurance subsidiary is to create sort of a full continuum of care in our acute care markets, greater integration with our physicians, et cetera, it\u2019s not really designed to be terribly profitable on its own.  As far as your second question about recruitment retention, look, there\u2019s a lot of things, and we could have a whole separate hour-long call. And Marc, I think, alluded to multiple recruitment and retention initiatives that we\u2019ve implemented during the pandemic. But I think you specifically asked about sort of patient care treatment sort of treatment structures and whatnot. And we\u2019ve tried to in both of our businesses create staffing infrastructures that are not so reliant on registered nurses because those have been the most difficult positions to recruit to during the pandemic. So we\u2019re becoming more reliant on things like LPNs and LVNs and mental health techs in the behavioral business and EMTs and that sort of thing in our emergency rooms, all those kinds of things. So we certainly have been working to really improve the recruitment and retention of the nursing population itself, but also trying to reduce our reliance, particularly on registered nurses who have been the most difficult to recruit. Marc Miller : But I\u2019ll just add, there are a number of technological solutions that are being bandied about on both sides, both segments. And we continue to evaluate a lot of those as some of our peers do as well. I do think in the coming years, there will be some that we go forward with. I\u2019m not sure that there \u2013 any of them are going to be a real panacea, but I do think that they can be helpful depending on cost to alleviate some of the staffing issues that we\u2019ve had over the past few years going forward. So we are excited about the possibility of some of those adding to the mix in the coming years. Operator : Thank you. Our next call will come from the line of Ben Hendrix, RBC Capital Markets. Please standby. Ben? Ben Hendrix : Yes, thank you. Just a quick regulatory question. There was a proposed rule from CMS concerning the 1115 waiver payment and implications there for calculation of a disproportional share payments for acute. Just wanted to see if you guys had any initial thoughts on that? I think you may have probably less exposure to that than some of your peers, but I just wanted to get any initial takes on that proposed rule. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, so we\u2019ve commented a number of times and then with reference or direct people to our 10-K filing where we detailing in pretty specific detail our supplemental Medicaid payments in the current year in 2022 and then what we expect for 2023. I mentioned before, we\u2019re expecting about a $30 million decline next year across a number of states. To your point, Ben, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting a big change in tech or some of the 1115 change. But in total, there\u2019s about a $30 million reduction in supplemental payments next year, including disproportion share over maybe two or three states. Ben Hendrix : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions in the queue. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Steve, for any closing remarks. Steve Filton : We\u2019d just like to thank everybody for their time this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation today. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Thank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first Quarter ended March 31, 2023. During the conference call, we\u2019ll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. We\u2019d like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.28 for the first quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.34 for the quarter ended March 31st, 2023. During the first quarter, our behavioral health hospitals produced strong results. The decline in COVID activity allowed our behavioral hospitals to continue to reduce their labor vacancies, resulting in a reduction of the capped bed capacity and a 4.7% year-over-year increase in adjusted patient days. Combined with a healthy 5% increase in net revenue per adjusted patient day, overall revenues grew by almost 10% over the prior year quarter. And with that level of revenue growth, same-store behavioral EBITDA margins increased from 20% to almost 23%.  Our acute hospitals experienced strong demand for their services with adjusted admissions increasing 10.5% year-over-year. For a variety of reasons, revenue growth was more muted at 3.5%. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 14% of our admissions in the first quarter of 2022, but only 4% of admissions in the first quarter of 2023. This decline in COVID patients resulted in reduced revenues due to the lower acuity and less of the incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients. The impact of the COVID support payments, including HRSA, Medicare sequestration, and the 20% Medicare add-on was a $42 million headwind in the first quarter compared to the same prior year period. There was also $15 million of out of period Texas TERP reimbursement recorded in Q1 of 2022 that did not recur in this year's quarter. While overall surgical volumes were robust, increasing a little over 10% from the prior year quarter, there was a continuing shift from inpatient to outpatient resulting in further overall revenue pressures. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter, which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter of 2022 was $85 million in the first quarter, similar to what it was in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The dramatic increase in volume is the major reason that premium pay has not declined further. It's worth noting that our average hourly rate, which includes premium pay, was 7% lower than it was in the first quarter of 2022. In total, the robust volume growth offset by lower revenue per adjusted admission resulted in flat same-store acute care EBITDA compared to last year's quarter. We also note that the first quarter acute non-same-store results included approximately $10 million of a headwind for the impact of the Desert Springs Hospital closure and approximately $5 million of losses related to startup facilities. Our cash generated from operating activities was $291 million during the first quarter of 2023 as compared to $445 million during the same quarter in 2022. The decline was largely due to an unfavorable change of $183 million in other working capital accounts, primarily due to the timing of disbursements for accrued compensation and accounts payable. In the first quarter of 2023, we spent $169 million on capital expenditures and acquired 650,000 of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $79 million. Since the inception of the current share repurchase program in 2014, we have repurchase more than 20% of the company's outstanding shares. As of March 31st, 2023, we had $875 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. I'll now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments. Marc Miller : Thanks Steve, and good morning. In our year-end conference call, we said we envisioned 2023 as the year of continued transition into a post-pandemic world. We anticipated that volumes in both segments and acuity in our acute business would continue their recovery trajectory and gradually begin to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. The comparison to last year's first quarter for our acute hospitals, which were experiencing the significant surge in COVID patients with the Omicron variant is particularly challenging, but many of those COVID related headwinds will become much less of a factor as the year progresses. We expect it to be able to reduce premium pay by about one-third in 2023 from 2022 levels, as we continue to increase hiring rates and reduce turnover. And while the decline in premium pay has leveled off for the time being, we continue to make progress on overall wage pressures. In our Acute segment, we highlighted the upward pressure of on physician expense, which tended to run at a rate of about 6% of revenues pre-pandemic, but is budgeted to run and actually is closer to 7.5% in 2023. Overall, we were pleased with our first quarter results, which were largely in line with our internal expectations, with our behavioral results somewhat ahead and our acute results slightly behind. We are pleased to answer questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Jason Cassorla with Citi. Please proceed. Jason Cassorla : Great. I guess, first, wanted to ask about your acute volume trajectory. I guess, obviously, a solid starts a year, but curious if you believe this was broad-based underlying demand, or anything else beyond an easier comp? And I guess given performance in the quarter, how you're thinking about the sustainability of the momentum and volume growth for the remainder of 2023. Steve Filton : Sure, Jason. Look, I think we've made the point for some time that we felt that as COVID volumes continue to decline and sort of continue at a kind of a lower, we'll call it endemic level, that the non-COVID volumes would begin to recover. I think that recovery quite frankly has been a bit slower than we anticipated. But clearly, taking into account what our public hospital, acute care hospital peers have said as well in the first quarter, I think there seems to be a broad-based recovery across the space. And I think our expectations is that we are going to begin to see acute care volumes track at their sort of pre-pandemic patterns with volume growth in the low to mid single digits and sort of pricing growth at a similar level. So, ultimately, and particularly I think once we get beyond the first quarter with that difficult COVID comparison, we'll begin to see an acute care business model that resembles something a lot closer to our pre-pandemic experience. Jason Cassorla : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the favorable behavioral revenue per patient day trend of 5% in the quarter. I guess any color on how we should think about the growth in that stat for the remainder of 2023, just given the improvements you're seeing on labor scarcity, better volume throughput than anything else. Any help there, that would be great. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. Again, so we've talked about this I think on a number of prior calls, I think prior to the pandemic revenue per adjusted day in the behavioral division tended to increase, so about 2% to 3% annually during the pandemic. I think, we've seen that number jump to 5% or 6% in a number of quarters. And we've attributed in many cases to a more aggressive stance on our part as we renegotiated contracts with some of our lowest payers, with the idea that in an environment of capacity constraint, an environment where we were turning patients away because of a lack of adequate staffing, it gave us more leverage to take a more aggressive stance with our payers. And again, I think you saw that in the 5% revenue per day -- per adjusted day increase in first quarter. Obviously, I think the sort of the crux of your question is as we continue to hire more people and those capacity constraints are eased some, does it change the dynamic with the payers? And I think the honest answer is to a degree, but I'll also say just broadly, I think across the space, the behavioral space, we have a view that demand across the space exceeds the supply of beds in many geographies and in many instances. And so, I think we're going to still have leverage with the payers in many of our geographies. If they want a place to have their patients treated, they're going to have to pay, at a minimum market rates to providers and to us. But we also did say, I think in -- when we talked about our 2023 guidance in our last call that we were projecting in our guidance that that revenue per day growth would moderate some. So, if we see some moderation, it is certainly something that's been anticipated in our guidance. But right now, it's a pretty strong environment in terms of our negotiations with payers. Jason Cassorla : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Marco on for Josh. I appreciate you taking the question. Based on your commentary, it appears that capacity is opening back up in the Behavioral segment, as staffing levels improve. And you also just spoke to demand outstripping supply in a number of geographies. So with that, do you think we're at a point now where we should expect more development on the behavioral side or even acquisitions of assets there? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. I think it's a reasonable question. Obviously during the pandemic and during the significant capacity constraints we had and the issues we had in hiring sufficient clinicians, especially nurses to treat our patients, we did put on hold some of our development activities, building new capacity at existing facilities or building de novo facilities, although we certainly continued with some. But I think your question is right. I mean, we just had a meeting recently in which we reviewed a whole chunk of facilities that are running at an excess of 80% occupancy on the behavioral side to consider, I think the exact point of your question whether it merited study of building more capacity in those facilities. So, I think you're right, this is a bit of a compounding kind of dynamic. As we're able to hire more people and fill more of our permanent vacancies, I think we'll be able to treat more patients. And as we're able to treat more patients, we may need to increase capacity in some of our facilities in some of our de novo projects. So, I think that's certainly a possibility over the next several years. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then just on the acute care side, I know you gave some detail on the contract labor trends in the quarter. But I was wondering your thoughts on whether rates are now back to levels where it makes sense to just continue utilizing temporary labor as means of increasing capacity. And do you think there'll be enough sustained demand on the acute side to support that? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, so, the traditional, I think, approach to temporary labor in the acute business for us, and I think largely for our peers always was that when there were temporary surges in volumes, which there often are, COVID activity aside, it always made sense to solve those sort of temporary demands on your staffing with the use of temporary and traveling nurses, et cetera. What became really sort of a disrupting kind of factor during the COVID surges was that the price or the cost of that temporary labor rose to two and three, and I think sometimes four times what traditional rates have been. I think as we see those numbers come down, and we certainly have seen them come down quite a bit, although I don't think we're at pre-pandemic levels. I think we're going to get back to that sort of traditional approach that when we need temporary labor, we'll go to these outside agencies for it. But it'll be on a less frequent basis, et cetera. And I will say that there were times during the pandemic where the cost of temporary labor got so expensive that we just refused to use it if it got above a certain level. And again, I think we're largely past that point. And like many other things that I've referenced on the call, I think that as we progress in 2023 and we go beyond that, we're going to see that temporary labor supply/demand dynamic and pricing and inflationary dynamic return to much more of a pre-pandemic sort of level than what we have seen in the last few years. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. All right. And it comes from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS. Please proceed. Andrew Mok : Thanks. Can you help us understand the sequential improvement in the acute business in the context of lower acuity trends seen in the fourth quarter? Did underlying acuity actually improve, or were volume so strong such that it masked some of the continued acuity headwinds that you're seeing? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, I think the sequential improvement reflects some of the normal seasonal patterns. I think, in any normal year, our first quarter is our busiest year on the acute side. And there's generally a pretty significant step up from the fourth quarter and some of the reduced activity during the holidays and the fourth quarter, et cetera. So, I think you did that. Absolutely, see some of that. I also think you just continue to see a return of normal patterns, patients who had delayed in deferred procedures during the pandemic, beginning to schedule those and at least get into the pipeline for some of those more elective and scheduled procedures, et cetera. So, I think you saw that dynamic. So, I think the acute care performance clearly, in my mind, was more favorable when you look at it from a sequential basis. When you looked at it from a year-over-year basis to the first quarter of last year when we had the Omicron surge, when we had the very high acuity, the comparisons that I think were much more challenging. You had the COVID reimbursement in the first quarter of last year. But to your point, the fourth quarter improvement over -- for the acute division was encouraging to us. And I think sort of reinforces our view that we've created an appropriate sort of guidance trajectory in 2023 with the acute care performance improving as the year goes on. Andrew Mok : Got it. And related to that, hoping you can provide an update on the Las Vegas market with respect to the Desert Springs Hospital you closed down in the new Reno hospital. How's that tracking against expectations? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, so those are two very different dynamics. As I think we discussed in our last call, the Desert Springs dynamic, it's really related to the new hospital we're building in West Henderson, which is sort of between our existing Henderson hospital and our existing Desert Springs Hospital. As I think physicians and patients and employees, all came to the realization that ultimately West Henderson would be replacing Desert's function in the market. They began to make other decisions and move to other hospitals, very often our own hospitals elsewhere in the market. And so we made the decision to close Desert as an acute care hospital, but we still operate a freestanding emergency department on the site. As I mentioned in my -- in our prepared remarks that those shutdown costs and severance costs, et cetera, created about a $10 million headwind in the first quarter compared to last year. Essentially I think after that, as the year progresses, Desert Springs will have much less of an impact. And I think we're very much looking forward to the positive impact that West Henderson will have when it opens in either the spring or the middle of 2024. In Reno, our new hospital had a bit of a drag compared to last year. But certainly not at the level of 2022 when it was $7 million or $8 million drag per quarter on average. And we think, again, that will improve over the year. And as I think we indicated in our guidance, we're expecting about a $30 million favorable tailwind in 2023 from the Reno hospital. Broadly, I would just say, and I think this is consistent with what our peers have said, we've seen our Texas and Florida markets recover, and this is, I think particularly from an acute care perspective, recover from the pandemic dynamics faster than our other markets around the country, including in our case, Nevada and California. There's been a shift in population to places like Florida and Texas. I think those economies tended to recover more quickly from the shutdown. They didn't shutdown as completely or as quickly as some other markets around the country. So, again, I think our experience in those markets is consistent with what, at least a couple of our peers have talked about as well. Andrew Mok : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. All right. And it comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Nick on for Steve. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how your Q1 results impact you\u2019re thinking for full year guidance, particularly in light of some of the margin favorability you saw in behavioral in the quarter. Thank you. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, as is our practice, we didn't address guidance in our press release, which means that we're maintaining our existing guidance. I will say that -- and because we don't give quarterly guidance, I will say that our internal forecast for the quarter were somewhat ahead of the consensus estimates, although our actual results were ahead of both consensus and our internal forecast. In term -- I know that a couple of our peers raised their guidance in the first quarter. As you all know, I've been at UHS for more than three decades. I don't recall that we've ever changed our guidance after the first quarter, for better or for worse. Obviously, in this case it would've been for better had there been any change. But generally, we were pleased with the first quarter results. I think as Marc's comments on the call indicated, and -- but I will also make the point that unlike other years, the earnings trajectory that we're expecting in 2023 is that earnings will continue to improve as the year progresses. And so, we feel very comfortable with our full year earnings. We're very pleased with the first quarter results. But certainly it didn't feel from a either a -- sort of historical practice perspective or any other that, there was any need to change the guidance after the first quarter results. Operator : Does I answer your question, sir? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thank you. Operator : My pleasure. One moment for our next question, please. All right. And it comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Group. Please proceed. Ann Hynes : Hi. Good morning. Could you talk about nursing trends maybe in each segment? Which segment do you think is be covering faster than the other? And I know you said turnover improved, but can you give us some stats? Maybe what turnover was at the height of the pandemic? What it was before the pandemic, and what it's trailing now? Thanks. Steve Filton : Sure, Ann. And so, I think turnover, particularly in nursing, across the U.S. pre-pandemic tended to average in the low 30% range. I think most of our hospitals tended to do a little bit better than that, but obviously nursing turnover is and has been a significant, I think, challenge for the hospital industry for many years. During the pandemic, I think those percentages often doubled and in some cases, maybe even tripled. Again, not just for UHS and not just for acute or behavioral, but I think for hospitals across the country, I think it was particularly challenging for sub-acute providers like behavioral hospitals or nursing homes or home health agencies or any long-term care businesses who were losing clinicians to these incredibly sort of high priced opportunities to make these really premium amounts in acute care, COVID settings during the pandemic. I think what we said all along was that as COVID volumes diminished and reduced to sort of the levels that we saw in Q1 of this year, that many nurses would sort of return to their original or if you will, their sort of home base occupations or work sites. And I think we've seen that. I think we've seen a sort of a faster and quicker benefit to that on the acute -- on the -- excuse me -- on the behavioral side, where we've been able to fill more of our permanent vacancies. And as a consequence, we've been able to admit more patients. And again, the -- that 10% same-store revenue growth that we saw in the first quarter, I think is a -- very concrete reflection of our progress that we're making. I think on the acute side, we're making progress. We've, obviously, reduced our premium pay by almost half from where it was a year ago. I think a number of our peers have quoted, we have tended to talk about the wage issues in acute care by quoting our premium pay numbers. And that includes both things like overtime and shift differential that we pay to our own employees as well as contract labor. But when you just isolate the contract labor numbers as a percentage of overall salaries and wages, I think we're in that 5% to 6% range, which I think is right where our peers are maybe even a little bit lower than that. So, we've clearly made progress on the acute care side as well. And I think that -- while it's -- the acute care recovery has been a little bit slower, I think it positions the acute care business well for the rest of the year as acuity returns, as surgical volumes improve, the fact that we've been able to reduce premium pay so much from a year ago bodes well for what we'll be able to accomplish in the upcoming quarters as well. Ann Hynes : Great. And just on the inpatient side, inpatient trends, admissions improve sequentially, can you just describe what delta, like what do you think is coming back versus what was not in 2022? Steve Filton : Yeah. I think it tends to be across the board. We have seen emergency room volume increase and that always has sort of a cascading impact on our admissions. We've seen our schedules in elective and surgical procedures increase. And I think the one dampening sort of impact of that is that -- which again I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that even though overall surgical volumes are clearly increasing and even inpatient volumes are increasing on an absolute basis, there's definitely a shift to more procedures being done on an outpatient basis. I would highlight, I think, particularly, again, I don't think this is unique to UHS, but particularly in the orthopedic service line, we've seen a pretty dramatic shift in the last couple years from inpatient to outpatient procedures. But just broadly, I think we're seeing the volumes in almost all of our service lines improve. Ann Hynes : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Austin on for Justin. I appreciate the question. Steve, sticking on that like scheduled elective mix that you just described. I know that was a little bit of a focal point in 2Q, 3Q and through back half of last year. You noted some improvement there, but wondering if you can kind of quantify where that's maybe tracking versus the pre-pandemic level? And is that shift to outpatient, maybe shifting that run rate going forward? Thanks. Steve Filton : So, again, I mean, I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about year-over-year surgical growth, total surgical growth as around 10%, higher on the outpatient side, maybe 14% lower on the inpatient side, maybe 4% something like that. I think those -- that level of growth is reflective of some amount of catch up of deferred procedures, et cetera. I mean, that would be a pretty difficult pace to continue sort of indefinitely. But again, I mean, I think we've argued for some time now that as COVID volumes declined, there would be some kind of pent-up demand and surgical volumes at a minimum would return to their pre-pandemic levels. I think we're at a point right now where we we're recapturing some of the volume that we lost during the height of the pandemic. But it feels like absent another COVID surge, which nobody seems to be anticipating at the moment, there ought to be a relatively steady and sustainable growth in surgical volumes. Although, I suspect that they'll continue to be more skewed to outpatient rather than inpatient. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. Commercial contracting cycle kind of in focus, I'm just wondering if there's any update there and if you're still seeing some favorability on that front. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, I think, as we indicated and have indicated I think since -- probably the back half of 2022 when inflation began to have a clear impact on obviously our business, but on the rest of the world, we've been negotiating managed care increases that, I think, in general, are somewhere in a 150, 175 basis point range higher than what they were pre-pandemic. That will continue quite frankly for number of periods, as contracts come up for renewal. But yeah, I mean, I think, as we are renegotiating commercial contracts in particular, we're getting some relief. I think, we would still argue it's not necessarily full relief for the inflationary pressures we've been under. But it's certainly been helpful to our results. And more clearly on the behavioral side, you can see that number in our revenue per day. It's not as easy to see it on the acute side in our revenue per mission because you've got the sort of acuity factor working the other way. But again, I think, those comparisons are going to become a lot clearer as we get past the first quarter when the COVID comparisons to the prior year are going to be much more equal and not nearly as outta whack. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from Kevin Fishbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joanna Gajuk : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. This is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess, first just follow-up on the behavioral business. So, the volumes pretty strong there. We just talk about that acute, but any color there in terms of the regions or business lines, or is it kind of across the board, just kind additional color on the site volume strength? Steve Filton : Not really, Joanne. I mean, again, this is a subject that we've discussed at great length in calls during the pandemic. We have argued throughout that the biggest constraint on our volume growth in behavioral was our staffing and the inability to hire a sufficient number of clinicians, which was mainly nurses, but also things like other professionals, like therapists and psychologists and psychiatrists even. But also even some non-professional folks, the mental health technicians who are a critical part of our patient care planning in our behavioral hospitals. And what we continue to say is that as we -- as the COVID volumes declined, we'd be able to hire more people and fill more of those permanent vacancies. Our net hires have been increasing for well over a year now, pretty consistently. And I think you saw our behavioral volumes improve in the back half of 2022. Obviously, they continued to improve in the first quarter very robustly. But the early signs is those trends are continuing into Q2. I think we hit our highest behavioral census number within the last week that we've seen in a couple years. So, we're very bullish about our ability to again continue to fill those vacancies and increase our ability to treat more patients. But it's very much across the board. From a geography perspective, from a service line perspective, it's -- to be perfectly honest, that 10% same-store revenue growth really couldn't be anything, but pretty comprehensive because there's not a single geography or a single service line that could drive that level of improvement. Joanna Gajuk : And would you say that with the strength, because you made -- it sound like things were talking better, but in segment by sounds like maybe margins. So, any change to kind your view for the year for this segment, or it's kind of in the ballpark? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, again, I'll just echo the comments made by Marc in his remark, now, we -- I think when we created our 2023 guidance, we envisioned that 2023 would be a year of transition out of sort of the pandemic environment and into a post-pandemic world in which we'd have much greater success in -- filling our labor vacancies. There wouldn't be as much labor supply/demand disruption. Certainly that's the way the first quarter played out, particularly very strongly on the behavioral side. That's the way our guidance plays out for the year. We're feeling very good about how the year has started out, and anticipate that most of these trends will continue as the year goes on. Joanna Gajuk : Great. Thank you. And the last question on Behavioral segment. When it comes to the redeterminations, so states are starting this process now, many of them delaying it, but I guess, we've been talking about this quite a bit. So, can you talk about how you think this will play out for behavioral business specifically? Do you assume anything in your guidance? Or is it more 2024, if at all? And then also, I guess, any comments on how this could impact the acute care business? Thank you. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, look, I think the truth, Joanne, is that nobody really has a very sort of clear and precise view of how redeterminations are going to affect, and by the way, either the behavioral or the acute business, as your question indicates, it depends a lot on the pace at which the states go through the redetermination process. And that's not clear. It certainly depends on the pace at which folks who lose their Medicaid coverage can qualify for commercial exchange products. Number one, how quickly they can do so. Number two, what percentage of them can do so. So, there've been all sorts of guesstimate by all sorts of people about how this will play out. Some of them are quite frankly, substantively very positive for the hospital industry. Some are somewhat negative. I think broadly what we did in our 2023 guidance is, think about redeterminations as being sort of modestly negative for both segments. But to be fair, that was largely a guesstimate, but I think that has been included in our pricing assumptions for 2023. So, we'll see how it plays out. We're certainly ready from an operational perspective at our hospitals to do everything that we can do to make sure that patients who lose their Medicaid coverage, do everything possible to requalify for commercial exchanges or any other coverage that might be available in a particular market. So, we're prepared at that sort of ground level to deal with redeterminations, but I think that's something that we as an industry are going to have to wait and see how that develops and plays out over the next couple of quarters. Joanna Gajuk : Thank you for this color. I appreciate. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. All right. And it comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please proceed. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Not to get too granular on labor, but our monthly labor tracker showed the company had better momentum later in the quarter in February and March, especially on filling nurse job vacancies in both segments. So, I would think that would also bode well for volumes in the second quarter. So, I'm not asking you to comment on monthly trends, obviously, but just curious if you're able just to comment on the momentum for the company exiting the quarter on the labor front, and whether that also to give a positive bias for volume trends in the second quarter as well. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. Look, just broadly, Steve, I would say, we concur with the idea that things improve broadly, both from a labor perspective, volume perspective as the quarter went on. And again, as I think I've noted a number of times in my comments on the call already, that's the way our 2023 guidance is built. I think traditional seasonality would not suggest necessarily that things would continue to get better historically from the first quarter forward. But we thought 2023 trajectory would be different. And it seems to be playing out that way. It played out that way in Q1 and certainly early in Q2 that that seems to be the trend. So, we're encouraged by that, that the assumptions that we made in our 2023 guidance seem to be at least early in the year playing out in the way that we expected. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks. Operator : One moment for our next question, please. All right. And it comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Pito Chickering : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A follow up to both Ann and Joanna\u2019s question here. Can you combined both the new hires and the turnover to quantify with a net hires was specifically in behavioral now compared in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter? And then how many behavioral beds are you still unable to staff at this point if any, and kind of how does that track throughout the year? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, Pito, I don't have the net hire detail in front of me. What I do know, and what, again, I've said I think on a number of occasions is our net hires on the behavioral side in particular have been positive, definitely since the end of the first quarter of last year. And I think that's been pretty consistent and probably accelerating as time has progressed. And again, I think that's pretty consistent with our expectations. And I think we expect it will continue to be the case. How many beds we have capped, et cetera. It's kind of an interesting thing. We don't really give that number in a precise way because it really sort of varies the way each facility thinks about it. I think they generally sort of describe a bed or a unit as kind of capture closed if it has traditionally been open, but has to be temporarily closed because of a lack of sufficient staffing. I will say this, I mean, we continue to -- and that again, we've made this comment before, this is not anything terribly new. We continue to turn away significant numbers of patients, because there's either not an available bed or not an available staff member, staff members to treat that patient. So, we continue to believe that as we make progress and continue to hire people in the behavioral space, that the demand will be there. It's not like we're hiring people to chase demand. We believe that we're hiring people to meet the demand that's already out there and has been demonstrated to us through the incoming inbound inquiry process whether that's people calling our 800 numbers or people inquiring about treatment online. As we measure that incoming call volume, there's still a significant amount of unmet demand that we believe -- as we addressed earlier the call, we can meet through potentially expanding bed capacity, but also through continuing to expand our net hires. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great. And then a follow-up question here. As you think about sort of margin expansion in behavioral, so over the next sort of 12 to 24 months, how much is this coming from sort of getting those beds filled up and sort of getting the fixed costs leveraged there? How much is it coming from the spread of pricing running in the mid single digits versus wage inflation running in the sort of 3% range? Steve Filton : Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm not sure I fully understand the question. I mean, obviously, if you look at our 10% revenue growth in the first quarter was split pretty evenly between price and volume. Honestly, I think there's more upside on the volume side as kind of I think responded to an earlier question. I think we may see that price or revenue per adjusted day moderate a little bit as the year goes on, and some of the capacity constraints are eased. But I think the volume growth for the foreseeable future, I think you pegged the timeframe as 12 or 24 months should continue. And quite frankly, not really inconsistent with what our volume growth patterns were in behavioral pre-pandemic. Obviously, those volume patterns were significantly muted during the pandemic because of the labor supply and demand disruption that we saw. But as we continue over the next couple of years, I think that we're very confident that that volume growth in the mid single digits is a very sustainable sort of number. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys. Nice quarter. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. [Operator Instructions] And our question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Jamie Perse : Hey, thank you. Good morning. So, Steve, you previously guided to about 1% to 2% revenue per adjusted admission in 2023. You also said that was kind of one of the more aggressive assumptions in your thinking for 2023. So, getting through the tough 1Q comp, and I'm just curious how revenue per adjusted admission played out versus your expectations and how to think about that metric for the rest of the year for the Acute segment? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, again, I mean, I think our comments were straightforward in saying that our acute performance in the first quarter was slightly below our own expectations. And I think it was mostly on the pricing side, because obviously it was hard not to be pleased with the volumes in the quarter. And I think our expense control was pretty strong. So, now again, I think as we said that first quarter comparison we know was always going to be difficult for -- on a pricing basis for the acute business because of that acuity drop. I think we'll get a better view of this as the year progresses because the -- again, the COVID comparison is not going to be nearly as important and we'll get to see what the -- I'll call it sort of true pricing dynamic looks like, what the inpatient to outpatient shift means, et cetera. Again, I think, we were sort of slightly behind expectations in Q1, but certainly don't -- in any way feel like that doesn't mean we can't get to our full year expectations on the acute side. Jamie Perse : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, just on contracting tactics with commercial payers. You previously mentioned there were some contracts where you're potentially willing to walk away if payers didn't kind of meet you halfway. I'm curious how some of those types of negotiations have played out since. Are payers becoming more receptive to meeting providers at better rates? Have you actually walked away from contracts? Just any update there on the behavioral side in particular. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, again, I mean, to I think a large degree the proof is in the pudding, we had 5% revenue per adjusted day growth in our behavioral revenue in the quarter. That certainly is well above historical averages, which I think tended to be in the maybe 2%, 2.5% range, more like what we have been seeing during the pandemic. Again, because I think that with capacity constraints and with our large market share in many of our geographies, with payers are unwilling to kind of in your terms, meet us halfway, pay a reasonable rate and essentially go out of network with us, I think their choices and their options to have their patients treated in other settings in -- at least in some geographies is severely limited. So, I think we've been pretty successful. Again, at the end of the day that revenue per adjusted day, I think, is the evidence of that. And it plays out. You sort of are asking how it plays out. A lot of times we will give notice of termination and the contract never terminates and we will reach a negotiated settlement on rates. Other times, we will actually walk away and the contract will terminate. And sometimes that's a permanent thing and sometimes the payer comes back and even after the termination we'll settle. So, it doesn't play out the same way every time. But again, my sense is broadly in the behavioral space, there's not a lot of excess capacity around the country and payers, while they certainly are always going to be aggressive, are going to, I think, find themselves having to be reasonable if they really want to make sure that there is a place for their subscribers to be adequately treated. And so, I think, on the behavioral side that strong leverage position is going to continue with us for some time. Marc Miller : And I just want to piggyback on this point, because we have just decided a little bit more forcefully now that, that we're just going to push this issue. We need to be paid fairly for the work that we're doing. Our expenses are up, and some of the payers don't meet us halfway all the time. And we've been clearly explaining to them that that's not going to be adequate going forward. But in addition to that, we're having a lot of different discussions with payers, I'd say in the last six to 12 months, that we've not had before. And it goes to a lot of what Steve is saying, their needs are growing on the behavioral side, we are the largest provider in the United States, in behavioral. So, the leverage is shifting a little bit. And we're trying to work with them to show them how it is more conducive for them to pay us a little bit more, but have their patients serviced in a much better way than to try and continue to nickel and dine and ultimately, that's not going to satisfy their needs. So, those discussions are, I would say, escalating. And they're different discussions and I think that we're going to have more positive results from the types of conversations that we're having now. Jamie Perse : Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Steve Filton for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Steve Filton : Okay. Thank you. We'd like to thank everybody for their time this morning and look forward to speaking again next quarter. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Thank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.42 for the second quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.53 for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Our acute hospitals experienced strong demand for their services in the second quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 7.7% over the prior year. Even though the volume growth was skewed somewhat to lower acuity procedures, overall revenue growth was still a very robust 9.7%. While overall surgical volumes were solid, increasing about 5% from the prior year quarter, there was a continuing shift from inpatient to outpatient. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the second quarter was $75 million, reflecting approximately 10% to 12% decline from the amount in the previous several quarters. The continued robust increase in acute volumes is the major reason that premium pay has not declined further. It's worth noting that our average hourly rate, which includes premium pay, was 4% lower than the second quarter of 2022. On a same-facility basis, EBITDA at our acute care hospitals increased 16% during the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. During the second quarter, same-facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 7.8%, primarily driven by a 6.2% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. The patient day growth in the quarter was greater at our acute care -- our acute behavioral hospitals versus our lower acuity residential treatment centers, which tended to drive up the revenue per day beyond the already relatively robust levels we've been posting for several periods. With a similar level of revenue growth in the first quarter, same facility EBITDA for our behavioral hospitals has increased 12% in the first half of the year compared to the comparable prior year period. Our cash generated from operating activities was $654 million during the first six months of 2023 as compared to $478 million during the same period in 2022. In the first half of 2023, we spent $337 million on capital expenditures and acquired $1.4 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $192 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 20% of the company's outstanding shares. As of June 30, 2023, we had $946 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. In our acute care segment, we continue to develop additional inpatient and ambulatory care capacity. We currently have 24 operational freestanding emergency departments as well as three additional, which are expected to be completed and opened over the next six months and nine more which have been approved and are in various stages of development. Also, construction continues on our de novo acute care hospitals consisting of the 150-bed West Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is expected to open next fall; the 150-bed Alan B. Miller Medical Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida; and the 136 beds Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Washington, D.C., both of which are expected to open in 2025. In our behavioral health segment, we recently completed and opened the 120-bed River Vista Behavioral Health Hospital in Madera, California, and we broke ground on the 96-bed Southridge Behavioral Hospital in West Michigan, a joint venture with Trinity Health, Michigan, which is expected to open later next year. I will now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for some closing comments. Marc Miller : Thanks, Steve. We were generally pleased with our second quarter results, as both of our business segments continued their transition into a post-pandemic world. As we anticipated, acute care volumes have continued their recovery trajectory, and have gradually begun to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. The comparison to last year's second quarter for our acute hospitals is the first apples-to-apples comparison of two low COVID volume quarters we have had since the pandemic began and the 60-basis-point year-over-year margin improvement in Q2 is a step towards a more extended margin recovery, we hope to sustain for the next several periods. In our acute segment, we highlighted the upward pressure on physician expense which tended to run at a rate of about 6% of revenues pre-pandemic, but is running closer to 7.6% in 2023. Based on the generally favorable operating trends in the first half of the year, we are increasing the lower end of our 2023 EPS guidance from 9.50 a share to 9.85 a share. As we have previously disclosed, our 2023 guidance had originally assumed recognition in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $25 million of supplemental revenues from a Nevada Medicaid program. The state has dramatically reduced the funding for this program, and we now believe our fourth quarter revenue recognition will be only approximately $3 million. This reduction has informed our decision not to change the upper end of our guidance range at this time. It is worth noting that we believe a new Nevada state directed program which we also have previously disclosed appears to still be on track for a 2024 implementation with a potentially materially favorable impact on our Nevada hospitals. We are pleased to answer questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Cassorla from Citi. Your line is open. Jason Cassorla : Great. Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to ask about acute care volumes. I guess, obviously, a strong result for the first half, but wondering how you're feeling about the trajectory of those volumes in the back half of the year. And I know it's early, but do you think this creates a new base from which you grow off of for next year, or do you think it still create kind of a set of difficult comps that you have to kind of overcome and work through in the first half of 2024? Just any color or commentary around that would be helpful. Steve Filton : Sure. I mean I think part of what we're experiencing in -- certainly in the first half of this year is what both, I think, providers and payers have anticipated for some time, and that is during the pandemic, there was some amount of deferral and postponement of procedures. And I think what both providers and payers have been reporting in the last quarter or two is that we've seen an uptick in volumes, particularly lower acuity volumes, elective, and surgical procedures. Again, I think particularly skewed towards the Medicare population that probably was most prone to defer and postpone during the pandemic. It's very difficult for providers like us. And I think, quite frankly, for almost everybody, except for individual physicians to really try and precisely determine how much of current volume is an exhaustion of demand that was sort of postponed or deferred during the pandemic. I think the comment that we have made simply is that we had 10% adjusted admission growth in acute care in Q1, close to 8% in Q2. Those are really historically unprecedented numbers. So, our expectation -- and again, I think Marc's comments were in Q2, for the first time, we had kind of an apples-to-apples comparison with last year in terms of low COVID volumes. We're expecting, I think, volumes to moderate in the future, but also for acuity to rise and to return to sort of that mid-single-digit level of topline growth in acute care that has sort of long been the model. Whether that occurs in the next couple of quarters, whether we have a run of somewhat extended and enhanced volumes, I think is difficult for anyone to project. Obviously, it's been pretty strong for the last six months, early indications in July that remains that way. But we'll see. So, again, I think some of our caution about guidance in the back half of the year is also informed by this idea that we're not exactly sure at what pace acute care volumes moderate, but there is some sense if they will. But generally feeling pretty good about overall acute care volumes which did suffer -- at least non-COVID volumes, which did suffer definitively during the pandemic. Jason Cassorla : Got it. Okay. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up on the acute care physician subsidy expense. It sounds like that's coming in at an even greater pressure point than originally anticipated in guidance. I guess, one, is that fair? And curious if that level of spending is at a tipping point now where maybe you need to perhaps consider greater levels of in-sourcing or other strategies to help offset and create kind of a good guy sort of set up for '24 and beyond? Any just thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So we have certainly been talking about and anticipating that 2023 would be a challenging year when it came to this issue of physician subsidy expense. We talked about back in February when we gave our 2023 guidance providing like a $55 million to $60 million increase in our guidance in physician expense. The reality is the rate of increase is probably running at about twice that. I do think that this is to some degree, sort of a transitory pressure. These contract service providers who provide much of our specialty emergency room and anesthesiology coverage are -- many of them are facing pretty significant financial stress. There have been a number of high-profile bankruptcies in that area by these contract providers. And in this interim period, where we're having to replace or kind of substitute and either pay greater subsidies to our existing providers or to new providers or your question alluded to in source and hire these physicians ourselves, there's this sort of kind of onetime, hopefully, expenditure of money and dollars to make this transition. But at the end of the day, I think we have a point of view that there's x number of ER providers in the country, there's x number of anesthesiology providers in the country. And when this sort of current disruption settles out, those dollar increases like in 2024, will at a minimum level off and hopefully will actually decline. But we're not going to see this rate of increase over an extended period of time. Jason Cassorla : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you, one moment for our next question. The next question comes from Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Ben Hendrix : I was wondering if you could answer pretty much the same question on the softness in the behavioral that we saw this quarter versus first quarter. I think you had called out maybe some headwinds at some specific facilities. Just wanted to see kind of how that looks like in the back half? Is that an easy fix and what we can expect going forward? Steve Filton : Yeah. Well, I'll go back to the point that Marc made earlier. The first quarter comparison was a bit anomalous because we were comparing kind of a low COVID volume in Q1 of 2023 with a very high volume in COVID quarter in 2022. So particularly on the behavioral side, that comparison was very favorable and volumes, revenue, EBITDA growth all looked very favorable in Q1. Q2 volume growth was a little more normalized, frankly, a little softer than we anticipated. I think that our acute behavioral volumes, and I made this comment in the prepared remarks, we're actually in line with our expectations, but the volumes in our residential treatment centers were somewhat lower than expectations as we kind of, delved into those numbers. It really seems like they were focused on a handful of facilities that we're having specific issues with referral sources or regulatory issues that we believe will be corrected and largely resolved in the back half of the year, but didn't seem to be pervasive in any sort of company-wide or industry-wide sort of dynamic. So I think our view as we think about the behavioral business trajectory, the point that we've made for some time during the pandemic is that as COVID volumes eased, we would be able to hire more people. As we would be able to hire more people, we'd be able to generate more patient days, more volume, greater efficiencies, greater EBITDA growth. I think if you look at the first six months of the year, which, again, I made the point in my prepared remarks, EBITDA is up 12%. I think if you look at the last four quarters, EBITDA is up substantially. And I think that's how we're looking at the earning power of our behavioral business. A bit of a slowdown in Q2, but I think we think the long-term trajectory is much more reflective of the experience we've had over the last two to four quarters. Ben Hendrix : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, one moment for our next question. We have a question from Andrew Mok from UBS. Your line is open. Andrew Mok : Hi. Good morning. Same-store inpatient admissions were up about 7% in the quarter. But I think in patient surgeries were only up about 1% or so. You mentioned lower acuity procedures, but I think those stats would imply some very strong medical growth or nonsurgical growth. Can you elaborate on the nature of the procedures you're seeing on the inpatient side? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So what I said in my prepared remarks was that overall surgical growth was up about 5% Q2 over Q2, which we view as a pretty solid outcome skewed more towards outpatient growth so outpatient procedures -- outpatient surgical procedures were up 8%, inpatient were only up 1%. But that obviously affects acuity. And again, I think in my mind, this is sort of an intuitive result. If what we're seeing in terms of the volume growth in acute care is, to some degree, a recapture of postponed and deferred procedures, it makes sense that those deferred and postponed procedures were of the lower acuity nature. Almost by definition, if people had emergency health care needs during the pandemic, those were attended to. But the things that were deferred were more elective, more discretionary procedures, both surgical and medical. And again, I think that's the dynamic you're seeing in terms of very high volumes but somewhat more muted acuity. Andrew Mok : Got it. And just a quick follow-up. How is the Reno hospital tracking against expectations, can you help quantify the contribution that, that hospital had on same-store admissions growth in the quarter? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. I don't have those exact admission numbers for the Reno hospital in front of me, but I'll say that -- what we have said was included in our 2023 guidance was about a $25 million or $30 million turnaround at the Reno Hospital. I think we're tracking I think we anticipated that, that would be a little back-end loaded, and I think that's right. I think we probably had about a $4 million to $5 million improvement in Q2. But I think we're generally tracking for that level of improvement for the full year, and that's our expectation. My sense is the Reno Hospital is not large enough to have had a significant impact on admissions one way or the other in the quarter. Andrew Mok : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is open. Joshua Raskin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just the first question, getting back to the behavioral health margins. I think in the past, you've suggested, and I think you just alluded to this, Steve, that there just weren't enough clinicians to hire and that sort of slowed your volumes. Are you now able to find these clinicians? If so, where are they coming from? And are different categories, maybe nurses versus MD is performing different roles. I'm just curious how you're feeling that capacity. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, so what I think we have said pretty consistently throughout the pandemic is that the pandemic itself -- and I should start by making the point that prior to the pandemic, in late 2019, early 2020, I think we would have described, and I think most of our provider colleagues would have described the labor market. It's pretty tight back then. The overall unemployment rate in the country was, I think, pretty close to full employment, clinical employment, particularly nursing employment was very tight. The pandemic then really exacerbates that tightness, particularly for sub-acute providers like behavioral providers because we started to lose a great many nurses, especially nurses to these high-level premium pay opportunities they were having working in acute care hospitals and COVID units or ERs or ICUs, et cetera. And the argument we made all along was that as COVID volumes declined, those opportunities for these extraordinary pay increases would decline and nurses would return to their \u2013 we'll sort of call it home base and employment. And I think that's what we've been seeing I'm going to say, for the last 12 or 15 months, I'm going to say at least back to the spring -- the early spring of 2022. And we're seeing that. Now what we're seeing is an increase in base wage rates in order for us to get those folks back. So I think wage inflation and behavioral or average hourly rate increase in Q2 over the prior year is more like 4.5%, 5%, which is certainly higher than it was running in the pandemic. And again, you see some of that in our salary, overall salary increases. But at the end of the day, and this is the point that I was trying to make before, I think what we've demonstrated, especially over the last three quarters, and to a lesser degree, in Q2 of this year as we're able to hire more people, we're able to generate more volumes and as a consequence, EBITDA growth, margin improvement, et cetera. It's not a directly, it's not a ratable increase every single quarter. But -- and again, there's some element of timing here as we hire new people, they have to be trained and oriented and that causes some level of inefficiency. But over time, I think we have the view that we're going to continue to be able to hire more people in behavioral and admit more patients and that's going to lead to a long-term growth trajectory in that business. Joshua Raskin : Got you. Got you. And then just one more on United spoke about a large increase in the incidence of mental health utilization, just more people seeking services. Do you think that translates to more inpatient care, or is that a level of acuity that's been more steady on the inpatient side and maybe that's more lower acuity? Steve Filton : Yes. My recollection from reading the United transcript was that they specifically talked about that increase being skewed to outpatient procedures. And, obviously, I think outpatient is a more highly competitive market for behavioral, there's a lot more competitors. I think our view is over the long-term, the more people who are getting care and getting appropriate assessments, et cetera, is good for our business, which tends to have a much broader continuum of care that includes more intensive outpatient and partial hospitalization and all sorts of inpatient care across many diagnosis. So I think we have a view that while we didn't necessarily experience that same growth in outpatient that United referred to specifically, I think, in their first -- second quarter call, that ultimately down the road, we're likely to benefit from more and more people getting the appropriate level of behavioral care and assessment. Joshua Raskin : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Whit Mayo : Thanks. Steve, I appreciate the comments on Nevada and the supplemental Medicaid program changes. Any way to potentially size how you guys are thinking about the potential contribution of that in 2024? I know there's still some moving pieces and approvals that need to happen. Steve Filton : Yeah. So we're waiting Whit for the state to resume more specific guidance about how their specific methodology is going to work, et cetera. But based on our broad understanding of how this program is going to work as I think Marc commented in his prepared remarks, our expectation is that this could have a materially favorable benefit on our Nevada hospitals. But we're anxiously waiting for the state to issue more specific or more specifics surrounding the calculations and the methodology and the size of the pool, et cetera, which we think could be forthcoming going to sort of say in the near intermediate term. But certainly, we think there'll be a lot more clarity by the end of the year. Whit Mayo : Yeah. Okay. No, that's helpful. We've gotten some questions around the Cerner Oracle EMR investments you guys are making, none of this is new. But just maybe remind us the income statement, CapEx impact, how many hospitals you're thinking about converting? I can't imagine that's all of your facilities, just timeline and any review of that initiative? Steve Filton : Sure. So as you said, this is not necessarily really new news. We originally committed to a behavioral EMR implementation with Cerner. Going back a couple of years and after Cerner's acquisition by Oracle, Oracle wanted to do this press release, which is fine. But to be clear, I mean, it's not new. We've already implemented a handful of facilities in 2022. We'll implement another round of facilities in 2023. If you read the press release, it doesn't refer to the number of facilities. I think when at least one of the news media outlets picked up the story based on the combine the fact that we were making this announcement with the fact that we've got 200 behavioral facilities here in the US, and said that we were committed to implement 200 facilities, as your question alludes to, we\u2019re certainly have not yet committed to that. We have smaller residential facilities that may not be appropriate for an investment of this scale, et cetera. So I think the point -- I mean, I think that we will spend significantly less on behavioral EMR than we did on the acute care alone, I think, around $220 million, $230 million a number of years ago on the implementation of an acute care MR. I think we'll spend substantially less on behavioral and they'll be spread out over, I think, a five or six-year period. So, I don't think that the individual impact of the investment is going to have a significant impact. The other piece is we had an expectation that there are operating efficiencies that we'll gain and garner from the implementation. So a significant chunk of that investment should be offset with operating efficiencies. Whit Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody. I know you've gotten some good rate increases on the behavioral side the last year or so is -- I know a lot of states reset their rates midyear. I also know you've got ongoing discussions on the commercial side. Medicare, we can track that easier. But any update on thinking about where rates settle out back half of the year into next year for commercial and Medicaid in the behavioral side? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, A.J., I think our comments on rate increases and behavioral have been pretty consistent. They definitely -- historically, revenue per day in the behavioral division has generally increased sort of 2% or 3% a year, pretty consistently pre-pandemic. During the pandemic, we saw those numbers rise to something much closer to 5% to 6%. And then I think we've generally discussed that, and we think the main reason for that is we've been able to leverage the fact that there is capacity constraints in the industry as we've already talked about on this call because of labor capacity especially. And we've been going to our lowest payers and either demanding increases from them or canceling those contracts that we view to be inadequate and simply admitting patients whose insurance will pay us more, again, in an environment where we can only treat a limited number of patients, we can be more selective about who we treat and the fairness of what we think we're being paid. What we have said is we think that as we're able to admit more patients, our ability to leverage that diminishes a little bit and maybe that revenue per day increase that had been running 5% to 6% moderates more to 4% to 5%. We were again a little over 6% in the quarter, although that, I think, is a function not only of the rate increases we're getting but also of the mix of acute versus residential patients. as I mentioned before. But I think generally, our price -- the pricing environment in behavioral remains strong. We remain aggressive that we've terminated or issued notice of termination in a great many markets to a great many payers. We're pursuing this strategy pretty aggressively and feel like there's a runway to do so for the foreseeable future. A.J. Rice: Okay. I know you talked about the new facility in Vegas and the trajectory there. But maybe stepping back, I know you've got concentrated portfolios in the acute side in Vegas and Southern California and D.C. and Southwest, Texas, any dispersion? Obviously, you had good overall volume growth. Was there much of a difference in the performance in those major geographic markets this quarter? Steve Filton : So I think like most of our -- or several of our public peers, HVA antenna, I think most notably have commented in the last year or so that their facilities in Texas and Florida have been recovering at a more rapid rate than in other geographies. I think as those states have emerged from the pandemic more around the economies in those states have emerged on the pandemic more rapidly. I think honestly, that has been sort of a bit of a negative comparison for us. Again, over the last year or so because we've got less of a relative footprint in Texas and Florida and more in Nevada and California than our peers, but I think what we're seeing now is the recovery in those geographies is starting to pick up pace, et cetera. I think our performance in Nevada was particularly improved in the quarter. And obviously, that's always a significant piece of good news for us. I will say that to have the sort of acute care performance we had, in particular, the top line and EBITDA growth of 16% that's got to be pretty broad-based. It really can't be specific to one single market, and I don't think it was. But again, the encouraging, I think, element for us specifically was the improvement in our Nevada results in the quarter. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question, one moment. We have a question from Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jamie Perse : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the other operating expenses within acute for a second. You spoke about some of the bankruptcies for vendors in the space. Are there specific sort of onetime disruption costs in the $590 million you realized this quarter? I'm just trying to understand where we're going from here, if that's the right new baseline, or if you can take cost out at some point? Just any more color on the near term and how to model that line item? Steve Filton : Yeah. Look, I made the point earlier, Jamie, that we anticipated a significant increase in those physician subsidy expenses in our 2023 guidance. But in the first six months, they're tracking at twice the rate that we anticipated. But I also tried to make the point that I think we believe that these really dramatic increases are a function of this current disruption. We've got providers who are telling us one of two things. One, that they just can't continue. They've declared bankruptcy, and they can't continue to provide the contract services that we're contracted for, and we're having to replace them generally at a higher cost, whether we're contracting out to somebody else, or hiring these folks in. And again, there's these sort of transition costs that I think are largely onetime in nature. But I think we're going to continue to experience these for the next quarter or so I think we have a general view that by the time we get to 2024, However, this has settled out either -- and I'm not sure there's a single answer, but I think either a lot of these providers, these ER and anesthesiology physicians will be employed by hospitals and by us or they'll be employed by more local and regional providers who are more healthy financially, et cetera. But we're going to see a leveling off of this expense. I don't know that we're able to predict exactly how you should model that in the future. And again, I think in my mind, the positive view of this in the quarter is acute care EBITDA 16% higher than it was last year's Q2 despite the fact that we've got this significantly increased burden of physician expense. We feel like when that levels off next year, that's going to provide a boost to our earnings power. Jamie Perse : Okay. And you and other hospitals have always talked about a strong margin profile on surgery. Just given the tailwinds that seem to be in the surgical space at this point, can you give us any color on how to think about profit margins in your surgical business or profit contribution on average from surgeries? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean I think if you think about if -- however, you want to find our long-term acute care margins in the upper teens, I'm going to call it 17%, something like that. But I think surgical margins tend to be probably five to 10 basis points above that and medical margins tend to be five to 10 basis points below that. Obviously, there's a lot of difference depending on the specific procedure, the length of stay, the demographics of the patient base, et cetera. But historically, surgical margins have been measurably higher than medical margins. Jamie Perse : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Scott Fidel : Hi, thanks. Good morning. A couple of recent developments or proposals on the policy side, I would be interested to get your initial thoughts on -- the first was the CMS proposal that came out around the intensive outpatient benefit for behavioral in Medicare. And then just yesterday, I know it just came out, so don't expect too detailed commentary, but the Biden administration did also just come out with an updated proposal really focused on health plans around mental health parity and sort of enforcing that around in-network for behavioral. So just interested on both those proposals, if you have any initial thoughts on potential risks and opportunities there? Steve Filton : Yeah. So I'll tackle the parity one, which I know is the more recent one, Scott first. As you pointed out, I mean, I think the Biden administration announced yesterday that they were going to issue new rules on mental health parity, which they did this morning, and I appreciate your acknowledgment that we have not had a chance to review those. I think the broad context here is mental health parity legislation originally passed almost 15 years ago. But I think the industry has always been frustrated that the amount of adherence and an enforcement on the part of the government has never at least been as fulsome as the industry would have liked. And without reading the specific regulations or having a chance to read the specific regulations, I think the one positive that we take away is that the current administration seems focused on the fact that there needs to be better enforcement, there need \u2013 the mental health parity legislation originally was, I think, viewed very positively for the industry. And I do think it had a positive impact, but I think it should be more positive. And I think we would argue that there have been plans and payers that have sort of tried to dodge the \u2013 the intent of the legislation and we believe that any effort on the part of this administration to more aggressively enforce those parity laws is welcome. The intensive outpatient regulations, I'll sort of make repeat the same comments I was making just about United's commercial comments or commercial utilization comments before I think that any new developments that allow people or encourage people to get more access to in terms of outpatient or behavioral care in general are generally going to be positive for us. We have a lot of intensive outpatient offerings. But I think more than that, I think we had this complete continuum of care from very low acute outpatients or very high acute inpatient that the more people who are given access to care and behavioral diagnosis and assessment, I think that's generally good news for us. So I would say we view both of these developments as a positive. I think we view them consistent with I think general legislative and administrative sort of favorability to the behavioral business at both the federal and state level difficult to quantify the benefit for either of those in any sort of precise way. Scott Fidel : Got it. And then just one quick follow-up. Just on the Medicare volume sort of normalization that we've been seeing. Anyway, can you sort of tease out just in the second quarter, how I guess that's sort of skewed between outpatient and inpatient? Obviously, we know that it's felt seem to be sort of heavily driven by outpatient. But I'm interested whether you saw a pickup in the inpatient side on the Medicare volumes as well. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, so we saw, as we said, adjusted admissions increased by almost 8% in the quarter. Some of that is certainly driven by the outpatient activity. But obviously, pure admission growth was also pretty strong. again, I just feel like what you're seeing is it is a bit skewed towards the lower acuity procedures. And again, not by a tremendous amount. I mean, we saw overall revenue per adjusted admission on the acute side increased by 2% or so in the quarter. I think normally, we would expect that number to be more in the 2% to 4% range. So it's kind of on the low end. But there's a little bit more of that skew to -- I think it's not so much -- I mean, it is clearly an inpatient and outpatient issue, but I think it's more of an issue of skewing more towards those elective and deferred procedures that were postponed whether they were in or outpatient during the pandemic and are now being realized in greater numbers. Scott Fidel : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. First question, I wanted to ask about what you're seeing from the payers. I know you already got asked about pricing. But given Medicaid payers are heading into redeterminations, Medicare Advantage payers are talking about higher utilization. Steve, are you seeing any early kind of signs of increased medical management claims, denial, et cetera, the typical stuff that managed care will do when their costs are or might be a little bit higher? Steve Filton : Yeah. So two things or two comments that you made, Justin. I mean, one is we're not seeing, I think, at least a measurable impact that we can identify from Medicaid redeterminations so far. I do think again, we -- Marc commented on the rationale for not raising the upper end of our guidance, he commented on the Nevada supplemental payment. I do think that's a big piece of it. But I think we also have a view that there may yet be an impact from Medicaid redeterminations in the back half of the year in both of the businesses that we have not yet seen. So we're paying very close attention to that, and that's a focus. But, yeah, I think your other comment is also well taken, and that is with a lot of the payers reporting an increase in their own medical life utilization, we have an expectation that we're going to see more aggressive behavior on their part to whatever it may be limit length to stay on the behavioral side or challenge more inpatient versus observation classification on the acute side. I can't say that, we can say definitively that we've seen that change in a measurable way just yet. I think it sometimes takes a quarter or two for that information to sort of play out. But I will tell you that we're very prepared for and very focused on it. I think in all sorts of ways, I think we're trying to change our contracts, so that these issues are more defined that are in upfront in the contract, but also in the way that we provide billing information and we go through the appeal process. So all those things are a significant focus of ours. But I think you are suggesting that managed care payers are likely to become more aggressive in their utilization review procedures is something we're very sensitive to and prepared for. Justin Lake : I appreciate that. Maybe you can expand on your commentary around redeterminations. I know a lot of us are uncertain how this plays out. But one kind of line of thinking is that a bunch of people are going to be kicked off Medicaid, and a lot of them could end up on the exchanges or on private employer health plans, which pay a lot better, right, especially on the acute side, but even on the behavioral side. So how do you think about that vis-\u00e0-vis? Do you just think that is your concern that a lot of folks are going to be unfortunately removing the roles and not pick up other coverage. Is it your market specific to you, given your geographic exposure, or do you think that's just broad-based? And what drives that? Steve Filton : Yeah. So I think that, we generally concur, as your question sort of alluded to with the sort of broad way that a number of analysts both, I'm going to say, dispassionate analysts like CMS and the Urban Institute, et cetera, when they looked at the potential impact of redeterminations and then the number of sell-side folks have done exhaustive studies. And I think they all conclude largely the way you framed your question that ultimately, there will be a sufficient number of people who are redetermined off the Medicaid roles but who can requalify on better paying commercial products, commercial exchange products that the net impact to positive one. I think our sort of skepticism or concern or caution is more short term or timing related in nature and that is as we go through the process and people get redetermined off, how quickly can they requalify for commercial products, et cetera. And again, I just don't think we've had enough time to really measure whether there could be sort of a short-term bump or a drain on this. But I think in the long run, we think we probably come out at least whole, if not somewhat ahead. The good news from my perspective is based on the redetermination data that I've seen while there have been a lot of people redetermined off, a lot of those redeterminations a good chunk of them are sort of more for administrative reasons. Their paperwork is not up to date. Their address is not up today, whatever it may be. And so it feels like those people will be able to get back on the Medicaid roles quickly. So, it feels like maybe the impact in the long run is not going to be as significant as we might have thought. But again, our point of view is maybe some short-term uncertainty over the long term, I don't think we think this is really going to be a net negative for providers. Justin Lake : Got it. Thanks for all the color. Steve Filton : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. Thanks. I want to go back to, I guess, Marc's comments about both segments starting to transition to that post-pandemic world. Do you guys -- how are you thinking about what the company's two businesses look like in that world? Is it right to just assume that from a margin perspective, things look like 2018, 2019, is there reason to believe that margins might be higher or lower over time? And how do you think about that path and the timing of getting to whatever that normalization is? Steve Filton : Yes, I think the answer, Kevin, is a little bit different for each of the segments. I think -- and I think we touched on this to some degree in the call today, but certainly in previous calls as well. I think on the behavioral side, our view is that margins during the pandemic, particularly were diminished or negatively impacted by the labor scarcity. And again, the argument goes that as we are able to hire more people, we'll be able to create and really not create but exhaust more of the unmet demand that's been out there. And I think our view on behavioral is not only should we be able to return to 2019 margins ultimately, but to return to sort of peak behavioral margins, we'd probably go back to 2014 or 2015. Now, just to be clear, when I say that, I mean, I don't think that's an immediate. I don't think that happens obviously in the next quarter or two. But I think it is this sort of gradual trajectory of relatively robust topline growth and relatively fixed and semi-fixed expenses that allow us to do that. I think on the acute side, it's a bit -- a little bit more of a mix story. There was certainly some benefit to the acute care business from the pandemic itself from the acuity of the COVID patients from the special reimbursement that we received related to COVID patients, et cetera. And so I think it's a little bit more challenging for the acute business to get back to those pre-pandemic margins because they've got to replace a lot of that, I'm going to say, COVID patient-related benefit. Now clearly, they've been doing that over the last few quarters. And again, this gets back to, I think, a question of how sustainable this higher level of acute care volume is going to be. But again, pretty much -- pretty similar. I think we certainly feel like we're 400, 500 basis points on the acute side, below where our pre-pandemic margins were, as Marc's comments in his prepared remarks where we got 60 basis points of that back in Q2. We view that as a first step, which we hope to sustain for many more quarters to get back there or get close to pre-pandemic margins. Kevin Fischbeck : Yeah. So it sounds to me like to some degree in both cases, it's the volume number that's going to get you back to where you were. I guess the behavioral one makes sense, labor is a constraint you fix that. The Q1 though, it's still a little bit unclear to me. I understand the concept of pent-up demand, but when you just finally got above 2019 levels when historically, you've been growing volumes a couple of percent per year, kind of well below that long-term trend line. What is it that makes you cautious to say that you wouldn't get back to that long-term trend line? Are the population growth, demographics and fundamental demand drivers in your markets really unchanged? So why do you get concerned at this as a bolus rather than the new normal? Steve Filton : Yes. And again, I'm not -- I don't think we've -- in any way, given up the hope that we can get back to acute care margins -- pre-pandemic acute care margins. I'm simply suggesting that I think the recovery or the path to recovery is a little more complicated on the acute side because there were some benefits from the pandemic that they just clearly were not on the behavioral side. The pandemic really had only negative consequences for our behavioral business. And therefore, I think recovery from the pandemic is sort of steeper and more robust and quicker, quite frankly, on the behavioral side than it is on the acute side. Look, I think what you're seeing is some pretty rapid recovery on the acute side. But again, it's being driven by what I think we would argue are probably some level of extraordinary volumes that will moderate some. But look, I think if you look at the acute care business model and earnings trajectory over an extended period of time with kind of mid-single-digit revenue growth in that 5% or 6% range we have generally been able to produce EBITDA growth, margin improvement, et cetera. And I don't think there's any reason we can't sustain that level of top line growth for the foreseeable future. I do think it may take us a little bit longer to get there than it will on the behavioral side. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. All right. So I think I got it, but just to make sure to it up, you're not saying that this year's volumes become a headwind to next year because there's some sort of unsustainable bolus. This is probably a good base, but we just shouldn't assume 7% volume growth, we should assume from here more normalized volume growth or are you saying that there could be a headwind next year from a comp perspective? Steve Filton : Yes. Again, hard to know, Kevin, but we had 10% revenue growth, obviously, this quarter. Again, that's at a historically high level. I don't -- again, I think getting 2024 guidance at this point, but I don't know that we'll be able to sustain that level of revenue growth. Two things. I think the level of revenue growth probably moderates a little bit. I think the \u2013 the makeup of that revenue growth changes to somewhat less volume, some of more acuity in pricing. But I think, again, if that 10% revenue growth moderates to 6% or 7%, I still think that's a model in which we're likely to see increased EBITDA and margin expansion. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. We have a question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi, thanks. A follow-up on an earlier question. I wanted to see if you could expand a little bit more on the behavioral margins in the quarter. Usually pre-COVID margins increased sequentially in the second quarter. Obviously, you had a different experience this quarter with SWB and other OpEx as a percent of revenue up sequentially. Wondering what drove those increases? And how did margins internally compare to your expectations? And do you think we should see something closer to typical seasonality in the balance of the year? Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes. And operator, I'm just going to make the point this is going to have to be our last question. So we had a few non-recurring items in the quarter. We had a loss on disposal of assets that were about $3 million. We had an unfavorable exchange rate, which was affecting us in the UK by a couple of million dollars. But just generally, I think we saw salaries increased a little bit more than we expected in the quarter. And this is a point I was making in to an earlier question. I mean I think generally, our ability to hire people and fill these vacant positions is a positive development. In the short run, it can be somewhat inefficient. We have a lot of people in orientation and training. A lot of these people that we're hiring are somewhat less experienced and less trained and particularly in behavioral care, then were used to historically. And that creates a little bit of inefficiency again, in the short run, I think in the long run, and that's why I'm suggesting to people not to focus so much on just the second quarter, but on the first six months of the year or the last four months -- of the last four quarters where we've really been emerging from the pandemic not being impacted by COVID, being able to hire people. And I think the -- broadly, the results there show that we're going to continue to grow the top line but also generate the efficiencies that we think generally come with that top line growth. And I think that's still fundamentally our belief. So I think that's the way we're looking at the business. Thanks for your question. And operator, I think we're going to have to stop at this point in time. Operator : Okay. I'd like to turn it back to Steve Filton for any closing remarks. Steve Filton : Yes, just to thank everybody for their time this morning, and we look forward to speaking with everybody again after our third quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Thank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.  During this conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.  As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.40 for the third quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.55 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  During the third quarter, same facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 7.6%, primarily driven by a 6.5% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. The patient day growth in the quarter was greater at our acute care behavioral hospitals versus our lower acuity residential treatment centers, which tended to drive up the revenue per day beyond the already robust levels we've been posting for several periods.  Additionally, as we have anticipated in our original 2023 guidance, we're beginning to see a negative impact of Medicaid redeterminations in certain states on behavioral health volumes. With 8.3% revenue growth, same-facility EBITDA for our behavioral health hospitals has increased approximately 10% during the first 9 months of 2023 compared to the comparable prior year period. Our acute hospitals experienced strong demand for their services in the third quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 6.8% year-over-year. in part because the volume growth was skewed somewhat to lower acuity procedures, overall revenue growth was 7.5%.  While overall surgical volumes increased about 3% from the prior year quarter, there was a continuing shift from inpatient to outpatient. Additionally, we note that managed care behavior has become more aggressive in 2023 as it relates to denials and patient status classification changes. Meanwhile, the amount of premium paid in the third quarter was $69 million, reflecting a 15% decline from the amount in the previous several quarters. The continued robust increase in acute volumes is the major reason the premium pay has not declined further.  It's worth noting that our average hourly rate, which includes premium pay was slightly lower than in the third quarter of 2022 -- in 2023 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. Our cash generated from operating activities was $815 million during the first 9 months of 2023 as compared to $699 million during the same period in 2022.  In the first 9 months of 2023, we spent $537 million on capital expenditures and acquired $2.7 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $367 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 26% of the company's outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2023, we had $721 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. I will now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments. Marc Miller : Thanks, Steve. Despite what remains a difficult operating environment, our consolidated results continue to track our revised earnings guidance. As we anticipated, acute care volumes have continued their recovery trajectory and have gradually begun to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. As Steve has previously commented, we recognize the need to counter the increasingly aggressive behavior on the part of our payers and seek appropriate price increases to offset the impact of inflation on our cost structure and to seek further contractual protection to ensure we are properly reimbursed for the level of care provided to our patients.  We previously highlighted the upward pressure on physician expense, which tended to run at a rate of about 6% of revenues, pre-pandemic but is running closer to 7.6% in 2023.  In our behavioral segment, we have been pleased with our strong pricing and related earnings growth to date but acknowledge significant upside opportunity in our existing occupancy rates, particularly as we continue to improve our recruitment and retention metrics.  As previously disclosed, we expect our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2023 to include revenues earned by our hospitals in connection with the Florida Medicaid Managed Care directed payment program. In addition, it is worth noting that we continue to believe a new Nevada state directed program, which we have previously disclosed appears to still be on track for 2024 implementation with a potentially materially favorable impact on our Nevada hospitals. We are pleased to answer questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : Appreciate all the detail. A couple of questions on 2024. One, the -- just -- I know it's early to give guidance, but just wanted to hear your view Steve, on headwinds, tailwinds. And specifically, Marc, the -- I appreciate the comments on Nevada that it does sound fairly material. Wanted to get some color, historically, when a state goes to CMS and tries to put one of these programs in place, can you talk a little bit about timing and probability? Have you ever seen a state be unsuccessful. Have you ever seen CMS turn one of these down and say, I know you have the money, but we're not going to match type of thing. Can you give us some color there, historical background? Steve Filton : Sure. Just in terms of sort of the first part of your question, in terms of 2024 guidance, Justin, as you know, we don't -- won't formally give our 2024 guidance until our fourth quarter earnings call at the end of February. I think it's fair to say that we continue to believe that the underlying metrics of the two businesses.  As Marc kind of alluded to in his remarks, every sort of passing quarter, continue to resemble more of our pre-pandemic operating environment. And I think broadly, that's sort of the way we're thinking about 2024. I'm not going to go through a detailed list of puts and takes for 2024 at this point. Obviously, the most significant one is the one that you mentioned. This supplemental program in Nevada, which we've been disclosing in our Qs and Ks for a number of quarters now.  We believe the program has been submitted by the State of Nevada to CMS. We believe that the state has been talking with CMS so that they believe that the program meets the CMS requirements, and I think they're anticipating CMS approval. Based on our experience with like programs, we don't believe there's anything in the program that CMS should fundamentally object to. But obviously, it's not over until there is CMS approval.  I think the state's expectation is that approval is likely forthcoming early in 2024. The program is supposed to be retroactive. It's created to be retroactive to January 1 of 2024. We are still waiting for the state to publish an impact file, which would show their estimate of the impact on individual hospitals. People have been using a number to, I think, estimate the impact on UHS in total in Nevada in the $100 million to $150 million range. And based on our understanding of the program mechanics, that doesn't seem like an unreasonable estimate.  So again, the outstanding dynamic is CMS approval. We think it's probably forthcoming early in 2024. But obviously, we'll continue to keep people updated as we learn anything new. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla of Citi. Jason Cassorla : Steve, I wanted to go back to your commentary on the Medicaid redeterminations impact on behavioral volumes. I guess are you able to work with those patients to help get them back on the coverage like you can with the acute care business. And as a result, see that volume headwind as more of a transitory issue? Or how should we think about the puts and takes on the redetermination impact on volumes for behavioral specifically? Steve Filton : Yes. And to be perfectly candid, Jason, I think we're guesstimating to a degree, the impact. What we have noticed during the quarter is that in certain states and probably for us, most notably, Texas, certainly being the largest one, and it's been reported that I think there have been at least 1 million people redetermined off the rolls in Texas.  But what we've noticed in a place like Texas is that the number of calls and inquiries that we're getting that qualify from both a clinical and financial perspective, meaning there's adequate coverage available [indiscernible] have declined a little bit in the quarter. We don't know, I think, precisely that, that's related to Medicaid redeterminations, but we sort of draw that conclusion kind of based on historical trends and metrics.  As has been reported, it seems like a lot of these redeterminations are for administrative reasons. And a great number of these people will be able to get back reenrolled. And when they reach out to us, we certainly can help them do that. We can also try and help them to get other coverage. But a lot of those things take a little bit of time. So I think our perspective on this is it's probably, in large part, kind of a temporary dynamic. But I think we feel like there is a reasonable chance that our volume growth, particularly in our residential business amongst our trial on adolescent population might have been greater in the third quarter, had it not been for the impact of Medicaid redetermination, again, especially in Texas, but a handful of other states as well. Jason Cassorla : Great Helpful. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. Just on capital deployment. It looks like share repurchase activity picked up in the quarter. I guess just given the backdrop, how are you thinking about the uses of your free cash flow moving forward in areas where you perhaps see the best returns just at this juncture? . Steve Filton : Yes, I would just remind people that we have slowed our share repurchase a little bit in Q2. It seems like ages ago, but there was the threat of a government shutdown at the time, and we were concerned potentially about some short-term cash flow crunch issues. But obviously, that got resolved at least for the time being, and we resumed our sort of regular share repurchase activity in Q3. And I think we generally sort of think about using the bulk of our free cash flow for share repurchase going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : Can you expand a little bit on the managed care environment? Any way to quantify, I guess, how much of a drag on your realized commercial rates you're seeing from these tactics like if you thought you were getting a 5% rate increase. Is that effectively now 4% or some other number, given the drag there? And would you say this is getting back to pre-pandemic practices as the environments normalize? I think you've talked something about that in the past? Or do you think this is something that's kind of gone well beyond that? Steve Filton : Yes. I think the way you frame the question, Stephen, is quite appropriate. I think that what we experienced or observed was particularly early on in the pandemic when health care utilization dropped dramatically. I think we felt like the managed care payers eased up quite a bit in what -- sort of what their historically more aggressive utilization review, audits, denials, patient status changes, that sort of thing. I think as utilization picked up for the industry in 2023 and seem to be getting more back to normal and I think created some pressure on the MLRs for the managed care companies they got -- they returned to sort of what I would describe as their historical practices when it came to again, denial and claims reviews and that sort of thing. And I think that's what we're seeing. And I think the way it's reflected is. And it's difficult to quantify in a precise way, but our acute care revenue per adjusted admission, which was up only modestly in the quarter, I think we would have been higher had it not been for this behavior.  Now I think to a degree, we view it as again, relatively temporary in nature. You saw that our accounts receivable days outstanding ticked up in the quarter. A lot of this is I think, sort of an extended process, meaning we'll appeal a lot of these claims denials. We'll work to collect a lot of these moneys. And I think we will collect a substantial amount of them down the road. But again, in the current period, it did weigh I think, somewhat on our acute care revenue per adjusted administered. Operator : Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of UBS. A.J. Rice: Maybe two things. Just to put a finer point on your revenue per adjusted admission trend in acute you're talking about MCO behavior. I think you also commented on volumes coming back tend to be a little lower acuity. Is there any way to parse that out? Do you think the underlying apples-to-apples pricing in acute care is still in that sort of 2% to 3% range. and how much are each of those being a drag. And then the flip side on the behavioral side, it looks like it's more of a volume question. And you mentioned Medicaid redeterminations, but there's been times when it's been constrained somewhat by staffing challenges. And just maybe comment on the underlying demand. This is still there to the same degree has been historically on the behavioral side. Steve Filton : Okay. Quite a bit in your question, A.J., I'll try and cover it all. again, I think on the acute side, as you suggest, in our prepared comments, and I think we've talked about this in previous quarters, I think the volumes are particularly high in 2023 because we are experiencing, not just us, but the industry in general, some level of recapture of procedures that were postponed or deferred during the pandemic. And I think by their nature, those procedures tend to be the lower acuity, less intense procedures. Obviously, the emerging sorts of procedures that occurred during the pandemic, the heart attacks, the strokes, the accidents, trauma, those were attended to immediately but more elective, low-intensity stuff with the things that were deferred, including as -- even as simply as visits to primary care physicians, et cetera. And so as those began to occur kind of in their more normal trajectory, they sort of create a cascade of demand as well. So somebody who hasn't seen their primary care doctor for a couple of years, now goes and now had his visit to the cardiologist or had routine colonoscopy or whatever it may be. And I think you're seeing that. So as our volumes, I think, are elevated, our revenue per admission is somewhat more muted. I think over time, we would expect our volumes to moderate a little bit, but also our revenue per adjusted admission to come up. And again, I think we have a view that the long-term model in this business has not changed dramatically. I think we imagine that revenue growth in the acute business over time for a historically long time has been in that kind of mid-single-digit range, 5%, 6%, 7% and split pretty evenly between price and volume. And I think as time passes, we'll get closer and closer back to those historical norms. I think on the behavioral side, as you suggest, the sort of dynamic has been -- kind of the flip side of that where pricing has been particularly strong. And again, that's a little bit of a mix issue. We've talked about some weakness in the residential business. In a couple -- a handful of facilities that are challenged with some very specific issues, but also with Medicaid redeterminations I mentioned earlier. But again, I think over time, those at least will see an increase in residential business. That will naturally bring down pricing, but will also increase volumes.  And the staffing issue just is a continuing issue we remain constrained in some markets, in some facilities by a lack of staff that could be nurses. It could be therapists. It could be mental health technicians who are nonprofessionals. Generally, I think we continue to improve our recruitment and our retention metrics. And I think those metrics as they continue to get better, will drive greater volumes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jamie Perse of Goldman Sachs. Jamie Perse : First on physician subsidies, can you just give us -- first, can you confirm whether that was in line with the expectations this quarter? And then secondly, just what are you seeing in terms of the market dynamics? Are you seeing the market start to settle? Or do you see more disruption out there? And any comments on your prior comments from 2Q about that kind of flattening out into next year? Steve Filton : Yes. So Jamie, the comment that we made in Q2 was that we had originally anticipated and what we included in our 2023 original guidance was that physician expense would be $55 million to $60 million higher in 2023 than it was in 2022. As it turned out, I think this has been a bigger issue than we anticipated, and I think virtually all of our peers anticipated around the country. And what we said is that we anticipated that the second half of the year would also reflect like another $55 million or $60 million increase over the second half of 2022. And we are tracking very closely to those numbers in the third quarter. So in other words, I don't think we've had a material sequential increase in our pro fees or in our physician expenses.  Our expectation, what we said at the time was we thought -- not necessarily that physician expenses would absolutely flatten out in 2024. But certainly, that the rate of increase, which is running in the 35%, 40% range this year would moderate significantly. And while I think we were not prepared to suggest exactly what it would be right now, I think, something in the 10% to 15% range of increase would be sort of more of what we would expect.  And it's really a function of -- the industry, I think, has largely sort of had to reset itself since the No Surprise Billing Act passed and the impact of that on the profitability of these physician billing businesses or physician services, the impact of the lower billings paves its way through the system.  So what we're finding is we're replacing those contracts that are most expensive. We're putting them out to bid. We're in some cases, in-sourcing the service. We believe that we'll be able to -- through those activities drive greater efficiencies, and that's why we have this general view that 2024 will not be as volatile and will not have as many material increases as we saw in 2023. But certainly, as we get closer to our 2024 guidance, we'll have a better sense of that, and we'll give more detail. But again, at the moment, we're tracking for the back half of the year, sort of exactly where we said we'd be last quarter. Jamie Perse : Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then secondly, just on 2024. Can you update us on progress with the three de novo hospitals, in Nevada, Florida and D.C. Specifically, how should we think about the EBITDA drag as some of those preopening expenses ramp up next year? Steve Filton : Sure. So the only hospital that will actually open in 2024 is our West Henderson facility in Las Vegas, which I think at the moment is scheduled to open either late in Q3 or early in Q4. So I think it will have a bit of a drag in our 2024 results. But given that it's relatively late in the year, given our historical success in opening hospitals in that market, I don't think it will be a tremendous drag. Again, as we get closer to our actual guidance, we'll put some more concrete numbers around that. But I don't think it should be terribly impactful to our 2024 guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Philip Chickering : Can I go back to Medicaid redetermination again for a second. Is this primarily inpatient or is it residential? And looking at the referral channels and basing in Texas, are you -- is there any of your patients in the ER that can't get discharged and inpatient behavioral because they don't have coverage or any other color on which channels you're seeing the referrals due to Medicaid redetermination in Texas. Steve Filton : Yes. So I think as I mentioned, and again, I want to be clear that I'm not sure that the data that we get and the space that we have is sort of absolutely precise or that we can sort of correlate it to redeterminations in a very precise way. I think what we observed during Q3 was that the number of inquiries that we're getting, and that includes, as you suggest, referrals from third-party sources. It includes direct calls to our 800 numbers, it includes direct inquiries to our Internet sites, et cetera. We're not necessarily down in volume, but what we were noticing is that it was a greater number of patients who did not have appropriate financial coverage. We always have some patients who don't, but it seems -- that number seemed to elevate in Q3. And it seemed to elevate in particular geographies in which Medicaid redeterminations were high. I mentioned Texas a bunch of times. I think Arkansas, Indiana, were also states where we saw an elevated level.  But again, I'm not sure that I can parse it between inquiries from referral sources or direct increase to us. And like I said, I don't know that we can also tie it directly to what we generally are asking patients is what their current sort of financial coverage is. We're not necessarily getting their history of had Medicaid, lost Medicaid. We will talk to them about whether we can help them get Medicaid coverage, et cetera, but we don't necessarily document the history there. So it's a little bit difficult to, I think, give the level of sort of precise data that you're looking for. Philip Chickering : Okay. So just to make sure I understand that. So the number of inbound inquiries are basically the same, but the financial ability to pay was lower. Steve Filton : Correct. Philip Chickering : Okay. Got it. And then a quick follow-up to Jamie's questions on the business pressures. Thanks for giving us this number is about 30% to 40% increase for this year, moderating sort of 10% to 15% for next year. I guess, what percentage of contracts are locked in either typically multiyear contracts? So what percentage contracts are already locked in for next year? Or you've already gone and in-sourced this group yourselves? Steve Filton : Yes. I think the truth is, Pito, these contracts are multiyear contracts, but they all have short-term outs. So in other words, I mean, I think the reason this physician expense issue became a crisis in 2023. And is that -- even though hospitals, I think, have long-term contracts with their physician -- their contract physician providers, their ER physicians, their anesthesiologist those groups were coming to hospitals and saying, look, we're going to give you a 90-day or 120-day notice whatever our contract calls for unless you're able to increase our subsidy or change our contract in some way, et cetera.  So I'm not sure that the underlying length of the contract is all that determined because I think in most cases -- for us, and I'm guessing for others in the industry because otherwise, this wouldn't have become the issue that it did have -- all have short-term out. Operator : Our next question comes from Sarah James of Cantor Fitzgerald. Sarah James : I wanted to go back and clarify two comments that you made. First, on what sounds like the low acuity pent-up demand working its way through. You said you expect it to phase down over time. So just wondering if that means you expect it to still be a factor in 2024, if you're talking about phasing down through the end of this year? And the second clarification is just on the inpatient denials from insurers. Can you give us a little bit more context? Are these procedure classes that the payers are saying should have been outpatient? Or is it something about the number of hours spend or some other aspect that they're pushing back on? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, so I've said before that it is virtually impossible for us to precisely say whether a particular procedure is a catch-up of something that was postponed or deferred during the pandemic. So in other words, when we schedule an elective surgery or an elective diagnostic test. We have no idea when that patient sort of originally contemplated that procedure or discussed it with their physician, et cetera.  What we do know is that the volume of elective procedures clearly declined certainly in the early stages of the pandemic and they have been picking up since. And so we conclude and I think it's a reasonable conclusion that there is some element of catch-up. And to be fair, if you look at it, acute care adjusted admissions for us were up like 10% in the first quarter. Which was really kind of an extraordinary number. It's moderated a little bit in Q2, down to like 8%, which is still a very high number, moderated to a little less than 7% in Q3. Which, again, still a very robust number from a historical perspective, but seems to be moderating a little bit.  Your question about how quickly it continues, how much is left in the pipeline. The truth of the matter is I'm not sure that anybody can answer that question with precision. I just don't know that, that data is out there in a meaningful way that anybody can capture. So look, when we, again, give our 2024 guidance, we will make some guesstimate based on trends and how it's going and what we think acute care volumes will look like in 2024.  But I think broadly, our view is that those lower acuity volumes will continue to get caught up and moderate, and we'll get back to again, mid-single-digit acute care revenue growth that ultimately will be split between price and volume pretty evenly, whether that happens early in '24. Late in '24, I think that's yet to be determined. Your question about denials, particularly in the acute business, the issue that I think is probably, first and foremost, tends to be classification of patients between an inpatient admission and observation status. With obviously a patient who -- and this is frustrating for us because A lot of these patients are in the hospital for multiple days. But from the managed care perspective, don't meet inpatient admission criteria even though we're treating them for multiple days and maybe then getting paid for them as if they were simply an outpatient in our emergency room.  But that's the main issue. We do get sort of flat out denials where an insurance company would say that a patient shouldn't have been treated at all. But the vast majority of issues that we have with insurance companies on the acute side are over patient classification between inpatient and observation. Operator : Our next question comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho. Ann Hynes : Can you just give an update on the behavioral hospitals that had some issues in Q2, how they are progressing -- I'm sorry, progressing back to normal emission trends. And also maybe to that same effect, I know in Q2, you hired a bunch of nurses that take a while to train and a while to ramp up. Can you talk about how that's going? And when you think that group of nurses will be able to take on a full patient load that we'll be able to see in the admission trends? Steve Filton : Thanks, Ann. So you alluded to the two items that we probably discussed at the greatest length in Q2 that was affecting behavioral volumes in Q2. One was a handful of residential treatment facilities that were challenged with very kind of specific and nuanced issues with either regulators or referral sources, et cetera, that were working their way through.  And then secondly, on a broader kind of more macro basis, so significant amount of new nursing graduates into the system, having to orient them, get them trained, et cetera. In both cases, we talked about the fact that the sort of recovery from those things would take the better part of the year. But by the end of the year and early into 2024, we thought both those issues would be largely behind us. I think that's true.  The first issue is a much more sort of identifiable issue, those facilities will sort of return to their normal trajectory. The staffing issue is obviously an ongoing one. We're constantly hiring new nurses and having to train them, et cetera. Again, I think it became an issue in Q2 in the spring when a lot of new nursing graduates were coming out of school where those numbers sort of crept up and we're having sort of a measurable impact in the business. I think the encouraging thing from our perspective is that overall, our hiring rates as well as our turnover -- hiring rates are going up and our turnover rates are coming down, albeit in both cases incrementally. Which should allow us to, in our minds, get back to kind of what we think is a more normative and expected level of volume growth in behavioral, which is probably not terribly higher than the 1% we're running now, but maybe in the 3% or 4%. And in terms of our model and our ability to generate incremental earnings and incremental margin growth, that small increase in occupancy should make a big difference. Ann Hynes : All right. And I'm not sure if you said this, but can you just provide the contract on premium labor as a percentage of total labor for nursing and acute care? Steve Filton : Yes. So it was $69 million in Q3, which is about a 10% to 15% increase over what we've been running last few quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. You may have just -- I don't know I just missed, but you made a comment earlier about how lack of labor is restricting volume growth. But then on the RTC side, it sounds like you got redetermination potentially restricting volume growth, which seems that odd. I guess you're saying that the occupancy difficulty is on the acute side and that it's not really a lack of labor on the RTC side or else you'd just be able to refill that redetermination headwind, right? Steve Filton : Yes. I just think they're discrete issues, Kevin. I think again, Medicaid redeterminations, I think, again, in just certain geographies are creating, we believe, relatively temporarily a bolus of patients who lack coverage, who didn't lack coverage, let's say, a quarter ago or 2 quarters ago. And so where -- we seem to be turning more patients away in Q3 for lack of financial resources than we have had in the past.  But again, we think that's sort of a temporary issue. The staffing issue tends to be more of an issue in the acute behavioral business just because we rely more on RMs in that patient care model. And so yes, I mean, the staffing constraint and the deflection issue in behavioral tends to be more skewed to the acute behavioral business than the residential business. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess on the professional fees, I just want to -- I think you said the number went from 6% of revenue to 7.6% of revenue. Was that an acute care revenue number? Or is that a total revenue number? And then is there any reason to think that this cost pressure is fundamentally different than any other cost pressure? Like right now, you're going back and getting better rates to match the inflation spikes you've seen over the last few years. Is this cost pressure just one more cost pressure that you would have to price in over the next few years and maybe it takes 3 years to recapture the 1.6% headwind to margins, but you should -- you would expect to catch that eventually? Or is there anything structurally different about this cost versus others? Steve Filton : Yes. So two things. Number one, in terms of the first question, yes, I should have been clear this is the physician expenses really, as we've been discussing, it is really ER coverage, anesthesiology coverage and by definition, is an acute care issue, and those percentages were meant to be percentages of acute care revenue.  Your second question about sort of isn't just like any other expense. I mean, again, as I was mentioning, I think in a previous response, I think what really drove this sort of immediate pressure and position expense and the timing of it was the passage of the No Surprise Billing Act. And what I think we all collectively learned was that these physician coverage businesses had relied on their profitability in large part for their billings to out-of-network patients. I'm not sure collectively, we have a full understanding of that. So when that ability was reduced dramatically by the No Surprise Billing Act, those businesses to the degree that they were run by third parties or even to the degree that hospitals were insourcing, became much less profitable, and we had to absorb those costs. I mean in our case, in almost all cases, we were just having to pay third parties more. But I think once that gets reset, I'm not sure there be pressure continues. I mean, to me, that's a onetime reset. I think that's what you're seeing play through our numbers in 2023, et cetera. I do think there's also an element, I mean, there is, I think, a finite -- there's a shortage of these kinds of doctors much like there was a shortage of nurses that we felt during the pandemic, and that exacerbated the dynamic a little bit. But again, I think that expense rose by 35% or 40% for us in 2023. I can't think of another expense that rose by anywhere near that amount. And so again, I think we have a view that this is a largely kind of onetime notion. That's not to say that there won't be pressure on physician expense next year that, as I said earlier, it couldn't increase by 10% or 15%. And something above the rate of inflation. But I just don't think we think that this is something that we're going to have to face 35% or 40% increases multiple years in a row. Kevin Fischbeck : But I'm sorry, maybe I'm just -- it seems to me like you're not saying this 1.6% acute care margin pressure is going to reverse over time as you just price -- surgeries, everything higher to reflect you now have an increased cost in here. You're saying this is a new baseline and we should kind of think differently about the long-term margin in acute because these pressures won't continue to get worse, but they're here to stay. Steve Filton : Yes, I don't think anybody is suggesting that physician expenses are likely to decline anytime soon. I don't think that's anything we have suggested. Like I said, we said earlier, when people talk about what's it likely to be in 2024, I said a 10% or 15% increase is not an unreasonable way to think about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Whit Mayo of Leerink. Benjamin Mayo : I know you guys are still going through the planning process for 2024, but I just wanted to sort of dial in to maybe some of the top strategic priorities you have for the behavioral health business that might be different than some of the initiatives in prior years? You've covered your labor agenda pretty well on this call and the progress -- the small progress, I think, that you're seeing there. But just anything else you'd call out, any organizational changes, anything that gets you excited or less excited about next year? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, so Whit, I think as we've discussed, obviously, staffing, recruitment retention remains a top priority and focus, and honestly, I think will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Like I said, I think we feel like we've made a significant amount of progress, but it continues to be a major focus because, again, I think we have a belief that to the degree that we can hire appropriate clinical personnel, particularly in very specific geographies, very specific hospitals. We absolutely have the ability to increase occupancy significantly.  There are other initiatives, I think we have to increase occupancy. I think broadly, increasing occupancy is sort of the most significant opportunity we see in our behavioral business. In a business where pricing has been strong, where I think what Q3 reflects is that cost controls have been improving. We've been reducing contract labor. We've been reducing over time. I think that increased occupancy is the most significant opportunity we had in [indiscernible] going forward. And I think we believe it's a significant opportunity.  Recruitment retention is a big way to get there, but we're looking at broadening our continuum, focusing on certain service lines like substance abuse and MAT and telehealth and outpatient and broadening sort of the continuum of care that we already, I think, offer a pretty broad continuum of care, but broadening that even more and broadening our payer mixes that we reach out to, we have a pretty strong presence in both the active and retired military but I think have a number of initiatives to increase our penetration there. So there's a handful of important initiatives in behavioral. But all I think would fall under this umbrella of being able to increase occupancy. Benjamin Mayo : Got it. Steve, just looking at the guidance, I know that you're reiterating it, but my math, if I just apply very simple normal seasonality looking at the DPP program in Florida you can easily get to the high end of the range. And I know that you're very respectful of the volatile operating environment, but just sort of anything that I'm missing or any refresh views as you kind of look within the range and kind of how you feel like you're tracking next. Steve Filton : Yes. I mean I feel like -- and I will say that we don't pay a great deal of attention to consensus estimates, but the last time that I looked at consensus estimates, I think they were sort of in the midpoint of our revised guidance. It seems like a reasonable target at the moment. I think as we've discussed on the call, in my mind, clearly, the two upsides for us, number one, as we just discussed, is if we're able, over the fourth quarter to increase behavioral volumes and occupancy, I think that would be extremely helpful and create a significant amount of upside. And on the acute side, being able to push that pricing number up, recapture some of the sort of disputed amounts from our managed care payers, increased acuity, that sort of thing.  So I think we've largely discussed what the upsides are and that if we were able to achieve those things, maybe we could get beyond where the consensus targets have us now. Operator : Our final question comes from Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Joshua Raskin : Just on the physician staffing costs again. Can you just remind us how much of the staffing may be for ED anesthesiology, how much of that is outsourced or if any of it's in-sourced at this point? And then separately, how are your employee physicians performing? Is it really just an issue of specialists that we're billing for specific out-of-network issues? Or are you seeing some of that internally as well? Steve Filton : Yes. So first of all, for us, Josh, all of these contract services have historically been outsourced at least ER and anesthesiology. We have, in the last 3 or 4 months, brought some of those services in-house where we thought it made economic sense to do it, but historically, they've all been outsourced. I think it's a very different dynamic. And I think again, it's very specific to these house-based physicians, anesthesiology, ER being by far the highest ones. But we're seeing it some in radiology, some in intensivist or labors or whatever. But clearly, ER and anesthesiology being the two largest. Our employed physicians who are just either regular primary care or specialists. I don't think they've been affected in a material way by the No Surprise Billing Act. Essentially, those physicians are in network with virtually all of the payers that we're in network with. So it's really not an issue with them. So this dynamic, I think, is very specific to the hospital-based physicians. Joshua Raskin : That makes sense. And then just one last one on '24. I know you're talking about this normalization. But when I look at some of the same-store revenue growth numbers, mid- to very -- mid-to-high single digits in the acute side, very high single digits to low double digits on the behavioral side. It just seems like pretty tough comps. And so do you think this is just more of a catch-up reset year and that next year we'll be back in that, pick a number, 5%, 6% range overall? Steve Filton : Yes. And again, I think I made those comments earlier. I mean, I think, yes, I think we think that in both cases, revenue growth, whether it's exactly in the beginning of 2024 later. But I think we think it moderates to sort of more historically normative levels. And I would also say a more historically normative split.  So on the acute side, I do think volumes are likely to come down over time, but I think acuity will come up. And again, we'll get back to kind of mid-single-digit pricing.  I think in behavioral, we're likely to see pricing moderate a little bit, but also see volumes come up and again, get to kind of mid-to-upper single-digit pricing or upper single-digit revenue growth. And in both cases, I think with the moderation in costs with physician expense on the acute side coming into better control with contract labor coming down and overtime coming down, it should put us in a position where we're back on that trajectory of getting -- being on a path to get back to pre-pandemic margins in both segments. Operator : I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Steve Filton for closing remarks. Steve Filton : Thank you. We'd just like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Thank you and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning and we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the fourth quarter and to December 31, 2023. During the conference call, we\u2019ll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.16 for the fourth quarter of 2023. After adjusting for the impact of the item reflected on the supplemental schedule as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.13 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Marc Miller : Our acute hospitals continue to experience strong demand for their services in the fourth quarter. With adjusted admissions increasing 5.6% year-over-year. Overall surgical volumes were solid as well, increasing 4% year-over-year. Net revenue per adjusted admission, which has lagged for much of the year, increased by 3.7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, as acuity trends and pressure from payers have started to stabilize. Meanwhile, the amount of premium pay in the quarter, which declined from a peak of $153 million in the first quarter of 2022, was $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, similar to what it was in the third quarter. For the full year 2023, our strong acute care revenues were largely offset by elevated expenses, especially physician subsidies, which resulted in flattish margins for the full year. During the fourth quarter, same facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 7.2%, driven primarily by a 6.1% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. The patient day growth in the quarter was greater at our acute behavioral hospitals versus our lower acuity residential treatment centers, which tended to drive up the revenue per day to relatively robust levels consistent with our year-to-date experience. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to see a negative impact of Medicaid redeterminations in certain states on behavioral health volumes, although it appears that impact has also begun to stabilize. With 8% revenue growth, same-facility EBITDA for our behavioral hospitals has increased approximately 9% for the full year of 2023 compared to 2022. Steve Filton : We also note that in the fourth quarter, we recorded approximately $18 million in connection with the recently approved Mississippi Hospital Access Program covering the six-month period of July through December of 2023. Our cash generated from operating activities was $452 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to $297 million during the same quarter in 2022 and $1.268 billion during the full year of 2023, as compared to $996 million during 2022. We spent $743 million on capital expenditures during 2023, which was consistent with our original forecast for the year. For the full year of 2023, we acquired $525 million of our own shares pursuant to our repurchase program. Since January 1, 2019, we have repurchased more than 26 million shares representing almost 30% of our shares outstanding as of that date. As of December 31, 2023, we had $701 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. Marc Miller : The core operating assumptions underlying our 2024 operating results forecast, which was provided in last night\u2019s release, largely reflect the historical pre-COVID trends in the respective businesses. We anticipate that volumes in our acute segment will moderate from the elevated 2023 levels, but conversely, acuity and pricing in our acute business will increase, and for the full year, both metrics will resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. Despite the continuing shift of services from inpatient to outpatient settings and pressure from payers to restrain reimbursement increases in a variety of ways. We expect continued improvement in premium pay labor trends and general cost trends that will remain largely stable in 2024. Specifically, physician expenses, which were a major headwind in 2023, are expected to grow by the overall inflation rate in 2024. As noted in our press release, our 2024 operating results forecast includes an additional $149 million of Nevada supplemental revenues, which were approved by CMS in late December and disclosed by us in an 8-K filed in early January. We believe demand for our behavioral services remains robust and our same-store adjusted patient day growth in 2024 is forecasted to exceed the 2.1% growth we experienced in 2023. A significant driver of behavioral volume upside is due to our success in filling vacant positions. But we acknowledge that specialty workforce shortages in certain markets continue to be an obstacle to even more volume growth. In both our business segments, we were pleased that measures of patient satisfaction and quality of care increased in 2023 and we are focusing on continued improvement of these metrics in 2024. We are pleased to answer questions at this time. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Hi. Good morning. I just want to ask you about the Two Midnight rule. I know that throughout the year, you had a lot of denials for these short-stay inpatient stays. Did that get better in Q4 and do you actually think one of the large national managed care plans is saying they actually think hospitals might have billed early and start benefiting Q4? Do you actually think that happens? Did you receive actually a benefit in Q4 from kind of early billing for this regulatory change that\u2019s starting in January 1, 2024? And also, can you tell me what your guidance includes for any potential benefit for this change, for this and also for Medicaid redetermination considering there\u2019s like a big growth in the health exchange market? And are you assuming any kind of positive pay and makeshift benefit in guidance? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, as Marc commented in his prepared remarks, I think, what we saw in Q4 was improved revenue per admission -- per adjusted admission in the acute business, which I think we attribute to a combination of increasing acuity, but also at least stabilizing pressure from payers. Again, I think we saw for much of 2024, excuse me, for 2023 and payers being more aggressive as their medical loss ratios were rising, et cetera, in a variety of ways, including denials and patient status changes, which would include recasting patients from inpatient to observation, et cetera. I don\u2019t think we changed our billing practices during the quarter, but I think all you\u2019re seeing is, effectively, I think, we\u2019re starting to anniversary some of that more aggressive behavior of the payers in the fourth quarter. As far as sort of how we\u2019ve guided, again, I think, as Marc said in his remarks, I think, we\u2019re assuming that in the acute segment, that volumes moderate a little bit in 2024 and that acuity pricing improves. So we returned to kind of what I would consider to be a more historically normative model of mid-single-digit growth in acute care, maybe 5%, 6% growth, split pretty evenly between price and volume. And I think what that really means is, we\u2019re being a little conservative about volumes, which have sort of been running hotter than that, but we\u2019re being a little bit more aggressive about pricing, which has been running less than that. But it\u2019s not like we have included in our guidance a specific impact from sort of how payers will use the Two Midnight rule differently going forward, et cetera. We believe there may be an incremental opportunity there, but I don\u2019t think we necessarily feel it\u2019s material until we really see the behavior on the part of the payers change. Ann Hynes : Okay. Great. And just one follow-up. You talked about in your prepared remarks that the labor shortages are still impacting volume. Is this in both segments or is it mainly behavioral and maybe how much do you think your volume is being held back because of labor? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, so as we\u2019ve said, I think, throughout the last several years, it\u2019s been a very tight labor market and I think it\u2019s affected the two businesses differently. On the acute side, we\u2019ve generally been able to fill all of our necessary positions, but obviously often at a higher cost using a temporary label and traveling nurses, et cetera. Although, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, those numbers have declined significantly. On the acute side, excuse me, on the behavioral side, in contrast, in a number of cases, we\u2019re simply unable to fill our positions over the last several years and it has curtailed our volume growth. Again, I think our basic guidance for next year is mid-single-digit growth, probably, in the behavioral segment, that means, 6%, 7%, 8%, again, split pretty evenly between price and volume. In the behavioral segment, I think that means we\u2019re being a little bit more conservative about price, which has been running hot the last couple of years and a little bit more aggressive about volume, which has been relatively soft this year. I think, Marc said, our patient day growth in 2023 was 2.1%, so our guidance assumes something greater than that. But we acknowledge that in some markets, in some hospitals, there are positions that we still have difficulty filling. I don\u2019t know that we can say precisely, but we do think that we could run higher volumes if, in fact, we could fill all of our positions, but we know that\u2019s not a realistic outlook at the moment at least. Ann Hynes : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you first about the 2024 guide. The -- specifically, Nevada ends up at the high end of the range you gave before, obviously, a great tailwind, ex that, it looks like EBITDA growths at the midpoints in the 4% range, too. Just trying to understand, I think, we\u2019re probably only splitting hairs a little bit, maybe expected 1%, 2% better than ex-Nevada. Just curious if there were any kind of one-timers in 2023 where it\u2019s not really apples-to-apples that you want to point out or anything within the guidance. For instance, Marc mentioned in a tough comp on inpatient, how -- like maybe you can tell us what you think the EBITDA by business is going to grow and any thoughts on why that\u2019s maybe 1% or 2% shorter than kind of typical? Steve Filton : Yeah. So, first of all, Justin, I mean, I think, that there\u2019s a series of arguments being made that excluding the $150 million increase from Nevada or quite frankly excluding any of our Medicaid supplemental payments is really an appropriate way to look at the business, because I think what we would argue quite strenuously is that, one of the reasons -- one of the significant reasons that our margins and earnings have lagged over the last several years is that Medicaid reimbursement in particular has not kept up with elevated costs, whether that\u2019s the labor costs across both businesses or the physician subsidy expense that Marc referenced and the acute business in his remarks. So, in our minds, the Nevada increase specifically but these Medicaid supplemental programs in general are simply bringing us back to adequate rates that at least partially compensate us for some of these increased expenses. So, in my mind, ignoring them as we think about our growth year-to-year is not necessarily the correct way of doing it. But I\u2019ll try to answer your question the way you asked it. What I would say is, I do believe that, after a couple of difficult years and difficult operating environments and elevated costs, again, in labor, physician costs, just general inflation sort of across the Board, we\u2019ve been a little bit cautious about our ability to expand margins. I would say that if we\u2019re able to achieve the revenue targets that we\u2019ve set in our guidance, we\u2019d be hopeful that we could do better than the margins that are embedded in guidance. But as we\u2019ve faced over the last several years, some of these expense increases have been a bit unpredictable, physician subsidies in 2023 are a perfect example. So I think we\u2019ve been prudently cautious about how we look at the profitability growth in both businesses. Justin Lake : That\u2019s helpful. And then, Steve, as you mentioned on DPP, and I don\u2019t disagree that it\u2019s lumpy, but it should be part of the business. That said, it\u2019s gone to a place I never imagined it going, these supplemental payments. And I\u2019m just curious, like, you guys actually put out a great table in the 10-K where you actually showed us the estimated number for 2024. And I\u2019m just sitting here looking over time, Steve, I think in 2019, it was $225 million of net benefit or 13% of EBITDA. Now it\u2019s an $809 million benefit or 41% of your EBITDA guidance in 2024. And I\u2019m just curious, like, do you think this continues, like, do you see any states that, could be the next Nevada or do you see the potential that, this starts to moderate at some point or kind of stabilize, because it\u2019s obviously been a big part of growth over the last couple of years. Just curious how you think about it going forward. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. So, look, I think, you make a good point. I mean, I think, if you look, and I appreciate your commenting on our disclosures, because I think we\u2019ve provided probably more expansive disclosures in this area of Medicaid supplemental payments than any of our public peers. But if you go back, however many years you want to track it, it has, as you\u2019ve suggested, an upward trajectory and that\u2019s not by accident. I mean, I think it\u2019s an acknowledgment by the states and by CMS that Medicaid reimbursement, again, in specific states, has really been inadequate and -- has really been inadequate over the last several years in an elevated inflationary environment with significant expense pressures, particularly in labor. And the states are providing these monies, not as bonuses for hospital providers, but quite frankly, as necessary supplemental reimbursement to keep them in a position, to keep the providers in a position to be able to provide absolutely necessary services to a population that otherwise will not receive them. So, quite honestly, there are other states that do not have these programs that are talking about adopting them. We don\u2019t really disclose them until they get further down the road and sort of are submitted for approval and that sort of thing. But we know that conversations are happening in a number of other states. CMS, to your point, has certainly talked about the impact of the growth in these programs and has talked about, I think, limiting the growth. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re really talking about cutting back these programs, but they\u2019re talking about capping the growth, maybe capping the growth so that Medicaid reimbursement can\u2019t exceed commercial reimbursement. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at risk of that in any of our states or just sort of capping the overall growth rate, et cetera. So I could see that happening where the rate of growth slows, but it strikes me that once these programs are implemented, the safety net hospitals that they are really designed to target become so reliant on them that it would be extremely difficult for the states and/or CMS to stop the programs or curtail them in a terribly material way. Marc Miller : I think that\u2019s the main point, that it\u2019s going to be hard to go backwards because of these safety net not-for-profit hospitals that rely on this. And so the crux of your question as to whether or not you can bank on this in the future, we never know, but I think it\u2019s going to be hard for them to reverse a lot of this. And in fact, to Steve\u2019s point, we\u2019re seeing a lot more activity in other states that we had never seen before. So we think it\u2019s going to increase. Justin Lake : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Joshua Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Question just started, I\u2019m looking at the longer term as you sort of think about capital deployment. I\u2019d be interested in your updated views on the relative attractiveness of the behavioral health and the acute care segments and specifically thinking, whether you believe either one of those segments has either a different growth or return profile one more attractive than the other? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, obviously, anyone who looks at our financials, you can see that we are in a higher margin in the behavioral business, I think, probably, higher returns. But I think we\u2019ve always viewed our opportunities for capital deployment agnostically in the sense that we want to invest our next dollar of capital wherever we think it\u2019s going to earn the highest return and that\u2019s not just about which line of business, but it\u2019s about the individual market opportunity. Las Vegas is a great example, we\u2019ve invested a tremendous amount of capital, hundreds of millions of dollars of capital over the last decade or more in Las Vegas and I think for the most part, it has earned a significantly sort of outsized return. We are not about to stop investing in that market and protecting our number one market share position in that market, et cetera. So our capital deployment decisions are, I think, made, as I said, market-by-market, in terms of the demographics of the market, the competitive environment. And obviously, as I think we commented in our remarks as well, a significant amount of capital has been devoted over the last five years or six years to share repurchase, because we think that that\u2019s been a compelling return and opportunity for us, and we\u2019ll continue to look at that as well. Marc Miller : I\u2019ll just add one thing to what Steve said. We\u2019re looking, and I obviously agree with everything Steve said, but we\u2019re looking at more outpatient opportunities now than we probably have done in the past. And so I think more of them are being presented to us, and again, if we think that there are good returns there and that they make sense for increasing our success in our markets, we\u2019ll continue to look at those and deploy more capital to outpatient, maybe at a greater percentage than we did historically. Steve Filton : In both things. Marc Miller : In both things. Sorry. Joshua Raskin : Right. So that makes sense, and so in theory, those are margin accretive. Those are certainly return accretive, but margin accretive, I guess, depending on though if there\u2019s more opportunities maybe in the acute care segment in the short-term, maybe that\u2019s not the case. But I guess my follow up would be, I\u2019m curious about the current environment for additional supply then. Are you seeing any major capital deployed in your markets by competitors and I guess, conversely, you know, sort of that Vegas example, what markets do you think are in need of more supply? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, so we -- as you know, we\u2019re opening a new hospital in Las Vegas late in 2024 in West Henderson. That\u2019s on the heels of opening Henderson Hospital five years ago, if I\u2019m getting my chronology correct and that\u2019s been a very significant success. We\u2019ve continued to expand our presence in South Texas and Riverside County, California, where we have significant market positions. We\u2019re building a new hospital in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. And one in the DC market where we\u2019ve had a significant amount of historical success. So, and then, on the behavioral side, we continue to add beds and do joint ventures with non-hospital -- non-profit hospital partners. So, again, I think, there are lots of opportunities. I think, the challenge for us is to be judicious about where we do that. And to your point, Joshua, I mean, I think, our competitors are also investing in markets. I think HCA has invested heavily in Las Vegas as well, because it has been a very lucrative return market for both of us. So, we see that, it really varies by market, it would be difficult to characterize the sort of capital deployment of our competitors in a broad way. But yeah, we certainly see our competitors expanding as well, and again, our whole sort of view is we don\u2019t want to chase what our competitors are doing, we want to really take advantage of the strong franchise positions that we have and build on those and earn greater returns by investing where we\u2019ve had success. Joshua Raskin : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks. Two quick ones on the acute business. I guess, good to hear the physician fee expenses that you seem to think the worst of the inflation is behind you there. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on how or what level of contracting visibility you have on 2024 in particular. And then just a kind of step back on the acute business, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on portfolio management at a couple of your peer companies, a couple of examples of significant value creation. I was wondering how you think about the size of the acute care business philosophically and whether there could be examples potentially, whether you\u2019ve seen any increase in inbound interest on the acute side. Would love to just hear kind of how you guys are thinking about that as you contemplate capital across the company? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. I think that the notion of contracting visibility in terms of the physician subsidy expense is a little bit flawed. The reality is 18 months ago, if you had asked us and asked, frankly, any acute care hospital in the country, you know, are your hospital based physician contracts locked in, do you have rates locked in? The answer would have been yes. And what we found were because of changes in the operating environment, in particular, the No Surprise Billing Act, et cetera, that made those businesses far less profitable. The providers of those businesses, the physician groups, the companies that were providing those services simply were unable to do it and they were coming to hospitals and saying, look, you either have to provide us greater subsidies or we can\u2019t do this. There were a number of bankruptcies, et cetera. So what I will say is, I believe that over the last year and a half, most of our hospital-based physician arrangements have been recast. They\u2019ve either been renegotiating with the incumbent providers. We\u2019ve either gone out for RFPs and put in new providers or we\u2019ve employed in some cases the physicians ourselves. We\u2019ve done so, I think, really beginning late in 2022 and early in 2023, such that the increased costs of doing all that is now largely reflected in our financial statements and shouldn\u2019t increase again dramatically in 2024. But I will say again, back to the comments that I made in response to a question that Justin asked, I do think that the volatility in that area is one of the reasons why we\u2019ve been a little more cautious in our overall guidance in 2024, because I think, all hospitals would say, that was a cost that really surprised us in 2023. We think we have it under control. We think it\u2019s much more stable going into 2024. But we\u2019re certainly concerned about that popping again or happening again in some other areas. Marc Miller : I\u2019ll do the acute care development. Steve Filton : Sure. Marc Miller : As to your second question about the portfolio and acute care opportunities, we track very carefully all the companies familiar with what you\u2019re referring to, to the question of portfolio rationalization for some of those other companies out there. We are most interested in what we can do in our current acute care markets. So if there are opportunities to pick up other hospitals within markets that we are already present, we would certainly look to do that. But in addition to that, we are familiar with the whole portfolios of these companies and if there were opportunities to expand to new markets that we thought made sense, we would do that as well. Like Steve said earlier, we\u2019re kind of agnostic as to which side we deploy capital to. But if there are opportunities, we\u2019ll certainly pursue them. Steve Filton : And I know your question was not directed at the behavioral business, but I would make the point that, we\u2019ve done quite a bit of portfolio management in the behavioral business over the last five years or 10 years. If somebody wants to take our 10-K list of properties from 10 years ago, behavioral properties and compare them to today, you can see that they\u2019re quite different. We\u2019ve closed facilities, we\u2019ve sold facilities, we\u2019ve merged facilities where they\u2019re underperforming and where we\u2019re looking to increase efficiencies. We tend not to disclose that, because individual transactions are non-material, but there has been a fair amount of portfolio management on the behavioral side and then, again, we\u2019re open to that. I think we\u2019re ready for the next question. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kevin Fischbeck : Great. I was wondering if you could give us an update on where wage growth is across both the acute and the psych businesses today and to the extent that, labor is still a gating factor on the psych side of things. How do you think about the incremental return of just raising wages a couple of percent to potentially drive more volume back to the facilities? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. I would say that wage growth has moderated a little bit from its highs in both segments. I think we\u2019re probably in that 4% to 5% range of annual wage inflation, and obviously, we\u2019ve made, as again, I think, we said in our prepared remarks, a fair amount of progress in reducing premium pay, which includes temporary traveling labor and overtime and shift differential, that sort of thing. And as -- I\u2019m sorry, you want to say\u2026 Marc Miller : No. Well, the question is, we look quite often as to whether or not it makes sense to raise wages as a way to increase capacity and we have done that in certain areas. It\u2019s not as easy as one might think, but we definitely look at that and we try to figure out if there are areas where that would make more sense. The other factor for us is we have high occupancy in a lot of these facilities. So we\u2019re constantly looking and reviewing ways that we can add beds to the facilities to increase capacity. And one of the things when Steve talks about the portfolio rationalization that we\u2019ve done on the behavioral side in the last few years, what that also allows us to do is spend less time on facilities that are not growing and really spend more of our time figuring out how to do programmatic growth, not just beds, but just changing program offerings at certain facilities and changes like that that we think will have a positive effect. So we\u2019re doing a lot of that as well. Steve Filton : But I would just say, and I think, Kevin, what to some you\u2019re asking, do we think about the efficacy of paying increased wages to attract that last 1% or 2% of the workforce that would help us increase our volumes. And that\u2019s really the why -- when and why we use temporary labor, because the challenge is, if we hire somebody for that, last position or last two or three positions in the facility and they\u2019re making $5 an hour more than everybody else in the facility, in short order, everybody in the facility will be making that same wage. So that\u2019s the consideration we have to use. We certainly acknowledge that we want to fill every position we can, but we understand that there are implications to paying up to do that. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Great. And then I guess I just want to maybe push back a little bit on the guidance for acute care hospital volume growth, kind of just being more pre-pandemic growth rates of 2% or 3%. I guess when I look at your same-store volume growth going back to 2019 and just trying to get forward, I think, you\u2019re only like about 4% above where you were in 2019 five years later, when you would normally be thinking you\u2019d be growing 2% or 3%. So you\u2019re still -- in 2019, we might\u2019ve thought your volumes would be 10% or 15% above those levels. So, why is normal growth off of only 4% up like the right number? Shouldn\u2019t there be more pent-up demand or normalization in demand within your markets while in normal growth? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, and again, though, particularly the comparison that you\u2019re talking about, Kevin, I think it\u2019s wholly inappropriate to exclude the $150 million of Nevada supplemental from a comparison to 2019, because I think what we would say in Nevada is we\u2019ve had virtually no Medicaid increases for this period of time, and as a result, and we\u2019ve been questioned about this, our margins in Nevada have declined, et cetera. So to then say that, we\u2019re going to exclude the $150 million from comparing where we were margin-wise to 2019, again, I think, is a flawed approach. And again, that\u2019s not to say we believe that even with the supplemental payments, et cetera, there is still more growth to go in the acute division and more recovery to be had to get closer to those pre-pandemic margins. But I think, excluding the supplemental payments from that is a flawed way of looking at it. Kevin Fischbeck : I\u2019m sorry. My question was kind of more around the volumes, like, it feels like to me, like your volume guidance, it feels like your volumes haven\u2019t really rebounded to the long-term trend line yet. So I\u2019m still not sure why you\u2019re only growing normal. Wouldn\u2019t you still be trending back to the long-term growth rate in volume? Shouldn\u2019t you be growing fast in 2% to 3% for another couple of years? Steve Filton : I mean, our adjusted admissions in 2023 grew by 5% or I think actually over 6% for the year. Obviously, I think those are historically a high level of admission growth. We\u2019re projecting that at some point that starts to moderate. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason Cassorla : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just want to ask on behavioral, you\u2019ve talked in the past around the labor backdrop as the gating factor for bed growth. You\u2019ve discussed the portfolio rationalization efforts. I guess occupancy rates are still some 200 basis points to 300 basis points below pre-pandemic levels, with labor improvement, I know you\u2019re expecting volume growth to accelerate in 2024. Can you just give us a sense on what you\u2019re contemplating on the behavioral bed growth side moving forward and maybe just the opportunities a little bit more around that expansion at current facilities against maybe perhaps the pipeline of JVs or potential M&A for behavioral business as well? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, so I think, we added somewhere around 250 new beds in behavioral this year. We will probably add a like number, maybe a little bit more next year. But I think, the comment that Marc made is, I think we\u2019re seeing, frankly, just as much opportunity on the outpatient side as well. So we are expanding and expanding our existing outpatient services across all lines of service, including addiction treatment, et cetera, and plan to continue to do that as well. I think as Josh Raskin mentioned, that\u2019s kind of a higher returning, higher margin business. So, that\u2019s attracting more of, I think, our investment dollars there. Jason Cassorla : Okay. Fair enough. And then just following up on an earlier question a bit, just curious on what your expectation around payer mix dynamics for acute next year, obviously, redeterminations, exchange growth. You\u2019ve talked about this return of low acuity of Medicare volumes in 2023. Just any kind of expectation around how that trends into next year or into 2024? And then can you remind us what percentage of admissions are uninsured at this point, and if -- just given the backdrop, if you\u2019re seeing any indication that those uninsured admissions could be picking up, just any color, that would be great? Thanks. Steve Filton : No. We haven\u2019t seen a significant change in uninsured admissions, which run in certainly mid-single digits, 5% or 6% of our overall admissions. I think what the big change in payer mix, which I think, both the providers and payers have talked about in 2023 is that, as we\u2019ve emerged from the pandemic, I think, we\u2019ve seen more of those lower acuity, I think, especially Medicare, lower acuity procedures that patients had deferred or postponed during the pandemic taking place. And again, as our volumes moderate going forward and they have been moderating, not just for us, but certainly for our peers as well in 2023, I think, it\u2019s those lower acuity volumes that especially are moderating, which I think to a degree is what\u2019s driving the increase, let\u2019s say, in the fourth quarter in our acuity and pricing dynamic. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just to the comment on premium pay first. I think you said you started the year at $153 million in the first quarter and you were $67 million as you exited the year. Do you think the $67 million is a good run rate? Is there further opportunity? And putting it all together, how much of a tailwind do you have from reduced premium pay in 2024 versus 2023? Steve Filton : Yeah. So just to clarify, A.J., the $153 million was the first quarter of 2022, not 2023. A.J. Rice: Okay. Steve Filton : So, yeah, that number -- obviously that number has come down considerably. I think we still think that there is -- we ultimately have talked about getting to a premium pay number in the $50 million quarter range. So there\u2019s still $50 million or $60 million of opportunity. A lot of that is dependent on what happens to volumes. I think that premium pay has remained a little bit higher than we originally anticipated because acute volumes have been as strong as they\u2019ve been. But, yeah, I mean, we certainly have the goal of further reducing premium pay. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to get back to the pre-pandemic levels where it ran about $35 million a quarter, but we should be able to get at least part of the way there. A.J. Rice: And I don\u2019t have the full year number for premium pay, but how much have you just stated $67 million, how much of a tailwind would that create in 2024 versus 2023? Do you have that number by any chance? Steve Filton : Yeah. So I think that would probably -- I\u2019m doing this all the time. I think that would probably on its own be like a $30 million, $40 million improvement, because I think in the first half of the year, we were running about $85 million a quarter. A.J. Rice: Okay. And then my follow-up question, just to ask a little bit more on Medicaid, both from the supplemental and the redeterminations. On the supplemental, I know we\u2019ve talked about individual programs. When you put it all together, what you got in 2023 versus what you\u2019re expecting in 2024, how much of a change is it? I guess it could be gross or net after provider tax, just trying to understand that. And then you mentioned, I think in the press release, sort of a 10-K, that Medicaid redeterminations were a headwind for the behavioral business. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019d flesh that out a little bit more? Steve Filton : Yeah. So as I think somebody earlier has suggested, I mean, we did some pretty robust disclosure about these Medicaid supplemental programs in the 10-K that we filed last night. I\u2019d refer people to that. But we have a table that shows the supplemental increase from 2023 to estimated 2024. It\u2019s about a $200 million increase. Obviously, the $150 million of the lot is the biggest piece of that. But you can see a lot of the detail\u2026 A.J. Rice: Right. Steve Filton : \u2026 if you take a look at that schedule. And as far as Medicaid redeterminations, I think, what we\u2019ve said, A.J., is that in the states, which probably is most notably Texas on the acute side and some other Texas and some other southern states like Louisiana, Arkansas on the behavioral side, it\u2019s largely affected the child and adolescent population from our perspective and that\u2019s had a relatively minimal effect on the acute business, a bigger effect on the behavioral business. We\u2019ve seen a softness, I think in the last six months of 2023 in our child and adolescent business in the behavioral business that we attribute to a large extent to these redeterminations. We think we\u2019re sort of out of the works with that. The redeterminations for the most part or the disenrollments have taken place. We\u2019re already starting to see some of these populations re-enrolled either in Medicaid or alternative programs like CHIP or in commercial exchange programs. So I think that we\u2019re imagining that the impact of redeterminations in 2024 will be limited. A.J. Rice: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Yeah. Good morning, guys. On behavioral, like I think for 2024 guidance, I think half of the revenue guidance is coming from pricing. Pricing for behavioral has been very robust the last few years. Can you talk about the sustainability of that strong pricing you\u2019ve seen looking at the exit rate in fourth quarter? How we should think about a step down in 2024? And then any color on sort of what you\u2019re seeing between the different payer mixes, Medicare rate increases versus Medicaid and Medicare, that\u2019d be great? Steve Filton : Sure, Pito. So again, I think, as we\u2019ve commented, the strong behavioral pricing I think has really been driven in 2023 by two things. One is actual sort of softness in our residential and that\u2019s where a lot of the child and adolescent businesses is. And so a higher weighting of acute patient days to residential patient days and that by definition sort of increases what we would describe as pricing the revenue per adjusted day. As we emerge from the disenrollment challenge, as we emerge from the handful of residential facilities that had particular regulatory challenges in 2023, I think, we\u2019ll see residential growth starting to outpace acute growth and that will have a kind of muting effect on pricing. The other issue that we have talked about pretty consistently, I think, for the last 12 months or 18 months is, a pretty aggressive effort on our part to go back to payers, particularly in markets and in facilities where we are already capacity constrained and negotiate higher rates and that\u2019s, I think, particularly managed Medicaid payers who have been giving us, I think, historically, less than adequate increases. We\u2019ve had a lot of success doing that, but to some degree, we\u2019re starting to anniversary that impact. So, again, while we are certainly going to continue to strive for the maximum increases we can get from our payers, our general sense of our 2024 budget is that, pricing and acuity will decline a little bit on the behavioral side, but be offset by increased volumes. Pito Chickering : Okay. Great. And then on acute margin guidance for 2024, it sounds like physician reimbursement is now just slightly over inflation, full-time labor is normal, contract labor is a $30 million, $40 million savings guiding to flat margins, despite revenues growing 5% to 6%. Are there any known headwinds for 2024 to offset all these tailwinds or is this simply just pure conservatism at this point? Steve Filton : Yeah. Again, as I think I tried to frame it before, Pito, I think it is kind of a broad caution and conservatism that we\u2019ve taken, but informed by the pressures of the last couple of years. And when we were sitting here in, a good example is the physician expense. When we were on this exact call a year ago, we were projecting a pretty big increase in physician expense, a $50 million, $60 million increase. It turned out to be twice that. So even when we\u2019re aware of issues, et cetera, the last couple of years have created a little bit more volatility than we\u2019re accustomed to. So I think we\u2019re -- we were trying to account for some of that in what I view as a fairly cautious approach to guidance. Pito Chickering : So let me ask that differently, ignoring the $30 million, $40 million contract savings and assuming nothing normal labor, et cetera, et cetera. On a 5% to 6% revenue growth, what would be the normal margin expansion coming from that? Steve Filton : Yeah. I think that\u2019s a hard question to answer, Pito, because it\u2019s sort of, how do you define normal? We\u2019re in a high inflationary environment, et cetera. I\u2019ll just repeat what I said before. I believe that our view is if we can achieve the revenue targets that are embedded in our guidance, we\u2019d be hopeful to bring out more efficiencies and therefore higher margins from the business than are currently reflected in the guidance. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Hey. Thanks. First, Steve, I just wanted to point out that you have also considerably exceeded those initial Medicaid supplemental payment disclosures in your 10-K every year, I can recall. So I just wanted to mention that for the record. But my question really on Medicaid is there\u2019s been a theme for years now where many states have gotten workaround solutions to the IMD where Medicaid is now covering adults that actually have substance use disorders through 1115 waivers. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any evidence that you see that those policy actions are now manifesting into any volume growth for you? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, there are a couple of individual facilities and markets that I think have been affected by IMD waivers. I would say that, broadly it has had probably not a material effect on this segment, but there are specific examples I could point to. But, yeah, no, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s broadly a material impact. Whit Mayo : Okay. And back to your comments on outpatient now elevating itself as a higher priority now that Medicare is reimbursing for IOP and Partial Hospitalization Programs. Just wondering if that opens up opportunities for you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re referencing when you talk about outpatient for behavioral? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, it really, I think, is the full continuum. We have always had what we call intensive outpatient programs in our behavioral facilities or Partial Hospitalization Programs, which are sort of a means of step down from the inpatient facility. But I think what we\u2019re focusing now on, besides those programs, which we continue to maintain, is more sort of pure outpatient. In many cases, not necessarily even affiliated with an existing facility, et cetera, but standalone outpatient. And to your point, it\u2019s the Medicare advantage, it\u2019s the Medicare opportunity. But it\u2019s also, again, we\u2019re finding the need for behavioral care to be growing across all segments of the population and across all diagnoses, including addiction and others. Whit Mayo : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Sarah James : Thank you. So earlier, your comments on pricing about being a little bit below the halfway point of the 5% to 6%, I\u2019m assuming that was blended products. Could you speak to what you\u2019re seeing on the commercial rate increase side, because some of your peers are talking about mid-single digits on that and seeing a little bit of traction of being able to work in the physician fees. So I\u2019m wondering what that\u2019s looking like for you guys on the acute side? Steve Filton : Yeah. I think those characterizations are fair. So if we\u2019re talking about overall -- an overall pricing assumption in our guidance, 2.5% to 3%, we\u2019re probably getting twice that on our commercial business, so 5%, 6%. And in terms of specifics about whether we\u2019re able to cover increases in our physician subsidies, et cetera, that really varies contract by contract, et cetera. But the mid-single-digit commercial increases that you\u2019re saying our peers are citing seems to be consistent with our experience. Sarah James : Great. And one more just on what you guys are doing on technology investments on the acute and behavioral side. Are you implementing any sort of virtual bed checks on either of those segments or where would you focus your technology investments? Steve Filton : Yeah. So I would highlight, I mean, we have a lot of technology investments, but I think specifically in behavioral, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, we are implementing an electronic medical record in our behavioral facilities. That project is already underway. We are experimenting with and testing a number of technological solutions to more efficient patient grounding in our behavioral facilities where patients will wear something like an Apple Watch kind of device and we\u2019re able to track their location and we\u2019re able to track when we lay eyes on those patients, et cetera. So that\u2019s improving the efficiency of our patients and in our behavioral facilities as well. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d now like to turn it back to Steve Filton for closing remarks. Steve Filton : Yeah. We\u2019d just like to thank everybody for their time this morning and look forward to speaking to everybody in a couple of months after the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Thank you, and good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. During this conference call, we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.82 for the first quarter of 2024. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.70 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Our acute hospitals continue to experience strong demand for their services in the first quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 4.5% year-over-year on a same facility basis. When combined with the net revenue per adjusted admission increase of 4.6%, our acute care services net revenues increased by 9.6% during the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the first quarter of 2023. Despite these increases, we believe that both volumes and acuity in March were adversely impacted by the timing of Easter and spring break which occurred in March of this year compared to April of last year. In connection with the previously disclosed newly implemented Medicaid supplemental reimbursement program in Nevada, our acute care hospitals located in the state recorded approximately $38 million of aggregate incremental income during the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, premium pay in the quarter was $68 million as compared to $86 million in the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, same-facility net revenues in our Behavioral Health Hospitals increased by 10.4%, driven primarily by an 8.2% increase in revenue per adjusted day. Adjusted patient day growth in the quarter was 2.0% over the prior year quarter. We believe the patient day volume was muted somewhat by the aforementioned calendar timing issues. Our cash generated from operating activities increased by $106 million to $396 million during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $291 million during the same quarter in 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we spent $209 million on capital expenditures and acquired 700,000 of our own shares at a cost of approximately $125 million. Since January 1, 2019, we have repurchased almost 27 million shares, representing 30% of our shares outstanding as of that date. As of March 31, 2024, we had $733 million of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. I will now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments. Marc Miller : Thanks, Steve. In our year-end conference call, we said we envisioned 2024 as a year of continued strength in both of our business segments. And during the first quarter of 2024, both segments increased their operating margins when compared to the comparable quarter of 2023. We anticipated that acute care volumes would likely moderate to a degree, but remain robust compared to historical levels. We also believe the acuity trends will continue their recovery trajectory. In our Behavioral Health segment, we anticipated that patient day volumes would gradually improve over the course of the year, returning to a more historically normal level of growth in the 3% range. We noted that both of our business segments have experienced a significant increase in Medicaid supplemental payments which are helping to compensate for several years of inadequate reimbursement levels that have failed to keep up with the costs we had to incur to properly care for our patients. Overall, we're pleased with first quarter results. We are now happy to answer questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin Lake : First question on your acute care volumes in the quarter. Just to your point, Steve, I think it's pretty clear the calendar had some impacts, January, February stronger, March weaker. So I'm curious if you can maybe share with us what you were seeing monthly or maybe kind of Jan, Feb versus March. And then how does April kind of starting to look versus March? Are you seeing it kind of back to January, February levels or somewhere in between? And then secondly, we know you've got a bunch of Medicaid dollars in Nevada, curious what ran through the behavioral business in the quarter. For instance, Mississippi, I think, had at a program that was put in, can you give us some color on the impact of those Medicaid provider tax dollars and behavioral? That would be helpful as well. Steve Filton : Okay, I'll try and tackle a bunch of different issues there. Yes, so definitely acute care volumes and behavioral volumes softened in March, I think, as a result of the Easter spring break timing. We're seeing some recovery in April, I would say April is probably volume-wise somewhere in between the January, February run rate and the March run rates. And I think that's what we would expect. I mean, the shortfall in admission and elective activity and surgical activity that we saw in March, I think we would largely expect to make up not necessarily completely in April, but mostly through the second quarter. And it seems like we're on track to do that. As far as the Medicaid dollars, the one thing I would point out is we probably had in the quarter on the behavioral side, maybe $10 million to $15 million of out-of-period behavioral dollars that is we're catching up, mostly from 2023 as programs sort of refine their calculations, et cetera. So I think that's the major point in terms of the activity. Obviously, we disclosed in our at 10-Ks and 10-Q a great deal of detail about these Medicaid supplemental payments. And we'll update that disclosure in the 10-Q that we'll file in a week or so. Operator, we can get the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Ann Hynes : So obviously, you beat consensus EPS and EBITDA meaningfully. Can you tell us what you beat versus your internal expectations? Is my first question. And my second question is, inpatient grew higher than outpatient in the quarter. Could you let us know how much is from the 2-Midnight Rule? Steve Filton : Thanks, Ann. Yes, I mean, our internal budget for the quarter was not far off from consensus. I think maybe it was a little bit higher than consensus, so maybe 2 or 3 percentage points higher than consensus. But obviously, it was a successful quarter, both in terms of the third-party expectations as well as our own. As far as the 2-Midnight Rule and the impact on inpatient acute volumes, as best as we can tell, it did not have -- and I think the question is, is there a change in payer behavior that's resulting in a measurably increased amount of inpatient activity versus observation and our own data as well as we use a third party to help us adjudicate a lot of these [Indiscernible] call them claims that are on the bubble of being inpatient or observation. We use a third party to help us with that. And I think both our internal resources and our third-party consultants tell us that they're not seeing a significant or measurable change in the behavior of our payers that's really impacting our inpatient activity. So I would say that in our minds, most of the growth in acute care volumes in the quarter is exclusive of any change in payer behavior. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Stephen Baxter : Two kind of quick ones, I guess. So first, the behavioral patient day, volume growth improvement that you're expecting throughout the year, I guess, just give us a little bit of color on leading indicators or potentially capacity opening up, I guess, like what is giving you the confidence to kind of point to that from here. And then secondarily, you obviously had this disclosure of a jury award during the quarter. I know that you discussed some measure of potential protection from insurance related to this. First, could you update us on where you stand from an insurance perspective related to that specific award? And any general comments you might offer about the litigation environment. Steve Filton : So in terms of your first question about behavioral patient days and behavioral patient day growth, I think as you alluded to in your question, it improved slightly from the pace of the last few quarters, our expectation is that it will continue to improve during the year. Incrementally, I think Marc mentioned that our underlying guidance for the year assumes we'll get to like a 3% patient day growth level. What gives us that confidence is simply that, as we've said, many times over the last several years as we believe the underlying demand is there. That's evident in the amount and volume of inbound inquiries we get on the Internet and our 800 numbers, et cetera. And it's really about our ability to staff sufficiently to be able to treat that volume. We've mentioned a few other I think dynamics that have muted that volume a little bit in the last few quarters, including some specific residential treatment facilities that we believe continue to improve including the impact of Medicaid disenrollment, which I think we think is stabilizing, et cetera. So I think it's all those factors together that give us the confidence that behavioral volume will continue to grow incrementally throughout the year. Your second question was around the verdict in a malpractice case in Illinois that we disclosed in an 8-K a few weeks ago. That verdict was as we noted in the 8-K, unprecedented, it was unprecedented, both in terms of our own history and cases with similar fact patterns, it was unprecedented in terms of verdicts in that specific jurisdiction, et cetera. And so we think there still is a great deal of uncertainty around how that specific verdict will be ultimately adjudicated and as a result, other than the disclosure that we had in the 8-K and in the press release, we'll have in our 10-Q, we haven't really had any measurable impact on our financial statements until there is some level of greater certainty around what the ultimate outcome will be. From an insurance perspective, we disclosed in our Qs and Ks, our insurance coverage by year. This is a 2020 incident, we disclosed that we had $250 million of commercial insurance for that year. The bulk of that insurance around $225 million is still available for coverage. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Pito Chickering : Can you talk about the acute OpEx changes that you saw in this quarter? How much did [Indiscernible] increased year-over-year? And is this the right level going forward and any other pressure points [Indiscernible] should be thinking about? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think, Pito, especially on the acute side, the increase in other operating costs are primarily driven by physician expense which we said for the year would increase by about 5% or 6%, and we believe that will still be the case. But because physician expense continue to increase every quarter last year, and we believe will be relatively flat this year, meaning flat quarter-to-quarter, the increase over last year will diminish as we get to the end of the year. And again, I think we're on target to get to that sort of 5% or 6% growth over the prior year. But in Q1, that growth was more like 12% or 13%. And then the other, I think, driver of OpEx increase, particularly in the acute division was increased claims having to do with our insurance subsidiary and that's mostly having to do with increased premiums, the insurance subsidiary, was that sort of a breakeven level for the quarter, which is where we had it budgeted. So nothing unexpected there for our point of view. Pito Chickering : Okay. And then on -- a follow-up to Justin's question on supplemental payments. I guess for $10 million to $15 million from prior two periods. But looking out into '24 or '25, what states do you think could be expanding or adding sort of new payments that could impact your behavioral throughout the year? Steve Filton : Yes. So what I would say is we've often pointed out, and I think there are a couple of analysts on this call who will routinely point out that over the last several years, especially our original forecast of supplemental payments have tended to only increase as the year has gone on as states either implement new programs or refine their existing programs and calculations and I think that's our expectation for this year as well. One of the tricky parts about this is I think we tend not to disclose what states they are or what expectations might be until the state really goes public or gets the approvals they required or goes public with their calculations. So we do believe, I think as we said on the last call, and I'll reiterate today, I think we do expect a number of states to implement either new programs or expand existing programs by the end of the year, but we'll give that detail as it becomes more certain in our public filings. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice of UBS. Albert Rice : Obviously, with the strong revenue number, that gives you leverage down the income statement. But I wondered if you look at labor, both permanent and your premium labor. Can you give us a little sense of what the underlying trends are year-to-year wage increases, how it's working out with your premium labor outlay and then similarly, I'll ask on the first second question. Pricing was strong in the quarter. Obviously, that was helped on the acute side by the supplemental payments, any updated thoughts on where commercial rate increases are coming out and the extent to which you think exchange-related coverage as people maybe pick up exchange coverage versus Medicaid is impacting what you're seeing there? Steve Filton : Yes. So again, a few different issues here. I'll try and address them discretely. Yes, I mean I think clearly, what the income statement reflects as you alluded to, A.J., is more operating leverage and efficiency on the labor line. I think it's a result of a few different things, premium and pay. As I said in my opening comments, is down roughly $20 million from the same quarter last year. I think we're seeing wage rate inflation decelerate from the peak levels that it was running at the height of the pandemic. I think that's helping. I also think we've made a number of productivity adjustments in both business segments over the course of the last 6 months. As we came out of the pandemic, I think we reevaluated our productivity in both segments, particularly in our nonclinical areas, some of which I think maybe grew ahead of the actual need for those resources during the pandemic. As far as pricing goes, we continue to get, I think, reasonable price increases in our contractual rates. I think the bigger issue, quite frankly, on the acute side, especially, is more this issue of as the managed care companies see their margins under pressure, we have tended in the past to see greater levels of denial activity, patient status changes, et cetera. We saw a lot of that in 2023. I think that activity has stabilized some in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year, but it's something that we're watching very carefully. We are seeing, I think, as a result of Medicaid disenrollments, more patients moving to exchange coverage. I think that tends to be a net positive on the acute side because I think exchange coverage reimbursement tends to be slightly better than Medicaid or in some cases measurably better. On the behavioral side, I think it's a bit of a toss-up because a lot of these exchange coverages have pretty significant co-pays and deductibles. And given the fact that behavioral care on an absolute basis tends to have a much smaller bill. I think we find that patients who have exchange coverage often will not be able to cover their or the bill will not cover their co-pays and deductibles. So sometimes, that switch from Medicaid to an exchange coverage is not a favorable development on the on the behavioral side, and May, I think, contribute a little bit to the slower growth in patient pay volumes on the behavioral side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix of RBC Capital Markets. Benjamin Hendrix : Just a quick follow-up on the Illinois litigation. I appreciate that this is unprecedented and different, in fact, and jurisdiction from Acadia settlement, but that was also kind of equally unprecedented. I was just wondering if this is changing at all your approach to the RTC business, your strategy, capital allocation and how you expect to kind of grow in your approach to behavioral health over the long term? Steve Filton : No, I think it would be premature, then. Again, as I commented earlier, I think that there still is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this particular case and verdict that we had. I'm certainly not an expert and wouldn't comment in any great detail on the case that Acadia had other than to comment that it was a different state, it was the case with multiple plaintiffs. There were multiple cases. Our case was in a different jurisdiction, a single [Indiscernible] of a single incident, et cetera. So yes, I think broadly in response to your question, no, I don't think our approach to the business is being changed at the moment as a result of this verdict. We are very focused on the things we need to do to work through this verdict and to challenge it and appeal it if necessary, at several different levels of the judicial system. But at the moment, I don't think it's having an impact on the way we think about the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Kevin Fischbeck : I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about margins. I guess both segments saw some nice margin improvement in the quarter. You've talked about a significant margin opportunity in both segments of time. Just want to get a little more color update about how you think about build to an opportunity for margins, the pace of that margin improvement? And it does feel like -- and I don't know if this was in your original assumption, but it does feel like the supplemental payments are coming in maybe better than one might have thought a year or 2 ago. So I want to get your thoughts about how that might impact your view on where margins ultimately can be? And then I guess if you think about where we are versus where it could be, what are the main levers in each segment to kind of get from here to there. Steve Filton : Yes. So Kevin, we have said for some time that we felt like the margin deterioration that we saw during the pandemic could and would largely be recovered in both business segments as we return to sort of more normal levels of growth, and I think you specifically have pointed out that acute care volumes broadly, not just ours, still haven't necessarily returned to prepandemic levels. So we still think there is a decent amount of runway there for continued acute care volume growth as well as behavioral volume growth, which I addressed in a previous question. I think the benefit there is that we continue to have this strong revenue performance. I do think expenses are being better controlled, both by us in terms of our own in actions and things that we control, productivity, et cetera, but I also think broadly, wage inflation is becoming more manageable. Physician expense, which was a huge drag of the increase in physician expense in '23, I think it's not going to be a drag for the full year of '24. And so I think that's -- all those are opportunities for margin improvement. Obviously, as your question suggests, the increase in Medicaid supplemental payments are a significant opportunity as well. I think as Marc's comments reflected in our prepared remarks, we largely feel that those increased Medicaid reimbursements are making up for an adequate reimbursement over the last several years, but if you put it in the context of margin improvement, they should be very helpful because at least at the current moment, there's not new or incremental expense associated with most of those Medicaid supplemental payments. So it's a big help in recovering those margins that deteriorated over the past few years because they were inadequately reimbursing us for our cost increases. We'll see, I mean, obviously, the first quarter was a significant improvement, as I alluded to in an earlier question, over our expectations. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out. But hopefully, we'll recover more of that margin deterioration than we originally anticipated in our guidance, but we'll see how the rest of the year plays out before making that judgment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla of Citi. Jason Cassorla : I wanted to follow up on the supplemental payments and the acceleration there. Clearly, you guys are benefiting. But I guess your local market competitors [Indiscernible] benefiting as well. So I guess I'm just curious if you're seeing any changes from a competitive standpoint either competitors accelerating build-out of the outpatient or anything along those lines? And then if I could follow up quickly just on the Illinois litigation. I know there's a number of unknowns there on how that could play out. But does that change how you're thinking from a share repo argument or capital deployment in the near term as you wait to see how that all evolves. Any help there would be great. Steve Filton : Yes. So in terms of your first question, Jason, I don't know that in any of our markets, we've detected or recognized a significant change in our competitive behavior as a result of the increase in supplemental payments. I'll make the point that, obviously, the supplemental payments tend to benefit as they're intended to providers who are providing more service to Medicaid patients have higher Medicaid utilization. I think that's why we struggled a little bit more during the pandemic. I think we tend to have a slightly higher Medicaid utilization than some of our public peers. So I think we're benefiting from that now. But in terms of our local market now, I don't know that, again, the Medicaid supplemental payments are specifically affecting competitive behavior. Just like I don't know that it's specifically affecting our strategic sort of moves or actions in a specific market. As far as the Illinois impact on capital deployment or specifically share repurchase, I'll sort of reiterate the same comment that I made before. I think it's too early for us to really make any sort of -- or have any sort of specific reaction until we see a further diminution of the uncertainty surrounding how this verdict and case will ultimately be adjudicated. At some point, it could have an impact but I think at the moment, we're waiting at a minimum until we at least see the outcome from post-trial motions at the trial judge and trial court level. And so at a minimum, I think we'll wait and see what happens there before deciding what our next steps are. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo of Leerink Partners. Benjamin Mayo : Steve, maybe just comment on the Medicaid rule that was released this week on state-based programs. Maybe too early to have much insight, but it seems like some positives and some less positive things. Just curious how your team and legal advisers are looking at this. Steve Filton : Yes. So I mean we were encouraged with the fact that in this rule, Medicaid did not place a cap on these supplemental programs. Instead, they focused -- as they have in the past, I don't think this was a new focus there, but they focused on these hold harmless agreements, which they have historically objected to. I'm certainly not an expert -- a legal expert in this regard. But I do know that we've certainly used legal experts and consultants and are aware of consultants who will adamantly argue that CMS just is wrong on this particular issue and on the legality of these hold harmless arrangements. But regardless of -- so I think there's a chance that CMS' objection to these hold harmless agreements might be successfully challenged legally over the course of the next several years. In any event, I think it was encouraging that CMS said that they were not going to essentially go after or enforce any actions against these hold harmless agreements until 2028, which I think means that if states are convinced that these arrangements are not going to withstand sort of legal scrutiny, they have time to change them. So I would make the point, we did a quick analysis and think that maybe about 1/3 of the supplemental payments we currently receive are under these hold harmless agreements that CMS has objected to. But 2/3 are not. And we think, again, that CMS has left the stage plenty of time to restructure their arrangements if they're convinced of these hold harmless agreements will not hold up under legal scrutiny. So I think generally, we found that all to be pretty encouraging in terms of the flexibility the states will have and the time they'll have to respond to this new rule. Benjamin Mayo : That's helpful. And just one other quick one. Just thinking about the opening of West Henderson later this year. Is that still a good timetable and maybe the P&L consideration, start-up losses, and I'm kind of curious how you think about how the volume may get redistributed in the market once that hospital opens. Steve Filton : So West Henderson is scheduled to open late in the year, maybe in late November, December. So it shouldn't have much of an impact, there will be some level of preopening costs and then a month or 2 of probably operating losses as it opens. I think we didn't really highlight that in our call a couple of months ago, in part because I think we have a view that continued improvement of our hospital in the [renal market] will largely offset that. And as a consequence, neither was likely to have a material impact on this year's results. There's some amount of cannibalization that will take place, meaning we'll take some patients probably from our existing Henderson Hospital. But the real play for West Henderson is significant population growth in that area that we think will allow the hospital to have a very successful opening. Quite frankly, the opening of Henderson at this point, I think, 5 years ago was very successful for the same reasons. And I think we're looking for West Henderson to have a very similar experience when it opens late this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James of Cantor Fitzgerald. Sarah James : Can you clarify the $5 million sequential uptick in premium pay, was that related to the acute volume strength? Then does your $50 million a quarter of premium pay goal assume a version to normal acute volumes? And how do you think about strategy and time line to get to that $50 million? Steve Filton : Yes. So I actually think, Sarah, that the $68 million in premium pay in Q1 is pretty similar to what we've been running the last few quarters. You're right, we have talked kind of about a goal of getting into sort of the mid-50s. But I think what's prevented us from doing that is these really robust acute care volumes. And I'll make the point that the 4.5% adjusted admission increase in Q1 of this year is compared to, I think, in excess of a 10% increase in adjusted admissions last year's first quarter. So you're really talking about, I think, some pretty historically high acute care volume numbers. And yes, I think we acknowledge that it will be difficult to get much below the premium pay levels we're currently running at unless acute care volumes moderate. And quite frankly, we'd be perfectly happy if they don't. I think at these levels of acute care -- at this level of acute care volumes, we're relatively satisfied with having to run this level of premium pay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Joshua Raskin : I was wondering if you could give a broader update on CapEx spending and maybe capacity increases in specific areas of focus and then just a quick follow-up on Las Vegas and West Henderson opening. I'm curious if Las Vegas on the acute care side, volumes or demand there running above company average? And maybe just a little bit more color on sort of shorter-term trends there. Steve Filton : Sure. So I think from a CapEx perspective, Josh, I think we continue to invest on the acute side in those areas where I think acute invasion hospitals really differentiate themselves, meaning emergency room services, emergency room capacity, surgical services, both in and outpatient, and again, for the higher acuity, higher-end services that we don't have as much competition in. But we also continue to invest in outpatient. We have a very successful freestanding emergency department initiative that has been underway for a number of years. I think we'll finish this year with probably 30 freestanding EDs around the country, whereas 5 years ago, I think we didn't have any,  and we can also continue to invest in some freestanding surgical services facilities, freestanding imaging centers, et cetera. On the behavioral side, it's mostly building more inpatient capacity now that we are at least in many markets and many facilities, more fully staffed, but also in that business, investing in freestanding outpatient developments, telemedicine, addiction treatment, et cetera. So I think, again, in both business segments, the CapEx really runs the gamut of the sort of full service continuum at our facilities and our integrated providers tend to provide in their markets. As far as the specific questions about Las Vegas, look, I think one of the comments that we've made over the last several years is that one of the reasons why I think we've been slower to recover those margins that we talked about in the previous question than some of our peers is that some of the geographies around the country that have recovered more quickly from the pandemic, Texas and Florida, most specifically, while we have a presence in those geographies, we tend to have a bigger footprint in places like Nevada, California, the addition of Columbia that have tended to recover more slowly from the pandemic just from a broader economic perspective. But I think in the last couple of quarters, the recovery trajectory in Nevada has definitely accelerated and separate and apart from the Medicaid supplemental program, which obviously is quite helpful in that market or that state. We've seen, I think, fundamental business metrics improve pretty dramatically in the last couple of quarters. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok of Barclays. Andrew Mok : I think you commented that the quarter was above your internal expectations. You're expecting behavioral volumes to improve from here, and there's potential upside to initial forecast for supplemental payments. So just putting all those together, any updated thoughts on where you think you sit within the unchanged guidance for the year. Steve Filton : Sure, Andrew. I mean, clearly, just from a mathematical perspective, the amount that we exceeded our own internal budget and consensus numbers for the first quarter would already put us on the trajectory [indiscernible] towards the high end of our guidance. I think most people know, but I'll just repeat for everybody's sake. We had never revised guidance after the first quarter. It's just something that we don't generally think is a kind of a prudent thing to do. I think if the trends continue, however in Q2, that's certainly a possibility, guidance revision at the end of Q2 if these trends continue. Again, I think the trends that I would specifically highlight were better than we expected in Q1 of our acute care volumes, which I think we thought might moderate a little bit more than they actually did and behavioral pricing, which I think we thought might moderate a little bit more than they did. Obviously, we're pleased that neither did, we're focused on keeping both of those metrics as high as they can be. But to me, that's where we'll watch most closely in Q2. If those metrics remain strong and steady in Q2, I think it's much more likely that we'd have a guidance revision at that point in time. Andrew Mok : Great. And then just a follow-up. I think you commented on intra-quarter in April volumes in the acute segment. Just hoping you could do the same thing in the behavioral segment and maybe comment on trends exiting the quarter to help support the higher growth outlook? Steve Filton : Yes. I think I forget if the comments that I made were specifically about the acute segment. But I think the trends more similar in both. I think I commented in some conferences earlier this quarter that the behavioral business got off to a bit of a slow start with some bad weather -- in bad winter weather in states that don't necessarily usually expect bad winter weather in the south central part of the country. But  [April volumes] recovered in late January and certainly in February, but I think have the same calendar issues as the acute segment did in March, softer volumes, et cetera, particularly in that child and adolescent population, which tends to really soften when school is out. But yes, I mean I think I'd make the same comment. I think we would expect to recover that softness if not in April, but then over the course of the second quarter. And I think Marc alluded to in his prepared comments that our general expectation at the beginning of the year was that behavioral volumes would incrementally improve as the year went on, and that's still our expectation. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Steve Filton for closing remarks. Steve Filton : We'd just like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead. Steve Filton : Good morning. Marc Miller is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. During the conference call, we'll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $4.26 for the second quarter of 2024. After adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule, as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $4.31 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Our acute hospitals experienced a moderation of the demand for their services in the second quarter with adjusted admissions increasing 3.4% year-over-year and surgical growth flattening out. Overall, revenue growth was still a solid 6.6%. Meanwhile, expenses were well controlled. Specifically, the amount of premium pay in the second quarter was $61 million, reflecting a 15% to 20% decline from the prior year quarter. On a same facility basis, EBITDA at our acute care hospitals increased 37% during the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. And the increase was 20% if you exclude the impact of the incremental Medicaid supplemental payments in Nevada. During the second quarter, same facility revenues in our behavioral health hospitals increased by 11%, primarily driven by a 9.3% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. Even after adjusting for Medicaid supplemental payments not included in our original 2024 guidance, same facility revenues increased by 7.2% and same facility EBITDA for our behavioral health hospitals increased 13% in the second quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period. Our cash generated from operating activities increased by $422 million to $1.1 billion during the first six months of 2024 and as compared to $654 million during the same period in 2023. In the first half of 2024, we spent $450 million on capital expenditures and acquired 1.1 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $195 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 30% of the company's outstanding shares. As of June 30, 2024, we had $1 billion of aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. In our acute care segment, we continue to develop additional inpatient and ambulatory care capacity. We currently have 27 operational freestanding emergency departments as well as 12 more, which have been approved and are in various stages of development. Also, construction continues on our de novo acute care hospitals consisting of the 150-bed West Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is expected to open late this year. The 136 bed Cedar Hill Regional Medical Center in Washington, D.C. which is expected to open in the spring of 2025, and the 150-bed Alan B. Miller Medical Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which is expected to open in the spring of 2026. In our behavioral health segment, we recently opened the 128-bed River Vista Behavioral Hospital in Madera, California, and we are developing the 96 beds Southridge Behavioral Hospital in West Michigan a joint venture with Trinity Health Michigan, which is expected to open later this year. I'll now turn the call over to Marc Miller, President and CEO, for closing comments. Marc Miller : Thanks, Steve. We're pleased with our second quarter results as both our business segments continued to make operational improvements. As we anticipated, acute care volumes have moderated somewhat and are gradually be going to resemble the patterns we experienced prior to pandemic. The increase in operating income in comparison to last year's second quarter for acute care hospitals is a further step towards a more extended margin recovery, we hope to sustain for the next several periods. In our acute segment, physician expense, which is a significant headwind in 2023, has stabilized at approximately 7.5% of revenues. Based on the generally favorable operating trends in the first half of the year, we are increasing the midpoint of our 2024 EPS guidance by 17% to $15.80 per diluted share from $13.50 per diluted share previously. New supplemental programs being developed in Tennessee and Washington D.C. which are not yet fully approved are not included in our revised guidance. Lastly, as announced in yesterday's earnings release, our Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, thereby increasing the current aggregate purchase -- repurchase authorization to $1.228 billion. We're happy to answer questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question which comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Ann Hynes : Great. Thanks. I just want to focus my question on the supplemental payments. I'm just trying to figure out what inning you are in both the acute care and behavioral for maybe new programs. Like so you mentioned D.C. that sounds like it might be a new program in acute care. And on the behavioral side going forward that would be great. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, Ann, so I think we had mentioned before that I think from our perspective while we may understand that individual states are contemplating either new programs or expansion of existing programs, we tend to really not discuss them until there is some formal submission of a program to CMS and sort of pending approvals with -- from CMS within the state and both the Tennessee and Washington D.C. programs sort of fall into that category. As you suggest, Tennessee is a state in which we have exclusively behavioral business. Washington D.C. is a geography where we have both acute and behavioral business although the Medicaid supplemental program would be primarily beneficial to the acute business. Both programs we have been told that the expectation from state of the district is that the programs are likely to be approved either later this year or early next year. Both programs would be retroactive. We believe Tennessee would be retroactive most likely to July of 2024 and that D.C. would be retroactive to October of 2024 this year. And again, none of these things are guaranteed and they all depend on CMS approval. Those are the two I'll call them incremental or additional programs we would disclose. But we certainly are aware of other states and where expansion of programs or new programs are at least being considered. Ann Hynes : Great. And just one follow-up. I know that you provided the potential benefit for Tennessee, but have you -- can you provide what you think D.C. would be? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So, we've disclosed in our 10-Q that we think the potential benefit of our prior 10-Q the potential benefit in Tennessee would be between $42 million and $56 million annually. The potential benefit in Washington D.C. is probably in the $80 million to $90 million range annually. Ann Hynes : Great. Thank you. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, Stephen. Stephen Baxter : Hi. Thanks. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on behavioral volume performance in the quarter. I think you had expectations maybe the last earnings call just going to improve a little bit in the second quarter. So just wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers of performance in the quarter. And then also, how you're thinking about behavioral demand growth in the back end of the year. Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes. I think that the dynamics surrounding behavioral volumes have remained pretty much the same. You are correct in your description. We -- behavioral patient days on a same-store adjusted basis were up I think about 2% in Q1. We expect it be to equal and maybe better than slightly in Q2. We did not. I think the issues are very familiar to what we've been talking about for some time, while we've made I think a lot of progress on filling our labor vacancies around the country. We still find in very specific markets and geographies that certain labor positions sometimes nurses, sometimes therapists and counselors, sometimes nonprofessionals and mental health technicians are difficult to place and can sometimes limit capacity or our ability to admit patients. I think we've discussed in the last few quarters the fact that Medicaid disenrollments, particularly in the Southern states, Texas and Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas have had more of an impact on our business as people have gotten disenrolled from Medicaid and it's taken them some time to get either reenrolled in Medicaid or into a commercial exchange program, if they get into a commercial exchange program they often have the high co-pays and deductibles which make them meeting their financial requirements difficult behavioral hospitals. And finally, we have a handful of behavioral facilities that struggled with very specific issues in 2023, I believe they've all improved but are doing so at a somewhat slower pace than we originally imagined they would. I think ultimately we still believe that that 3% patient day growth target that we embedded in our original 2024 guidance is an achievable target, probably not in terms of full year growth. But I think we believe that by the end of 2024, we should be growing at that rate and we view that as a sustainable rate of growth going forward. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Ben Hendrix of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ben Hendrix : Thank you very much. Just wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on the moderation in acute demand and your surgeries flattening out with trending towards pre-COVID levels. Any trends you can call specifically in specific categories and any payer mix implications there, and how you're seeing that develop? Thank you. Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, so one comment that I'd make about the 3.4% adjusted admission growth in acute care is that that comparable number in the second quarter of last year was 7.7% and surgical growth in the second quarter of last year was in the 5% to 6% range. So those were both very difficult comparisons. I think we had a view that 3.4% adjusted admission growth a relatively flat. Surgical growth was relatively close to our expectations given the very difficult comparison. We've been talking I think for some time about the expectation that acute care volumes both overall admissions and surgical growth would return to pre-pandemic patterns. I don't know that that's absolutely where we are right today. But certainly I think we've been preparing for that. And I think a lot of the cost management that you saw during the quarter was an expectation and preparing for that, so that as we return to some of those pre-pandemic levels of revenue and volume growth, we could generate the increased EBITDA and margin expansion and remain on that trajectory for at least several more periods. Ben Hendrix : Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is open. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just first question and then I have a follow-up. First question on the updated guidance, I know you didn't raise the full year guidance after the first quarter and there was some outperformance, and then you've had some outperformance in the second quarter. And then there's also the supplemental payments maybe that weren't in the original guidance. Can you just parse out how much is just capturing year-to-date trends? How much is an adjustment for supplemental payment information? And then have you made any adjustment to your second half expectations in this updated guidance? Steve Filton : Yeah. So A.J. from a high-level perspective the approach that we took to the revised guidance was, obviously, to increase the guidance by the amount of the first half beat, which was substantial to include in the revised guidance for the back half of the year. Any supplemental programs and payments that we knew would continue and be present in the second half. We did not as Marc indicated in his comments include anything for Tennessee or Washington D.C. And then we included some of the cost management improvements that we've made, which we believe are certainly sustainable. But for the most part particularly from I think a revenue and a volume perspective just generally retained our original guidance for the second half of the year. A.J. Rice: Okay. There's been a lot of discussion this quarter about impact of two-midnight rule Medicaid redeterminations and so forth. Can you just maybe make some comments about what you're seeing there and how -- I know two-midnight rule wouldn't affect the behavioral business, but the redeterminations maybe it had some impact on both sides. Any updated thoughts on what you're seeing in those two areas? Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean as far as two-midnight goes and we've commented on this before and I acknowledge that our comments may be a little bit different than what some of our peers have said. But we've been unable to validate, or I think precisely identify any real benefit that we're getting from the two-midnight rule change. We don't see any dramatic change in metrics like amount of denials or patient status changes, et cetera. Nor anecdotally do we hear from our personnel who deal with this issue on a daily basis that they've seen real behavior changes on the part of payers. Again I know some of our peers have suggested otherwise, but we're just unable to really parse out any significant impact from the change of the two-midnight rule. Medicaid redeterminations, I think on the acute side have resulted in an increase in commercial exchange patients. Again I think compared to some of our peers probably not as big an increase. We've gone -- we had commercial exchange patients as a percentage of our overall adjusted admissions. Pre the end of the PAT was about 4%. I think that number has climbed to about 5% currently. I know some of our peers have suggested that number has climbed to 6% or 7%. We haven't gotten that high. On the behavioral side, I alluded to this in an earlier response. I do think we're being affected by the Medicaid redeterminations, particularly in the adolescent population. We definitely have seen some weakness in that population in the last, I'm going to say, two three quarters. And it's -- I think, it's been a slow process for those adolescents to either reenroll in Medicaid or to get on to a commercial exchange program. And if they get on to a commercial exchange program, to exhaust a bit or sometimes large copays and deductibles that those plans have. So, I think Medicaid redeterminations to probably had a bigger negative impact on the behavioral business, the shift to commercial exchanges on the acute side, has probably been a slight net positive. A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Steve, first on the guidance, in terms of just kind of isolating that DPP bucket, I think you started the year at about $810 million in the 10-K that you expected to get this year. You updated it to $860 million, with the ones with the 10-Q. Just curious, what that number is right now that you expect to get this year. So let's just do that in my first question. Then, I've got one for Marc. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So we're still working on that disclosure, which we'll have in our 10-K in eight or 10 days. But I think there'll be a significant step up from the $860 million obviously, including the Washington I know numbers that we included in the press release, et cetera. But there'll be a more precise picture that we file our Q in a week or so. Q \u2013 Justin Lake : Okay. Do you have a round number, you could share with us? Like does it go to -- do you think it goes much higher than $900 million? Or if I add those two numbers in there? Steve Filton : Yes, I think it will go into the low to mid-900s. Q \u2013 Justin Lake : Okay. So, if we look at your guidance raise of $215 million, you started the year at around 810. If it goes to low to mid-900s, is it maybe fair to say that, maybe half give or take of that guidance raise is coming from these supplemental payments? That a reasonable way to think about the rest [indiscernible]? Steve Filton : I think that's fair. Q \u2013 Justin Lake : Okay. And then Marc, you talked about the improvement in the hospital business in terms of the margins. Curious, if the -- there's still a potential way to go to get back to pre-COVID levels. What do you think a reasonable target is when you sit down with your hospital operators? And do you have a trajectory or a plan, at which you kind of time line is probably the best way to put it in terms of when you expect to get there? Maybe you could share a couple of the steps, you expect to take to get that. Thanks. Marc Miller : Yes. I mean, we have a lot of plans and there's a lot of discussions on how we're going to continue to incrementally improve. I'm not going to give you a number or a time period right now. But every market is a little bit different, obviously. We've been very pleased, with the work that the operators have done especially, in the last 12 months. In addressing not only the volume issues, but really getting a better handle on expenses. And I think if we just continue with that trajectory, we'll get to where we need to be fairly soon, but we still have a little ways to go. Q \u2013 Justin Lake : Great. Thanks. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Jason Cassorla of Citi. Your line is open, Jason. Q \u2013 Jason Cassorla : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to ask on the acute pricing and mix in the quarter up 3.5% or so, but kind of normalizing for the supplemental payment dollars this year maybe only up kind of slightly year-over-year. Is that just simply a function of that lower acuity volume continue to return? I know you made comments around surgical volume dynamic in the quarter? Or just maybe anything you can give on acuity and payer mix trends within a Q kind of outside of the supplemental payment programs would be helpful. Q \u2013 Justin Lake : Yes. I think it's a variety of things, Jason. Again, I think we had a pretty difficult comparison. We were comparing to something close to 10%, revenue growth last quarter high surgical and less years quarter, rather high surgical growth, et cetera. I think we're seeing some settling down, some exhaustion of some of those postponed and deferred procedures that have been postponing deferred, during the pandemic. I think that even exclusive of the supplemental payments our expectation in the acute business is, we'll get to as we have historically a same-store revenue growth sort of trajectory of 5% 6% split pretty evenly between price and volume. And again, I think with our with the progress that we've made as both Marc and I have alluded to on the cost management side, that should allow us continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion until we get either completely back to or something close to pre-pandemic margin levels in that segment. Q \u2013 Jason Cassorla : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up. With the $1 billion increase to the share repo program, I know you accelerated a little bit in terms of share repo activity in the quarter maybe with the Illinois lawsuit kind of dynamics going on. But with the increase there in the repo program, is the expectation that you're still aiming to spend around $500 million $600 million on share repo for this year? Or how should we think about the share repurchase dynamics? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So, I think your suggestion is largely on point. Our original guidance suggested that we would spend the bulk of our free cash flow, which would be $500 million or $600 million on share repurchase. And I think that is still our intent. And I think frankly the main point of including that announcement in this quarter's release was to just reinforce that idea. We believe we're still on track and obviously we needed the reauthorization to be able to accomplish that. Q \u2013 Jason Cassorla : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will be coming from Sarah James of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Sarah James : Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the embedded adjusted admissions growth baked into your guidance for the second half. Are you assuming that first half levels stay flat or decelerate? And could you talk a little bit about what the drivers are for that assumption? Steve Filton : Yes. So, our volume assumptions I think in the back half of the year are not terribly different than our original guidance. On the acute side, I think it's adjusted admission growth in the 3% to 4% range just sort of continuing kind of how we're exiting the in the second quarter. I think on the behavioral side, practically, it will be a tall order to get to 3% patient day growth for the full year. But I do think that we still believe that we'll get to that 3% by the end of the year and that that will be a sustainable level or a level of growth that we can sustain for the foreseeable future after that. Sarah James : Got it. And on the behavioral side, do you think about getting to that 3% as mostly capacity driven? And do you have any updates on how you're hiring practices are going? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean I think it's a combination of things. I ticked off I think the things that have been progressing a little more slowly than we expected. I think we believe that will accelerate. We believe we'll continue to have more success in hiring particularly in pockets that have been somewhat troublesome. I think that the impact of the Medicaid disenrollment, which I do think is weighed down our volume in the last three or four quarters will get better as more of these people get either reenrolled in Medicaid or in commercial exchange products and the copays and deductibles. And I believe the progress on the handful of residential facilities that have been a drag which have been progressing but at a somewhat slower rate than we expect will continue and all that will help and allow us to get back to the 3%, which I think again was our original plan it's just happening a little bit more slowly than we had originally anticipated. Sarah James : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will be coming from Andrew Mok of Barclays. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the Medicaid supplemental payment programs. First can you give us a sense where these programs stand relative to average commercial rates? And second how does the higher Medicaid reimbursement change the relative attractiveness of patients in that payer class? Is this a category that you would lean into from a referral and service line perspective? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. So, -- and I think at least one of my acute care company peers made this point that even though there have been these substantial increases in Medicaid supplemental payments around the country that for the most part. And I think this is particularly true on the acute side our Medicaid reimbursement remains well below commercial rates mostly well below Medicare rates. And quite frankly in most cases still below our cost. So, we've made the point before and I'll reinforce it again because it's an important one that these Medicaid increases are really intended to I think make up for the inadequate reimbursement of the last several years, particularly the cost pressures that accelerated during the pandemic just broadly inflation pressures, but also the particular wage pressures that were exacerbated during the pandemic. I think on the behavioral side, at least in some of the states the Medicaid supplemental payments do in some cases approach Medicare reimbursement in some cases sort of probably between Medicare and commercial. I think in those states and in those facilities it does sort of change our approach and it I think encourages us to focus on those referral sources and those community resources that tend to produce Medicaid patients. And I think we it does inform our approach in those markets. And we are I think the phrase you used was leaning into that. I think on the acute side the vast majority of our Medicaid business comes to our emergency room. So, there's not a whole lot of proactive actions that we take to seek that business out we get the business we get and we're just being reimbursed for that a more adequate rate. But yes, on the behavioral side, I do think that we're in those space where these programs increase the Medicaid reimbursement to a level that makes it more attractive. We are using upraise leaning into that business and trying to work with referral sources to get more of it. Andrew Mok : Great. Thank you. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, Pito. Pito Chickering : Hey. Good morning guys. So, on the acute labor side, can you talk about where turnover is today where hiring is and how to think about those in the back half of the year as well as contract labor? And also as length of stay comes down due to better staffing, how does length of stay reductions help your EBITDA growth? Steve Filton : Yeah. So as far as acute care turnover Tito, I think that we're down into the low-and-mid-20s which is kind of where we were in sort of the pre-pandemic period. Obviously we still view that turnover rate as high. But to be fair that's -- the hospital and acute care industry has had turnover rates in the high-20s and low-30s and nationally for a long time. And while we view those as still very inefficient and not necessarily ideal and we continue to work to lower them. Part of that is it's just the nature of the business. But obviously, as I indicated in my prepared comments our ability to reduce premium pay which has been reduced almost probably by two-thirds from its height at the -- the very height of the pandemic indicates more success in hiring and filling these permanent positions. I think you also see it in our -- in just our deceleration or a reduction, in the rate of acceleration, in wage inflation, in the acute business, the reduction in incentive payments, recruitment incentive payments et cetera, all indicate I think a settling out of the labor supply demand dynamic and just greater success on our part in filling our open vacancies. As far as the length of stay dynamic, because the vast majority of our payments are made on a per discharge basis the lower our rate to stay, the more efficient we are in being able to treat patients and fully treat them and discharge them to the appropriate setting whether that's home or to some sort of subacute facility to the degree that we reduce length of stay. We're really reducing our cost per discharge or cost per admission. And then, again, I think that we've lowered our length of stay dramatically from the height of the pandemic, but even continue to do so incrementally. And again I think that's partly reflected in our very successful cost management and cost reduction initiatives that you can see on our income statement. Pito Chickering : Okay. There's been some negative press recently including the Senate Finance Committee on results of care. Are you seeing that impact to your referrals at all? Steve Filton : Yeah. Honestly, Pito, we really have seen virtually no impact from the Senate hearing and report. I think the greatest impact we would expect perhaps to have seen would be from referral sources. But I think what we kind of believe is the lesson from this is that referral sources understand the business very well. They understand this is a very difficult patient population. They understand that our hospitals, I think do overall a very admirable job. And I think the outcomes and the patient satisfaction results suggest that patients are generally satisfied and highly satisfied with their care in these facilities. And I think referral sources recognized that. So no we've really seen no impact on our volumes no impact from referral sources not necessarily any additional incremental regulatory oversight. So we're pleased with that. Pito Chickering : Perfect. Great. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Michael Ha of Baird. Your line is open. Michael Ha : Thank you. So on behavioral volumes still yet to slowly rebound pricing remains powerful. I was wondering if you could help us break out roughly how much of the volume headwind is Medicaid redeterminations versus labor-related constraints? Is it 50-50 maybe more of redetermination related? And would it be fair to say that redetermination impact tails off into the back half of this year that it creates a positive backdrop? And against easier second half volume comps that should help the bounce back naturally in behavioral volumes. And then, if you could discuss the source of behavioral pricing strength I think you said 7.2% as the supplemental payments. So if you could just test some of the dynamics there is it what's happening in par pricing that would be helpful. Thank you. Steve Filton : Yeah. I mean, again, I would just make the point that the shortfall from where our behavioral volumes are the 1.4% patient day growth in the quarter versus where we thought we would be which would be continuation of Q1 at around 2% or maybe a little bit higher than that. It's not an enormous shortfall. And its 60, 70, 80 basis points and therefore it's like to parse with great precision between the issues that I elaborated on the staffing, the Medicaid redeterminations the handful of residential facilities. So that's difficult to do. I think broadly as your question suggests we do believe redeterminations get -- or the impact from redeterminations get better in the back half of the year as we do believe these other issues the staffing and the residential facilities will get better in the back half of the year and allow us to reach that 3% target. Operator : And one moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin Fischbeck : Okay. Just a follow- on that comment there about the site volume improvement. I guess two questions. First one is, is there any sign, I guess, maybe outside of the Medicaid population that demand in any way shape or form is being impacted? Or is this really just about kind of capacity and then redeterminations? And then second, when you think about that labor dynamic to get back to 3% by the end of the year and to consistently be growing 3%. I mean, you're going to have to be adding staff at that pace. Are you currently adding staff at that pace generally that would support that? It sounds like you're not quite there yet. So just trying to understand what you're doing between now and year-end that should be getting you to kind of sustainably add that type of capacity? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, Kevin. So I think -- and part of the reason that I think we have been confident that behavioral volumes should and could increase to sort of more historically normative levels is that we believe the underlying demand is strong and we measure that in a couple of different ways. We measure it sort of from a macro basis, there's a lot of sources of incidence of behavioral illness and the need for treatment in a whole variety of diagnoses, including opioid illness and many others. And again, we believe that virtually across the board demand for behavioral treatment continues to increase. And so this really becomes an issue of can we -- what do we have to do to satisfy that demand and that sort of plays into the labor dynamic? Yes, we are. We continue to have net hires. I would say, our -- we have had positive net hires for between the last 18 and 24 months. Again, it's been incremental and a little slower than we thought, but we continue to add that. I think one of the major areas of focus more recently is we had a question earlier, I think, for Pito about acute care turnover. Behavioral turnover tends to be probably twice what acute care is. And that creates a lot of inefficiency. So even though we're hiring a lot of people they're leaving. And again, I think, this is not just a UHS issue. I think it's an industry-wide issue. But we are very focused on the things that we can do and want to do to reduce that turnover rate, which includes mentorship programs and educational opportunities and career development opportunities so that when we hire people they really have an incentive to want to stay with the organization to stay with the facility. And I do believe that we can reduce our turnover rate, which I think is a practical objective. That will be one way in which we'll be able to satisfy some of that outstanding behavioral demand that we've really been unable to satisfy as much as we'd like to in recent periods. Kevin Fischbeck : All right. Great. Is there an actual physical capacity dynamic too that you need to be adding beds? Or is there enough bed capacity it's really just the labor that's the constraint? Steve Filton : Yes. So I think it's sort of a catch 22. I think we dramatically reduced the pace at which we were adding beds during the pandemic, because we had a view that well what's the point of adding new beds if we can't staff the beds that we already have. I think as we make more and more progress, and again, this is an individual facility individual market kind of calculation in each phase, but as we increase our ability to fill those vacancies et cetera and sort of see a path and a ramp to being able to fill those vacancies, I think, we're going to be more willing to resume the pace of bed additions that we were running at before the pandemic. Kevin Fischbeck : Thanks. Operator : And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Whit Mayo of Leerink Partners. Whit, your line is open. Whit Mayo : Hey, Steve I have one more labor dynamic question. What's interesting is this is fourth consecutive quarter where your SWB per patient day has moderated. And I'm just really trying to square this against the comments on the challenges in filling positions. You said you're hiring maybe a little bit slower than you thought, but it's not pressuring the salary line at all. And I guess, I would have thought intuitively the opposite would happen, but maybe there's something optical with the mix of RTC versus acute or something. How do I make sense of this? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean, I think what you saw during the pandemic was people leaving subacute industries and that obviously included behavioral, but it included, I think, lots of other sub-acute industries like nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities and home health. And they were leaving those industries to work in acute care settings where they were able to make a significant premium to their existing salaries. And I think there's always been for sure a gap and that acute care compensation rates were always higher than sub-acute care compensation rate, but that gap widened dramatically during the pandemic. I do think it has since narrowed. And so really -- and that's I'm trying to answer your question in the sense of. So it really got to be an issue. It didn't matter when a nurse told us -- a behavioral nurse told us that she was leaving to make three times for salary in an acute care setting. Raising her salary by $2 an hour et cetera was not going to have any impact which is why I don't think you saw dramatic pressure on our behavioral rates during the pandemic and which is why as you're suggesting I think you're seeing moderation actually in our salaries and wages per patient day. Because the way we're solving this problem is not necessarily through higher premium payments and incentive payments. Although, we certainly did that during the pandemic and we do it in markets where we still think it's necessary. But I think our real focus is on how do we make people feel that working in a behavioral setting is rewarding is creating career opportunities for them is a place that they're going to be valued et cetera. And I think that's our focus. Look certainly and particularly with the availability of some of these Medicaid supplemental payments et cetera in some markets, if we believe that paying higher compensation and -- could be an answer we'll pursue that. But again I'm going to suggest that I think in most cases this is not a problem of throwing money at it just automatically solves it. But we'll invest more money where we think it makes sense. Whit Mayo : Okay. And my follow-up I haven't heard you talk about the health plan business in some time. Wondering how that's performing versus expectations? And how you guys think of that as a core business for UHS? Or do you think differently at all about it? Thanks. Steve Filton : I mean we've talked about the health plans and time to time. I think like any provider-sponsored health plan and this is really an acute care dynamic. We only operate the health plan in markets in which we have acute care hospitals. And it is a way for us to create narrow networks in which our hospitals participate. It's a way for us to create further alignment with Medicare physicians particularly in plants that are focused on Medicare Advantage patients. And we think ultimately even though the plan operates largely at a breakeven level currently that it's still less expensive and greater, sort of, return investment than some other options like physician employment or other similar options although we certainly do those things as well. And so, yes, the health plan continues to do that. It continues to provide us again I think a narrower network and a funnel of patients in certain markets and we'll continue to operate it with that aim. Whit Mayo : Thanks. Operator : Our last question will be coming from Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Joshua, your line is open. Joshua Raskin : Hi. Thanks, Just one more Steve. I guess, I heard the 5% of patients are coming with exchange-based insurance. But what percentage of revenue is coming from those individual exchange patients? I'll be curious across both segments. And if you could comment on the margins of those patients relative to your other segments? And then why do you think that 5% is lower than peers? Is that network strategy and contracting? Or do you think that's geographic based? Steve Filton : As far as the second question I don't really know the answer to that Josh. As far as the first one goes because I think commercial exchange reimbursement tends to be somewhere between Medicare and commercial probably a little closer to Medicare I would say I don't have this data right in front of me, but my guesstimate would be the 5% of admissions would be something pretty close to what percentage of revenue would be because I would think that sort of midpoint between commercial and Medicare is probably about the midpoint of our reimbursement. Joshua Raskin : Okay. And margins you think similar to somewhere between Medicare and commercial then? Steve Filton : Yes. Yes. I'm sorry, but yes. Joshua Raskin : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We did get an additional question from Ryan Langston and that's Ryan Langston of TD Cowen. Your line is open, Ryan. Ryan Langston : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just real quick on the new facilities that are coming online both I guess in the acute and behavioral can you just remind us generally how long it takes those facilities to get to breakeven? And do the geographies or any other dynamics in those markets have any changes to that maybe faster or slower? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes. I would say generally the ramp of the facility to breakeven is probably in the 6-month to 12-month range and then to what I would consider to be divisional averages probably the 18-month to 24-month range. In markets like Las Vegas that time frame tends to be compressed. Again I think there's little impact this year in 2024 because the facility that we're opening in Las Vegas will be very late in the year. So I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on earnings this year. And we'll get more precise feedback on the impact of both West Henderson and the Washington D.C. facility when we give our 2025 guidance early next year. Ryan Langston : Thanks. Operator : Okay. And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Steve Filton for closing remarks. Steve Filton : We would just like to thank everybody for their time this morning and look forward to speaking with everybody again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Steve Filton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead sir. Steve Filton : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to this review of Universal Health Services Results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. During the conference call, I\u2019ll be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. I'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $3.80 for the third quarter of 2024 after adjusting for the impact of the items reflected on the supplemental schedule as included with the press release, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $3.71 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. As we anticipated, acute care volumes have moderated somewhat and have gradually begun to resemble the patterns we experienced before the pandemic. Adjusted admissions to our acute hospitals increased 1.5% year-over-year, with surgical growth slowing. Overall revenue growth was still a solid 8.6% excluding the impact of our insurance subsidiary. Meanwhile, expenses were well controlled. Specifically, the amount of premium pay in the third quarter was $60 million, reflecting a 12% decline from the prior year quarter. Included in our operating results during the third quarter of 2024, were aggregate net incremental reimbursements of approximately $20 million recorded in connection with various state supplemental Medicaid programs, approximately half of which was earned by our acute care hospitals. These net reimbursements were in excess of the supplemental program projections included in our earnings guidance for the full year of 2024 as revised on July 24, 2024. On a same facility basis, EBITDA at our acute care hospitals increased 36% during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter and the increase was 17% when excluding the impact of the incremental Medicaid supplemental payments earned in Nevada during the third quarter of 2024. The increase in operating income comparison to last year's third quarter for our acute hospitals is a further step towards a more extended margin recovery we hope to sustain for the next several periods. In our acute segment, physician expense, which was a significant headwind in 2023, has stabilized at approximately 7.2% of revenues thus far in 2024. During the third quarter, same facility revenues at our behavioral health hospitals increased by 10.5% primarily driven by an 8.5% increase in revenue per adjusted patient day. Even after adjusting for Medicaid supplemental payments not included in our original 2024 guidance, facility revenues increased 8.3% and same facility EBITDA increased 9.6% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the comparable prior year period. As a result of unfavorable trends experienced during the last several years during the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a $30 million increase to our reserves for self-insured, professional and general liability claims. Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.4 billion during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $815 million during the same period in 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, we spent $698 million on capital expenditures and acquired 1.7 million of our own shares at a total cost of approximately $350 million. Since 2019, we have repurchased approximately 31% of the company's outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.01 billion aggregate available borrowing capacity pursuant to our 1.3 billion revolving credit facility. In our acute care segment, we continue to develop additional inpatient and ambulatory care capacity. Construction continues on our de novo acute care hospitals consisting of the 150 bed West Henderson Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is expected to open shortly, the 136 bed Cedar Hill Regional Medical center in Washington, D.C. which is expected to open in the spring of 2025 and the 150 bed Allen B. Miller Medical center in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which is expected to open in the Spring of 2026. In our behavioral health segment, we recently opened the 128 bed Riva Vista Behavioral Health Hospital in Madera, California and we are developing the 96 bed Southridge Behavioral Health Hospital in West Michigan, a joint venture with Trinity Health Michigan, which is expected to open in the spring of 2025. The approval processes continue in connection with new Medicaid supplemental payment programs in Tennessee and Washington, D.C. as well as a proposed funding increase to the existing program in Nevada. Although we cannot provide assurance that any or all of these programs or program changes will ultimately be approved by CMS or the timing of such approvals, which may not occur until 2025. If approved in their current forms, the Tennessee program, with estimated annual net benefit of $40 million to $56 million, would be effective July 1, 2024. The Washington, D.C. program would estimate an annual net benefit of approximately $85 million would be effective October 1, 2024, and the funding increase to the existing Nevada program, with estimated annual net incremental benefit of approximately $56 million, would be effective July 1, 2024. Our previously provided earning guidance for the full year of 2024, as revised on July 24, 2024, did not include the estimated incremental net benefit related to any of these programs. I'd be pleased to answer your questions at this time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. And our first question is going to come from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Marco Criscuolo : Hey, good morning. This is actually Marco on for Josh. Appreciate you taking the question. I was just wondering if you could speak to any changes you may be seeing in the behavior of managed care plans during the quarter, including activity around patient denials or downgrades across both the acute and behavioral segments. And then it would also be helpful if you just give some color on what trends you're seeing between commercial and MA plans and whether this activity is focused around any specific areas like two-midnight. Thank you. Steve Filton : Sure. So I think if you go back and review some of our transcripts and other commentary from late in 2022 and early into 2023, we first began to note, I think more aggressive behavior on the part of our managed care payers, especially coming off of the initial years of the pandemic, 2020, 2021, 2022, where clearly we felt like payers had become less aggressive, I think in response to a large degree to the significant decreases in utilization during the early stages of the pandemic. So since then, since I would say late 2022, early 2023, again we've seen I think payer behavior become more aggressive as it relates to denials, as it relates to patient status changes, length of stay, management when patients are in the facility, etcetera. I don't believe that we saw a dramatic change in the current quarter. I think again the more aggressive behavior that we've been citing I think has been ongoing for more like a year or four or six quarters, but wouldn't necessarily suggest that we saw dramatic change in the current quarter. As far as whether and behavior is focused on any particular area. You specifically asked about the two-midnight rule. Again, I think we've made a comment that we've been focused on the two-midnight rule and the appropriate coding consistent with the two-midnight rule and appeals consistent with the two-midnight rule. For several years we've been using a third party firm to help us properly code admissions. We've been using that same firm to help us with denial appeals, etcetera. And so I don't think we've seen again some of the perhaps significant difference in how two-midnight coding claims are being handled with our claims as maybe some of our peers have really changed their behavior as a result of the recent clarifications that CMS issued in terms of two-midnight rules. Marco Criscuolo : Thanks, appreciate all the color on that. And then just to squeeze in one more quick one, I was wondering if you could just give a quick update on physician recruitment and turnover trends in the acute behavioral segments, especially as it relates to opening up additional capacity and then whether you're seeing any more incremental competition in that area. Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes, so I think there's been much discussion about physicians and especially as it related to hospital based physicians. Last year when there was a significant increase for almost all providers in the expense of hospital based physicians, in our case especially emergency room physicians and anesthesiologists, I think that increased expense was more a result of billing changes and I think specifically the no surprise billing act and the constraints that that put on those specialties, emergency room anesthesiology, in terms of their ability to bill for out of network patients. So I think the pressures on those expenses were driven more by those billing changes than they were by a lack of or scarcity of those sort of physicians. I don't think that there's a dearth of physicians, nor do I think there's a glut necessarily in every market. Different specialties, are more challenging, etcetera. But I don't think we would describe physician recruitment as particularly, difficult in the current period. I don't think it's changed much over the last several years. Marco Criscuolo : Great. Thank you for all the color. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ann Hynes : Great, thank you. Heading into 2025, are there any maybe major headwinds and tailwinds you want to call out? And to that I know it sounds like you're getting incremental providers stuff in 2024. Is there anything we should be on the lookout for 2025? Thanks. Steve Filton : So I think for us, Ann, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we will have two new facilities open in 2025, our West Henderson facility in Las Vegas which will open late this year, and then a hospital in the District of Columbia which will open in the spring. I don't believe, and we'll be more precise about this when we give our detailed 2025 guidance in February, but I don't believe that either of those facilities will create a significant drag on EBITDA. There will be some opening expenses and some ramp up, but I think both are well positioned. So again, they should not create much of a drag. I think otherwise for the two businesses, we are expecting the continued margin recovery that again I alluded to in my opening comments. And then finally, the major tailwinds are the ones that I mentioned again in my remarks, the specific ones in terms of Tennessee, District of Columbia, Nevada. These are either new or additional supplemental programs that have been submitted to CMS for approval. There's been some reporting and some things have been written about programs, either new or expanded programs in California and Florida that could be effective next year. But those I think are in sort of earlier stages of development. So I think broadly there's some significant potential tailwinds in the Medicaid supplemental area, some of which we've disclosed in some detail, others which I think are a little bit more or not quite as precise at this point. But those to me seem to be the big puts and takes for 2025 at this point. Ann Hynes : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Andrew Mok with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Andrew Mok : Hi, good morning. Wanted to focus on the acute volumes. Maybe if you just take a step back and comment on the volume progression in that business and now that we've established a more normal baseline for volumes like what's the outlook in the acute care segment for volume growth? Thanks. Steve Filton : Andrew, I think we've been pretty clear and consistent in our commentary in this regard. And that is, we've been saying for some time that we expected acute, broadly acute care growth to return to sort of more normal, I'll call them pre-COVID levels. So same sort of revenue growth in the 6% to 7% range. That would be split pretty evenly between price and volume. I think if you actually look at our year-to-date metrics in acute care, I think our adjusted admissions are up 3%. I think our pricing or revenue per adjusted admissions is up 5%. I think if you adjust that for the Nevada Medicaid supplemental, you're sort of in that range of 6% to 7% revenue growth split pretty evenly between price and volume. I think that's been our view for a while. I know that some of the commentary from our peers have been a little bit more bullish about what acute care volume may look like and suggesting that there have been some structural changes in the business that would result in elevated acute care volume growth for the foreseeable future. We haven't seen that yet and obviously I think if there are these structural changes, we would benefit from them as would the average acute care hospital. We just haven't seen really evidence of that just yet. The other issue which I kind of alluded to earlier is I think a number of acute care hospitals are anticipating a fairly significant benefit from the two-midnight rule change and a consequent change in the way they're coding these things, etcetera. As I've indicated, again, I think pretty clearly and consistently for a while now. We think we've been focused on that issue for several years now and as a consequence don't necessarily anticipate an incremental benefit from that. So again, I think we view acute care volumes or the future of acute care volume growth, and I think broadly acute care revenue growth is something that should be solid, etcetera, but that some of the really elevated acute care volume growth that we've seen over the last several years has been a result of the catch up in postponed and deferred procedures or procedures that had been postponed and deferred during the pandemic. And by definition I think those were sort of a onetime thing and I think we're largely past that at this point. Andrew Mok : Great. And then your corporate expenses tracked a bit higher than our estimates in the quarter. Can you help us understand any one time items there or other drivers of the increase in the corporate segment? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, we had a $5 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to our refinancing that we did during the quarter. We probably had another 5 million settlements of miscellaneous smaller lawsuits that $10 million of corporate expense I would clearly characterize as non-recurring in the quarter. Andrew Mok : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, this is Dylan on for Justin. Thanks for the question. Just had a couple quick ones for you. Is there any color you can provide on the trajectory of volumes in the behavioral business in the quarter? And then second, behavioral pricing clearly remains a strength. Are you expecting to see similar opportunities heading into 2025 or do you expect that to moderate? Thank you. Steve Filton : So as far as the trajectory of behavioral volumes, again, I think for the last several quarters we've been talking about our sense that while we originally guided to 3% same store patient day growth for behavioral for the full year of 2024, that growth was occurring more slowly than we originally anticipated. And we sort of revised that view to we'd be able to exit the year at that sort of 3% level. We were able to exit the third quarter at that 3% level. And that's despite a little bit of drag from the hurricane impact in South Carolina and Georgia on some of our facilities at the very end of the quarter Hurricane Helene. So yes, I think we remain confident that we should be able to exit the fourth quarter at that at least 3% patient day growth rate and remain confident that we can do so. As far as behavioral pricing, behavioral pricing as people know, has been quite strong for several years now throughout most of the pandemic. We attribute that to some degree to our efforts to leverage better pricing from some of our lower paying payers, particularly managed Medicaid payers. And I think in an environment where there's not a great deal of excess capacity in the behavioral industry writ large. That's been an effective sort of strategy. We've been suggesting for some time that behavioral pricing is likely to moderate at some point, and we continue to believe that. But to be fair, it is hanging in there very robustly and very strongly at the current time. And obviously we're not doing anything to try and reduce that. But we do believe that behavioral pricing, which has been running at historically high levels, will moderate at some point, but still should track in sort of that 4% to 5% range for the foreseeable future. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Sarah James with Cantor. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is Gabion [ph] for Sarah. You had a nice beat on acute revenue permission. Could you just walk us through the drivers there? And was any of that related to the extra day in the quarter? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, the extra day, I think is a mechanical sort of thing. We tend not to really focus on that largely because I think in the end, obviously, the longer the period, if you look at the full year, all that comes out in the wash. I think more importantly, we had a difficult acute care comparison. I think our same store adjusted admissions in last year's third quarter were up close to 7%. But I think even more importantly, if you go back and you listen to our or read our commentary from last year's third quarter, we attribute a lot of that to again, this catch up in the deferred and postponed procedures, those procedures that have been postponed or deferred during the pandemic. And as a consequence, if you go back, while our volumes, both admissions and surgical volumes, were strong in the third quarter of last year, they tended to be skewed towards those lower acuity kind of more discretionary procedures that people had the ability to defer during the pandemic. And so when you're looking at now that comparison to 2024 to 2023, you see, volumes sort of look unfavorable. And they've come down some, but acuity's come up because so much of that activity last year's quarter was due to the lower acuity, lower revenue sorts of procedures. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, awesome. And then any color on the inpatient surgical trend? Steve Filton : Yes, as I noted in my prepared remarks, surgeries were so often they were probably down slightly in the quarter. And again, I think it's a lot of the same dynamic that surgeries were quite strong in the third quarter of last year, but that was skewed towards a lot of what I'll describe as sort of catch up, lower acuity, more discretionary, more elective sorts of procedures. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just to ask about the labor, you commented that your use of premium pay was down to 60 million, 12% down year-to-year. Any more broad comments on what you're seeing in both business lines and labor? Are we sort of at a stable point at this point, and if you can sort of hold your SWB ratio as a percent of revenues going forward, or do you think there's still further opportunities? Steve Filton : Yes. What I think has happened, A.J., is that, again, we're in sort of now this post pandemic environment in which wage inflation, I think, has stabilized. It is clearly lower than it was at the height of the pandemic. Obviously, our use of premium pay has diminished dramatically, although it is also, I think, starting to stabilize and sort of flatten out. And I think that should continue that's benefiting us obviously, in an environment where the revenue growth in both businesses has been quite robust. It's contributing to the margin recovery that salaries are somewhat stable. And I will say people have noted to me that, on the behavioral side, salaries as a percentage of revenue did sequentially increase from Q2 to Q3. And I've asked about whether that's kind of emerging trend. And I would say not. I think that that's a function probably of the impact of the hurricane that we saw at the very end of the quarter where a number of our facilities, particularly in the Georgia, South Carolina market, saw diminished volumes but also it's a double whammy because we see diminished volumes, but we're also paying overtime, etcetera, to keep people in the facility and make sure it's properly staffed. But I think outside of that, I would say that labor trends have stabilized substantially in both business segments. A.J. Rice: Okay. And maybe just thinking about growth, development capital deployment, etcetera. Any comment on the behavior side, the JV pipeline, you paid some new bed additions as you start to think about 2025 and then obviously, to the extent there is free cash flow beyond any of that, whether there's M&A opportunities? Or should we think that most of that cash flow is going to go to stock buybacks from the year? Steve Filton : Yes. I mean we continue with a pretty aggressive and robust capital expenditure program. I talked about some of the big spends in my prepared remarks, but we've started or maybe more properly, I would say we restarted to add that to our behavioral business. We've been doing that pretty consistently prior to the pandemic -- during the pandemic, we paused many of those expansion activities with the sort of logic being, we were struggling to staff the existing beds we had there was no point in building new beds. But now that, again, the labor market has stabilized, we're looking in those markets where there is an opportunity to increase volumes by adding beds. Now to be fair, our overall occupancy in behavioral stands on the low 70s. So there are plenty of facilities where we should have the potential for upside volume without having to add any new beds, but there are some facilities that are running at higher occupancies than that. And in those facilities, we are, again, either resurrecting or entertaining new programs to build beds and we'll continue to do that. As far as opportunities for M&A, I think we often comment that we are presented with opportunities reasonably regularly. We have found if you look at the last five, seven years, not a great deal of those opportunities to be very compelling, although we will continue to look at them. And so my guess, because this is M&A, I think can be hard to predict. But my guess is that as you think about it, our capital deployment will remain focused probably on capital expenditures and on share repurchase, much as it has been for the last five to seven years. A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Pito Chickering : Good morning guys. Looking at same store occupancy here, that's a fun metric because it probably underestimates the busier days of Monday through Wednesday for neglected procedures. So my question is what is the max occupancy for the portfolio before it impacts same-store mission growth? And as you think about hospital occupancy, if you can't sort of expand beds fast enough, does this create a more aggressive conversations with your lowest yielding MA payers like you did a few years ago when you're at max capacity in behavioral? Steve Filton : Yes. So Pito, I'm not sure if your question was specific to one or both of the segments, so I'll try and answer for both. I think on the acute side, occupancy over the years has become a somewhat less relevant metric. Obviously it measures your occupied inpatient beds, but my experience is I've been in a hospital any number of times that maybe at 2/3 occupancy from an inpatient bed perspective, but you walk through the emergency room and there are stretchers in the hallway or you walk through the OR and you've got a real busy schedule or the Cath lab, that sort of thing. So I think that acute care inpatient occupancy is not as relevant as sort of a metric as it used to be, or at one time it was. There are, I think, a number of other equally important variables in measuring sort of the efficiency and the output of an acute care hospital. I think in terms of the broader question, I don't know that we have too many OR hospitals that we're really at max capacity in any of those areas. We're certainly not there in terms of inpatient beds, but I don't think we're necessarily there in terms of emergency room capacity or Cath labs or ORs, etcetera. And to the degree that we are, I think we're responding to that with capital improvement and expansion programs that address that. On the behavioral side, I do think that inpatient occupancy or an inpatient bed occupancy number is more relevant. There are sort of fewer ancillary sorts of procedures in a behavioral hospital that account for that. Although obviously outpatient activity needs to be measured as well. But the same thing. I mean, as I said, for the most part, I don't think we have physical capacity constraints in our behavioral business, but there certainly are facilities and geographies where that is an issue. And those are the places where we're doing debt expansions or at least contemplating debt expansions. Pito Chickering : Great. And then a follow-up here is on physician expenses. Like you talked about sort of that being stable at like 70% of revenue. Are there other areas like radiology and NICU which have not been pressure points in the past, which could be asking for subsidies going forward or pretty much across portfolio across all different groups of physicians at stable? Thank you very much. Steve Filton : Yes. So the answer is yes. And I would say in the portfolio I can find examples in almost every specialty where we've had requests for greater subsidies or increased expense, etcetera. As I noted in comments earlier, I think for us the biggest pressure, by far the most expansive, has been in the emergency room and anesthesia areas. But yes, we have, I think, one off situations where we've seen pressure from hospitalists or laborists or radiologists, as you asked about. But they clearly, I think, have accounted for much less pressure than ER and anesthesiology. And I think broadly, while we continue to sort of deal with those issues every day, I think that situation, which was such a headwind in 2023, has largely stabilized. Pito Chickering : Great. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Joanna Gajuk with BofA Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Joanna Gajuk : Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I guess first to clarify the commentary around the outlook for psych business into next year. So you sort of alluded to the idea of, maybe pricing excluding supplemental, growing 4.5 and, and I guess you still expect to exit at 3% volume growth. So is that sort of the trajectory to expect next year in terms of growth for that segment? Steve Filton : Yes. So Joanna, I mean we're not, we're going to give sort of precise 2025 guidance on this call. We don't do that until our fourth quarter call in February. But I think we have broadly described our expected sort of trajectory of growth in the behavioral business is same. So revenue growth in the kind of mid-to-upper single digits, 6%, 7%, 8% probably skewed a little bit more to pricing. So 4% to 5% pricing, 3% to 3.5% volume. But I'm not suggesting that that's going to be our precise guidance for next year. But I think in terms of thinking about next year, that's I think how we start. And then obviously to the degree that there's any significant Medicaid supplemental programs, etcetera that would be sort of incremental to that. Joanna Gajuk : Right. And I guess on site in terms of volumes, so this quarter maybe wasn't very close to 3%, but I guess you still expect to kind of exit that year. But as we think about all these different tailwinds, so can you kind of walk us through what you're seeing out there in the market? So obviously there's the mental health parity with a deal that has, I guess more teeth requiring, to actually execute on this mental health parity and also sounds like states are adding more benefits. So are you seeing higher demand and I guess, are you able to meet that demand? I guess is there something to be said about increased rates to be able to then, staff for that volume? Steve Filton : Yes. So Joanna, I apologize because I'm having a little trouble hearing you, but I think I got the crux of your question. I'll say this. We as I indicated in some earlier comments, I think our volume recovery in behavioral has, I think we've been candid about saying it's taken a little bit longer than we expected. We've cited a number of issues that have been challenges, labor scarcity issues in specific pockets and specific geographies has been one. We had a handful of residential facilities that struggled with some very sort of unique issues that they've been recovering from. And I think over the last year or so we've talked about the impact of Medicaid disenrollments and the sort of challenges that that's created even for those patients who have been able to re-enroll or enroll in commercial exchange products. While that I think tends to be a benefit on the acute side, I don't think it tends to be as much of a benefit on the behavioral side because the large co pays and deductibles that generally come with those commercial plans have sort of been challenging. But I think for the most part the recovery in our behavioral volumes and our optimism about being able to sustain that recovery in the fourth quarter is really about the improvement of all these issues. We continue to be able to hire more staff and have more adequate staff to allow us to take more patients. The residential facilities that have struggled are continuing to improve and the Medicaid disenrollment impact continues to dissipate as either patients are able to re-enroll in Medicaid or get commercial exchange coverage and they exhaust their copays and deductibles. So I think it's the improvement in those areas that's really contributing to the behavioral improvement. I think you specifically asked about whether we're seeing or anticipating a significant benefit from the Biden administration's sort of tightening of rules on mental health parity. Mental health parity, which was implemented any number of years ago, sort of to great fanfare and I think expectation that we would really benefit from that. I think we've benefited to some degree, but I think the payers and the payer community broadly has been challenging in terms of really getting them to comply with I think both the spirit and the actual intent of mental health parity. I do think that the strengthened government regulations are helpful, but I don't know that they're likely to really create a landscape change. I think where they're helpful is as we appeal these things, as we appeal denials and that sort of thing, strengthened government regulations are often helpful in that regard. But I don't think that's going to drive a huge increase in behavioral volumes. Joanna Gajuk : Thank you. And some excuse. Very last I guess clarification question, I'll comment on the 2024 guidance or assuming no change so you put up $20 million, I guess, good guide in the quarter from supplemental that wasn't in there, but then there was a $10 million back, I guess, for debt and debt cost and -- I guess settlement, so roughly no change to your 2024 guidance? I just want to confirm that? Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes, there is no change to our revised 2024 guidance. Operator : Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jamie Perse : Hey, thank you. Good morning Steve. I just wanted to go back to acute care volumes in the quarter at 1.5%. I appreciate you've been expecting some normalization but that was just weaker than expected. And want to get a sense of if you saw any change across the quarter, any callouts by payer class. If you can give us any detail on how some of the larger payer classes grew relative to that. And then as we think about normalization, is this what the new normal looks like or are there any dynamics in the third quarter that make this not representative of the go forward? Steve Filton : Yes. So on this one Jamie, I think I'm just going to have to repeat comments that I've already made. I think that the most significant sort of dynamic in the quarter is the difficult comparison to last year which I will say we have clearly and consistently pointed out during the quarter and tried to manage people's expectations. But more importantly is that difficult comparison to last year I think was really related to the fact and I think if you go back and read or listen to our commentary from last year it was this sort of exhaustion of deferred and postponed procedures which we did view as kind of a one-time thing. What I also said earlier was I thought that if you looked at the year-to-date performance of the acute business 3% adjusted admission growth, 5% revenue per adjusted admission growth. And if you ex-d [ph] out the impact of the Nevada supplementals you start to get an acute care model that in my mind a was reflective or is reflective of our historical model but also our expectations for the future which is kind of mid-single digits 6% 7% same store revenue growth split pretty evenly between price and Volume. Jamie Perse : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a bit of a longer term question. We've been in a pretty unique environment really for the last five years or so. A number of structural dynamics have either emerged or maybe intensified over that period. ASC utilization, aggressive payer tactics that probably impacts administrative burden, growth in MA and HICS. I guess, just as you think about the next five years, can you level set us on strategy and in particular internal investment priorities going forward? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, it's a pretty broad question and one that I'm sure we could speak for an extended period of time about all the dynamics that you mentioned. I think broadly the way I would answer the question, which seems to be an acute care centered question, is we have a view that the care continuum has clearly been expanded and payers are looking to ensure that patients can be treated in the most cost effective settings of care, which has resulted in a growth of ambulatory surgery facilities and freestanding imaging facilities and much greater access points. We've had great success with our penetration of freestanding emergency departments as an example. But broadly, I think we are trying to participate in the investment in that broader continuum. Whether it's again, ASCs, freestanding imaging, freestanding EDs, etcetera. That's certainly one component of it. The other, I think is a continued alignment with our physicians, whether that's through accountable care organizations. We have at least one of those in every single market in which we operate, whether it's employed physicians, which we have in virtually all of our markets, etcetera. But I think we view that as we sort of continue into a pretty challenging environment and where utilization is going to be viewed carefully by payers and by the government. We think being properly aligned with our physicians is most important dynamic. So to me, I would cite those two issues, the continued emphasis on physician alignment in a bunch of different ways and the continued expansion of the care continuum as two of our major focuses as we think about the next five years. Jamie Perse : All right, appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan Langston : Hey, Steve. Thank you. Quick one and then maybe a more broad one first. Does the SDP program benefit you called out for DC. Does that include the new facility that you're opening? Steve Filton : Yes, it does. Although I think for the most part it's been difficult to predict what the impact on the new facility is because obviously we have no track record of utilization, etcetera. So the number that we've given is largely based on the historic performance of our acute care hospital in the district as well as we do have a behavioral hospital in the district that would have a smaller benefit from this program. But the new hospital will participate in any new Medicaid supplemental program that's approved. Ryan Langston : So that would just be some upside potentially to what you've ranged already. I guess maybe modest. Steve Filton : Correct. Okay. Ryan Langston : And then maybe just more broadly, we've seen some, I guess, increase in frequency and legal headlines both on behavioral and the acute side. So just curious on your thoughts on is that just sort of the avalanche of you see one and now you're going to get three more. And if you think that might subside, I mean, it just seems like these are much higher, at least frequency than pre-COVID. So just any kind of high level thoughts on some of the legal news flow would be great. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, certainly there have been some kind of headline grabbing verdicts in I think, particularly in the behavioral space in the last year. I think, as we've indicated, we believe that the two verdicts that we have disclosed are both subject to appealable issues. At least one of the verdicts has been substantially reduced just at the trial judge level. But again, I think there's a great deal more appeal activity to go on both of those cases. I think it's hard to say whether those cases really reflect a significant, change in the landscape. I think they're both, they were both extraordinary verdicts in terms of any sort of history, in terms of the facts of the case or the jurisdictions or whatever. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are increasing our reserves for malpractice expense to recognize. I think just more broadly an increase not so much in the frequency of cases, but in the severity of cases and the severity of settlements and verdicts, etcetera, but not necessarily really driven by the two cases that we've been disclosing, because I do think those are sort of extraordinary and are both likely to be significantly reduced. Ryan Langston : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Matthew Gillmor with KBCM. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Matthew Gillmor : Hey, Steve, So the outlook for the Medicaid supplemental payments. I think we've heard you talk about Tennessee and DC in the past. I think today you mentioned some additional funding for Nevada of $56 million. Did that be understood to be something new that's developed, or was that already sort of baked in and understood previously? Steve Filton : No, I think what gives rise to that incremental benefit is the state increasing the size of their Medicaid supplemental pool as a result of updating their Medicaid utilization statistics and data and submitting that to CMS. So that is something that was sort of incrementally newsworthy to us and obviously we're disclosing it now. But I think it's triggered by the increase in Medicaid utilization that the state is experiencing and as a consequence is increasing their pool of these Medicaid supplemental payments available. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. And then, Steve, I wanted to see if you would be able to provide any comments on the hurricane dynamics. I think you mentioned some impacts around the edges with behavioral volumes, but any way to think about sort of any EBITDA impact or is it just small enough that it doesn't matter that much? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, I would say that we thought that probably in the behavioral side of the business, patient day volume would have been maybe 25, 30 basis points higher had it not been for the impacts of the hurricane. I mentioned that, I think there was a bit of a, creep up in salary expense during the quarter as a result. I think broadly we had the view that trying to quantify the impact of the hurricane in both of the segments, it was just not material enough to sort of call out as a discrete item. It certainly was, a bit of a drag during the quarter. But I think, I think our point of view was it wasn't significant enough to call out as a discrete item. Matthew Gillmor : Got it. Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Whit Mayo : Thanks. I'll just keep it to one question. Steve was just looking for an update on some of the EMR investments you guys have been making within the behavioral segment. How many facilities now, any benefits that you're seeing on labor or other efficiencies, and then just maybe any new strategic initiatives within that segment that we should be mindful of as we enter 2025. Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I don't necessarily have the precise data in front of me with, but I think, by early next year, we'll probably have 25 or 30 facilities live on the EMR and that implementation and installation process will continue. I think, we feel like it's generally been successful, and I think it tends to lend itself to greater efficiencies when you don't necessarily have a paper record. But also, higher quality of care, different clinicians are able to view the record more, more easily, etcetera. And that improves, I think the quality of the patient care that you can provide. I think the other technological development that we've talked about before in behavioral has to do with what we describe as patient observation or patient rounding. Having eyes on behavioral patients very, very frequently is a significant part of keeping patients safe and well. And to date, that's been a physical exercise that literally someone is laying eyes on every patient every 15 minutes or so. But to the degree that we can enhance that process technologically, have a patient wear what looks like an apple watch and have our clinicians carry what looks like a tablet around and be able to know where patients are and whether they've been observed and keep track of them more effectively that way, I think that's going to be a significant development that will help in the behavioral business in a great many ways in terms of quality of patient care and risk management, etcetera, in the next few years. Whit Mayo : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Michael Ha with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Ha : Thank you. Steve, I think last quarter you mentioned a lot of cost management in your acute care business in preparation for that sort of eventual return to pre pandemic volume. And then basically the aim of being able to continue EBITDA and margin expansion even when things moderate. So now that volumes appear to be moderating and acuity seems to be picking up, it feels like it might be materializing faster than most expected. So I wanted to revisit this topic, ask about those cost management efforts, how it's been tracking, how has it been tracking. And at this point in time, if volumes do continue to moderate, what's your confidence level that you're right now in the right position to drive that EBITDA and margin expansion in the queue? Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, I think the point that I tried to make last quarter, maybe in the last couple of quarters is this sort of idea that some of the traditional kind of blocking and tackling that we have done from a productivity standpoint was, if not suspended, maybe paused temporarily during the pandemic. We were so challenged in finding an adequate workforce and keeping an adequate workforce during the pandemic. There were, we definitely sort of, there was a reluctance to manage to what we would sort of consider peak efficiency. I think as we emerge from the pandemic more willing to do the sort of things that I think we've always historically done, including adjusting to volumes as they moved up and down. And I think you saw that last quarter and I think you saw that this quarter as well, where salaries as a percentage of revenues has been coming down and coming down pretty steadily, and I think is really one of the main contributors to that margin recovery. I think that's continuing. And I think the point being I don't exactly know where acute care volumes will move, and I don't think anybody really knows for certain. But I think we're in a position where we're much more, flexible about reacting to that and reacting to that in an efficient way than, we were at the height of the pandemic when we face so many more staffing challenges. Michael Ha : Thank you. And then follow up, California and New Mexico supplemental payments for 2025. We're hearing it could be potentially 70 million to 80 million for California, 30 for New Mexico. To UHS was wondering if you've any sort of additional clarity on sizing. And then with all the recent discussion around state proposals and the CMS raising those payments to average commercial rates for next year, I was wondering if you could talk more about those proposals. The potential tailwind, not just California and Florida, which everyone's been focused on, but across all your states, I guess. How real of a potential tailwind is this? Thank you. Steve Filton : Yes, so just responding to the specific questions you asked, New Mexico, I don't think is a significant, again, upside for us. We have one small behavioral facility in New Mexico, California, we obviously have a much bigger presence, both for acute and behavioral. And I think the challenge in terms of sizing the potential benefit in California is that the state has not created a formal plan or an allocation methodology, etcetera. So even though we understand that the potential benefit in total could be quite significant, we really have no way of knowing exactly how that would impact specific hospitals, how it would be allocated among specific hospitals until the state issues a more specific plan, which at least we understand is not likely to happen until sometime maybe next year, early next year. Your broader question about are more states likely to increase their programs or develop new programs, increase their funding to average commercial rates? It really varies by. And you know, we've sort of had this practice of we really only disclose them when the states have a formal plan, that they submit it to CMS and are awaiting approval. But we certainly, like others, are aware that other states are contemplating this in earlier stages, etcetera. And so we continue to believe that the potential benefit could be significant beyond just the ones that we disclosed, which are significant, I think, in and of themselves, but difficult to size that opportunity in any sort of precise way until the states develop their plans and Submit them to CMS. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question is going to come from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ben Hendrix : Great. Thank you very much. Just a quick follow up on some of the psychiatric questions, especially in residential psych. And I think I've asked this question, but just wanted to get any update or any updated thoughts on your strategic initiatives around psych. I know you mentioned, the higher liability reserves and some very specific issues at some of your facilities. Is there any thoughts on kind of changing strategic direction or evolving strategy there? And could we potentially, amid this heightened security, could there be consolidation opportunities in residential? Thanks. Steve Filton : Yes, I mean, I was asked kind of a more strategic question earlier. Well, that focus was on acute care. But then I think in some ways the, my answer on behavioral and my outlook is similar in the sense that we see an expanding continuum in which outpatient care is likely to play a greater role and there'll be more demand for access to outpatient care. And we're expanding our outpatient footprint in response to that. I think we continue to expand our services to military members because that seems to be a growing and significant part of the business. The SUD [ph] or addiction business continues to grow and demand is increasing there. And I think we're increasing our exposure there. Yes, I don't know that it's particularly an acute residential sort of issue of paying attention or focusing on one more than the other as much as it is these other service lines, which we think are growing. And I would add to sort of the outpatient dynamic, continuing expansion of telehealth capabilities as well. Ben Hendrix : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to hand the conference back over to Steve Filton for any closing remarks. Steve Filton : Yes, we'd just like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with people at the end of next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect, everyone. Have a great day.",
