Ltd., Research Division Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Starwood Hotels & Resorts First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Pettibone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Stephen Pettibone : Thank you, Sylvia, and thanks to all of you for dialing in to Starwood's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Frits van Paasschen, our CEO and President; and Vasant Prabhu, our Vice Chairman and CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Starwood's annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call on our website at www.starwoodhotels.com. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Frits for his comments. Frits D. van Paasschen : Thank you, Stephen and welcome, everybody, to our Q1 earnings call. For my prepared remarks, I'll follow my usual format and cover 4 main topics. First, I'll look at the business climate and our results in the quarter; second, some further comments on our business in China; third, a few observations on rising travel in emerging markets; and finally, our approach to global growth in cities around the world. Turning now to my first topic, the quarter. Overall, the global economy generally and the lodging recovery in particular continued to bounce along, with once again some markets doing better and others doing worse. This year's begun pretty much along the same trend line that we've been seeing since the end of the economic crisis. Across mature markets, namely North America, Japan and Europe, growth and demand showed a steady improvement on last year and from what we can see, conditions are set to stay along that same trajectory. What our customers are telling us jives with the macro view that rising productivity and low inflation have set the stage for more steady growth. That bodes well for our business in mature markets. But that same positive outlook also prompted the Fed start tapering QE, which had ripple effects across the fast-growing or emerging markets around the world. The drop in liquidity came hand-in-hand with concerns about economic and political risk in some emerging economies. And as we've said before, if you're casting about the world looking for things to worry about, there's plenty to find, whether its China's tighter credit markets and lower growth rates, political turmoil in Thailand, or Argentine currency devaluation, or most ominously, unrest in the Ukraine and Russian actions in Crimea. Looking ahead this year, we'll also see some milestone elections in places like Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey, and most notably, India. So with this as a backdrop, we could see further gyrations in financial markets. The implications for Starwood is that our worldwide presence makes us more susceptible to these uncertainties. And in fact, global uncertainty may have been a factor in our stock underperforming in the first quarter after a terrific 2013. Nonetheless, our view remains that despite the ups and downs, the long-term growth trends in these markets remain a huge opportunity. It's also important to note that despite investor concerns about emerging markets, our business did just fine. And point of fact, we had a great quarter at the high end of expectations. Worldwide REVPAR was up over 6% and adjusted EBITDA was $281 million. Here's a look at how our business performed around the world. Starting with North America, REVPAR was up over 7%. This came despite lower REVPAR growth in the East region, thanks to a harsh winter and new supply in New York. By contrast, the south and west regions were strong, with some markets showing double-digit REVPAR growth. Across North America, occupancies once again were pushed to record highs. At this point, you'd expect late-cycle market dynamics in North America with REVPAR growth predominantly coming through higher rates, which is generally what we're seeing. Yet despite this, we're still several years away from seeing any real increase in supply in most markets. At the upper end, new supply is especially scarce, so as long as the U.S. continues its even modest economic growth, it seems likely that high occupancy and rising rates are here to stay for a while. The situation in Europe is not so different, although REVPAR was up a more modest 2.5%. For those of you who follow our business closely, you know that the first quarter in Europe is the off-season and as such, doesn't say much about the rest of the year. REVPAR growth in Africa and the Middle East was a mixed bag. Egypt, with 11 hotels for us, continues to be a drag on the region. We're hopeful that this year's elections will bring stability, but our outlook for the year does not reflect a dramatic change there. Elsewhere in the region, we saw improved performance in Saudi Arabia and strength in Qatar offset by mixed results in the Emirates. In Latin America, up nearly 3%, performance was also mixed. For a while, we've been describing Latin America as behaving like a diverse collection of countries. What's emerging now is 2-tier region. On the bright side, Mexico and Central America, along with other members of the Pacific Alliance are promoting growth, integrating into world markets and supporting travel and trade. Our results in Mexico this quarter and in Central America would suggest that these policies are faring well with combined REVPAR up 14%. The second tier of Latin America would include the MERCOSUR countries, not to mention Venezuela. Both the Argentine and Brazilian economies continue to struggle. Turning now to Asia Pacific. REVPAR across China was up nearly 12%. Part of this was the incredible growth of the Sheraton Macao, now in its second year operation. In the first quarter, its 4,000 rooms ran at nearly 90% occupancy. But even factoring out the Sheraton Macao, China REVPAR grew nearly 6%. I'll come back to our business in China shortly. Across the rest of Asia Pacific, REVPAR grew nearly 6% as well. In the face of unrest in Thailand and a weakening economy, that growth speaks to the resilience of our business. Excluding Thailand, REVPAR was up more like 9%. Resorts in Asia continue to perform well with REVPAR up over 12%. In summary, the performance of our managed and franchised hotels around the world drove up core fees by 9% over last year. Our owned hotels also did well with total EBITDA up, thanks to better margins and some hotels coming off renovation. As a note, total owned revenue was down versus last year, but that's because we sold 7 hotels since the first quarter last year. This quarter also saw good sales trends of SVO, especially at The Westin St. John, which we're converting entirely to vacation ownership. We continue to manage SVO with an eye toward return on investment, non-GAAP [ph] earnings growth. Overall, Starwood's business has continued to generate cash. Since our last call, we announced both our first quarterly dividend and the first installment of our special dividend tied to the successful completion of Bal Harbour. In total, these dividends will return over $750 million to shareholders this year. And as a reminder, over the last 10 years, we've returned nearly $10 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, special dividends and share repurchases. As many have noted, we have great flexibility in our balance sheet and we'll continue to work to find ways of returning cash to shareholders. Vasant will give you a more detailed view of next quarter and the rest of the year, but in general, terms, we'll keep playing it safe in an uncertain world. As I mentioned earlier, the recent sell-off in emerging markets and the tension in Russia and Ukraine are but 2 examples of how fortunes could change. Thailand, Argentina and Egypt, to name a few, are markets where local events are disrupting our business as well. But I'll conclude this topic by saying again that despite the worldwide volatility, the long-term trends point to sustained growth in demand for high-end lodging brands. This leads me to my second topic, a closer look at our business in China. For this first time in over a year, performance was stronger than we expected. As I noted earlier, REVPAR to hotels in mainland China was up over 6%. The quarter also represents our ninth consecutive quarter of REVPAR index gains. Our result was especially good in light of government austerity, not to mention a slight drop in inbound travel to China. We've also improved our profit margins despite rising costs. We've been working hard to bring high-end Chinese travelers our hotels. In fact, occupancy, even excluding the Sheraton Macao, was up over 5 percentage points. This is a result of our efforts to leverage SPG and our Chinese language Web and mobile channels, as well as the strength of our brands, our hotels and our teams. We mobilized our call center and sales teams that target many smaller corporate accounts. We also promoted leisure, weddings, in particular, and we're using SPG for local SMB [ph] promotions. I should add that these promotions also provide a value touch point with SPG members in their home markets. The upshot of all this work is that our business is even more Chinese than ever. At this point, well over 70% of our occupancy are PRC nationals. Moreover, our ability to deliver value is resonating with developers, with our signing pace in owner relations as strong as ever. So those are the positives about China. Now for the challenges. We've maintained for some time that an economy as large and rapidly changing as China's will see some fits and starts. And while we agree with our owner partners that the Chinese economy has many years left to grow, we also recognize that China will need to make significant structural changes along the way. In the near term, we don't have much visibility into where the business is headed as transient booking windows are short, and we also have fewer large customers from whom to get a general read on business, let alone a commitment to meetings and conventions with long lead times. What we can see in China remains -- that it remains a relatively low occupancy market. So it's likely that our growth will be driven more by occupancy than rising rates. Wages have also been rising faster for some time now, so we're adapting our staffing levels to maintain our margins. On the development front, our view is the tighter liquidity has tempered the pace of real estate development. Many of our new hotels are slated for Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets and are part of mixed-use developments. As a result, the time it takes between signing and opening new hotels has become longer. But even taking this into account, we believe there's more risk in being timid in China and missing out on future growth. China's undergoing a transformation on a scale and at a rate never seen before in history. Hundreds of millions of people are still projected to move to cities in the next 20 years, and demand for high-end hotels per capita among current city dwellers still has a long way to grow. And China's not the only market where this transformation is playing out, and this brings me to my third topic, rising demand for travel in emerging markets. I've alluded a couple of times to the recent emerging market selloff. We've read and heard lots of talk about instability and uncertainty. But when we look at our business, we're reminded time and again to focus on the long-term trend lines, not the day-to-day headlines. And by trend lines, I mean the steady growth that we've seen in our Emerging Markets business. The secular growth in travel demand around the world is something that we've been talking about for some time, and it continues to play out. In 2008, 1/3 of all SPG members were based outside of the U.S. Today, non-U.S. members outnumber U.S. members, with China our second largest market. Also, across emerging markets, where affluence has risen dramatically, SPG membership has increased up by more than 460% since 2008. The number of Indian and Russian SPG members has tripled. In the Emirates, it's gone up by 150%, and Brazilian membership is nearly doubled. And of course, SPG membership is growing in parallel with travel. We've talked about the 21% increase in Chinese SPG outbound travel in 2013. But this is not just about China. Outbound travel from Korea is up 32%; Russia, 20%; India, 12%; and Mexico, up 7%. This all translates into an SPG Member base that's growing even faster than our footprint. While our room count has increased over 20% since 2008, the number of guests who stay with us more than 10 nights a year has nearly doubled. This is the result of targeted investments in growing the same base of high-end frequent travelers that we've historically had in North America. Our Ambassador Program is a good example. We established personal relationships with our highest-value guests and helped our properties make sure that these guests feel special and recognized, securing their loyalty and repeat business. We're now putting technology to work to find new ways to deliver that touch to a broader base of guests. Simply put, our business model is to make global guests happy so we can deliver great returns to our owners. That virtuous circle ultimately brings more and better high-end fee generating hotels into our system, making our brands that much more valuable to our loyal guests. Which brings me to my fourth topic, a look at how the secular growth story is playing out in cities around the world. Stepping back, it used to be that businesses were considered global if they were represented in North America, Japan and Europe, along with a few key cities in the rest of the world. For that matter, a couple of generations ago, New York and London were far and away the world's premier cities. Today, there are 100 big cities around the world that account for nearly 40% of global GDP. And we have a presence in nearly all of those cities. As they grow, they can support more hotels across our brands. Jakarta is a great example. We already have a Sheraton and Le M\u00e9ridien and we recently opened a Luxury Collection hotel. And in the next 3 years, we'll add another Sheraton, a Westin, a St. Regis, a W and 2 Alofts. Looking around the world at large cities, we still have a long way to go before we reach saturation. Take Dubai, where we now have 15 hotels and another 5 on the way or Shanghai, where we have 11 open and 4 on the way. And now global growth is reaching well beyond those top 100 cities. The next 500-or-so cities, which McKinsey has called the middleweights, are set to contribute almost as much to global growth as the top 100. These middleweight cities make sense for a few reasons. First, many of the top cities have become expensive, congested and polluted. So increasingly people and businesses that have the option to move are choosing to go elsewhere. Second, technology is making it easier to relocate as connectivity allows businesses to operate in multiple locations. Third and perhaps most significantly, middleweight cities are growing faster as the sheer number of people moving to cities accelerates. As the global middle class rises from 2 billion to 5 billion people in the next 20 years, millions of people per month are coming to cities. So here are some examples of our growth in middleweight cities where we're adding to Sheraton's existing presence. Panama City, where we recently opened 2 Westins and an Aloft, and we're soon to add a W; Cheung Sha, where we'll open a W, a St. Regis and a Westin; and Bahrain, where we'll add a Westin and Le M\u00e9ridien. And growth in the new middleweight cities is also the latest era in the first mover strategy that's fueled growth for Sheraton and Le M\u00e9ridien. On previous calls, we've talked about our move in second and third tier cities in China, but once again, this is not just the case there. Looking at Sheraton's pipeline, nearly 1/3 of the hotel's -- of the brand's new hotels will be in markets where we don't yet have -- that don't yet have a high-end hotel. These are cities like Aktobe in Kazakhstan, Nouakchott in Mauritania, Erbil in Kurdistan. Around the world, we estimate, in fact, that there are about 200 cities that could support one or more Sheratons that don't yet have one, and there's, of course, great potential for the rest of our brands as well. So I want to close by reminding you that we're careful about managing our growth. It's one thing to sign a deal in many locations around the world, it's quite another to sign a good deal. We've remained focused on the 3 pillars of our development strategy : right place, right property and right partner, because we know that the hotels that come into our system need to stand the test of time and meet the expectations of our SPG loyal members. So let me wrap up by saying simply this : Despite the gloom about emerging markets, we had a strong start to 2014. And for that, we can thank our associates who work hard to give our guests a better way to experience the world. And as a result, our distinctive and compelling brands continue to be favorites among travelers everywhere. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Vasant. Vasant M. Prabhu: Thank you, Frits, and good morning to you all. We've had a good start to the year. We exceeded our expectations for the first quarter with great revenue momentum, strong margin performance and profits ahead of forecast. Driving these results were our 2 largest businesses, the U.S. and China, which fired on all cylinders. Helped by Macau, China grew REVPAR in the double-digits, which we have not seen in a while. The U.S, helped by the Easter shift delivered REVPAR growth at the high end of the range. Asia, x China, was also strong despite sharp declines in Thailand. Europe remains stable but sluggish. Elsewhere, there were the usual pluses and minuses. All in all, the first quarter sets up well to meet or exceed our goals for the year. As always, we'll take a quick trip around the globe. I'll finish with some comments on asset sales and capital allocation. North America delivered 7% REVPAR growth in Q1 despite the harsh weather. Adjusting for the Easter shift into April, this momentum has continued into Q2. Driving growth is very strong corporate demand. Corporate business, both transient and group, is robust and shows no signs of slowing down. As we anticipated, the corporate traveler is back on the road trying to drive sales growth. Professional services and technology, 2 of our largest segments, grew double-digits in the quarter. Group business continues to pace in the mid-single-digits with smaller group corporate business especially strong while larger group association business remains weak. Due to weather, the Northeast, Midwest and Eastern Canada were weak in Q1. With the winter behind us, we hope to see improvement in these regions. The West and South grew double-digits in cities like San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Occupancies have continued to climb past prior peaks. With low supply, this sets up well for healthy rate gains in the months and years ahead. We expect North American REVPAR growth to continue to pace in the upper half of our outlook range of 5% to 7%. Perhaps a big positive surprise for many of you was the return of double-digit same-store growth in China. Frits gave you a fair amount of color on what we're seeing and doing. Our 4,000-room Sheraton Macau is in the same-store set [ph] now and clearly helped the reported numbers since it is still ramping up. The Macau effect will fade as we go through the year. But even without Macau, China was up 6%, a better trend than recent quarters, with cities like Shanghai, up 8%; Shenzhen, up 9%; and Hainan, up 14%. There continues to be weakness in the North and West due to government's focus on ensuring officials curtail spending at luxury hotels. Beijing and Tianjin were both down and Tier 2 and 3 cities in the West were also hurt. As Frits indicated, we have moved very fast to adapt to changing conditions. Our corporate business grew double digits, our occupancies were up 8 points and we gained share again. We expect the rate of growth to slow some in Q2 versus the Q1 trend, but still come in above the high end of our REVPAR outlook range. Across the rest of Asia, growth was sustained despite Thailand. REVPAR in Thailand declined 13% due to the protest in Bangkok. Indonesia, on the other hand, was up 34%. Bali is booming as some demand shifts from the Thai resorts to Bali. The recent event surrounding the Malaysian jetliner are affecting travel into Malaysia and further helping Bali. Japan continues to show strength, and Australia is also thriving. India remains sluggish. People are hopeful that the elections currently underway will allow growth to resume. All in all, the only issue for us in this part of the world is exchange rates. Even though REVPAR grew 5.6% in local currencies, it was down 4.7% as reported in dollars. We expect Asia, x China, to sustain its growth trend. In Europe, the first quarter is a small contributor and does not tell as much about how the year might shape up. We were hopeful that Europe may surprise to the upside in 2014. That may yet happen but it did not in Q1, and so far, Q2 looks to be more of the same. U.K. and Italy are doing well. France and Spain are sluggish. Eastern Europe could be hurt by events in the Ukraine. Greece is on a strong recovery track. Occupancies continue to climb. Supply remains dormant. We need to see better rate gains in Europe, and for that, we need somewhat more robust demand. Until that happens, Europe growth will stay in the 2% to 4% range we have experienced for the past few years. Meanwhile, surprisingly strong euro is helping profits as reported in dollars. In Africa and the Middle East, the story remains country-specific. Egypt is hurting as it laps the recovery we saw in the first half of last year before political uncertainty returned. Saudi and the Gulf are doing well. South Africa was up double-digits while Nigeria was flat with little or no inbound travel due to instability. Similarly in Latin America, Mexico continues to boom. Mexican resorts are very popular destinations again, whereas in the South, Brazil was down, hurting most of the region since it is also a major source of regional travel. Problems in Argentina continue. The devaluation helps our margins in the short term till local costs catch up. While Q2 will benefit from the World Cup in Brazil, these regions will likely continue in this mode for the next few quarters. SVO continued to be stable with sustained improvement in default trends. There are only 2 condos left to sell at Bal Harbour. In summary, we felt good about how the quarter is shaping up. We have left the major components of our outlook range for the year largely unchanged. We're raising our full year EBITDA outlook range modestly to $1.21 billion to $1.23 billion. We now [ph] expect a 50-basis points lower tax rate, which takes our full year EPS outlook range to $2.76 to $2.83. SG&A growth in the second quarter as reported may be higher than you might expect since we will be lapping the recognition last year of $7 million in state tax incentives derived from our headquarters move to Stanford. As we indicated, we have recurring annual benefits in the $3 million to $4 million range, which will most likely be recognized in Q3 this year. Moving on to asset sales. We continue to believe the market for hotel sales is becoming deeper with a larger pool of buyers and more buyers looking for portfolio deals. We have a significant number of assets on the market in North America, Europe and Asia. Our intention is to get transactions completed on acceptable terms as fast as we can. As is our practice, we will announce transactions as we get them done. We just closed on the sale of the Aloft in Tucson, a conversion that we had done ourselves. And now to capital allocation. With the announcement of our quarterly special dividend, we have opened up the third front, so to speak, to return cash to shareholders. This year, our special dividend is a return of approximately $500 million in net cash we realized from Bal Harbour. We can and will consider sustaining the special dividend depending on our cash generation from asset sales, other avenues to return to cash to shareholders and other uses for the cash to drive growth in our business. The special dividend adds on to the adjustments we had made to our regular dividend a couple years back, moving to a better yield and higher payout ratio. We have over $600 million in stock buyback authorization we can deploy, and we'll do so as opportunities present themselves. With a healthy regular dividend, quarterly special dividend and a big stock buyback authorization, we have all the levers we need to return significant cash back to shareholders as we have done over the past 10 years when we returned $10 billion through all 3 avenues. We know that many of you would like us to step up our stock buybacks, adopt a less opportunistic and more programmatic approach. You would like to see us borrow more at current rates and reset our capital structure. We want to assure you that your views have been heard by Frits and I, as well as our board. It is important that we remind everybody that while there may not have been stock buybacks in Q1, we returned $190 million to shareholders through our quarterly regular and special dividends. You have the cash and the flexibility to reinvest in our stock or redeploy this capital as you see fit. Our return of capital strategy is neither inflexible, nor inviolate. We're always calibrating what we do based on new facts, and we'll continue to do so. In the end, we are clear that any cash we cannot productively deploy to grow our business will be returned to shareholders. It is not a question of if; it is purely a question of how and when. With that, I'll turn this back to Stephen. Stephen Pettibone : Thank you, Vasant. We'd now like to open up the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Sylvia, can we have the first question, please? Operator : Your first question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So guys, I obviously respect your views on the buyback, and clearly that the capital return story has been present in different forms. But Frits, I believe, in your prepared remarks, you did highlight how Starwood has tried to focus on the long-term and long-term trends as they relate to the growth potentials for your brands. And I think obviously, as you identified one of the major controversies right now and potentially one of the reasons for the underperformances as some investors would call out is the clarity of the buyback story relative to some of your peers. Do you feel at any point where you start to look at the ROI implied by maybe a more aggressive buyback as a way of manifesting that long-term view in the near term and buying more of a company that you're bullish on longer-term? Frits D. van Paasschen : Yes, Carlo, thanks for the question. And I think that you among others have been vocal in calling this out. I do want to go back, though, and clarify a statement I made. The reason for our underperformance in the first quarter, if I were to hazard a guess, had more to do with the emerging market selloff than lack of clarity around buybacks. I don't think that our buyback strategy in fact got suddenly less clear in the first quarter after a great performance of our stock over the course of 2013. Then I haven't even [ph] said, and I don't mean to be snarky in that answer, but the other aspect of the short-term versus the long-term piece is that as the world zigs and zags, we believe we will come into some opportunities or potentially could based on what's happened historically where our stock may trade at more of a discount to its intrinsic value. So that's something that we're going to continue to work on. And as Vasant said, we're going to keep recalibrating both that view into valuation, as well as the outlook to determine what our level of buybacks are going to be. So we're going to continue to look at this, and we're well aware of the question based on what you said among others. Vasant M. Prabhu: The only thing I would add, Carlo, is that you shouldn't forget we returned $190 million back in the first quarter and, given what we've said about our quarterly dividend and our quarterly special dividend, that is a pretty reliable amount of cash you're going to get back each quarter this year, and it's a nontrivial amount and we still have flexibility to deploy more cash in terms of returning it to shareholders through buybacks, and so we have $600 million in authorization. So again, 1 or 2 quarters don't tell you what the long-term game plan is in terms of returning cash to shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So since announcing your disposition strategy early last year, you sold about $500 million of real estate in about a year. Would you be surprised to do less than that in the year ahead? And then just second part of this question is kind of should we read your recent actions suggesting that as you sell your hotels, you prefer to use that capital to pay special dividends than buying back stocks, kind of assuming your stock price appreciates in a reasonable fashion? Frits D. van Paasschen : Yes. So in answer to your first question around -- and obviously, we knew that people would do something like what you just did, which is, gosh, if you're going to sell $4 billion -- or $3 billion over 4 years, that means $750 million a year. The first year, you're at $500 million, you're behind. And, of course, I think we were pretty clear that we were going to be subject to what the marketing conditions look like and whether we could find both the right owners to work with and the right agreements to manage our hotels on their behalf. The good news, I think, is and this isn't to speculate that we'd sell more, although I think the indications would suggest that, is that we have more hotels on the market now than we've had at in any time since the crisis, and that's in response to what we see to be a deeper and broader market in terms of hotel asset sales, as Vasant referred to, as well as strong performance of our properties. So the likelihood is, if that situation persists for 12 months, that we would sell more than we did over the last 12 months, but do please keep in mind that there were couple ifs in that statement. In terms of preference for special dividend versus buyback, I think, again, we're going to keep recalibrating how we want to return cash to shareholders depending on the situation as we see it. I think what we've been very clear about is the fact that we do intend to use all 3 levers, a consistent dividend, a special dividend and a buyback, as we see fit at any given moment. So -- and Vasant, you may want to add something. Vasant M. Prabhu: I think what we've done is we've tried to create maximum flexibility both for us and you, our shareholders. We have maximum flexibility because we have all 3 avenues. We have said that we have a very healthy regular dividend, one of the best yields in our sector. We now have a special dividend that is quarterly, that gives us a structure that can be continued if it makes sense. And we've said that we will consider continuing it as a way to return cash from asset sales or other sources. And we have the ability to do buybacks at whatever level we want. So that gives us a lot of flexibility and it gives you, our shareholders, a lot of flexibility, too because you get a significant amount back in cash that you can deploy based on your own assessments, as well as when we do buybacks, you get reductions in share counts. So I think what you should view our approach as being -- as one that offers flexibility. Maybe it doesn't give you the quarterly predictability that some of you might want. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs. Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just -- I'm sorry to ask 2 questions. But North America systemwide REVPAR grew 7.1%, but the owned portfolio grew 5.5%. Could you just give us a little bit of color on that, why there's that discrepancy? And then just from a strategic perspective, you just noted that the buyers of assets in the market is very deep, getting deeper, it sounds very strong there, but you also said that you may want to buy your own stock at a different point because there could be volatility in the broader global environment. Is your view that the buyers of hotels would have a different view than you? So what I'm saying is, if the market or the economy were to decline significantly over the next 2 years, wouldn't those same people who were going to buy a hotel also be hesitant? That's where I'm having trouble understanding the 2 strategies at the same time. Vasant M. Prabhu: I'll take the first one on your North American owned hotels. Our owned hotels, as you know, is a fairly small portfolio right now. I think we're down to less than 20 hotels in North America, if I remember right. There's a heavy skew towards Canada. There's a skew towards New York. And so when you throw that in, you can see why they would underperform, the country as a whole, given what the first quarter was like in the North. So I don't think our North American owned hotels are representative anymore of what the country, as a whole, is doing and it's purely geographic. On your second question, I'm not sure I fully understood what you were getting at. Clearly, our view is the long-term opportunities in our business are very attractive and we remain very bullish. We are returning $800 million roughly back to shareholders this year, which is effectively committed and reliable and you can count on it, and that cash is available to our shareholders to -- if they want to redeploy it back into our stock, which, of course, we think is a good investment. In terms of buybacks, we have an authorization, and we will use it whether that is in one particular quarter or not, that depends on circumstances. I don't think it says anything about our long-term views of the business. I don't know. I'm not exactly sure, Steve, if there was something I was missing, but I don't know, Frits, do you want to add? Frits D. van Paasschen : Yes, I might try to clarify both. First of all, with respect to the first question, our owned REVPAR is -- now reflects a handful of properties versus several hundred that are otherwise in our system. And I think you would understand that in some quarters, that would shift one way or the other. In fact, that's been the case for some time as you've been watching our company. With respect to the second part, I didn't say the market was very deep, so let's just be really clear again. I said that the market is deeper and broader than it has been for some time and we have more assets on the market than we have before. And I think you're trying to play games with words in terms of the rest of your question. I think what you mean is are we somehow missing the point that if we can't sell our hotels for great prices, our stock will be lower. The reality is we're going to sell hotels when we have partners and when we have situations where that makes sense, and we've been very clear about that over time. We've also been very clear about the fact that we'll continue to look at where our stock is trading relative to value as we look at buybacks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker from MLV. Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division : Just a question I had with regards to the Aloft Tucson transaction, I guess, any implications from it. It looked like, and correct me if I'm wrong or maybe provide a little detail, that you guys incurred about a $36 million write-down in the first quarter. How much of that was associated with that Aloft in Tucson? And obviously, you guys sold it for $19 million, so I'm wondering if there was a substantial write-down with regards to the cost you incurred for the acquisition and then redevelopment of that asset. And then are there any implications with regards to the write-down of the costs that it might take to convert one of these assets that might be limiting your Aloft growth across the U.S.? Obviously, you guys are still only around 80 hotels now 10 years after the inception of the brand in 2005. Vasant M. Prabhu: Yes. No, I think there's a lot of misconceptions in that question. And if there are those out there, it's good that we have the opportunity to answer that. The impairment was not related strictly to the Aloft. There was a small impairment on that particular asset, but that's because of historical considerations. That was a very old hotel that was on that location that went back to days prior to the current version of Starwood. As you know, Starwood originated as a hotel REIT. There were some assets that predated the acquisition of ITT Sheraton. There were a variety of step-ups along the way, so there were book values that went back awhile. We did spend money to convert it to an Aloft. If you look at the ROI on the conversion and what the realistic sort of market value of the land was and all that, we got a good return. The impairments were other things, including a transaction that is close to completion where we're converting a leased hotel to a long-term management contract, which we hope will get done in the next week or 2, and we can tell you more about it on our next call, and then a couple of other things. So it was not linked to that particular sale. Alofts are doing well. We have a good pipeline of Alofts around the world, and in the U.S., they continue to increase their REVPAR index. And if you speak to owners, I think you'll get a very positive response from them. Frits D. van Paasschen : Yes, this is Frits, I'm just going to add a couple of things to what Vasant said to reinforce the point. The first is that both with the Tucson redevelopment, as well as the San Francisco Airport redevelopment for Aloft, we did that to be able to prove the case and understand for ourselves what the economics would be to make substantial conversions like those 2 projects were. And if we look at both of those projects as though we were a real estate investor, we would have been happy with the return that we got there, which was in fact the point of doing the project. The second piece is, just to be clear, the Aloft brand first opened its doors, I want to say 5 years ago, not 10. And to get to 80 hotels in 5 years and to be on track to get to 100 hotels in the next year or so, I think it would be a short list of hotel brands that have been launched in the last decade that in their first 6 or 7 years of operation would have gone to 100 properties with a worldwide footprint. And as Vasant said, in terms of REVPAR index, the ramping up of the pipeline and then the performance of the brand, we're actually quite happy with how it's doing. Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Vasant, you gave us some good color on the strength of the corporate and group bookings. I was wondering if you could give us some more detail on rate there. What are you seeing for this year and next year, and I are you seeing an increased appetite for spending on F&B. And also, if I may just weigh in on the capital allocation subject here, I think the other side of the question that investors have is, and have it for us a lot is, what are you doing with the other balance sheet? I mean, it's clearly not additive to value, so folks are definitely wondering why you're not being more aggressive there. Vasant M. Prabhu: Yes, in terms of corporate business, obviously, in the U.S., for sure, and generally around the globe, corporate transient is a huge bright spot. I mean, we've said for a long time that our business is driven very much by the global corporations, and global corporations are doing very well and that is evident in their spending. Overall, rates are in the mid-single-digits in some of these corporate negotiated rates. Certainly, corporate groups are the healthiest of all the group business. Corporate group business does tend to be booked with shorter lead times, but the trends are all very strong, and not just in the U.S., they're strong in Europe and they're strong in Asia, so it's a global phenomenon. In general, we see no change in that trend. And if you look across segments we've talked about, we tend to be high-end, and so we get a lot from professional services, very strong, and these would be the consulting/accounting firms, high-tech, very strong. Pharmaceutical is doing okay. Finance is okay. But overall, in terms of F&B, yes, there continues to be a desire on parts of corporate accounts to manage F&B spending, but it's not a significant issue. So net-net, it's all plus. The second question was, I missed that one. We'll move to the next one. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Greff from JPMorgan. Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Before I ask my question, I just want to make a comment. Frits, you said twice that you believe that your share price underperformance is a function of geography in emerging markets. I would say it's the lack of capital return in the form of buyback that's caused underperformance relative to other stocks, and we're hearing it from investors. You guys should hear that and be appreciative of that. And you've talked about your capital allocation. I guess, my question on the capital allocation from here and incremental discussion on special dividend is, when you think about special dividends, do you think about spreading out each special dividend, much like what you announced a couple of month ago, or would you look at it as more onetime in nature? Vasant M. Prabhu: I think in terms of special dividends, by creating a quarterly structure, we give ourselves the flexibility to either adjust the quarterly dividend, but we're not averse to doing onetime special dividends, too, if it makes sense. As you know, we did that when we did the Host transaction. We returned, I think, $2.8 billion to you in the form of stock, as well as some cash as a special dividend. Again, you shouldn't suggest -- you shouldn't see special dividends as our only approach to returning cash. We do believe in buybacks. We do believe that reducing our share count is a valuable thing to do, so we will calibrate between the 2 and we're not wedded to special dividends per se as the only way to return cash to shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from David Loeb from Baird. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : My first question, and then I'll give you the follow-up. We've been hearing that you had been marketing a group of 6 North American hotels. Are you also marketing a large number of international hotels? You did mention that you were marketing hotels in Asia and Europe. We've only heard about one larger asset in Asia. And then as a follow-up to Ryan's question, Lightstone actually reported an 8.8% to 2014 expected cap rate on that Aloft Tucson transaction. Do you think that valuation reflects the brand, or is it more related to the market? Vasant M. Prabhu: On the second one, it's -- there are different ways in which people can look at this, and it reflects potentially the market. It's Tucson, it's not a major market. In terms of your first question... Frits D. van Paasschen : David, it's our practice not to comment on anything, rumors in the market related to transactions, one way or another. When we get to the point when we're ready to talk to you about something, we'll let you know. Vasant M. Prabhu: Yes, but the fact is, as I said in my comments, we have assets on the market in Asia. We have assets on the market in Europe, and not individual assets, but multiple assets -- not single assets, but multiple assets. And yes, we have a lot of hotels that are in the market in the U.S. But again, I mean, there are all kinds of rumors out there. There've been various press reports. It's not our practice to comment on individual things, but we will announce these sales as they happen. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So just -- I'm going to avoid the obvious question on capital returns. But I actually wanted to turn to something else. Frits, last quarter, you talked some about technology and in the last month or so, the topic of Airbnb has become one that -- we've actually gotten a number of kind of longer-term investor questions about. So I'd like to turn the question over to you and get your thoughts on how disruptive do you think a technology like Airbnb is to the hotel industry? And kind of what segments of your business do you think that you could see an impact from a technology like this, whereas other segments that you think might be a lot more protected? Frits D. van Paasschen : Yes. Look, I think that the growth in Airbnb is a real phenomenon. I think the perspective that anything that reflects on more healthy demand for travel and encouraging people to get out, just like discount airlines as well, is generally a good thing for travel, not the other way around. The reality is that our focus in terms of technology is on the loyalty of the guests that we've been talking about for a while. And as you get to the high end and as you get to people who want to be taken care of when they travel, that's the segment that we compete in, and that's the one that continues to grow around the world. I do think there will continue to be disruptive technologies in different ways that people both buy and deliver lodging. But in some respects, if you go back 10 years to the rise of the OTAs and how I think there was a great deal of concern or question about whether that was going to disrupt the industry, OTAs, to us, are a very steady single-digit percentage of our revenue overall systemwide. What's really growing for us is our own Web and mobile channels. And when it comes to technology, our ability to know what people's preferences are, to be able to make our hotels more able to deliver on those preferences, and to give people offers that are targeted to their behavior and what they've expressed, either through their behavior or by telling us, I think are some incredible opportunities for companies like ourselves to leverage technology to deliver better experiences to our brand. So net-net, I see technology as increasing the opportunity for our business. And if you look at the travel intensity of the world today and the growth in travel, I think that's the most important driver. If the only thing that were happening in the world were the expansion of Airbnb, you might be concerned, but it's happening concurrent with a whole bunch of other things, many of which I think are extraordinarily favorable to our business model. Operator : Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Great. I wanted to ask about the pace of management fees through the year, because it looks like in Q1, it was helped by termination fees. And so first of all, I guess I wanted to ask if that was in your guidance when you gave it. And then -- and it didn't raise your full year guidance. Your full year guidance is unchanged. But excluding the termination fees, your other management incentive fee growth was kind of below that 10% to 12% guided range. So I'm wondering if you could just comment on sort of how you see the pace of that in the rest of the year? Vasant M. Prabhu: Robin, we, in fact, anticipated that. It was not entirely certain, but we knew that it was likely in the first quarter, which is why our first quarter, I think, guidance range for fee growth was in the 10% to 12%, whereas, our full year range was 8% to 10%. So it was not a surprise. It does reflect what happened in the first quarter. Our full year range is still 8% to 10%. Our second quarter range is also 8% to 10%, and that is the rate that we see as one that's sustainable, and you're right about your question. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose from Evercore. Smedes Rose - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Frits, in your opening remarks, you said you, for now, wanted to play it safe. And I just wanted to ask you, is that kind of pertain to the kind of balance sheet that I think most people would argue as kind of underlevered, here with low debt and high cash balance, or is it more a comment on reinvesting in the hotel business now through a brand acquisition or things that you've maybe done in the past. Just wanted a little more clarity on that. Frits D. van Paasschen : Yes, yes. Good question, thank you, Steve. I think the reality is this, that over the long term, and I think this is something that we've been trying to emphasize now for some time as we talk about our business. Over the long term, we see extraordinary continued growth in demand for high-end travel in the particular for our brands. Quarter-to-quarter, as sentiment among investors and travelers changes, we see a great deal more volatility. And so what we've said all along is that we want to be aggressive in investing in technology and investing in building a platform by which we build loyalty among high-end travelers and also customers that -- for whom many of those high-end travelers work. Where we want to play it safe are on areas like maintaining a cost structure so that if the world turns upside down we don't have costs that we need to go back and cut in a significant way. We've talked about playing it safe more specifically as it relates to our balance sheet. And then, I think the question about investing back into the hotel business, if by that you mean investing in hotels, I think, again, over the long term our strategy is pretty clearly stated, is that we want to become asset lighter and have 80% of our earnings driven by fees. At the same time, and I think again, we've been pretty clear about this for the last few quarters, we have invested in our existing properties in a pretty significant way, believing that as the world improves and as the asset sale market improves, having hotels that are in good shape that don't have, as people say, any significant hair on them, makes them more sellable and easier to sell to a broader pool of buyers, and we've certainly been willing to invest in that direction. In terms of investing, though, in the fee part of the business, most of that's going into demand creation in the form of building out the attractiveness of SPG and in making sure that we can be better at tracking and delivering on people's preferences and make our brands, brands that resonate with people with a solid, distinct and compelling positioning. So a bit of a multi-faceted answer, though, to a question, I think, that was pretty sweeping. Vasant M. Prabhu: Yes, I think there's no holding back on investment in terms of future growth. So our infrastructure spending in the growth parts of the world like Africa and the Middle East and like Asia continues at double-digit levels. You've seen us invest quite heavily in our technology platform that Frits referred to, which is creating new capabilities that we think create a lot of value for our guests. We've definitely invested whatever we need to, to create the pipeline, which is very healthy, especially in international markets. So as Frits said, where we play it safe is in places where there isn't a lot of growth. We've, in fact, scaled back where we can on our infrastructure in the, let's call it, the mature markets, but there's absolutely no holding back on investment in where we see long-term growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Varin from Citi. Kevin Varin : Can you just comment on the investor demand for international hotels specifically? What does the buyer pool look like? Vasant M. Prabhu: Well, it's specific to the nature of our hotels. So as you know, in Europe, a lot of our hotels would fall into what you might call one-of-a-kind trophy-type hotels. The buyer for those hotels is typically not an institutional buyer. It tends to be a private ultra-high-net-worth buyer, so that's what you would see in Europe. In Asia, certainly, there's a lot of money in certain parts of Asia. So even though our hotel may be in Australia, for example, the money would come from outside Australia for deployment into Australia. Certainly, in the U.S. the buyer base is institutional. And what we're seeing in the U.S., as we said on our last call is for the past several years, we were only able to sell hotels in ones and twos because the primary buyer was public REITs who would buy a hotel, issue some stock and then come back for another hotel. What we're seeing now, of course, is much more private equity money and, therefore, a greater interest in portfolio sales. So we would be more interested in now looking at portfolio sales to private equity or other institutional buyers in the U.S. So it varies by region. Frits D. van Paasschen : Yes. I think just to amplify on that, in terms of international demand, the 2 big geographic pools of money would be the Middle East and then the other would be China, although I would say broadly speaking, not just PRC China, but ethnic Chinese in other markets throughout Asia. And aside from that, you do have some sovereign wealth money, although we haven't seen a lot of that in discussions around asset sales. And then, of course, as Vasant mentioned, you do see some firms throughout markets outside of the U.S. but not as many as you would in the U.S., certainly. Operator : Your next question comes from Joel Simkins from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : You spoke a little bit earlier about Europe and what you're seeing there. It seems like gradual, albeit a bit modest improvement. I guess, what would sort of change your -- or would you sort of see that improve from these levels? And then as you look at sort of the recovery in Europe right now, what's sort of the composition between business versus leisure at this point? Frits D. van Paasschen : Yes. So as you know, Joel, our business worldwide is 70% to 75% B2B. And so clearly, sort of corporate confidence is really important to us. Europe is slightly different in that we have a number of destination hotels, particularly in Italy, but also across France, Spain, U.K. and so forth. And so some of the outbound demand among affluent leisure travelers is important for Europe as well. So in that respect and, of course, the summer will tell us a lot more. A particularly strong market for us right now is London. But things do vary a bit quarter-to-quarter. And I guess, the real question is whether we -- what would it take for us to see a real bounce back in Europe. I'm not sure that that's even something that we would plan on in terms of the overall economy. I think what we can hope for is steady improvement in local European demand for European properties, and then the continued growth in inbound travel from North America, Latin America, Middle East and Asia, so -- and I think that would be the real driver of demand, particularly given the destination properties we have in the gateway cities across the region. Operator : Your next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Just going back to the pool of buyers for some of your European assets. How many swimmers do you see in the shallow end of the pool if, in fact, there aren't that many folks seeking those kinds of assets, and really, has it changed over the last 12 months? And then the second question is really more of a comment. Again, it's -- you guys are among the best managers in the lodging industry that we know. What do you see out there that we don't see that causes this divide between our perception that you ought to be using your under-levered balance sheet, particularly during periods of time when your stock does get lower? In the first quarter, the stock got down to 73. What are you seeing that makes you more nervous than us? Vasant M. Prabhu: I think in terms of buyers, on the second question, there's nothing we're seeing that makes us more nervous than you, and I think you're interpreting too much into some of this, and perhaps overstating the case. But we get it. We understand where some investors are coming from on this topic. But in terms of buyers, our European hotel base has always been of a trophy variety, so if you go back in time, you'll see what we've done. The buyer base has changed over time, so in the last cycle, we sold the hotels, like the Danieli, that was an Italian buyer. We sold Danbury, that was a Middle Eastern buyer. We sold a couple hotels on Lido island in Venice, that was also an Italian buyer. Today, we would say that the base of buyers for our Italian hotels tends to be more from outside Europe. It's Middle Eastern, generally, in origin. So it varies. It varies on where money is being deployed. And yes, it's always been fewer buyers than large pools, and these are not auctioned largely -- these are not big auctions. These are very selective -- we think of them very much like collectibles that you would find at a Christie's [ph]. So we're not too surprised by the fact that these would be a small buyer base. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla from FBR. Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division : Just a very simple question here on the group distribution in your portfolio. If you could just remind us how much of that is in the U.S., what it looks like internationally, that would be great? Vasant M. Prabhu: In terms of group business, it tends to be more in the U.S. The U.S. may be 1/3, group; 2/3, non-group and non-U.S. is probably more like 1/4 group and 75% nongroup. So clearly, group is more important in the U.S. and U.S. group also tends to have longer lead times. Stephen Pettibone : Thanks, Frits and Vasant. I want to thank all of you for joining us today and for our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest in Starwood Hotels & Resorts.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I will now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Pettibone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Stephen Pettibone : Thank you Sylvia, and thanks to all of you for dialing into Starwood\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Frits van Paasschen, our CEO and President. Before we begin I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Starwood\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures discussed in today\u2019s call on our website at www.starwoodhotels.com. With that I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Frits for his comments. Frits van Paasschen : Thank you Stephen and welcome everybody to our Q2 earnings call. I\u2019ll cover three topics today in my prepared remarks. First, a review of our business performance around the world. This includes a look at our results for the quarter and our outlook for both Q3 and the rest of 2014. My second topic will be to outline our philosophy and approach to capital allocation. And then third, I\u2019ll close with some comments about our new Chief Information Officer, Martha Poulter and how his joining us reflects our ongoing efforts to use technology to give our guests better experiences and to give our hotel owners better returns. So turning now to my first topic, the results in the quarter. We delivered EBITDA of $324 million and EPS of $0.77 per share, both above our expectations. Worldwide REVPAR grew 5.3%. Management fees were up nearly 7% and franchise fees up almost 11%. Margins at company operated hotels were up 87 basis points. These results, along with what we are seeing across our business today show recovery that\u2019s continuing steadily into its fifth year. In fact, this is the first time in four years that we come into the summer months without the global economy showing even the signs of a wobble. Put in other way, we are seeing extension of the business trends that were in place at the end of the first quarter. For the next few minutes I\u2019ll give you a quick look around the world with some color on their business. Starting first with North America, REVPAR grew over 6% and occupancies were at a record 78%. That\u2019s up over 170 basis points from last year and you might recall that last year in the second quarter we also reported record occupancy. Rates across North America at constant exchange rates increased nearly 4%. As you may know the quarter saw the U.S dollar gain against the Canadian dollar versus last year. In fact REVPAR in Canada was up 6% in local currency but down 1.2% in U.S. dollars. Our results are very much in line with the state of the U.S economy. Fundamentals remain solid with unemployment down to 6%. However as the Fed noted recently there is still a lot of slack in the job market and while the economy is good, growth isn\u2019t robust which brings me to my point, the lodging sector is hitting record occupancy but the U.S. economy overall is showing no signs of overheating. This is very good news for us. It means that in this cycle we could enjoy full hotels and rising rates for some time before the rest of the economy catches up with lodging in terms of capital \u2013 capacity utilization. This challenge is what we are seeing right now. Corporate profitability is high and consumer confidence is back where it was in early 2008, both of which bode well for increased demand for high end travel. Of course in any one quarter results will vary across a market as large as North America and as it happens REVPAR growth was slower, 4.4% in our North region where we have a relatively larger concentration of business. Chicago was flat and DC was up less than 3%. REVPAR in New York was up nearly 5% in the face of new supply. But even in the North we did see a few bright spots with double digit REVPAR growth in Boston and Baltimore. Hawaii was another region under some another pressure where REVPAR at our hotels was close to flat. Inbound tourism from Japan was slow as a result of the weaker yen and a rise in taxes there. We also saw higher air fares from the Mainland U.S. although in the past few weeks those fares have begun to drop which could lead to improved performance later in the year. The real strength in this quarter was in the south and the west where REVPAR was up close to 9% with standout performance in markets like Dallas, Houston and South Florida. In total, our U.S. REVPAR growth was just below the STR national average for luxury and upper upscale. This is almost entirely a function of what I mentioned a moment ago namely a concentration of our footprint in markets which for this quarter at least were bit slower. A more granular look at our business tells us a better story. Year-to-date REVPAR index at our hotels in North America is up which means hotel by hotel on average our properties are outgrowing their direct competitors. Group business at our owned and managed hotels also outgrew the market in each for the three months of the quarter. Our group revenue in North America was up in the mid-single digit and our sales team did a great job with bookings in the year for the year up double digits from last year. Earlier this year we saw higher cancellations and adjustments primarily in the association segment. Still even with that group pace for 2014 is up mid-single digits. On the transient side bookings from business travelers remained strong and with high occupancies we\u2019ve been able to mix our lower rate of business. Looking ahead to Q3 and the rest of the year we expect trends in North America to remain positive. Supply growth in both luxury and upper upscale remains low which means we should be able to drive rate increases as demand grows. In aggregate we expect REVPAR North America be towards the upper end of our guidance range of 5% to 7%. Moving on and a look around the world, Latin America saw trends in Q1 extend into the second quarter with the REVPAR up nearly 5%. Momentum in Central America and Mexico was a highlight. The Mexican economy continues to expand and we saw particular strength at our resorts thanks to higher occupancy spilling over from the U.S. As a result REVPAR was up 13%. In Brazil, the World Cup of course was a real tailwind for our hotels pushing REVPAR up 25% and as an aside it\u2019s always good to have the winning team staying in one of your hotels. And from what I heard the victory party at the Sheraton Rio was one for the record books. But on a more serious note the sluggish trends from Q1 were still with us. World cup aside in Brazil as well as Argentina and Chile demand still struggles. Excluding Brazil for example we saw REVPAR decline across South America and in total across Latin America, REVPAR ex-Brazil was up 1%. As we move into Q3, we expect more of the same. Brazil will be helped by the final weeks of the World Cup but after that will revert to Q1 levels. Strength in Mexico may taper a bit as we move into the summer months in out of the high season. Overall for Latin America we expect REVPAR to be towards the low end of our range if not somewhat lower. In Europe, overall sentiment continues to improve. Leading indicators suggest that the modest recovery will continue. This is good news on top of occupancies in Europe that remains strong, up 130 basis points to 73%. Our European REVPAR was up about 2% and highlights for the region include Italy and Spain. REVPAR in Greece was up over 28% but at the other end growth in the UK was slow, transient trends continue to be soft as they were in Q1 and Germany faced tough comps where we left some significant trade fair business. But the biggest dark cloud looming over Europe today is the situation in Ukraine. But despite conditions there and the impact of U.S. sanctions on business in Russia the quarter in Europe ended in line with our expectations. If the situation in Ukraine and tensions in Russia do not escalate we expect that REVPAR growth in Europe will improve for the second half of the year. And behind this outlook is a robust calendar of events in UK and France and some good backlog in Germany and Greece. Before turning to Africa and the Middle East I should also add we were hopeful that the transaction market for hotels on the continent will continue to improve. Investor interest is building interest rates have been low for a while and there is signs of lending activities increasing. REVPAR was down 1% in Africa and Middle East. Once again behind this average is a wide range of performance across markets. In the Gulf States Abu Dhabi and Qatar saw REVPAR up over 17%. By contrast REVPAR in perennially strong Dubai was down slightly, thanks to some renovations and new supply, particularly on the [pod]. In Saudi Arabia REVPAR was flat held back by visa restrictions and concerns about the coronavirus, also business in Mecca was brought down by expansion works around the holy mosque. As that construction is completed likely next year business in the kingdom should improve. REVPAR to hotels in Egypt was down nearly 20% as we lapped a recovery that began in the first half of 2013 before being cut short in Q3. As we get into Q3 and Q4 we will start seeing easier comps there. Bad news from Nigeria in the form of kidnappings and terrorist attacks pulled down REVPAR for hotels by over 20%. The headlines in Egypt and Nigeria should not draw your attention away from the trend line that we have been observing for some time across Africa. Growth is wide spread across countries and encouragingly is being reflected by entrepreneurship and expansion of SMEs, that small and medium enterprises. Our performance in South Africa for example is up 6% and maybe a better reflection of those trend lines. As we look across Africa and the Middle East we experience performance in Q3 and the remainder of the year to improve driven by momentum in Middle-East as well as those easier comps in Egypt. Moving on to China, REVPAR growth was strong once again in the quarter, up 11%. Like in Q1 that growth was skewed by the ramp of the Sheraton Macau as it entered the same-store set. But even without Macau China REVPAR was up 6%. Across China, demand is not just holding up but growing as the occupancy at our hotels excluding Macau increased year-on-year by over 5.5 percentage points and it now stands at 60%. Driving our performance is the strength of the Starwood system in China; our sales team, call centers, web channels, royalty program, brand recognition, not to mention strong hotel operation. So once again our hotels outpaced their competitors and despite a pullback in government business we are seeing overall business pick up strongly. The health of the Chinese travel markets is also evident in the strength of the outbound travel. China reported second quarter GBP growth of 7.5% backed by government stimulus, strong consumer demand and sustained urbanization. As we step back we see China as a complex picture one that includes stories of newly built ghost cities but with rising occupancies at our hotels nationally. In other words from what we are seeing in this picture, hotels are not experiencing the same over capacity as residential or office real estate. China is not only complex but large with a range of performance across regions. Our hotels in the south and east did especially well. The Shanghai in particular seeing double-digit REVPAR growth, thanks to slightly easier comps following last year\u2019s bird flu scare. The north was flat, while the west and central regions saw growth of nearly 4%. Looking ahead to Q3 we expect business trends in China to stay at or above the high end of our range. You should keep in mind that the Sheraton Macau tailwind will taper during the second half of the year. In Asia, outside of China REVPAR was up nearly 3%. Bright spots include Indonesia which is booming with REVPAR up nearly 19%. Other strong markets are Malaysia and South Korea. Australia also did well and for us is showing strong footprint growth thanks largely to inflows of Chinese capital. By contrast business in Indo-China was off held back by unrest in Thailand. REVPAR there was down 12%. As of now there is a return to calm following the coup but travel restrictions are still in place and will take some time before business will rebound. Also in Indo-China Vietnam\u2019s territorial dispute with China didn\u2019t help business there with REVPAR down 4%. India has also been soft for a while. REVPAR this quarter was down over 4%. Like many of you, we followed the elections that concluded in May. We hope that the enthusiasm around the Modi administration is justified and will bring about much needed economic change. So far we are encouraged by the government\u2019s focus on promoting tourism as a part of the economic development plan. Overall as we look at Asia outside of China, trends in many markets are healthy especially on top of strong comps last year. Taking out Thailand and India, REVPAR in the region was up over 6%. Looking ahead we expect REVPAR in China, excuse me in Asia outside of China to continue growing in the low single digits. So that concludes our trip around the world. Rolling it all up we are maintaining our worldwide annual REVPAR growth range at 5% to 7% and for our owned hotels we are holding our range at 4% to 6%. Against the backdrop of our REVPAR outlook I want to address our base line for fee growth. You should note that the outlook of 2% to 4% in Q3 reflects some lumpiness in revenues not a change in trend. In this case we are lapping a large termination payment from last year. If you exclude that payment fees would be up about 7% to 9%. Importantly for the full year we are staying with our guidance range for fee growth of 8% to 11%. In terms of footprint growth during the quarter we opened 19 hotels adding 3,800 rooms to the system. You should note that our openings this year are weighted towards the second half of the year and we remain on track to open more hotels in 2014 than last year. Hotel exits have been slightly ahead of expectations but you can conclude from our fee discussion those are largely lower performing, lower fee paying hotels. Also significantly owner confidence is reflected in our signing 45 agreements for new hotels in the quarter. That brings our total for the first half of 2014 to 73 which is well ahead of last year. (Inaudible) activity is good in most regions of the world. Most noteworthy is the pickup in Europe sparked by conversions from other brands. I should remind you that the quality of our pipeline remains strong about 60% in luxury and upper upscale, about 80% managed and over 80% outside the U.S. The quality of our signings in recent years is also reflected in the high percentage of deals that are coming to fruition. We keep close track of our hotels that are coming on stream and when I look at the deals we signed since 2010 a very high percentage of those are either open or on track to open. Turning now to vacation ownership, I am happy to tell you that SVO performed well this quarter, offsetting slightly lower tour flows with better closing efficiency and higher pricing. Operating results at the resorts were also strong. Our vacation ownership team in our view is the best in the business. This shows not only in our pricing, in our margins but also in our repeat buys from our existing owners and in guest satisfaction. On the financing side of the business our careful screening and the improving economy has held defaults to all time lows. SVO\u2019s business model today is a health mix of earnings from sales of intervals and financing plus recurring fees and resort income they make up about 30% of EBITDA. Over the past few years we brought down inventory levels and focused on higher returns sources of future business, especially Orlando, Mexico and Hawaii. The work we did to convert The Westin St. John to vacation ownership is playing out well and we are seeing good sales volume for that new product. This quarter brought us another milestone as well. As of June 6, we brought the St. Regis Bal Harbor residential project to a close with the sale of the final unit. It\u2019s been a long adventure and we are happy to declare success and put it behind us. Looking ahead we expect Q3 EBITDA for SVO and residential to be about $35 million to $40 million and $160 million to $170 million for the full year. So I will wrap up my first topic with a quick look at SG&A which for the quarter was up 16%. This is an example of how SG&A in any one quarter can bounce around. You might remember on our last call we said that in Q2 we will be lapping $7 million in state tax incentives thanks to the move of our headquarters to Stanford. This year in Q3 and in coming years we will see benefits of $3 million to $4 million related to tax incentives. This past quarter we also incurred a few other one-time items and timing differences. So to be sure we are keeping a tight focus on cost while investing in the growth areas of our business. We still see our full year SG&A growth in the range of 3% to 5%. And that brings me to my second topic, in the wake of our previous calls and in subsequent meetings with many of you I want to layout our approach to capital allocation, including leverage, stock buybacks and dividends. In the words of one investor, Starwood has done the hard part winning in the marketplace. Now you need to do the easy part telling investors what you plan to do with our balance sheet. And we agreed that executing a plan for capital allocation is easier than leading an organization of couple of hundred 1,000 people spread across about 100 countries. But managing the capital structure of any company is one of management\u2019s most important responsibilities and we recognize that it may be impossible to have a balance sheet that pleases all of our shareholders. The approach I\u2019m about to describe represents our best view to the interest of our long term shareholders. Let me start by reminding you that we have a long term track record of returning cash to shareholders. Over the past 10 years we have returned on average $1 billion a year though dividends and share repurchases. And as we said in 2014 we intend to return about $1.35 billion. This includes our regular and special dividends along with our current share repurchase authorization which we expect to utilize fully this year. Most importantly from the start of Q2 to July 22 we repurchased 2.5 million shares for a total of $198 million. Year-to-date we have returned $578 million to shareholders through regular dividend or special dividend and our share repurchases. Our approach to capital allocation follows directly from our world view. We see this is an extraordinary time to be in the high-end travel business and we believe there will be secular growth in demand for our brands fueled by rising wealth and an increasingly interconnected world. And by secular we mean that in our view these growth drivers look set to be in place for the next couple of decades. But at the same time we need to ready for an unpredictable disruptions in demand as with 9/11 or the financial crisis. Our world view holds that both unprecedented growth and a volatile world can coexist. A point of fact during the last six years we have seen both a doubling of our luxury hotel base and the worst recession in our lifetimes. Let me emphasize again that our approach to capital allocation aims to balance investing in our business, maintaining flexibility and returning cash to our shareholders. Our approach reflects that we believe that it is in the best interest of our business and our long term owners. Investing in our business includes building capabilities to support our fee business, working with our partners to expand our footprint of hotels, renovating owned hotels and looking at possible acquisitions. And it\u2019s likely that these investments will not use all of our available cash. Moreover we expect to have substantial cash proceeds from assets sales as we work towards our goal of having fees drive 80% of our EBITDA. Still in a volatile world, we want to retain financial flexibility and ensure that we have dry powder during tough times. As such our target leverage is based on staying investment grade even in the wake of a major downturn. This will enable us to take advantage of investment opportunities or to buyback our stock, neither of which we were able to do during the financial crisis. This thinking underlines how we determine our target leverage. We began by modeling by what would have happened to our business in along its three lines in the event of a major downturn. We then estimated the level of debt that would still allow us to retain an investment grade rating. Bear in mind that the rating agencies make adjustments in calculating leverage, including operating leases and securitize receivables from vacation ownership. The agencies also exclude cash in our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve reported our total cash of around $650 million includes about $500 million in offshore cash. With these adjustments rating agencies that cover us would put our leverage at about 1.8 times. Without these adjustments our book leverage is 0.6 times. The next step is to estimate our rating agency leverage that we could reach today, while protecting our investment grade leverage in the event of a downturn. Based on current economic conditions and with our current mix of businesses we believe that ratio is in the range somewhere at or above 2.5 times but less than three times. This is the ratio that we continuously reassess for example as market conditions change and as the cycle move forward. Also as we approach of our goal of having 80% of our earnings driven by fees our target leverage could increase as our earnings become less susceptible to a downturn. For now in any case we have about three quarters of return of EBITDA or about $750 million of capacity to add leverage just to get to the low end of this range. As I mentioned a few minutes ago we intend to return about $1.35 billion to shareholders in 2014 through our special and regular dividend as well as completing the $460 million remaining in our repurchase authorization. This will bring our leverage in to the mid twos by the end of the year and of course it excludes cash from our any further hotel sales later this year. Looking ahead we intend to maintain our target leverage to a balanced approach. We plan to return available excess cash to shareholders in four ways. The first two are through regular quarterly dividend and systematic share repurchases. We see these as our evergreen year-in, year-out ways to return cash. As in the past, we intend to pay a regular dividend based on the target payout ratio. As you know we switched to a quarterly payout this year. Our payout ratio for 2014 will be nearly 50%. On a go forward basis we intend to maintain a target of between 30% and 50% which is a slight increase over the 25% to 40% range we last talked about in our first quarter 2012 earnings call. As we said than we wanted dividend to be predictable, sustainable, competitive and one that will grow overtime with earnings. We\u2019ve also started a systematic annual program to repurchase shares to offset at a minimum the annual dilution of stock based compensation. In 2014, that amounts to roughly $85 million and just to be clear the $85 million this year is baked into the $614 million in repurchase we intend to complete. Beyond regular dividends and systematic repurchases we also have two discretionary ways to return cash. First we can step up of the pace of share repurchases especially if we are below our target leverage and if we see a pullback in the markets or disparities in value relative to our peers. Second, annually we can consider special dividends. Special dividends would be most likely tied to assets sales as with our Bal Harbor proceeds. So in summary, we believe our capital allocation strategy is in the best interest of our business and our long term shareholders. It reflects the cyclical nature of the lodging industry and gives us the flexibility to be more aggressive in investing to grow our business throughout the entire cycle. I hope this gives you a better understanding of how we expect to manage our balance sheet and we will happy to answer any of your questions on this important topic during the Q&A period. Before turning to some additions we are seeing at leadership team, I want to spend just a moment to speak to the status of our assets sales. This topic goes hand in hand with capital allocation and I would like to give you an update on markets conditions and progress to-date. The transaction markets for hotels has continued to improve and we are seeing more interest in our properties. That interest however continues to be for single asset transactions at least as we see it today, the appetite for portfolio sales at strong prices and on acceptable terms is not there. So keeping with our asset like strategy we continue to look at selling individual hotels balancing price, long term agreements and commitments to invest in the property. The good news is that we are finding buyers that meet our criteria and we are in advanced discussion on a number of deals. Although of course nothing is certain until it\u2019s done, we feel optimistic that we will be able to announce a meaningful transaction in the second half of the year and early next year. Until then I can\u2019t be more specific but you should not be misled by the fact that we did not announce any significant sales in this past quarter, we remain very focused on our asset light strategy. So before wrapping up I would like to take a few minutes to talk about some changes in our senior leadership team. First I am happy to tell you that Martha Poulter has joined us as a Chief Information Officer in June, as you know, she is \u2013 we are transforming the way technology is \u2013 using technology to transform the way we meet guest expectations and build loyalty is a key foundation to our strategy and to build the strength of our fee business. Martha brings to us deep experience in leading and managing complex global IT organizations and her work at GE Capital, which had a broad span across areas like IT infrastructure, digital, mobile data security and other areas gives us the perfect background to drive Starwood technology strategy forward. And our innovative no-nonsense approach is exactly what we are looking for to lead our IT and digital efforts. We are delighted to welcome her to our team. Lastly, I know you are all interested in an update on our CFO search. As you might expect we have seen a high level of interest from many qualified candidates. We are working with (Contrary) to move the search forward and we are making good progress and we will let you know as soon as we have some concrete news, but you should rest assured we are working as quickly as possible while making sure we have an exceptional person for the job and so with that, I will hand the call back to Steven Stephen Pettibone : Thank you Frits, we would now like to open the call to your questions. In the interest of time and fairness please limit yourself to one question at a time and then we will take any follow-up questions you might have as time permits, Sophia can we have the first question please. Operator : Your first question comes from Ryan Meliker from MLV and Company Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC : Hey, good morning guys, I just wanted to kind follow-up on what Frits just mentioned with regards to portfolio sales and how we should expect things going forward with that, with this positions, we had heard that you guys had $1 billion portfolio in the market. Given that comments you made just now have you guys not received the offers, you are comfortable with on the portfolio, as you have looked at disposing, are you finding higher values in single assets and then, are you seeing the buyer pool particularly in Europe and Latin America expand from where it was six months ago? Frits van Paasschen : Yeah, Ryan so I will take that. First of all, I think it\u2019s pretty clear to most of you who look at our portfolio of hotels that just geographically and not \u2013 if not in terms of their location and their brands, they are not a consistent set of hotels that would optimally appeal to any one single buyer. And while we have explored the possibility in an geographic area like the Americas to sell a portfolio what we are finding and we believe is that it will get better prices with owners that we want to work renovations and so forth by pursuing individual sales and so while we might be able to get to markets more quickly if we did a single portfolio sale, we would rather do this right and take a little bit more time and sell hotels individually in the way that we think is best fit for our long term fee business and for our brands. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hey good morning guys. Just in terms of U.S. REVPAR seems like some of the higher tier segments specially the light three segments have been lagging the broader acceleration, U.S. REVPAR and kind of second quarter. Some thoughts that we have heard is that potentially that because of markets like New York being a larger percentage of the luxury mix and then other POYs just saying that\u2019s kind of logical trend given that where we are in the kind of in the recovery. Do you have any thoughts I mean given your concentration in kind of the higher segments? Thanks. Frits van Paasschen : Yeah Tom actually I think both the reasons that you cited are fairly complete in terms of making the distinction. So certainly earlier in this recovery we saw a much more significant bounce back and higher growth rate as you moved up markets to luxury and upper upscale and so forth and so clearly at some point in the cycle, some of the growth in REVPAR and occupancies is going to percolate down to other segments of the market and then I think as you also right pointed out, decent part of our business geographically is skewed to the North East or at least the North and Hawaii where growth was a bit slower and in particular in New York where more suppliers come on stream. So, I think those are the two explanations and as I said in the text, on balance as we look at our individual hotels in aggregate there are gaining in REVPAR index which would suggest that those hotels on a year-on-year basis are gaining share. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey good morning guys, I just want to return the capital returns discussion so first of all just to crystal clear about what you said. So the 85 million kind of systematic buybacks would be the number that you definitely will do each and every year to kind of offset dilution but any buybacks above that number would be kind of opportunistic based on a stock price or how should we just to clarify that? Frits van Paasschen : Yeah Shaun I will try to clarify that for you as much as I can, I think you got it mostly right but again just to state it. So what we have said is that on a programmatic basis which means independent of where we are trading, we would anticipate buying back shares to offset dilution for management compensation for this year that amounts to $85 million in rough numbers. In another year that number may move around. So I would fix as much on the $85 million as on the dilution offset, but I think the 85 gives you a good baseline for approximately how much that will be. Clearly as we work towards getting to our asset light goal and selling the $2.5 billion or so in assets that we still have in order to be able to do that, we\u2019ll generate more cash in that and then what we will do at that point is on a continuous basis assess the volume of share repurchases and then as we get to the end of the year, depending on asset sales and how much excess cash we may elect at that point to do a special dividend but we will be focusing on those two to continue to move ourselves into the range of our target leverage. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, Frits given what you just said about the REVPAR trends to Tom\u2019s questions about how things are rolling out in the second quarter should we then assume that your REVPAR growth will be lower than the overall industry over the balance of this cycle, it almost implies that but how you responded to that last question? Frits van Paasschen : I wished I had a crystal ball that could help me predict whether we are going to outgrow the industry overall out in the future years. I don\u2019t imagine that New York and Hawaii for example are necessarily going to underperform the rest of the Americas geography first of all. Second of all, I think that we can continue to build rate among our hotels and if that means that we can accelerate a big stronger than we wouldn\u2019t underperform the industry either. And then finally and I think most significantly because so many people who watch and write about our stock are based in New York, they tend to have a view of the world from the U.S. but as you look at the performance of our business around the rest of the world, our REVPAR continues to do quite well and routinely out performs our competitors. So, if you add all those things up, I think it\u2019s hard to stay on balance one way or the other, whether we are going to outperform the industry on a look forward basis for the rest of the cycle. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays Capital. Unidentified Analyst : Hi it\u2019s actually Anthony Paul here for Felicia, how are you? Frits van Paasschen : Hi Anthony. Unidentified Analyst : So see a lot of your passion for growth brand this quarter on both a REVPAR and unit growth standpoint, how big can the brand get eventually over time and do you see opportunity to add additional upscale brands or to grow your current brand even faster? Frits van Paasschen : Yeah, great question. So clearly where we are the smaller player in our industry is in what the North America called Select Serve or the other three or four star segment around the world, depending on where you are. And we think particularly a lot has \u2013 many of the characteristics against that segment that we saw in W a decade or decade and half ago, which brings \u2013 which in another words means we bring a fresh way of experiencing our hotel design language, color schemes the way that our associates deal with our guest, a focus on easy use of technology and a casual way of assembling in the living room or the lobby of the hotel. So all that I think is by way of saying that we think we have a brand and a [loft] that could make real inroads into a segment where we are small players. So and we have many hundreds fewer Select Serve hotels than some of our competitors and therefore we think it\u2019s plenty of opportunity to grow. I would add to that there are couple of other things and I am going to relate to the other brands that we have in our segment. Four Points by Sheraton continues to be in many corridors our second biggest brands in terms of signings and new hotels and particularly given the strength of Sheraton in so many markets outside of North America drafts off the strength of Sheraton as well as the strength that we have by having a position and an establish base of operations in so many markets. And then finally Element which today is a very small brand of ours, but one which we are seeing in terms of guest satisfaction ramp up and Performance is one that we think has tremendous growth potential as well. So as we get into a cycle where there is more new construction, more construction lending, we feel like this is an opportunity for us to accelerate growth in the segment. So we do see that as a trend that could continue. Stephen Pettibone : I think the other part was would we add another upscale brand? Frits van Paasschen : Yes and so in terms of the way we look at our portfolio of brands today, clearly with and I will go back to something that we talked about a few times in years past with the acquisition of Le M\u00e9ridien we clearly can add brands to our portfolio and our platform and have very good results by doing that. The idea of launching and building brands de novo which I know is happening with some frequency across the industry is something that we see as a pretty challenging thing to do. And getting a brand from zero to critical mass requires a considerable amount of investment and our own belief is that given the fact that we have at least eight brands and by that I mean I am excluding Sheraton, we have at least eight brands that have significant growth just in reaching global scale, we should be investing in growing those brands and if you were an owner of a hotel carrying one of our brands you would probably want us to be focused on growing the brands that you have already invested in not in turning our attention somewhere else. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura Securities Co.: Hi Frits I\u2019ve just actually got a clarification and then a question, going back to your I guess detailed and maybe a bit convoluted discussion of the capital allocation, is the bottom line that you are \u2013 that unlike maybe the $2 billion to $3 billion of capacity that some folks have thought that you have on your balance sheet to be more aggressive with share repurchase that you really think that\u2019s closer to $750 million. And then my question is if you could walk us through the Group outlook for the balance of this year and in to next year relative to the pacing and positioning that Starwood had in the U.S. in the first half of this year? Frits van Paasschen : Yeah Harry thank you and it was certainly my intent to have a description of our capital allocation process, an approach which was hopefully not going to be characterizes as convoluted so I will attempt to do better next time, but just by way of clarification, yeah I think that the notion that there was $2 billion to $3 billion in available leverage on our balance sheet today without any other changes is rooted in the distinction between a book definition of leverage in ones that the rating agencies uses and the pretty significant adjustments the $2-3 billion number is over stated. Just to get to low end of the range that we described would get to you about $750 million but the range went up in terms of the target from there a bit. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that 750 is the maximum but I would certainly suggest to you that the $2 billion to $3 billion is probably not based on a thorough look at the balance sheet or at least an interpretation of our available leverage such as we see it. So I hope that\u2019s a little less convoluted I am going to hand it Stephen now for a discussion of your group question. Stephen Pettibone : Yes, so if we look at our pace we are in mid-single digits. In the quarter we saw very, very good in the year for the year bookings, little bit less for 2015, but we still see sort of low mid-single digits for 2015 as well. Yeah I think what happened was we saw higher volumes of cancellations and some loss associated with some of the associations business earlier on the year and so that accounts for sort of what I call the steady as she goes pace we have been seeing as we look ahead. Frits van Paasschen : Yeah, the only thing I would add to that I think just from the productivity of our sales team is we have been investing in some sales tools to enable our associates from more locations and with greater flexibility not only access what inventory is available, at which prices but also start to be able to target more effectively customers based on what we know about their past history or their inquiries and other things and so, we have worked to be able to enable our associates to be more productive and some of that I think is borne out in India for the work that we have been able to achieve. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose from Evercore. Smedes Rose \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Thanks I wanted to ask about group as well which you just kind of answered but specifically you mentioned the couple of times that you saw some elevated cancellations particularly from association meetings. Was that specific to one or two groups or some cities or maybe you can just give us some more color there, what was kind of behind that? Frits van Paasschen : No, I think it was earlier on the year. They have subsided as we went forward and I can\u2019t point to a specific hotel or a group but I think the trends at this point going forward seem a little bit more steady. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Hi, good morning just a bit of a conceptual question here. I have noticed recently number of your competitor have started adding back share based compensation in order to calculate adjusted EBITDA and I noticed that you were somewhat unique in that you don\u2019t do it. I am wondering why you don\u2019t because I noticed on the Street that most, in giving competitors price target valuations do include this as total EBITDA and I would imagine if you did you would probably get several dollars of bump up in share price target, just curious why you don\u2019t do that? Frits van Paasschen : Yeah Patrick I guess, in my point of view at least in how the marketplace see us, I think moves like that are pretty transparent. I mean we all know that EBITDA is not a GAAP number and therefore people who look at stocks and company valuations carefully take account of what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out and you know it struck us not a substantive change to make in terms of the strategic direction of the company or for that matter transparency to our investor base. So there is other things I think we want to spend our energy on in terms of making sure that our shareholders and investors are seeing how our business is performing Stephen I don\u2019t know if you want to add something to that. Stephen Pettibone : Yeah, we\u2019ve always viewed this stock based compensation as an economic cost of business that we would reflect in EBITDA adjusted EBITDA. Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla from FBR. Nikhil Bhalla \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hi good morning Frits. Just if you can update us on your booking pace for 2015 as it\u2019s striking now and if there is a way to compare that to what that look like for 2014 at the same time last year. Frits van Paasschen : Yeah so Nikhil, so I am going to pass you over to Stephen. I am not sure exactly what we usually give out on that but\u2026 Stephen Pettibone : Yeah, I mean honestly for us in the past several years our pace has been sort of consistently in that mid-single digits range, hasn\u2019t fluctuated all that much up or down, so I think that\u2019s the best I can give you right now. Frits van Paasschen : Yeah, as you know, the group business overall is a more significant percentage of our North American business and around the world typically what\u2019s often called the mice business, meetings incentive, the conventions and exhibition is a bit lower and so it\u2019s a leading indicator but it doesn\u2019t give us as much insight into the future performance to the business as it even would in North America. So often times our best benchmark of the future health of demand and bookings for our hotels your direct conversations with our core customers recognizing that since we are 70% or 75% B2B depending on the month and our key customers are a big percentage of that and the feedback that we get consistently from professional services firms, tech companies, other global companies is that they are continuing to send their people out in search of growth in new markets and planning on travelling more as they look ahead. So that\u2019s probably the best leading indicator to our business although obviously not one that\u2019s got direct number attached to it. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Joseph Greff from JPMorgan. Joseph Greff \u2013 JPMorgan: Good morning everybody. Frits you mentioned earlier about the CFO search, maybe if you can talk about how your thoughts are evolving there in terms of exactly what you are looking for there and then if you can talk about the timing and then a follow-up looking at the 2Q if you were to look at U.S. only so within North America the U.S. only what\u2019s owned REVPAR growth what\u2019s system wide REVPAR growth? Thank you. Frits van Paasschen : Yes, so I will shift to Stephen in a minute to get back to you on your REVPAR question but I talked a bit about our CFO search in the past and you know from my view I believe that this is a company and in my own leadership style a management team where having a strong CFO who has a seat at the table not just as the head of the financial function but as a great mind leading the strategy of the company and asking and answering in many cases the difficult questions you know the special things I think about our business are an understanding of a global business in the way that we interact with our partners, most of whom are local in the markets where we operate and understanding of brands and where to invest in those brands over time because clearly there are financial versus brand tradeoffs you can make in the short term but I believe in the long term investing in brands is the best financial return. Clearly even though we are moving towards an asset light strategy and appreciation for real estate and asset sales is important although of course our real estate function is led by Simon Turner who leads development for us. Clearly someone can continue to move our agenda forward in capital allocation would be a strong benefit and I think in addition to all of those things, someone who is executive style and personality fits with the team and the culture that we built as I alluded to in the call, we have a number of very exciting candidates who are interested in this role and so we are hoping to bring this to a conclusion. But we will announce that more specifically when we have the name and someone entering the company that we can celebrate. Stephen Pettibone : Yeah, and in U.S. REVPAR growth was for the system wide was 6.3. If I look at owned it was let\u2019s say in U.S. dollars you see North America I think was 1.5 it\u2019s about 2.7 I believe it was for the owned set in the U.S. So next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo Securities. Jeff Donnelly \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Good morning guys, Frits your capital allocation plan seems to get more weight than I would have expected as a repeat of an economic crisis that we probably going to experience twice in the past century, and the impact of such a downturn is probably less as real estate ownership declined in [seed] contribution growth. So, is it fair to say your plan is to look maybe from an additional rating upgrade from current levels and separately as the follow up can you talk about what\u2019s specific figure of closed dollar volume of assets you currently have actively in the market for sale? Frits van Paasschen : Yes, so the answer to your first question, you are right in one sense, you know those two events were once in a century occurrences the second matter they also happened within a decade of each other. So, I suppose in many respects your or our view of the world happens to be at least shaped by considering whether it just happens that those two events were unusual and happened in the last decade or whether the world itself is more vulnerable place and I think that from our perspective as I tried to outline in the call, we see at the same time an extraordinarily long term growth opportunity for our business and the potential for a great deal of volatility. And you know like I said I think about the notion that we were describing as conservative and in a sense it is but in another sense it\u2019s also aggressive and what I mean by that is that if you expect that the world is going to be volatile and you have the capacity to invest throughout the cycle over time you will logically create more value for your shareholders then pushing yourself to the edge of having to struggle if the market turns down. In terms of whether that implies for the rating upgrade the description of our capital allocation approach is largely one now of ourselves pushing towards higher leverage then where we are and I think based on the feedback as I alluded to in the script from many of you that\u2019s something that is an interest and so in actual fact I think that you will see us increase our leverage based on the capital allocation approach that I was talking about and then as our business becomes more oriented towards these and therefore less vulnerable to a downturn, our ability to sustain more leverage should we choose do that, or to increase. The second part of your question related to the dollar volume of assets for sale, I will touch on that and then hand off to Steven for some additional commentary. I should just say that\u2019s not a number that we put out as such and you know partially because it may sound like an easy number to put out but the insight of view end to this that we are testing the market, in terms of selling assets on a continuous basis and there are hotels where we know there is a natural buyer or a natural segment of buyers and we are in private conversations to see whether for example, we can get a price that is as attractive as an open market sale, without the distraction potentially in the cost of a transaction like that. So it\u2019s very hard for us to give you a point estimate of how many assets we have for sale but what we said qualitatively last quarter and repeated this quarter is that we have more hotels on the market now than we had in a considerable length of time and while we didn\u2019t announce any sales in the quarter we are in advanced discussions on a few and I think our behavior over the last 10 years where we sold 128 hotels in the last since 2012 we have sold about $1 billion in assets at about 15 times EBITDA multiple, in many cases with very attractive contracts and with renovations to those properties that were \u2013 they were very effective in terms of supporting our brands and driving even better performance to those properties. So, the process of selling hotels is unfortunately the one you only see when there is a sale to announce, but I can assure you that we have been trying to do that in as many ways as we can be clear, it\u2019s something we are working hard on doing, with that I am going to hand it over to Steven. Stephen Pettibone : Yeah, I think I will just one thing that the target range that we are talking about 2.5 but no more than three I think allows us to maintain the ratings that we have now and but were we flex much about that, I think we would risk being taken down a little bit so. I think with that we will go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley \u2013 UBS: Great thanks just two clarifications of comments that you made earlier, Frits you mentioned the second half in China would be softer than the first half, is that just the Macau property kind of anniversarying the ramp up or is that a comment about the market in China overall excluding Macau and then the other clarification Steven it sounded like you made a comment about group bookings for 2015 being a little less and I was just wasn\u2019t sure what that meant in terms of little less in volume in the quarter versus what came in last quarter or just how you meant that? Thanks. Frits van Paasschen : Yeah, Robin so this is Frits. I will address the China question since you directed it to me. The slowdown in REVPAR for what we call greater China would be at least as we see it now almost entirely a function of the Sheraton Macau now becoming fully part of the same-store set having ramped up. Aside from that business trends for the rest of the year in other markets looked to very similar to what we have seen so far. And with that Steven I will hand it. Stephen Pettibone : Yeah Robin I was more referring to the fact that bookings that we saw in the quarter we are skewing much more to the in the year for the year. So it\u2019s more of a skew than it was a comment on overall volumes. So with that next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Kevin (inaudible) with Michael. Just given the potential slowness of assets selling assets on individual basis, what are you slots on spinoff at this point in order to accelerate the asset light strategy and also make sure that you don\u2019t miss selling an attractive point in the cycle. Frits van Paasschen : Yeah Michael, so this is Frits, we have looked at REIT spinoffs and I think the answer to that question on a certain level is I would never say never because conditions may be different. But a few things to bear in mind. First of all, there are plenty of REITs in the U.S. market today and I would argue many of them are at scales that are smaller than their shoulders might benefit from. That\u2019s just an outside person\u2019s comment. But what I think it means more broadly is it\u2019s not clear that the worlds needs another hotel REIT, first of all. Second of all if we were to spend a REIT we would have to have the SG&A structure that would go along with it, which would pull down some of the value. You would have whatever the IPO discount might be associated with the spin. And then finally although these numbers are always a little bit hard to validate but at least it looks right now like most REITS in North America are trading at a discount to net asset value. And so if you add up all of those things to your point if our objective function here were to sell a lot of assets fast, then we could move quickly to do that and that might one vehicle. If our objective here is to place each hotel with the right owner that we want with a contract, with a renovation and many of the other things we will continue to proceed accordingly. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James and Associates. William Crow \u2013 Raymond James and Associates : Good morning guys. Kind of a two part question here. First of all, you talked about the asset sales likely to be in kind of one-off methodology as supposed to large portfolio. Does that still allow you to get to asset light by 2016 as you previously communicated? And then the second part of that is, I guess we are now quarter three where the Street has reacted sharply negative to capital return to shareholders et cetera and it went kind of in a free fall with the convoluted and I\u2019ll use that term because that might be the nicest one discussion of the buybacks and so \u2013 do you think it\u2019s just an issue where maybe over years and years the Street has for some reason been communicated that, that was the primary driver of this company was this asset light return of capital and so has that process kind of misrepresented the longer term goal that you Frits as a CEO? Frits van Paasschen : Well yeah, I mean again I\u2019m not sure quite how to react to convoluted, but if that\u2019s the word, that\u2019s the word, I think the more important thing is the substance of it. And I think it could not have been more clear in terms of our endeavor to add some leverage to the company from where we are today for reconciling some of the considerations in terms of how much available debt there is. I think we have also been crystal clear in terms of our focus on being asset light, getting the 80% fee driven by 2016, that over the time period from where we first made a projection around that, that would be about 3 billion in asset sales. We are not on pace for that right now but we never said, we were going to be on pace on a year-on-year basis, and it was very hard to predict when we made that projection whether there would be a large portfolio sale or not. And I can\u2019t still tell you with absolute certainty that between now and 2016 that there won\u2019t be a larger asset sale. So as we sell hotels and as we get more cash on to the balance sheet in the absence of acquisitions or other places to invest in our business this is a capital return story and I think that that\u2019s \u2013 that should be as clear now as it ever was. Stephen Pettibone : We got time for one more question, Sophia. Operator : Your final question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche. Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hey guys thanks for taking my question. Just a quick two part question. First piece is if you guys could just summarize maybe with all the talk around capital allocation, how, from your 1Q call at the end of April to today would you define how your capital allocation thinking and/or strategy has changed? Frits van Paasschen : That was part one, okay. So yeah well Carlo, look I think what was what we tried to describe in some detail over the course of the script here and what I said was that we had an approach to looking what our target debt would be. We had ability to lay out what that difference is with where we are today and a path towards getting to that target debt level. And my sense was that less clear a quarter ago so what we laid out here, I think is more clarity around what the capital allocation process and thinking is and our approach for getting there. So to the extent that helps from our last quarter all the better. Stephen Pettibone : Thanks Frits. I want to thank you all for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest in Starwood Hotels & Resorts. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to us. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s Starwood Hotels & Resorts Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Robin Farley - UBS Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Joel Simkins - Credit Suisse Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Starwood Hotels & Resorts' third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Pettibone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Stephen Pettibone : Thank you, Sylvia, and thanks to all of you for dialing into Starwood's third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today is Frits van Paasschen, our CEO and President; and Thomas Mangas, our CFO and Executive Vice President. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.

You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call on our website at www.starwoodhotels.com. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Frits for his comments. Frits van Paasschen : Thank you, Stephen, and greetings to all of you from Italy. We're calling your from the beautiful St. Regis and Westin hotels here in Florence, where we're holding a meeting of our top-100 leaders from around the world. Following our usual format, I'm going to cover four main topics today. First, an overview of our Q3 business performance and the global business environment. Second, our outlook for the rest of the year as well as our initial thoughts on 2015. Third, I'll walk you through how we're working to deliver more value to our hotel owners, guests and corporate customers. I'll finish my remarks with a few thoughts on our upcoming relocation to India for the month of March. Following my remarks, I'm delighted to say that I can hand the mike over to our new CFO, Tom Mangas, who joined us in September. As many of you know, we were looking for someone who has deep understanding of global brands, is operationally savvy, and has hands on experience as a public company CFO. We also wanted someone with the energy and personality, both to roll up their sleeves with hotel operators and to step back and think about our strategic direction. With his 20 years at P&G, along with his time at Armstrong Building Products as CFO, and most recently CEO of their largest division, in Tom we found someone who checked all the boxes. I'll leave it Tom to introduce himself further and to share his initial thoughts on Starwood. He'll also take you through the latest on our capital structure as well as a little more detail on our outlook. Now, I'll turn to my first topic, our performance. On a summary level, the key trend lines that we saw in the first half of year continued through Q3. Rising global wealth, unprecedented growth in travel infrastructure and a more interconnected business world are driving long-term demand for high-end travel. As such, was bullish as ever about the growth of our business over the long-term. Despite that, we also maintain that the world has become a more volatile place over the last decade. That volatility has dialed up in recent weeks in the form of Europe's double or even triple-dip recession, the rise of ISIS, unrest in Ukraine, and fears about Ebola. So in the face of both long-term growth prospects and short-term volatility, our strategy remains the same. We continue to invest in growing our business, strengthening our business model and in ensuring our P&L and balance sheet are resilient. In that context, we're pleased with our Q3 results. EBITDA came in at $289 million and EPS at $0.66, both were ahead of expectations. RevPAR globally was above the high-end of our range, up almost 7.5% in local currency. Here is how business played out around the world. Global RevPAR was led by North America, up over 9%. Occupancy was 78%, our sixth straight quarter of record levels. With full hotels, we were able to drive rates up nearly 6%. North America saw double-digit RevPAR growth in the south and the west, and growth was above 8% in the north. Our properties in Hawaii were the one slow spot, pulled down by a drop in tourism from Japan, the results of a weaker yen and higher consumption tax there. RevPAR in Hawaii was up less than 1%, and taking out Hawaii, North America was up close to 10%. RevPAR growth in Latin America was 6%. Behind that number is still the 2-tier growth pattern we've seen for a while. South America continues to struggle. RevPAR was down in Argentina and Chile. Brazil was stronger, but only thanks to the final weeks of the World Cup. By contrast, Central America did well, and Mexico was the real standout with RevPAR up nearly 20%, driven by both resort and urban locations. Europe had a solid Q3 with RevPAR up 6%. Greece, Turkey and Spain remained strong and business in France and Germany picked up. Business is off in Russia and Ukraine, but between the two countries we only have seven hotels. Our outbound travel from Russia to Western Europe was also down, but we were able to make up for the drop in business with new business from North America and the Middle East. This is a good example of our ability to move quickly to a market change with the sales and marketing levers at our disposal. Looking to Africa and the Middle East, RevPAR was up almost 5%. Performance in the Middle East was in line with the past few quarters with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, all performing well. Dubai was flat, as that market has seen quite a bit of new hotel capacity. Egypt was the bright spot in Africa. It's only because of last year's unrest. Excluding Egypt, Africa overall was down. As you might expect, Ebola played a role in Nigeria with RevPAR at our hotels there down over 25%. Moving on to China, RevPAR was up nearly 9%. As in the first half of the year, this growth was helped by the ramp up of the Sheraton Macau. Excluding Macau, China was up over 6% with occupancy up over 6 percentage points. At nearly 64% occupancy is close to an all-time high for us there. East China and Hainan RevPAR was up double-digits, while the north was a bit soft. In Asia, outside of China, RevPAR was flat. We were happy to see business pick up in India with RevPAR up almost 6%. But for a variety of reasons, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Japan were all soft. Of these countries, Thailand is our largest market with 21 hotels and the situation there is improving. So this concludes my look around the world and brings me to my second topic, a view of what lies ahead in Q4 and into 2015. Based on what we're seeing now, we expect worldwide RevPAR growth of 3% to 5% in the fourth quarter. That would put EBITDA between $310 million and $320 million and EPS between $0.73 to $0.77 a share. We'll follow our usual approach and give you a more detailed look at 2015 in February, when we report our results for Q4 and the full year 2014. Normally at this point, we share our initial view on next year's RevPAR growth, which we currently see coming in at the range of 4% to 6%. Tom will go into more detail on our guidance for the rest of the year and add some additional thoughts on 2015, and he will share more color on our balance sheet and return of cash. I'll just note that as promised, we have indeed moved quickly towards our target leverage. More specifically, we repurchased $815 million in stock in Q3. As for asset sales, you'll see we announced the sale of the St. Regis Rome last week for a \u20ac110 million. The terms of the transaction are consistent with the goals we've been talking about for a while. We sold the hotel for a trophy price to a buyer, who we feel confident will a great partner with us for the long haul. The sale includes a long-term management agreement and the buyer has agreed to undertake a major renovation. On the heels of that sale, I can tell you that we feel confident that a number of key transactions are also moving forward. But let me remind you, it's our practice to resist the temptation to comment on specific transactions until they're closed. What I am willing to say right now is that we're working hard to give you more news before the end of the year. Before turning to my third topic, I'd like to say a few words on development and footprint growth. This year, as you can see net rooms growth is coming in at around 2%, which is below the 4% to 5% range that we said at our Investor Day last year in Dubai. And frankly, it's a bit lower than we anticipated for this year. You should know, that looking ahead, we're working to bring our net rooms growth back into our target range. Part of the drop is a function of longer development lead times in a few markets, especially China. As you've just heard, our hotels are performing well in China, but as our development pipeline has shifted to large mixed use developments in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, these projects are taking longer to build. Also, while the numbers are small, we are seeing financial issues among some developers. At the same time, in North America, our pipeline mix has shifted to Specialty Select hotels, which have about half the room count of our overall average. The good news is that Aloft is taking off. The brand has 15% more rooms than a year ago, and we're on track to get to 100 Aloft by yearend 2015. We also have 13 Element properties and another 12 slated to open in the next 24 months. Similarly, our Luxury footprint is growing well and those hotels have on average fewer rooms as well. Overall, Luxury net rooms growth is over 5% for this year. That includes notable St. Regis openings in Moscow and Venice. Next year, we're also scheduled to open an additional four St. Regis Hotels. So by the end of 2015, we'll have over 175 hotels across our three Luxury brands. That said, more than 100 properties in less than 10 years. The upper-upscale categories, where growth has been slower for the entire industry, and especially across North America and Europe, despite that both Westin and Le M\u00e9ridien have grown between 3% to 4%. Sheraton's net rooms growth is lower, as we've continued to prune the brand's North American portfolio. And also I should add that we would rather, the hotels that aren't performing well and can't be renovated, that they exit the system rather then go to a bucket brand. So in summary, global lodging growth has shifted from emerging markets to the U.S. and from upper upscale to mid market, and both have been a bit of a headwind for us. But it's also important to emphasize that owner appetite for our brands is not only strong, but growing. Based on a number of hotels we signed in 2013, that's last year, we project that year will be our most productive ever in terms of organic new hotel signings. In fact, 2013 looks to deliver 20% more new hotels than our previous peak signing year, and our signing so far in 2014 are nearly 20% ahead of 2013. Beyond organic growth of our nine brands, we're also exploring creative ways to expand our reach and give SPG members access to more experiences and better high-end hotels. For example, we recently completed a transaction with Design Hotels, a company in which we took a position two years ago. We're working closely with Design Hotels' leadership to explore ways to put the power of Starwood behind this collection of over 280 hotels. With an average rate above $300, these are independent, unique, and as the name implies, design-led properties. In other words, just the kinds of experiences that SPG members are looking for. Design Hotels gives us a platform to explore how we can create value for independent hotels that appeal to SPG members, but they don't fit our current nine brands. We see this platform opening up a new avenue for growth spreads as we explore opportunities along these lines. So to close off the discussion on footprint growth, I want to add that our pipeline has increased to 470 hotels and this number doesn't include the 280 Design Hotels that I just mentioned. So this brings me to my fourth topic. Creating great experiences for our guests and customers lies at the heart of our strategy, as is creating value for hotel owners, and you may have noticed the headlines around the SPG app in the Apple Watch launch. Now, the idea that your watch could open your room may seem futuristic, but it's a future that's not all that far off. The mobile, keyless check-in that we first launched at the Aloft in Cupertino and Harlem have been a great success. Starting next month, we're rolling out keyless check-in at other Aloft and W's around the world. But that's just one innovation that happens to have caught the headlines. We have a lot more going on with innovations that are strengthening our system as they expand the capabilities of our digital platform. Here's an example of how the tech is helping our hotel teams around the world providing more personalized service to our guest. This past summer, associates across our system have used an app that we have created to catalog over 80 distinct features of our 350,000 rooms. With that standardized global database, just a couple of weeks ago, we launched a program we call SPG Preferences on our web channels. SPG Preferences allows guest to personalize each stay, based on options that are available at our hotels. We have added profile options tailored to each guest's SPG level. This gives more choices for elite members. And at the same time we've given every SPG guest, who books with us a common way to tell us what they're looking for in that stay. Importantly, it gives SPG members a simple reliable way to tell us their unique needs for a specific trip. And it makes it easier for our hotels to deliver experiences that builds greater loyalty. We're also leveraging SPG with our B2B customers. On October 15, we revamped our B2B customer loyalty program with a new offering called SPG Pro. This marks a major sales milestone for us. We're using our technology platform to bring SPG to our customers. It's built on the simple idea that travelers favorite loyalty program is also a favorite among travel professionals and meeting planners. We replaced several legacy programs, so that under SPG Pro our customers can earn Starpoints and elite status through bookings made with Starwood. The program will help us grow our business as we recognize and serve our most valuable customers better in their own property. At the same time our technology platform affords our sellers a clear view into a B2B customers booking history, so they can provide customers with personalize offers. The same platform can generate automated tailored offers with a much higher conversion rate. So before handing the call over to Tom, I want spend a few minutes on our upcoming month-long world headquarters' relocation to India. This is our third such relocation after China in 2011 and the United Arab Emirates in 2013. As a leadership team and as a company, we get real value out of these experiences. We gain insight into what's happening in markets that are at once far removed and yet increasingly connected to New York. We spend extended time with our local partners and we know that nurturing those relationships translates into new business and more hotels. So, why India and why now? Simply put, we see this as an exceptional time to relocate to India. First, outside of North America, India is already our second-largest country market after China. In fact, we have about the same number of hotels in India as we did in China eight years ago. Second, energy and optimism has swept across India since the election of Prime Minster Modi. One of our parameters of business confidence in any market is the local appetite for keeping their money in country. And based on my recent visit to India, it was clear that our partners have this view there. Third, global trend lines of rising world and global connectivity are playing out as dramatically in India as anywhere else. Alongside, India's base in technology and business services, we're seeing a rise in both entrepreneurship and investment. This is propelling millions of people into the ranks of India's middle class every year and driving demands for travel infrastructure. Finally, India's famously or maybe better said, infamously challenging as a place to do business; all the more reason for us to get close to our leadership team there and see what they need. As a reminder, our legacy in South Asia goes all the way back to the Sheraton, Mumbai, which opened in 1973. Our partnership with the ITC started in 1975 with the Sheraton, Chennai. Nearly 40 years later, we're still together with the ITC. Today we have with them 10 Luxury Collection hotels and two Sheratons. Along with our new Westins, Sheratons, Le M\u00e9ridiens and Alofts, we have a total of 9,000 high-end rooms in India, that makes us the largest high-end global player in India by far, and in fact, only one India-based company is larger. And at latest count, we have another 36 hotels under development. So we are already in a great position, and I'm sure we're going to build on that strength in 2015. That concludes my prepared remarks. And so with that I could not be more pleased to hand over the call to Tom. Thomas Mangas : Thank you Frits. Good morning and thank you for joining us on the call. Given this is my first earnings call with Starwood, let me take a few moments to introduce myself and share with you a couple of the reasons why I joined Starwood. Then I will carry on with the balance of the third quarter review and fourth quarter outlook. First, a bit on my background. I am an operations-oriented CFO. My experience includes almost 20 years in a variety of finance and accounting roles at Procter & Gamble, working on brands like Tide, Gillette and Pantene. I was the CFO for P&G's 10-country hub of Turkey, Central Asia and Caucasia, based in Istanbul. Later, I was the divisional CFO of P&G's $17 billion Global Fabric Care business and eventually was the CFO of P&G's $24 billion Beauty and Grooming business. I left P&G at the beginning of 2010 to become the Chief Financial Officer at Armstrong World Industries, a $3 billion commercial and residential building materials company. After four years as a CFO, I was appointed CEO at Armstrong's worldwide flooring products division, which is about half the company's sales. It was from that role, that I was recruited into this role working with Frits. I was attracted to this role for four core reasons. First, I love the brands and properties. As a frequent global traveler, I enjoyed my guest experiences at Starwood's hotels and also really valued my SPG Program benefits. Growing up in the consumer product space, I am really attracted by strong brands and belief in their power to drive disproportionate growth. Second, I believe in the secular trend of a rapidly growing middleclass, who want to travel and stay in great properties, creating significant upside for our company with this tremendous global footprint in some of the most exciting and dynamic growth markets in the world. Having worked on global businesses, in both P&G and Armstrong, I saw this dynamic firsthand and have built a significant experience base, helping to accelerate growth in these markets for my former employers. Net, I wanted to be a part of helping Starwood win in the market and participate in that growth. Third, having studied the asset-light model that this industry and Starwood is pursuing, I came away confident that Starwood have the right underlying business model to really drive sustainable and long-term shareholder value creation. Finally, as I got to know Frits, the team here, and several Board members, I felt I was joining a winning team with a winning culture that has a track record of creating shareholder value. And I felt like, I could help them accelerate their plans to grow total shareholder return ahead of peers in the years to come. Okay, enough about me. Let's turn to the third quarter results. I will then review the actions that company took in the quarter to restructure the balance sheet and reduce the share count. I will conclude with a deeper look at the fourth quarter guidance and briefly touch on our 2015 RevPAR outlook. As Frits discussed, we had a great third quarter of 2014. Worldwide systemwide RevPAR for same-store hotels increased 7.4% in constant dollars or 7.5% in actual dollars compared to the prior year. We enjoyed growth both in average daily rate and occupancy, with rate up 3.4% and occupancy up 280 basis points over 2013. At the brand level, Aloft led our growth with RevPAR up 12.6% in constant dollars. Our luxury brands of St. Regis, Luxury Collection and W all enjoyed 8% to 9% RevPAR growth. Let me spend a few minutes on North America and some of the trends we're seeing there. First, we saw strong group results, with total revenue up in the low-double digits with room nights up high single-digits and rate up mid-single digits. We saw exceptional group book activity in Q3, with group bookings for the quarter up double-digits and bookings made in Q3 for 2015 were up in the high-single digits, as well as very strong group booking activity for all future years. The leisure and corporate transient travel segments were both up in the mid-single-digits. Going into the fourth quarter, transient is shaping up to be strong with the revenue on the books up low-double digits, similar to what we saw in the second and third quarters. North America's group pace was softer as we came into Q4. We're projecting both transient and group growth in the mid-single digits in Europe, consistent with what we have seen year-to-date. Similarly, we expect transient in Asia Pacific to be up mid-single digits, but group will be down low-single digits driven by weaker demand from Thailand and Malaysia. The strong RevPAR growth in Q3 that Frits walked you through translated into good fees and EBITDA performance. Total fees grew 3.2% to $255 million compared to the prior year, in line with our expectations. Core fees, which are fees from our ongoing hotel operations and exclude gains from early termination payments or changes in amortization of prior gains from hotel sales, grew 7.3%, more in line with our reported RevPAR. Within core fees, franchise grew 12.5%. As you know, we have higher than normal termination payments from 2013 associated with the termination of one management agreement that suppressed the third quarter year-over-year comparison. We feel the measure of core fees is a better reflection of our results and helps washout the noise with the occasional non-recurring benefit from breakage of the management or franchise contract. Owned hotels grew RevPAR 7.2% in constant dollars or 7.7% in actual dollars. Looking at same-stores, owned and leased hotel EBITDA grew 12%. Owned margins grew 120 basis points in actual dollars, driven by strong expense management and rate improvement at our properties. North America owned hotel margins drove this result, up 140 basis points. Revenues for owned and leased properties were down 1.3%, but adjusted for the assets we sold in the past year, revenues were up 8.9%. Overall, SG&A for the company decreased 4% to $96 million, due to higher bad debt expense in the prior year and the timing of incentives earned in 2014, in connection with the company's relocation of its corporate headquarters to Connecticut in 2012. Year-to-date, SG&A is up just over 5%, which is more in line with our full year guidance. However, for the full year we are raising our SG&A guidance to 7%, reflecting higher corporate expenses associated with launching some of our key initiatives like the very exciting mobile check-in initiative that Frits described. We believe these kinds of initiatives are leading to growth of our global brands ahead of the markets in which they compete. Now, let me turn to the vacation ownership segment. For the purposes of these remarks, I am excluding the impact of the Bal Harbour residential project, which was sold out earlier in the year. SVO and residential revenues were $159 million in the quarter, flat to prior year, with a lower average price per unit partially offsetting a modest increase in the number of unit sold. EBITDA was essentially flat. For the company, all that rolled up to adjusted EBITDA of $298 million in the quarter, which is slightly above our guidance range. Now, let me turn to the balance sheet and recap the many actions our team have taken to reshape it over the past quarter. First, the board increased our share repurchase authorization by $1.1 billion and we issued bonds totaling $650 million in September in support of our repurchase program. Specifically, we issued $350 million in senior notes due in 2025 at a coupon of 3.75% and $300 million of senior notes due in 2034 at a 4.5% coupon. We also implemented a commercial paper program to give us access to low-cost short-term borrowing, and we extended our revolving credit facility of $1,750 million by two years to 2020. Net, the company has created a well-structured and low-cost debt ladder with a significant portion of fixed long-term debt at very attractive levels. The company repurchased 10.4 million shares or 5.4% of outstanding shares at a total cost of $857 million at an average share price of $82.57. Finally, during the quarter, the company paid the third special dividend associated with sellout of Bal Harbour, worth $0.65 per share, and our regular dividend of $0.35 per share. On top of our repurchases and dividends in the first half of the year, this brings total cash return to shareholders for the first nine months of 2014 to nearly $1.6 billion. We continue to be in the market, repurchasing our stock in the fourth quarter, and expect to declare our fourth $0.65 per share of special dividend payment later this quarter. By yearend, we expect cash return to shareholders to total between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. With these actions and our underlying business performance, we've grown EPS from continuing operations and excluding special items to $0.66 per share in the quarter, slightly ahead of our guidance. Also at the same time, we've made substantial progress in achieving a better capital structure for the company, as measured by our net debt to EBITDA ratio without adjustments to 1.4x. When you make the adjustments, the rating agencies do, we arrive at a ratio more like 2.5x at the end of the quarter. This is at the low end of our new target range of 2.5x to 3x, again on a rating agency basis that we announced at our last earnings call. We continue to make progress on asset sales en route to our goal to have 80% of our EBITDA come from our fee business. As you saw last week, we sold the St. Regis in Rome for approximately \u20ac110 million. I know there are active rumors and press articles about other deals we may be pursuing. As Frits noted, our approach has been only to announce or comment on deals after we close them versus simply signing them. I can't tell you that the team here is committed to deliver the asset-light strategy and are aggressively working plans to sell assets, both an eye to balancing speed and with finding the right owners, and securing long-term value creating management contracts. I am confident you'll see more progress in the coming quarters. Given our continued repurchase and asset sales programs, we expect to close the year at a debt to EBITDA range closer to the high-end of our range on a rating agency basis, with the variability largely driven by our ability to close some additional asset sales in the near term. I am sure many of you are interested in our 2015 plans for cash return, both in size and in form. I'm not ready to speak to that just yet, given I'm only four weeks into this new role. I want to both understand the underlying business better and have a chance to listen to shareholders and speak with our board to understand the perspectives. I will say based on my prior experience, I am comfortable with the current range of 2.5x to 3x leverage, and do believe that as we make progress on the asset-light strategy, which should reduce our cash flow volatility, this range could move higher over the longer term, especially if we were to find attractive hotel businesses to buy and add to our asset-light strategy. Now, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter and our guidance. We are projecting EBITDA to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. This is a reduction versus what we thought was possible in our last full year guidance, driven by materially weaker FX rates, which are impacting our full year EBITDA performance by approximately $10 million. Earnings per share for the quarter are projected to be $0.73 to $0.77 per share. Frits spoke about the challenges facing the travel industry with fears of Ebola, continued conflict in Middle East and a softening of the macroeconomic trends in many priority markets for us like Europe, China and Russia that are reflected in lowering bond yields and a flight to safety in the financial markets. As a result, we are forecasting owned and managed RevPAR to grow 3% to 5% on a constant foreign exchange basis. Actual RevPAR will trail this range by about 200 basis points due to foreign exchange. That said, we expect North America to remain our top performing region in the quarter. However, the Yom Kippur move and a lower group business due to a shift of citywide events in key markets for us from Q4 into the prior third quarter will reduce RevPAR growth this quarter versus last. And as you know, our portfolio continues to be one of the most geographically diverse for our peer group. So we will feel the effects of the near-term FX and tremors of uncertainty more than our peers, just as we expect to disproportionately benefit from a longer-term secular growth expected in those markets. Similarly, we expect worldwide owned hotel RevPAR to be up 3% to 5% on a constant FX basis. We are projecting systemwide fee growth of 7% to 9%, well above our RevPAR guidance, due to a large non-recurring fee we expect to receive in the quarter due to our managed hotel flipping to a franchise agreement. As a result, we expect our core fees to grow 2% to 3%, more in line with our RevPAR expectations and reflective of the stronger dollar this quarter versus last. We are projecting the vacation ownership business to deliver operating income of $40 million to $45 million. With access to financing at attractive rates through our commercial paper program as well as the great performance of our receivable portfolio, we are no longer planning a securitization transaction in 2014. Given our higher debt levels, interest expense will grow to $35 million to $40 million and we expect our effective tax rate to be around 32% in the fourth quarter. Now, let me spend a minute on our current 2015 outlook. We continue to see catalyst for solid hotel fundamentals, including improving employment and better economic growth in the U.S. Frits mentioned, we are anticipating systemwide RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% in constant dollars. This is a slight deceleration versus what we've enjoyed this year and reflects a cautious view of 2015 travel demand outside North America. Going into the quarter, group pace for 2015 in North America was up in the low-single digits. This is something we'll be watching very closely and filling gap strategically to take advantage of transient revenue opportunities in compressed markets. We are making good progress in corporate rate negotiations for 2015, though it's too early to give you a specific range. We will of course provide more details on our 2015 guidance, when we hold our fourth quarter call in February, but keep in mind that we will be lapping nearly $30 million in above-normal non-recurring fees, which we receive from early contract terminations in the 2014 base, including termination fees we anticipate receiving this quarter. Similar to the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect continued headwinds from FX to restrain EBITDA growth in 2015, if current FX rates hold. Finally, we are not projecting any incremental EBITDA growth from Design Hotels in 2015, given that we bought a majority stake in 2012. However, with the completion of the domination agreement, we are now exploring ways to plug these hotels into our SPG capabilities to drive joint value creation to both owners and for Starwood. Thank you for bearing with me, as I had a lot to cover in this call. I want to say again, how pleased I am to be here at Starwood, how confident I am in our fee driven asset-light business model that are supported by best-in-class product, programming, technology and service, all leading to a better guest experience that will drive loyalty and disproportionate returns to our shareholders. With that, I will conclude by saying, I look forward to meeting our shareholders and analysts in the coming months, and will hand it back over to Stephen. Stephen Pettibone : Thank you, Tom. We'd now like to open up the call to your questions. In the interest of time and fairness, please limit yourself to one question at a time, then we'll take any follow-up questions as time permits. Sylvia, can we have the first question please. Operator : Your first question comes from Joseph Greff from JPMorgan. Joseph Greff - JPMorgan: The question I had for you, Frits, related to your footprint commentary earlier in the prepared remarks. Last three quarters it's been in that 2%-plus range below the 4% to 5%. You talked about development lead times becoming a little bit longer, which I could interpret as being a little bit temporary. But your comment about reaccelerating that net unit growth, what gives you confidence that that can happen? And what gives you confidence that some of these shifts that you're maybe seeing in the development community. You talked about, emerging market for the U.S. and developing markets upper-upscale in luxury to mid market. What gives you confidence that these shifts are temporary versus a function of relative penetration rate? And then, my follow-up question for Tom. Just looking at the pieces of your 4Q guidance, it looks like you bought back quarter-to-date somewhere between 4 million and 5 million shares. Can you help us out and talk about that? Frits van Paasschen : This is Frits, and I'll address your question regarding footprint growth. So you alluded to a number of factors that I also talked about in my prepared remarks. So I'll try to assess those in the context of whether I see those as being temporary or passing or something that either one change or we can deal with. So the first is the shift in the timeline and I would imagine that, first of all, even if the timeline stay longer, at some point we'll be in a steady stay, where we just have a slightly longer gestation period for properties. But I think in some cases, we may even see some of those timelines come back and slide. And of course, we're going to continue to focus on conversions, both in North America, which has been a catalyst for our growth, but also increasingly in markets like India, where in more difficult times many hotel vendors have realized and recognized the benefit of looking into a global system. In terms of the U.S. business, yes, I don't expect that we're going to see an increase in the average size of hotels. So clearly for us the key is to find new ways to accelerate our growth in the Specialty Select segment in North America and that's something that we're intend on doing. And then finally, I do think that in other markets around the world, we could see a pick up in growth momentum again, in terms of overall signings. So our sense is that across those three areas, as well as looking at other ways to expand the reach of our footprint and our pipeline for delivering high paying guest to great hotels, we're going to explore other avenues of growth as well. So I hope that gives you a little bit more color and background on what we're thinking about in terms of making sure that we get the net rooms level back to where we think is right for us. And I'm going to hand now Thomas, as you had asked him a question as well. Thomas Mangas : Yes. So we are in the market in the fourth quarter. We continue to pursue a more programmatic approach to share repurchases. You can do the math. Basically we've guided $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in total cash returned to shareholders and we are expecting to pay our regular and special dividend. You can get to about $500 million to $550 million of cash repurchases in the fourth quarter that we're going to make, which will largely consume, but not fully consume the full authorization the Board has given us. So we continue to make good pace and rate on the programmatic repurchase program. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley : So first question for you, when you were talking about your capital return, I mean you talked about that 2.5x to 3x leverage, you talked about going more asset-light and you mentioned that you could get leverage higher, especially if you could find attractive asset-light businesses to buy. Can you just talk a little bit about the balance of returning capital to shareholders with potentially doing acquisitions? And if you were to do acquisitions, now where do you think -- what do you think you're missing? And then just a quick follow-up. In the press release you talked about in Dublin, The Westin Dublin converting from a leasehold to a franchise. Can you just touch on that quickly? Thomas Mangas : Sure. So the company has framed the range of 2.5x to 3x on rating agency basis. One, I think the company and I value are BBB rating on our debt at the company level. And so I think you'll see us try to be in the zone. I mean part of my philosophy on capital allocation is to be transparent on what our intensions are and execute on what we say we're going to execute. And so I think you'll see us try to be in that zone of 2.5x to 3x. And I can imagine with asset sales we might creep below it, with an intent to get into the zone. And again with potential acquisition opportunity, creep above it, we intend to get back into the zone. Clearly, I think as we went through the net rooms count, the discussion that Frits laid out there, we need to grow and part of my focus in coming to this company, and as Frits asked me, how do we help -- how do I help the company grow. And I think one way we help the company grow is leveraging the balance sheet to drive growth through acquisition or other more creative deal forms that allow us to sign up, in bigger scale owners to deals that create significant value for us and for them. And so I do think you'll see from me a posture of using the balance sheet to drive acquisitions. And I think the shape and the form of the name will -- I don't know enough yet to answer that question on who are the right targets for us, and clearly it seems to be a very active space and one that this company has had a terrific track record of executing against, starting with its origin, including Le M\u00e9ridien deal. So stay tuned. On the Westin Dublin, yes, that was simply a very onerous lease of a hotel that we have terminated the lease and had a significant lease termination payment, and we flipped it to a management contract that we are very pleased with on a long-term basis. So it's nothing more than that. Frits van Paasschen : And I'm just going to jump in. First of all, I think Tom Mangas did a great job answering the question this early. And Tom Allen, just a couple of more thoughts on your question. We have and we'll continue to look at acquisition opportunities. I think Tom was correct and careful in pointing out that we're looking at asset-light businesses, not going out and buying hotels, so I think that's pretty clear. And that also our 2.5x to 3x leverage range reflects the current mix of EBITDA income, but as our business shifts increasingly to asset-light, as Tom was also referring too, that will give us the potential through lower volatility to be able to take that leverage ratio up as we look ahead. And then Tom's thoroughly up to speed. Yes, the Dublin lease was not one that was very well structured from our own return standpoint. It also carried with it all the volatility and implied debt that a lease always does. So when we can, we try to find ways to convert lease arrangements to other situations. And in this case with Dublin, we were able to do that and move ourselves to franchise arrangement with a partner that we feel very good about. So this was a win-win from our perspective. And of course, also it's a way of moving to being more asset-light in the shape and form of our earnings. Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from David Loeb from Baird. David Loeb - Baird: If you could just give us a little more color on the bump in the G&A guidance. I understand about new initiatives, but $7 million, $8 million seems like a lot for mobile check-in. Are there other big lumpy items in that number? Thomas Mangas : Now, that's really the primary one. Certainly, we are launching several initiatives under the SPG banner, mobile check-in is the big one to have the significant amount of expense with it, because not to get to technical on you, but this is something we are pushing out to both owned and managed hotels and generally we are pushing out devices into the buildings that we don't have a fee recovery mechanism in place right now, because we're really trying to prove and qualify the idea. So we're absorbing the expense in the quarter, this quarter and next quarter as we try to roll them out. And over time I think it serves both as an effective marketing expense to drive excitement and buzz in the hotels where our guest will value it, and overall drive greater occupancies we believe, and rate in these hotels. So that's really the main driver on this SG&A increase for the year. Frits van Paasschen : Yes, I think the other point is just that there is always going to be some puts and takes in our P&L and some of those flow-through SG&A. And Tom alluded to a few of those in his prepared remarks. For us, the main one we wanted to call out was our initiative around keyless check-in. But it's one among several that we're working on, and we'll give you a little bit more clarity around that when we close the year in terms of what some of the other factors might have been. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Tom, I have a multi-parter for you. First, wondering if you could provide more color on the fourth quarter guidance. I am just wondering, how much are you expecting North America growth to slow sequentially? And then correspondingly, are you expecting something like low-single digit growth from international, if at all? And then if you could just talk about your view on U.S. RevPAR growth for the fourth quarter, well, that was part of my question, but also for 2015. And then you said something about citywide shifting from the fourth quarter into the third quarter. How much did the North America RevPAR benefit in the third quarter from the shift at citywide? Thomas Mangas : Felicia, you're challenging me on my first call with the three-parter. That's impressive. So let me try to tackle it. So let me start with the fourth quarter. Yes, we are seeing a deceleration given our geographic mix, but also in North America. So North America, as we called out was up 9% in RevPAR. We still think North America is strong in the mid-single digit, but we are seeing the group sales being weaker going into the quarter in North America, than what we saw in the first three quarters of the year, which is giving us a pause there. And part of that is, because we did see a shift in the citywides, out of the fourth into the third in markets where we have significant concentration of hotels like Boston, New Orleans, Dallas, San Diego and Seattle, so North America is a deceleration versus what we enjoyed in the third quarter, but also Latin America is a deceleration, largely because we have the World Cup in the part of the third quarter, we don't have that. And we know with the hurricane, we had in Cabos that we took couple of our properties out of the mix there, which were showing strong growth. So we don't have quite the same footprint in a strong growth region that we had for the bulk of this third quarter. And the last thing of real measure is in China we are seeing pressure on ADR. We're starting to lap the Sheraton Macau ramp. So I think there is enough, very tangible things that led us to believe that 3% to 5% range was the right range. Now, I didn't mention Europe, I do think that we had a strong base in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2013. And Russia continues to be weak for us. So I think we continue to feel like we're doing the right things and executing well and we're playing the hand we're dealt in terms of he geographic mix and this is a quarter where it's slightly weak. Relative to your point on 2015 in North America, we continue to think North America is the strong market next year and is likely going to be in the same zone as it has played out for 2014, so we don't expect a major deceleration or change in the North America trajectory. And I do think the one thing that we're cautious about is both the group activity going into the fourth quarter as well as group going into the years in the low-single digits, and that has given us some pause for; first, being more bullish, but frankly we think that the 4% to 6% RevPAR range for the total system is pretty attractive range. It's not far off of where we are this year, and where I think most people are externally. And so we feel like it's an aggressive one and we're seeing some share growth in there. Frits van Paasschen : I might just add a couple of things to that. And obviously, I think Tom for four weeks in, has given a pretty comprehensive answer. I'd just throw a few other things into the mix as we look at Q4. In Europe in Q3 we did benefit a bit from the shift in Ramadan, which gave us a few more strong weeks in Q3 that we won't obviously see in Q4. Also Yom Kippur finding a place in Q4 in North America meant the business might be a little softer in terms of comparison there. And then I want to make sure that we're being not too negative in terms of what we're saying about group, because group was very strong in Q3. We've had good in the year, for the year bookings. Q4 is generally a slightly weaker quarter. And as we look into next year again, the momentum is still there. So this isn't a major change in trend, it's a bit of a reallocation of some of the revenue that we saw land in Q3 versus land in Q4. So I want to make sure that that's clear. I think it's also important to emphasize what Tom stated at the end and that is that we are seeing relative performance improvements against our hotels and their comp sets. So our RevPAR index numbers continue to show a positive trend, which in our industry at least is the way we talk about growing market share. And then I think as we look into next year, one of the things in addition to some of the group bookings that makes me feel comfortable is the fact that when we talk to our bigger corporate customers and ask them whether they're hiring and traveling more next year than this year, which is something we often do as we get to the fall, the answer again, as you look into 2015 is that their momentum for travel continues to be strong. So we think 4% to 6% is a good range today given all that's happening in the world. And as we said all along, in February, we will give you a bit more on what 2015 ends up looking like. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker from MLV & Co. Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co.: Just a quick question with regards to asset sales. I appreciate the color that you gave, that you might see a couple more assets trading hands by yearend. I am just wondering. You gave some good color in terms of slowing economic growth in Asia and in Europe, and some of those concerns that could weigh on 4Q results. Do you see any impact on that dynamic weighing on your ability to sell assets outside of the U.S. as we go into 2015? Frits van Paasschen : No. Ryan, this is Frits. I think the first is, we didn't actually say a couple of asset sales, we said we were working hard to have more news with you, so just to be totally clear. But the performance of our own hotels is continuing to be strong. And the trends that we're talking about here are much closer to deceleration than they are to less good performance. Meaning our hotels are still going to be up and performing well next year. And I think that reflects growing demand. I mean bear in mind, in China we had huge jump in occupancy within market. We continue to see strong outbound in Chinese travel as well. And so I know the momentum factors that lie behind secular growth and demands that Tom referred to in his assessment of deciding to come to Starwood I think are definitely playing out here. So no, that has not been a factor in terms of conversations that we're having around selling assets. And we'll give you more when we have it. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla from FBR. Nikhil Bhalla - FBR: Just on the timeshare side, Frits, could you just give us some sense of what's happening? Why are the sales sort of not picking up or actually been slowing down through the year, what maybe going behind that? And also some color on the inventory you have to sell on the timeshare side? Frits van Paasschen : We've pulled over $1 billion out of the timeshare business in last four, five years as we've talked about, and we continue to believe that that's thanks to the very strong brands and the great team that we have in the business. They, in fact, have been so good that we've sold through a lot of the extra inventory that we had. And that I think more than anything lies behind the change of pace, so one of the things that we're looking at is finding balance sheet friendly-ways to make sure that we can secure inventory to maintain the business. I think that we've been very clear; I shouldn't say, I think, I know that we've been very clear about our sense that while we believe this is a great business for our guest and for our SPO owners, that we didn't want to have this be a major growth engine for us as a company, because we wanted to focus on being asset-light. And so the goal has not been to grow this business, and that isn't our goal today either, but our goal is to make sure that we have sufficient inventory to maintain the momentum that we have. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley - UBS: You gave some color around some of the reasons for the slowdown in growth in Q4. But they don't necessarily sound like kind of one-off or one-quarter type issue. So I guess how are you comfortable that those factors will lead to re-acceleration after Q4, just based on your early '15 guidance? And then just so if you can, separately if you can quantify, in China you mentioned kind of some slower development there. Can you give us a percent of rooms in your pipeline in China that are under construction now and how that compared to a year ago or a quarter ago? Frits van Paasschen : Yes. Robin, so this is Frits. I think the important thing to look at when you compare our fourth quarter to our full year outlook for 2015 is that in any one quarter, we're going to see numbers move around a fair amount. And even though this is a very big system with global reach, individual quarters do tend to move around just a bit. So in some respect, if Q3 was a bit higher than the trend line we're talking about and Q4 is a little bit lower than the trend line we're talking about, the basic level of growth, the fact that our hotels are broadly at high occupancies and we're seeing most of that growth in RevPAR now or increasingly through rate, I think is behind our feeling comfortable there. Clearly, the shift in some of the holidays is more of a temporary thing. The Macau ramp down clearly will be something that will come in the next year. But at the same time, we're seeing underlying transfer growth that make us feel comfortable at this stage for this kind of growth range. In terms of your second question around China, I don't know that that's a number we specifically release. But what I can tell you is that as we go through each of the proposals that our development team in Chain brings to us, and we review those every couple of weeks in direct conversion between our global feasibility and development team and our development teams on the ground around the world, and what we clearly see in -- I think there was a technical difficulty here. Excuse me. So what we're seeing is a tendency for those hotels to be slated, to open, five and sometimes six years from now as opposed to two or three years out in front. And that's more of the issue for us than bigger financial questions. I did allude of the fact that there were a very small number of developers that looked like they had financial difficulties. The reason I mention it is, because up until now we haven't seen any developers with that. So I wanted to highlight that, well, it's not a huge number, there is some of that taking place in the market today. So Stephen if there is more you want to add to that. Stephen Pettibone : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America : So I just wanted to ask about, overall when we look at the quarter same-store RevPAR was up 6.9%. It looks like base fees were below that or if we looked at your just total worldwide RevPAR and we looked at your overall fee growth, the spread was pretty wide. So the question is, like, why are fees now trailing your overall RevPAR growth, which I think this is the first quarter, we've seen that in quite a while. Is there is something in new units that we should be focused on? And my follow-up question is, on incentive management fees that number dipped down, it was below what we were expecting as well. So kind of following up, does that imply anything about the kind of new hotel margins or margin growth for some of your international hotels? And how should we think about incentive management fees in the next year? That'd be helpful. Frits van Paasschen : Shaun, this is Frits, I'm going to make a couple of comments, and hand to Tom, because I know he wants to add a bit more to answer your question. You should know, first of all, that our fees generally speaking both in terms of franchise as well as management are a function of topline revenue and incentive fees profitability of our hotels. And so at anytime, if all we're looking at our cash fees relative to the performance of our hotels, we should see growth in our fee base when RevPAR is up, that's faster than RevPAR and likewise if it's flat or down the other way. So the only reason that wouldn't be the case would be one or two things. First, we might have some one-time fees that are in a year prior, which in this case is what we're talking about or we can have new hotels entering on to the system that are on average at lower rate. And aside from the fact that we have slightly more Select Serve hotels entering the system there, I can tell you that our contracts on average actually continue to get better, because we have more discipline today than we ever have, and whether we're looking at legacy contract or for that there especially legacy Le M\u00e9ridien contract, they are actually getting stronger. So in actual fact, I think that the strength of the base of our business, when it comes to our agreements with hotels, is actually getting better. The mix has not significantly shifted there. So this is largely a function of some one-time moves. And Tom, do you want to add anything to that or? Thomas Mangas : Well, I think you covered it pretty completely though, Frits. I just want to reiterate that, excluding the one-timer that we had in the third quarter, I think the real phenomenon on the third quarter is we had a big non-recurring fee last year that's suppressing the total fee growth down to only 2.5%. If we exclude that one-timer, we're growing more like 7.3% in total fees. Incentive fees continue to grow and we are not seeing a different change or change introductory in incentive fees. We're still having a significant portion of our contracts outside of North America paying on a systemwide basis. About 70% of our managed hotels pay incentive fees and about 85% of our total incentive fee income comes outside from North America or outside the U.S. So I think we're not calling it all differently than we've done before. We're really just trying to reflect kind of the base period impacts in getting to that core fee growth measure that we described. Stephen Pettibone : We have time for one more question, please, Sylvia. Operator : Your final question comes from Joel Simkins from Credit Suisse. Joel Simkins - Credit Suisse : One quick question I guess for you Frits. First, in terms of this Design Hotels portfolio, just walk us through sort of the economics there, what sort of long-term strategy as an opportunity? And then, also, perhaps a follow-up for Tom. Again, I know you're early into your role here. You got an earlier question on timeshare. I just wanted to understand sort of how you view that business longer term? How core strategic it is going forward? Frits van Paasschen : Yes, Joel, so I'll address your question with respect to Design Hotels, first. The arrangement the Design Hotels has today as a company with its member properties is not anywhere near as deep as the one we have with hotels that are part of our system. And so what we are looking at are ways to bring value from the capabilities that we have developed to those hotels. And of course, as we do that, we'll find ways to make sure that we get some of that value back. It's a bit early, because in spite of having begun the discussions to get at least partial share of this company earlier on, it hasn't been until only recently that we have been fully at liberty to have open discussions strategically with Design Hotels' management. And yet also have not yet had a chance to explore exactly how we might do this to negotiate with the current owners. So while I'd love to be a little bit more specific now, I think it'd be better for us to do our homework, and come back to you with some initial insights as to how the structure of that might work, once I have a better idea of how we might get started. What I think is attractive about this though is, if you go online, if you look at the hotels we're talking about, they're very intriguing properties. They are the kind of indigenous authentic properties that come actually with a different feel than either say, Le M\u00e9ridien or W or Luxury Collection. So they're very additive to our mix of hotels, bringing us to new locations also. And I am absolutely sure based on our initial discussions, that we're going to find ways that work for Starwood and that are very beneficial for the owners of the properties. And so with that, I'll hand over to Tom, to add some comments on vacation ownership. Thomas Mangas : You're right. I'm four weeks into the job. I have not even been down to Orlando yet to meet the team. So that's something I've got slated next week, when I am back in the United States. Clearly, we have a world-class vacation ownership business, one that we're very proud of, one that's built a lot of value overtime, very successfully building our properties in prime markets like Orlando and Hawaii and in Mexico. So this is something Frits has asked me to get into and look at, because it's clearly a very capital-intensive business. It needs capital to grow. It's lumpy capital. And right now as we're pursuing an asset-light strategy, we're not quite clear how to square the circle on pursuing a high capital in terms of business, as we move to asset-light. So that's something I'm going to be working on in the next several months, as I evaluate the business, and I'll be bringing forth to Frits and the board my own thoughts and stay tuned. Stephen Pettibone : Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Frits. I want to thank all of you for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest in Starwood Hotels & Resorts. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to us. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Starwood Hotels & Resorts third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Marriott International's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 19, 2015, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. 2014 was a terrific year for Marriott. Worldwide comparable system-wide RevPAR rose nearly 7%, adjusted EBITDA rose 15%, and EPS increased 27%. The number of rooms in our lodging system grew by 7% gross. Over half of these new room openings were outside North America, and over 40% were conversions from competitor brands or were M&A related. Our room signings were even more impressive. We signed over 650 hotels with 100,000 new rooms in the year, more than triple the pace from five years ago, and we ended the year with nearly 240,000 rooms in our development pipeline. Every region, North America, the Caribbean and Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific each signed a record number of deals during the year, positioning us for great earnings growth in the future. Our Development team led by Tony Capuano did an extraordinary job, and we thank them all. With our talented developers and the rising demand and limited supply macro story has certainly contributed to our recent growth. Our success in 2014 was also rooted in a number of strategic decisions we made following the 2009 downturn. First and foremost, we chose to decentralize, putting important business decisions in the hands of competent executives who are close to the customer and the local market. Deep knowledge of the Middle East and Africa region enabled us to quickly seize the opportunity presented by the Protea brand. In the Asia Pacific region, our strong relationships with local owners allowed our Regional Development team to sign an extraordinary number of deals in just a few years. And in Europe, our local presence enabled us to find the right entry to the economy tier with the Moxy brand. Around the world, we increased the number of brand platforms available for owners and franchisees, adding five brands in as many years, developing the Autograph and Moxy brands internally, and acquiring AC Hotels, Gaylord and Protea, all of which helped fuel our unit growth and pipeline. We also enhanced the value of our brands, introducing new and exciting guest room designs, including by transforming the Marriott Lobby, introducing the Renaissance Navigator program, and rolling out Courtyard Refreshing Business. We estimate our owners and franchisees have invested over $5 billion in renovations and repositionings over the last few years. We committed capital strategically. Our EDITION brand growth clearly benefited from our decision to build three EDITION Hotels on balance sheet. Two of these properties in London and Miami are already open, and The New York EDITION at the Clock Tower building is scheduled to open in just a few months. Just last month, Travel & Leisure Magazine named the Miami EDITION one of 43 transformative hotels worldwide in its 10th Annual Editor Choice Award. With strong momentum, we now have a dozen EDITION properties open or in the pipeline. By the way, we closed on the sale of the Miami EDITION last night, and we expect the New York Clock Tower EDITION sale to close within the next couple of months. We enhanced and improved our already powerful above-property platforms. We introduced new languages and new functionality on marriott.com, and we launched Marriott Mobile. Our site remains an incredibly low-cost, high-value booking channel for our hotels. Last year, we booked over $10 billion in property revenue on marriott.com, nearly 20% of that coming through mobile. We also rolled out mobile check-in and check-out to virtually all of our worldwide hotels well ahead of the competition. We strengthened Marriott Rewards to better target young travelers and introduced Ritz-Carlton Rewards to the Luxury space. We introduced new redemption options, embraced social media, and leveraged technology to provide instant gratification to millennial travelers. In 2014, we announced free Wi-Fi for Reward members to great acclaim. Last year, Rewards membership topped 49 million members worldwide and contributed one-half of our worldwide occupancy. In 2014, 60% of new Rewards members were next-generation travelers and 40% of new members live outside of North America. We also improved our business structure. With the spin-off of Timeshare in 2011, we dramatically increased return on invested capital and retained a significant royalty stream for Marriott Vacations worldwide. Last and most important, we delivered stronger hotel financial results and higher owner and franchisee satisfaction, both essential for continued unit growth. Since 2009, worldwide system-wide RevPAR has increased by more than 30%, margins have improved dramatically, and owners and franchisees as a whole have rarely been happier. In five years, we increased our fee revenue by nearly 60%, doubled our adjusted operating margin, and dramatically improved earnings per share. The results of all of these are impressive. And this year offers even more opportunities. Our 2015 earnings guidance reflects rooms' growth of roughly 7% gross or 6% net of deletions. We expect conversions will contribute roughly 15% of our room expansion. Upon completion of the Delta transaction, we'll pick up another 10,000 rooms. In light of our accelerating development, you may be concerned about new industry supply. Now while supply growth impacts some markets, STR estimates U.S. market supply overall increased by only 0.9% in 2014 and expects it will increase by only 1.3% in 2015. In this low supply growth environment, we are driving market share. We currently have a 10% share of rooms in North America, but 26% of the under construction market. In fact, Marriott has more hotel rooms under construction in North America than any other company. Five years ago at ALIS, we introduced the Autograph brand, a flexible lifestyle brand combining unique style and identity with the advantages of powerful [audio skip] (8:22) property systems and marketing. In recent years, hotels joining the brand saw double-digit improvement in RevPAR index. Today, Autograph has more than 75 properties with 17,000 rooms worldwide, and we expect to have more than 100 Autograph hotels open by the end of this year. Our Moxy brand was designed to capture the rapidly growing number of millennial travelers. The brand launched in Europe in 2014, and at this year's ALIS Conference, we announced the introduction of Moxy to urban markets in North America. Today our development pipeline includes 16 Moxy's under development in Europe and five already in the United States. Just last month we approved two Moxy deals for Manhattan. We expect to have 150 Moxy Hotels open worldwide by 2023. Our first AC by Marriott hotel in North America opened in New Orleans in 2014. Hotel owners love the stylish cosmopolitan brand. We already have nearly 60 AC Hotels under development worldwide, including roughly 45 projects underway in North America. Our three largest limited service brands, Courtyard, Residence Inn and Fairfield, have over 2,200 hotels and 260,000 rooms in the United States, but are just starting aggressive expansion abroad. Today, more than 50% of Courtyard's worldwide development pipeline is outside the U.S., we are adding Fairfields in Mexico and India, and launching Residence Inns in Europe and the Middle East. As large as they are, these brands still have plenty of runway worldwide. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire the 10,000 room Delta Hotels brand in Canada. Upon completion, this transaction will significantly increase our full service market share in Canada, and provide another new brand platform for growth worldwide. We are very optimistic about the long term. As the world becomes more integrated, global travel continues to grow. The World Travel Organization estimates that the number of international arrivals has more than doubled in the past 20 years to 1.1 billion visits in 2014. In November, the United States and China reached a reciprocal agreement that extends visa validity terms from 1 year to 10 years for short-term business and leisure visitors, significantly reducing the red tape for frequent travelers. This visa extension allows flexibility for the traveler and makes the U.S. and China more attractive destinations. In 2014, our U.S. hotels reported a 20% increase in guests coming from Greater China. It's this kind of statistic which demonstrates that we truly are in a new golden age of travel. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Carl for a review of the fourth quarter and our expectations for 2015. Carl? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Arne. We were very pleased with our fourth quarter results. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.68, $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of our $0.62 to $0.66 guidance. Compared to the midpoint of our guidance, stronger-than-expected results among our owned and leased hotels added roughly $0.01, higher-than-expected termination fees added about another $0.01, while our favorable one-time interest true-up added about $0.02. In North America, continued economic growth drove North America system-wide RevPAR up nearly 7%. We saw strong RevPAR growth in San Francisco, the Pacific Northwest and our Florida resorts. Among our system-wide full service brands, transient demand was strong and hotels in nearly half of our top 20 markets increased retail RevPAR by double-digit percentages. System-wide North America group RevPAR rose 6% in the quarter, 4% in our full-service hotels alone, reflecting less favorable holiday timing on the heels of a very strong third quarter. Looking ahead, in the first quarter of 2015, group revenue pace for our company-operated full-service hotels is up 6% while our full year 2015 group pace is up 5%. Meeting planners are bullish, booking windows are lengthening and future room rates are strengthening. In fact, in the fourth quarter, room revenue for managed group business booked for all future periods increased 9%. Room rates are moving higher. In 2015, we expect special corporate room rates from continuing accounts will increase 5% to 6%. Once again this year, we are bidding on fewer accounts in order to increase available inventory for higher rated retail business. We remain bullish about demand trends in North America. Consumer confidence is up and we are approaching record occupancy rates in our hotels. To be sure, the strong dollar will likely discourage international travel to some gateway cities in the U.S., but across our U.S. system international guests make up only about 5% of our room nights. So we don't see this as a significant headwind to our U.S. operation. All in all, we expect North America system-wide RevPAR will increase 5% to 7% in both the first quarter and the full year 2015. In our Caribbean and Latin America region, constant dollar RevPAR rose 8% in the fourth quarter. Strong leisure business and good group demand drove results in the Caribbean and Mexico. Brazil's results are likely to remain weak due to the soft economy as well as a tough comparison to last year's World Cup, but we remain bullish about this country's long-term growth potential. We expect constant dollar RevPAR growth in the Caribbean and Latin America region will increase at the mid-single-digit rate in 2015. In 2014, we earned roughly 4% of our worldwide fees in the Caribbean and Latin America region. RevPAR in Europe rose 3% in the quarter, on a constant dollar basis, benefiting from good group attendance, strong holiday demand in Germany and Austria, and easy comparisons to the prior year's poor weather. At the same time, results were constrained by weak lodging demand in Russia. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect the London market will benefit from strong group business and the impact of the Rugby World Cup late in the year. Although the broad European economy is soft, roughly 30% of our European lodging demand comes from outside Europe, with about 20 points from North America and six points from Asia. With the continued strong dollar and our concentration in attractive gateway cities, we could see upside from a good American tourist season summer. We expect 2015 RevPAR will increase at a low single-digit rate in Europe. In 2014, 7% of our fees came from this region. In the Middle East and Africa, constant dollar RevPAR increased 15% in the fourth quarter. RevPAR growth was strong in Egypt, including both business travel to Cairo and leisure travel to the Red Sea. In Africa, our Protea Hotels are on marriott.com and we've completed systems integration at a third of the properties. For 2015, we expect constant dollar RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa region will increase at a high-single-digit rate. In 2014 3% of our fee revenue came from this region. RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region increased 3% on a constant-dollar basis in the fourth quarter. In Japan, U.S. arrivals increased as the weakened yen made the country more affordable to international travelers. RevPAR in Greater China increased slightly reflecting strong Shanghai demand offset by the disruption from political demonstrations in Hong Kong. In 2015, we expect demand will remain strong in Shanghai and improve in Hong Kong, yielding a mid-single-digit growth rate for the region. In 2014, the Asia Pacific region accounted for 9% of our fee revenue with about five points coming from Greater China alone. Across all regions our system-wide international hotels reported 5% higher constant-dollar RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter but only a modest increase in RevPAR on an actual currency basis. Including the impact of hedges, currency moves reduced our pre-tax earnings by about $5 million in the quarter and $12 million for the full year. In addition, we booked an $11 million charge earlier in 2014 due to the Venezuelan bolivars' devaluation. Our operations outside the United States contributed roughly 25% of our fees in 2014. Each year we pragmatically hedge to minimize the impact of currency moves, usually a few quarters prior to the start of the year. For 2015, we estimate a 1% change in the value of the dollar in all of our markets, net of hedges, would change our adjusted EBITDA by roughly $3 million for the full year. Property level margin performance across our system was outstanding in the fourth quarter. Comparable company operated house profit margins increased 110 basis points in North America and 90 basis points worldwide. Higher room rates and continued productivity gains drove our results. For 2015, new accounting rules for the lodging industry require service charges to be included in property revenue. While we would have estimated worldwide house profit margins would increase roughly 90 basis points worldwide in 2015, adjusting for the impact of this accounting change, we estimate our reported margins will increase roughly 60 basis points. We do not expect a material impact on hotel profitability or fee revenue from these accounting changes. Worldwide, fee revenue totaled $430 million in the fourth quarter, an 11% growth rate, reflecting higher RevPAR and unit growth. For full year 2014, incentive fees increased 18% with more than half of our hotels worldwide paying incentive fees, up from 38% in 2013. For full year 2015 we expect fee revenue will increase 9% to 11% with incentive fees increasing at a low double-digit rate. Fee revenue growth will likely be constrained by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, lower deferred fee recognition, and the impact of renovation. We estimate foreign exchange alone is likely to reduce total fee revenue by $15 million to $20 million in 2015. We expect 2015 owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, will be roughly flat to 2014 results, reflecting stronger results at renovated hotels and higher credit card branding fees, offset by the impact of property renovations, lower residential branding fees, lower termination fees, and roughly $5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. We expect 2015 general and administrative costs will decline to $635 million to $645 million, reflecting modestly higher core admin costs, offset by lower legal costs and an easy comparison to the 2014 bolivar revaluation. We also expect G&A to reflect a roughly $5 million favorable foreign exchange impact in 2015. Net interest expense should increase to roughly $135 million, reflecting a senior note offering in the fourth quarter of 2014, lower capitalized interest with the completion of the three EDITION hotels, and higher overall debt balances. We expect interest income will increase reflecting our $100 million mezzanine loan on the Atlantis hotel which we funded in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect 2015 fully diluted EPS will total $3 to $3.12, an increase of 18% to 23%, and adjusted EBITDA will increase 13% to 16%. Remember, this guidance excludes the pending Delta acquisition. We expect the P&L impact of Delta to be a little noisy in 2015 due to the integration and transaction costs and the like, but the transaction should be modestly accretive in 2016. Our RevPAR sensitivity is unchanged. We estimate that a point change in our RevPAR outlook across our system in 2015, assuming it was evenly distributed, will be worth about $20 million in fees and roughly $5 million on the owned and leased line for the full year. Investment spending should total $600 million to $800 million in 2015, including about $125 million in maintenance spending and $135 million for the Delta acquisition. In 2015, we plan to renovate several owned and leased hotels and begin construction of a Fairfield Inn in Brazil. We expect asset sales and loan repayments will total roughly $600 million to $650 million, including the sale of the Miami Beach EDITION and Residences and the New York EDITION. As a result, we expect cash return to shareholders in 2015 will total at least as much as we returned in 2014. For the first quarter, we expect fee revenue will increase at a mid-teens rate with higher relicensing and application fees. While group pace is strong, full service RevPAR growth in North America is likely to be a bit lighter than later in the year due to property renovation schedules and the recent Northeast snowstorms. We expect owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, will increase more than 20% with the addition of the Protea leased hotels and higher credit card branding fees. G&A should increase in the first quarter, reflecting higher brand initiatives and hotel development expenses. However, first quarter G&A will also benefit from a roughly $12 million net favorable impact to our legal expenses associated with certain litigation resolutions. All in all, we expect EPS to total $0.68 to $0.72 in the first quarter. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Maria, we'll take questions now. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Arne \u2013 hello. Clearly, Arne, for you, where we are in the cycle certainly favors the Select-Service hotels. Just wondering with luxury and upper upscale RevPAR lagging since last year, what are you doing at those chain scales to boost RevPAR growth or is it just simply a function of the cycle? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's good question. I mean, I think the biggest reason for the difference between the upscale numbers and the upper upscale numbers is really about group. And, obviously, we've seen group demand build nicely over the course of the last 12 months or 18 months and I think, if anything, we see that demand continuing to build and, as a consequence, should get quite a bit better. Having said that, as we've talked in prior calls, I think in a building rate environment, transient tends to grow faster than group. That is the case even if group is quite healthy. And, obviously, one of the shortcomings of a RevPAR-dominated statistic, when you look at our industry, is it does not include non-rooms revenue that's associated with the group business. And if you include that, I think you get probably a truer sense about what's going on. I know a couple of folks have asked questions about whether luxury, for example, lagging some of the other brands is a sign of \u2013 an early sign maybe of getting to the maturity of the cycle. We don't believe that to be the case. We've poked at it in every way that we possibly can. And we don't think there's either a logic nor data to support a conclusion that there are any big conclusions that ought to be drawn by the difference between luxury or upper upscale RevPAR and the upscale RevPAR. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Helpful. Thank you. And then, Carl, you were just giving us a lot of details about SG&A. I appreciate that. You grew it slightly in 2014 and you're projecting a 2% to 4% decline in 2015 and you gave us the reasons why. If you look back to your Investor Day in September, you provided a 2017 goal of about $710 million. I'm just wondering, is that goal still part of your three-year outlook because that would imply a mid single-digit CAGR in 2016 and 2017, which is significantly higher than what you've done recently. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think when we did our Investor Day, I wouldn't look at that as a forecast as much as we're putting goalposts out there with certain percentages. We're very focused on G&A costs and managing our costs down. As I mentioned, we have some favorability coming in 2015 with FX as well as lower legal costs that are helping us. But let there be no mistake, we are very focused on G&A to keep those costs flat or growing at a minimum amount. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So the goalposts that you gave us kind of implied a 3% to 4% CAGR. I mean, if we're just trying to model out further, should we use a low single-digit CAGR going forward? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think we want to give you a new 2017 model at this point, Felicia. But I think you've got what you've got to make some judgments. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I want to dig in on the incentive management fees a little bit more. So, I think, Carl, in your prepared remarks you said low double-digit for kind of 2015 as initial outlook. So (29:09) understand that a little bit better, from two regards. One, should we expect some of the Select-Service portfolios to be moving into the money, I guess, if you will, in 2015? And then second, we heard from a big owner of Marriott Hotels earlier today that they were successful in renegotiating some contracts as it related to incentive management fees. And I'm curious if that's at all a drag for you? And if you could just give a little more color on what that means from Marriott's perspective. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I think there's a couple things that are affecting the incentive fees. FX, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, a little bit of a headwind. We've got some renovations going on at some big hotels in the U.S., full-service hotels that are great incentive payers that we'll get a little bit pullback there. Last year the World Cup in Brazil generated a lot of incentive fees; that's a little headwind there. But I \u2013 and we got some deferred fees in 2014 that won't repeat. I think your question about the portfolios of limited service, you could see as in 2014 we had 50% of our hotels paying incentive fees and that was up from 38% the previous year. So you're beginning to see some of those portfolios move in. They're not generating a lot of dollars yet. They're just starting to come into the paying. But as RevPAR continues to grow, you'll see those limited service ones contribute more. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: How about the host portfolio, Carl? We had a recent renegotiation and... Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we have every now and then we talk about a hotel or some negotiations, but nothing that moves the needle. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins of Credit Suisse. Joel H. Simkins - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Quick question for you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Joel H. Simkins - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Obviously, you've tacked on Delta here that follows on the heels of Protea. How should we be thinking about sort of your future appetite for tuck-in acquisitions? Are there any geographic holes you guys feel like you're missing at this point? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, there's a big world out there. And I think in some respects, this is also a repeat of what we said the last few quarters. I think if you had asked us at any time in the last few years whether we would have added this many brands, we wouldn't have probably discouraged you from thinking we'd do it. And we wouldn't have identified AC in Spain or Protea in South Africa or Delta in Canada as being companies that we had necessarily targeted, but we're really pleased with all of them. And I think what we've found is acquisitions that seem to be priced in a way that allows us to get to creating economic value and earnings accretion fairly quickly, and priced well below our company valuation given to us by markets. You see that accretion quite quickly. And in every instance we've found deals that give us a new platform for growth. And that's the real silver lining here. We are not going out simply to acquire additional rooms to drive our rooms count, but we're really going out to try and either develop brands internally, which is cheaper in some respects but harder in some respects, because you start at zero, obviously, in terms of current distribution, or acquire. But in either instance, hopefully have a platform that will continue to drive substantial unit growth, new incremental unit growth, for those platforms which is what really delivers the great value. And I think when you look out through our pipeline, we see something like 25% to 30% of the rooms that we're working on already which are being pursued in platforms that we didn't have just a few years ago. Joel H. Simkins - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's very helpful. And then we obviously, just as a follow-up, know very much about what's going on in the Select-Service climate here domestically in terms of unit growth. What are you seeing right now in lending activity for, let's say, chunkier urban hotels or resorts per se? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think you're starting to see some of the big major banks get back into the lending market for big hotels, but it's a very small number and it's very targeted for construction financing. And then I would also say it's related to whether it's a convention hotel or something involved with the municipality close by. The other thing I would say is there's a long lead time for those hotels, especially the full-service urban ones. We're seeing those lead times really stretch out to get those things open. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But it is still the case that the full-service development which is being pursued in the U.S. today is a very small volume... Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Very. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Of new build deals. And they tend to be deals that have \u2013 often they're big convention hotels. You think about the Marriott Marquis and McCormick Place in Chicago or we've got a Marriott Marquis in Houston which is under development. The cities have both been involved in helping to put those deals together and to make them happen. We're not seeing a lot of full-service development which is happening independently from forces like that. So you end up with banks I think getting \u2013 opening up a bit for financing existing hotels in the full-service space, but not enough activity in new build to really be able to say that they're open for that kind of business. Joel H. Simkins - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is you have Asian RevPAR in your guidance kind of accelerating in 2015. Is that just easier comparisons in Hong Kong, or is China actually accelerating underneath that Asia Pac guidance overall? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Asia Pacific is a big market, and I think we'll see hopefully \u2013 knock on wood \u2013 easier comparisons in places like Hong Kong and Thailand. Thailand was rough in the first part of 2014 because of political demonstrations, and it's much more stable today than it was then. We wouldn't expect a meaningfully different kind of performance in China in 2015 from what we saw in 2014, although to be fair, the quarters got weaker in China in 2014. And so, we enter 2015 with maybe a somewhat lower trend line, but still kind of a mid-single-digits RevPAR growth would be our guess. And you roll all those things together and maybe it gets a little bit better in 2015 than it was in 2014. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then as my follow-up, the guidance for asset sales of $600 million to $650 million -- are you expecting additional asset sales outside of the New York and Miami EDITIONS? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, yeah, we have a small Courtyard in Europe that we have on the market, so we'll sell that. We'll also collect some notes that come due in 2015, and that helps us as well in that total recycled number of $600 million to $650 million. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Kent of Goldman Sachs. Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Two questions. First, just give us a sense for moving to dividends from buybacks on your capital allocation front. Especially as, if you look historically at your stock and its multiple, you're near or above your previous high. So I'm just trying to understand the rationale of buybacks versus dividends, and the way you and your board are thinking about it. And then just as an aside, you mentioned that 9,000 of the 46,000 rooms added in 2014 were from competitor brands' conversions. What are the brands \u2013 what brands are typically deciding to convert to Marriott? How do you target more of those conversions over time, and are they across all price points for you? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Those are all good questions. Let's start with dividends versus share repurchases. And I \u2013 this is a conversation we continue to have, not just with our board but also with all of you in the investment community. And I think obviously, buying back stock is a inherently more flexible approach than dividends. It allows us, in an industry that does have ups and downs, to calibrate much more instantly. And also in a stage of our business where we are jumping at opportunities when they present in a way that's compelling, Delta being the most recent example of that with a $135 million roughly acquisition which will close in the next few months here. Share repurchase also allows us to flex up and down on a short-term basis in a way that accounts for the other investment activity that we've been making. We hear from the Street over and over again a strong desire for us to continue to return capital to shareholders. We don't hear a strong desire that that be in the form of dividends as opposed to share repurchases. Not that individual investors might have a view one way or another, but when we listen to the community as a whole, we don't hear a strong push either way. Your question obviously focuses in essence on value and the valuation of the company. We closed yesterday at $81 or so. I think if you take our midpoint of \u2013 and earnings release, that's probably a $26 EPS multiple or $26 and change, which is higher than our sort of 20-year average which we think of it as being about a $22. But obviously that multiple varies meaningfully whether we're in a growth stage of the cycle or some other stage of the cycle. And if you look at the kind of earnings growth which this business modeled in this way can produce, with RevPAR growth, unit growth, cost control, and good capital discipline, I think we see EPS that can continue to grow in the 20% range hopefully here over the next couple of years. And I don't think that valuation is a troubling one in any respect. And so, I think it's a long-winded way of saying I suspect we'll continue with kind of the approach that we've taken over the last, not just few years, but probably last decade or more. You asked about conversion of other brands, 9,000 rooms. I'm not sure I can pick them off the top of my head. I'm sure there are dozens of brands which are in there. I did walk through a hotel yesterday which has not been converted yet, but wasn't a loft and is becoming an AC Hotel, and will reopen as an AC Hotel by Marriott in the next 30 days or so. I think that's the first we've seen of that. I know Laura is looking at a list. I don't know Laura whether you... Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : I'm looking at a list of the fourth quarter conversions and they're largely \u2013 I mean, there's been a lot of Autographs added in the fourth quarter. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so that's independent to... Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : ...largely independent. We also saw some conversions into the Marriott brand and Renaissance brand that were also independents. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : So in the fourth quarter, it's probably independents... Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Independents would probably be the biggest single chunk. Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Two quick questions. The $600 million that you expect to spend this year -- you've already isolated maintenance and Delta, leaving you with $340 million to spend. One of your competitors mentioned that their growth \u2013 that the investment cost to spur 6% to 7% growth was about $100 million for 2015. Of that $340 million, how much do you think is being used to drive your unit growth outside of acquisitions? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, if you kind of put in things like key money and that kind of stuff, it's obviously in there. We also have in there about, I don't know, $80 million to $100 million to finish the EDITION hotels building. And I think as we grow with Select-Service, we don't need to put a lot of capital in to get new Select-Service hotels or put it in. I think if you added it all up, it's probably $100-and-some million that we'll spend in a year on key money and loans and all that. If you think about in 2014, we did the Atlantis mezz loan for $100 million and that would count as capital in 2014. So it's those kinds of things, Harry versus a said amount that you have to invest to keep the growth going. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It is, as Carl said, it is a small percentage of the total amount that we're investing which is sort of run of the mill support to our owners, franchisees and development deals. I don't think we've mentioned today, but we've got in the 2014 \u2013 or 2015 spending, excuse me, not just the EDITION finish that Carl talked about, but we're building a couple of hotels in Brazil because we think they will give us a platform to leverage stronger growth in Brazil going forward. Those are fee ownership deals and obviously we'll turn around and recycle that capital before long. We are renovating, we've got a leased hotel in the Caribbean that we're putting $30 million or $40 million in. We own the Charlotte Marriott which we are reinventing to prove that we can take a 20-year-old Marriott Hotel and reinvent it and drive decent returns and that's probably a $30 million or $40 million project. We've got a number of those which we would not categorize at all as being sort of regular support of the development world. And in fact, as our developers are out around the world, competing with our principal competitors, we are absolutely convinced that we are not more aggressive in offering key money or other financial support to our prospective owners than our competitors are, in fact just the reverse. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. That clarifies that. And then, the second question focusing just in the U.S., is it a reasonable range to be using in the U.S. net room growth in 2015 of roughly 20,000 to 25,000 new rooms this year. And what percentage of that will come from conversions and does it change much in 2016? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The U.S. \u2013 Laura can we pull these numbers out as we're talking, but the U.S., overwhelmingly the U.S. numbers are going be driven by new build, upscale hotels. Usually in secondary markets, secondary or even tertiary markets, so think about the brands we've had for some time, Courtyard, Residence Inn, TownePlace, SpringHill Suites and Fairfield, but also then the growth that we're going to be getting in the next few years from AC, particularly Moxy, I think the first will probably not open until 2017 is my guess. So I don't think that will drive significant openings. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Harry, probably about half the openings in 2015 will be in the U.S. The majority of those will be flex service and the rest will be throughout the international area. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: And what percent are likely to be conversions of that? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Remember we have a hard time predicting conversions because they're not in our pipelines. And I don't think we've got our 45,000-ish rooms to open next year broken down between conversions and new build hotels. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. All right. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There'd be a few in the next few months undoubtedly that are in there, but we wouldn't be very aggressive in trying to predict conversion, for example, happening in late 2015. We probably don't even have those discussions going yet. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Very good. That's helpful. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Loeb from Baird. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, David. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Arne, a big picture follow-up to Joel's brand question, what's the optimal number of brands? You've successfully integrated brands like Renaissance in the past as a way to gain market share in crowded markets, and AC looks like a similar play in segmenting markets, but for Delta or future potential brand acquisitions, is there a diminishing return in terms of your ability to capture more of the travel of the Marriott Rewards customers? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think so. I mean, we've added \u2013 we obviously have a good portfolio of brands, as many as anybody if not more, and we still drive 50% of our business through the Marriott Rewards customer base. I think our pipeline of customers that we connect to these hotels are successful in most markets and with most hotels of driving an immediate lift, usually quite substantial. And so, in no respects do we believe that we have too many brands and we've gone past that point. I think there are a couple of things to keep in mind. One is in this lifestyle space, we've obviously watched it for years. We've talked with you about what we started with, with Renaissance first and then EDITION, but now more recently with Autograph and AC and Moxy. And we think we now have five very strong brands in the lifestyle space giving us a good stack across the segments in that area. And each one of those brands, I think is resonating not just with customers but with our owners and franchisees and should have good growth prospects ahead, and I think will flavor the way our entire portfolio of brands is looked at. You look at our recent acquisition of Delta and it does very much stand on its own from a financial perspective with the existing Canadian distribution and existing Canadian pipeline that they have. But you look beyond that and we see an opportunity to compete in a space where we didn't really have a brand. And you see with Hilton and their DoubleTree brand or you see with Starwood and their Sheraton brand that they've got brands that participate in this part of the full service market that have been successful, and we think there's something we can do with the Delta brand in that space as well. Again, I think as you look forward, it's very hard to predict whether we'll find additional brands that are available on both attractive economic terms, which is essential and attractive on strategic terms. So we're not simply going to add brands for \u2013 without a view about our ability to grow them longer term. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Very helpful. And a quick follow up for Carl. How much gain on the Miami EDITION, Residences is embedded in your guidance for 2015? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're just assuming a break even on it. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): On the Residences part? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Just. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of J.P. Morgan. Joseph R. Greff - J.P. Morgan: Good morning, everybody. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Joe. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - J.P. Morgan: You guys obviously have done a very good job on growing the footprint, growing the pipeline and signing new contracts, and as we look at your progress and efforts and other lodging companies that we follow, there seems to be sort of a divergence between the haves which of course, you're one and then the have-nots. And so the question we have is that -- the somewhat divergence, is that creating any heightened or incremental competition for you management or franchise contract in the U.S. or outside the U.S.? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thank you for putting us with the haves, by the way. We appreciate that. I don't think so, no. I mean, obviously we are in an intensely competitive industry, and each of us want to better the other, there's no doubt about that. I think one of the things that has been interesting is the companies have gotten to a \u2013 collectively the big companies are a bit more stable and a bit longer-term in their focus than they've probably ever been and that drives I think more rational decisions in the way they compete for management contracts or franchise contracts. And if anything, if you said we're getting into an industry in which a relative fewer of us have that much more attractiveness to owners and franchisees that would probably tend to drive towards a bit less intense competition as opposed to more. But having said that, I think the right way to think about this business is it's an intensely competitive business and it's competitive for the guests that are checking into our hotels as well as the owners and franchises that we're partnered with. Joseph R. Greff - J.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you. And, Carl, my follow up for you, can you help us understand what's embedded in your 2015 guidance in terms of gross proceeds from asset sales? And obviously the $230 million from the Marriott in Miami Beach, or the EDITION in Miami Beach. But can you help us understand what else is contemplated within your guidance? Thank you. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, in the $600 million to $650 million that we're spending -- we think we'll generate about $600 million to $650 million recycling. Obviously the two EDITIONS, Clock Tower, and Miami as well the Residence. We closed a lot of the Residences in 2014, but we got about probably $50 million still coming over into 2015 from the Residences. We'll also \u2013 like I said, we've got small Courtyard on the market, we've got some notes that we're going to collect all together probably in the range of about $30 million on the notes. We've got some preferred stock that comes due in 2015. So it's a myriad of smaller things, Joe, that just kind of add up to that $600 million to $650 million. The biggest piece being the (53:49) Joseph R. Greff - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. The color around the amount of demand coming from locals both in the U.S. and Europe is really helpful. But just as you think about your now 49 million Member's Rewards Program, can you just talk about what percentage of your customers are U.S. versus international customers and how to think about that kind of driving your overall RevPAR and revenue performance across your portfolio? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a big globe out there. But I think one thing that can be said is in virtually every market the biggest customer is a local customer. So, in the United States, for example, 95% of our business is U.S. business. 5% is inbound business. Now, obviously city-by-city it varies. We think probably New York in the U.S. is the most international city in terms of visitation. But the room nights are probably between 10% and 15% total, something like that. Obviously, you go to different cities and you see some variance. Even in China, in our hotels, the majority of our business, a heavy majority of our business is Chinese travel. It would be more mixed in a city like Shanghai than it would be in a Guangzhou or a Wuhan, but still across the country as a whole it's going be mostly Chinese business. And you look at what's happening in that space, obviously all of us are focused on currency these days. Currency will hurt arrivals in a place like New York almost for certainty. In fact, we think room night \u2013 international arrivals to New York were down probably 3% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Conversely, it will help for Americans, for example, traveling to London or Paris, and we thought we saw increases in Paris in the fourth quarter of sort of a mid-single digit percentage of American travelers. The other thing that's happening, though besides foreign exchange and impact that that has on the cost of visitation is we've got this growing global middle class that is driving an increase in demand, going into the top end of that funnel. And so, absent significant moves in foreign exchange, we would expect many of the world's best destinations to continue to drive higher and higher international visitation. Our Marriott Rewards Membership becomes increasingly international in its mix. That's no surprise. It really follows with our opening hotels in those other markets and it follows with the outbound travel from those markets. So you look at a place like Japan, Japanese have obviously been huge global travelers for 25 years or 30 years. And before we opened our first hotel in Japan, we had a substantial number of Japanese members of the Marriott Rewards Program because they came and stayed at our hotels in the United States when they came to the United States. Now that we have great momentum in adding to hotels in Japan, we end up with the extra benefit of having those local customers that we can sign up when they're staying with us in our hotels in Japan, as well as when they come to visit in the rest of the world. I don't know if that answers all your question. I've sort of rambled on around it a bit, but we think net-net that currency may have some impact in the short term. Probably they'll tend to offset each other, so we'll have as much positive from folks going to Europe as we'll have negative from folks coming to the United States. But longer-term, we'll continue to see an increase in internationalization of our Rewards Program and increase in volume of international travel, period. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And that's perfect for what I was trying to get out of it. And then just a follow-up, you answered earlier about China, how you're expecting kind of similar mid-single digit growth to what you saw in 2014. But one of your peers talked I think yesterday about seeing some green shoots in terms of improvements in kind of the F&B environment there. Are you seeing anything or are you hearing anything similar or seeing anything similar? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, if you look at it \u2013 our two biggest markets are Shanghai and Beijing. They are meaningfully different in the way they're performing. Shanghai is New York and Beijing is Washington. And as a consequence, you see in Beijing lower RevPAR and lower F&B year-over-year performance than you do in Shanghai. Shanghai, even though we are now probably 25 hotels or 26 hotels open, I don't know precisely today, as we speak, but with Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, Marriott \u2013 I'm sure we're the biggest high-end operator in Shanghai by a lot. We saw RevPAR up in \u2013 above the 5% range, probably 6 or 7% range. And if anything, we see Shanghai continuing to perform well because there's still a lot happening in the commercial space in China, even with the government austerity drives for government spending. If you ask narrowly, do we see green shoots based on government spending, I don't think so. Maybe they're there and can be discerned when we get a little farther down the road, but at the moment our expectations at least would be that the government spending in art (59:49) space will continue to have pressure on it. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ian Rennardson of Jefferies. Ian Rennardson - Jefferies International Ltd.: Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, there. Ian Rennardson - Jefferies International Ltd.: Just a quick question for Carl. What is behind the $13 million of interest income in Q4, please? Thank you. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : $13 million of interest? I didn't hear your... Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's your accretion true-up. Ian Rennardson - Jefferies International Ltd.: Yeah. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, why we had the benefit? It was a one-time interest accretion true-up. We had been recording too much interest on a accreting bond, and we adjusted that in the fourth quarter as about $7 million benefit. Ian Rennardson - Jefferies International Ltd.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Arne... Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Bill. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, Arne, how close do you think we are to hitting the high watermark on the pipeline? In other words, when we get to that point where we're opening more rooms than we're adding. And all your new acquisitions notwithstanding, it seems like we've got to be getting somewhere close to that number. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Getting close to the peak of the pipeline? Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, where we'd start opening more rooms than adding new rooms to the pipeline. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a good question. I don't think that that's near actually. I mean, for better or worse, the longer RevPAR goes up and profitability of hotels improve, more projects pencil. And you can say for better or worse because if you could have a omnipotent kind of wisdom, I suspect at some point you would say, well, let's start to calibrate that back, simply because we know that there'll be a correction coming at some point in time. But our industry doesn't really work that way. So I would expect that the pipeline \u2013 and, again, this is sort of a U.S. focused comment, I'll confess to that. But I would expect that the pipeline in the U.S. will continue to grow. With each year, we see mid single or mid to high single-digit RevPAR growth and enhanced profitability that goes with that. You get to the Rest of the World and I suspect \u2013 by the way, each one of the last few years, our team in China has warned that we may see fewer signings this year than they did in the prior year. Through 2014, they've been proven wrong and we've continued to sign tremendous volume. But I suspect, again, that right now our expectations for 2015 would be China will sign fewer hotels. We'll bring fewer hotels into the pipeline than we brought in in 2014. And it might be less than we open, although I doubt that still, because I think the openings are still to come and that's a multiyear thing. In any event, you can see different dynamics in different countries based on this. And I'm hopeful that longer term one of the advantages we will have in the next downturn will be that we've got a big globe out there with growth that's coming from lots of different markets and they're not all trading in tandem anymore. So, obviously, you've got the U.S. which is dramatically stronger than much of the Rest of the World. And if we could envision an environment which U.S. growth tempered a bit and that would have some impact here. But that may or may not be duplicated in other markets of the world and maybe we don't end up with the same volatility we've had in the past. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. That's helpful. And, Carl, just a housekeeping note. You've talked about the Delta acquisition being accretive in 2016, but I think you said noisy in 2015. Is there any detail you can put behind that so that we're not surprised by headline result on these quarters? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Yeah, we think, with transition costs, transaction costs and just implementing all that, it will probably cost us a couple of pennies in 2015. But that's not in our guidance, Bill. And what we'll do is, as we incur those, we'll point them out to you as we hit those things. We're still obviously sharpening the pencil and finalizing all those estimates right now. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. My question is on... Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: ...fee guidance. You guys talked about 14% to 15% type growth in 1Q kind of implies 9% 2Q through 4Q. Could you help quantify any of the year-over-year comp issues related to termination or deferred fees that might skew the growth rates in those two periods? And, especially in light of you guys mentioned an FX headwind, I would think a lot of that or a good portion of that would show up in 1Q. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think in the first quarter we've got sort of a chunkier \u2013 a positive chunkier relicensing fee number, which come through the franchise fee line. As existing hotels sell, there are fees that are collected with the sort of relicensing to the new buyer. And there's at least one meaningfully good-sized portfolio, maybe two ,that will close in the first quarter, which will help us in Q1. So that may be offsetting what I think you're right about, which is that the FX impact on fees would be otherwise we would guess most significant in Q1. Obviously if currency stays where they are by the time you get to Q4, the comparisons will get easier and easier. Certainly the full year fee growth number is impacted by the FX by I would think something like $20 million to $25 million even. We think $17 million is the fee number if you look compared to full year 2014 actual currency. But if you look at sort of where we expected currency to be when we released our third quarter earnings, if anything, the impact on fees is even a little bit more than that. Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : And we had it \u2013 in the third quarter of 2014, we had a $15 million deferred fee that was recognized. So you've got a tough comparison in that quarter. And that was \u2013 you can read more about that in the press release for Q3. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Those would be the two biggest. Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. Thanks. And then second question also on fee guidance, maybe approaching it from a different perspective. You mentioned that incentive fees, which is largely international, still you expect to grow low double-digits. Your other two buckets, I think base is 70% domestic and franchise 90%. What type of growth rates are you guys kind of thinking about to get to that 9% to 11% range for 2015? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We don't really have that handy. But clearly, given the U.S. numbers, we'll expect franchise fees to grow faster than managed fees. We have \u2013 the hotels that were recently opened in 2014 and the hotels that will open in 2015 in the United States will skew heavily towards franchised Select-Service and Extended Stay hotels. And managed portfolio by comparison will not be adding the same kind of unit growth. So even though we'd expect RevPAR numbers between managed hotels and franchised hotels to be roughly comparable, the unit growth impact to those things will be quite different. And then, of course, you get to the Rest of the World and there we'll see that the FX impact is most pronounced coming out of Europe, for example. And I don't have this in concrete terms for you today, but certainly the FX impact is likely to eat up the RevPAR growth and maybe even a fair measure of the new unit growth that would otherwise drive growth in both management and franchise fees. That will be much less the case in other regions around the world, but there will still be some FX impact. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There will be some. Canada. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citigroup. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you, for your Moxy brand, what are the per-key cost to develop that? And is that all new builds or is that a conversion opportunity as well? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The Moxy in Europe is all new builds. And our biggest partner there is Inter IKEA, which is a affiliate, but not owned by or in any way sort of directly affiliated with the IKEA retail network. But the folks who are owning those hotels and developing them bring a lot of engineering skill and, as a consequence, are doing new build, often modular construction, and the ex-land cost is in the \u20ac40,000 to \u20ac50,000 per room range. Something like that. In the United States, we are going to be I think much more focused initially on center urban environments. As a consequence, the absolute cost numbers will be higher. The use of modular construction will be either nonexistent or certainly much rarer. And... Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There'll be a lot of adaptive reuse (1:09:47) Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's a little hard to predict. So I don't \u2013 I know we've signed a couple of deals in Manhattan. I'm sure the cost per room is sort of well into the $100s. But I can't tell you off the top of my head what it is exactly. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just a housekeeping thing. What was the share count at the end of the quarter? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We'll look that up for you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'll come back to that one. Let's take the next question. We'll throw that one back in if you stay online. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Arne, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that 60% of your new Rewards members have come from what you call the new generation members. Any early sense of where the brand appeal is for this new group of travelers, and if there's an opportunity for any of your brands' RevPAR index to move up on the back of kind of where this new group is staying? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, we're obviously focused on \u2013 we had a meeting last week where we brought our senior operators in from around the world, which is something we do every January to talk \u2013 or every February to talk about priorities and things. We had a millennial group in to work with us on the second day of the meeting. I talked to every one of those folks as they left afterwards, and every one of them said I hate that you call me a millennial. And I think \u2013 I start with that only because I think it's \u2013 we're all talking about millennials or next generation or whatever. They are not a monolithic group. And what we see is that they are 20-something-year-old and 30-something-year-old professionals, consultants, road warriors that are already heavily invested in our brands. They are in many respects not that dissimilar from earlier generations of heavy travelers. They may be more technologically connected and obviously that's important to them. But they're maybe quite similar to earlier generations and quite different from some of their peers who we tend to focus on more when we say they are technologically addicted maybe, they are focused on lifestyle, they're focused on food and beverage. And we think they are flavors of all of that there, which of course is one of the reasons we have rolled out this new portfolio of lifestyle brands. And I think, with it, we will and are already finding that we're capturing their interest through both the hotels that we're opening and some of the great things we're doing in the marketing space. And we are committed through them, but also through all of our other vehicles to continue to drive index as well. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : So in answer to the question about shares, so we ended the year with 280 million shares and about 6 million shares of dilution, which would take you for diluted shares at year-end to approximately 286 million. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. And then one final one \u2013 sorry, one final one that I had just kind of going back to the IMF fees. You outlined at your Investor Day that 20% of North American IMFs come from New York. And I was wondering if your plus 6% group outlook for 1Q and plus 5% outlook for 2015 holds true in an important market like New York, kind of what your group outlook is given the additional supply that we've seen? And then that's it. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't have a group number for you for New York, but Q1 New York could well be negative. You've got Super Bowl, you've got snowstorms, and you've got supply. When we look at our New York numbers, and this is not group only, but whole hotel sort of numbers, we would expect New York to be a few hundred basis points south of the rest of the U.S., and probably the first quarter to be meaningfully the weakest quarter of the four. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. If you compare on the group side \u2013 I don't have the number, but if you just think last year had the Super Bowl, which would be heavy group and not this year, you have a very tough comp relative to group business in the first quarter. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you all very much. We appreciate your time and attention this morning and I look forward to welcoming you into our hotels around the world. Get on the road and travel. Hope to see you soon. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Bye, bye. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Marriott International conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Pettibone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Stephen Pettibone : Thank you Tina, and thanks to all of you for dialing into Starwood\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Bruce Duncan, the Chairman of our Board of Directors; Adam Aron, our CEO, on an interim basis and Tom Mangas, our CFO and Executive Vice President. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Starwood\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today\u2019s call on our website at www.starwoodhotels.com. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Bruce for his comments. Bruce Duncan : Thank you, Stephen. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before I turn the call over to Adam for an overview of the quarter and the initiatives Starwood is working on and then on to Tom for a review of the financials, I want to begin with a brief comment on today\u2019s other announcement. This morning, we announced that the Starwood board will be exploring the full range of strategic and financial alternatives to increase shareholder value. Our board has always been focused on maximizing long-term shareholder value and continuously considers potential value creating ideas and opportunities. As we promised when Adam was named CEO on an interim basis, we are taking aggressive steps to accelerate Starwood\u2019s growth, improve performance and sharpen our focus on operational excellence. You will hear more about that from Adam and Tom on today\u2019s call. This is clearly a time of enormous opportunity and change in our industry. And accordingly the board has decided to thoroughly explore the full range of strategic and financial alternatives available to Starwood in order to capitalize on our industry leading global platform and best in class premium brands. Let me be clear, no option is off the table. As to timing, we will take the time we need to carefully review our alternatives and achieve the best results for our shareholders, business partners and associates. I hope you can appreciate that we\u2019re not going to say any more about the process at this time. Regarding permanent CEO succession a thorough search process including external and internal candidates is proceeding on a parallel track and our team is working with Korn Ferry to complete the search in a timely manner. We are also continuing to execute on our asset light strategy and the other initiatives we will discuss later on this call. With that I\u2019d like to thank you again for tuning in today and now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Adam. Adam? Adam Aron : Thank you Bruce and good afternoon everyone. While there\u2019s been understandable attention to the board\u2019s announcement this morning, we also have news with encouraging first quarter for Starwood. As Bruce mentioned, we\u2019ll begin with a brief overview of our quarterly results and expectations for the second quarter and full year 2015 and then quickly discuss with you four topics : Initiatives we\u2019re driving to one, accelerate the pace of our growth; two, sharpen our focus on strengthening the appeal of our brands, both to consumers and hotel owners; three, deliver on our asset light strategy; and four, increase our operational efficiency. Our CFO Tom Mangas will then drill down on our financial results for Q1 and expectations beyond. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks Bruce, Tom and I will be delighted to take any questions you may have. Let\u2019s start with our first quarter 2015 results. Adjusted EBITDA was $274 million and EPS before special items was $0.65; both were above the high end of our expectations. Our owned hotels performed particularly well in the quarter, increasing profit margins by some 110 basis points. Around the world, we grew REVPAR index which is a proxy for our market share in the quarter for fully seven out of our nine brands that were in the marketplace in Q1. This all sets Starwood up for a better outlook for the full year 2015. Accordingly, we are raising our guidance range for the year. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.185 billion to $1.210 billion, up $10 million from the previous guidance range. We also now expect EPS to be between $2.94 to $3.04, again before special items, up $0.07 from the previous guidance range. Having been in this interim role as CEO at Starwood for mere 10 weeks but in that time having had the chance to visit all three of our divisions and meet with and listen to almost 1,000 of our hotel general managers, over 150 of our hotel owners and countless of our passionate leaders and associates, this has been a time for me to do a ton of listening. That listening combined with a long standing proximity to the issues facing Starwood as a member of the board since 2006 and as previously declared in my first phone conversation with you in February, a bias for action. [Ph] This all has made it possible to put our senior leadership team in a position to rapidly come to some key conclusions about what Starwood should be doing right now to accelerate our progress on a broad array of fronts. Starwood is a company with many significant strengths, but we are well aware even so that we need that boldly and intelligently and in some cases, differently than before in order to advance the pace of making real progress for our company. First with respect to growth. The first quarter of 2015 started well. For new properties in our system, we opened 20 new Starwood Hotels in the first quarter, doubling the 10 hotels open in the first quarter of 2014. We opened or converted new Starwood properties for nine of our 10 hotel brands including five Sheratons, three Westin and Le M\u00e9ridien hotels, three Luxury Collection and Tribute Portfolio hotels, one St. Regis and eight Aloft, Four Points and elements hotels. The interest, eight of the 20 opened hotels were conversions from other hotel company brands which is encouraging and a high priority for us because conversions can be a meaningful part of Starwood\u2019s growth but also those hotels can come into system more quickly than the new build development. We also signed deals in the first quarter for 33 more new hotels, up 18% from the 28 signing in the first quarter last year. That number, 33 is the highest number of new deals we\u2019ve signed in a first quarter since 2008. Five of the 33 are Sheraton hotels, five are Westins or Le M\u00e9ridiens and fully 22 are Four Points, Aloft and elements luxury hotels. Of note, highlighting a pick-up in our North American development activity, first quarter signings for North American hotels are up 70% from the same quarter last year. Significant hotel deal flow is now coming into our development stats. To that end, we\u2019re also pleased to be able to report the several conversions are now in work which we expect will open in calendar year 2015. Indeed a handsome St. Regis conversion was announced just this morning and is now open to hotel guests for example. We\u2019re also seeing increasing demand from owners and developers to Le M\u00e9ridien for both conversion as well as new builds. In fact, we\u2019re planning to open more Le M\u00e9ridien hotels in 2015 than in any year since we acquired brand, in 2005. More information on these 2015 conversions for the new openings and additional development signings will be announced at the appropriate time. Also in the quarter at our behest an independent third-party was commissioned to interview owners of more than 2,700 hotels and 500,000 hotel rooms globally. These included Starwood hotel owners and our competitor hotel owners. The results of these candid interviews are in and we\u2019ve already gained meaningful insight about what Starwood does well now and specifically how we can and will do a better job stimulating growth as we move forward with the owner community. Being more communicative, more flexible and more responsive with current and prospective hotel owners and speeding up Starwood decision making, all our actions that are now directly in our gun sites to enable us to continue to look for growth at an accelerated pace. An example of that accelerated pace was the fast-tracking of the launch of our 10th brand, the Tribute Portfolio on April 16th. We moved quickly to bring Tribute to market and did so with a comprehensive brand launch. Admittedly this is still a void for Starwood. The Tribute Portfolio allows us to address the four star upper upscale independent hotel markets and now gives Starwood a credible horse in the autograph serial and now Tribute race. Our own five star Luxury Collection brand has been in place for two decades with some 100 hotels and is a significant driver of pace for Starwood. Given Starwood\u2019s considerable experience with collection brands as evidence by the Luxury Collection, we have every confidence that Tribute is a brand that also will be a significant driver of fee growth for Starwood. We\u2019re starting with the five deals we announced when the Tribute Portfolio brand launched and we anticipate to rapid take-off and meaningful fee streams from Tribute, going from five hotels, to 10, to 25 to 50 at a relatively fast cliff. Given the conversations we\u2019ve been having with owners, developer interest from around the world in Tribute has clearly been keen. We expect Tribute Portfolio to be a global brand within year one and we expect to get to a 100 Tribute Portfolio hotels with four or five years. Second topic, we\u2019re sharply focused on the strength and appeal of our now, 10 hotel brands. Given Starwood\u2019s longstanding reputation as an innovative brand builder, another key strategy to accelerate growth is to make sure that all of our brands are distinct and sharp and at the top of consumers\u2019 minds through focused and effective marketing and sales efforts. That focus will start with Sheraton, our largest and one of our most important brands. Sheraton represents more than 40% of our global room footprint and has been for many years our fastest growing brand in absolute terms. In many parts of the world, Sheraton\u2019s solid and enduing reputation makes it the brand to be and the first choice of hotel owners in emerging markets. But in certain developed markets like North America Sheraton needs to be significantly reinvigorated with a boost that can only come from top notch marketing. We believe it\u2019s time that we once again elevate Sheraton as a global brand of choice, innovate with its product and design, focus on the fundamentals of providing excellent service, cut through with distinctive marketing communications and branding efforts. In short, crystallize for both consumers and hotel owners what the Sheraton brand stands for as a unique and differentiated brand. To that end, in conjunction with the NYU Hospitality Conference at the beginning of June, we will lay out a comprehensive and what we think is a bold marketing effort to give Sheraton its due place in the sun. We expect that plan then will be immediately implemented beginning in the second half of 2015. Once more, we believe we can accomplish all this with already budgeted, committed or redeployed funding. So, we do not expect any incremental cost impact on Starwood\u2019s bottom line or to that of our hotels as we move to drive top line revenue growth at Sheraton. The attention we\u2019re devoting to Sheraton will be devoted to each of our other brands in turn. There\u2019s opportunity to grow revenue at a faster pace in each of our brands. Along with Sheraton, we\u2019ve identified that Starwood can benefit most immediately from heightened marketing and sales activity focused on our Luxury Collection, Westin, W, and Aloft brands. To that end on Monday of this week, we announced internally a significant strengthening of our global brands group including putting some of Starwood\u2019s strongest marketing executives in charge of high opportunity brands. Fully five of our ten brands will benefit from this new invigorated leadership. While we\u2019re certainly aware that Starwood was late coming to the select serve hospitality segment, we are now making progress on select serve as well. We\u2019re on track to open more select serve hotels in 2015 than in any year since 2009. While that\u2019s a positive story, it does not change the fact that we\u2019ve got fewer than 200 select serve properties in North America and just over 300 globally. Therefore, we\u2019re putting additional dedicated development resources on the ground to grow our select serve footprint. We\u2019re also allocating additional marketing spend this year to drive greater brand awareness of Aloft and are taking another hard look at the design of brand hallmarks at Aloft, Four Points and element to make sure that they\u2019re cost effective to build. Third, let me turn to asset dispositions. At Starwood, we continue to reaffirm our previously announced commitment to sell at least $800 million in hotel assets in 2015 on top of the $200 million to $250 million in hotel asset value included in the SVO spinoff as well as reaffirming our $3 billion goal in cumulative asset sales through the end of 2016. The transaction market remains strong. And based on conversations that we have been having related to various specific assets, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll hit both targets. What\u2019s more, with respect to the $800 million 2015 objective, we believe you\u2019ll see this spread throughout the balance of this year rather than being backend loaded. We should be in a position to make more specific announcements on specific transactions rather soon. The fourth subject for me to cover is our tangible work to improve Starwood\u2019s operational efficiency at the corporate level and throughout our network of hotels. It\u2019s become one of our most repeated internal rallying cries of late in striving to deliver superior returns, both to our shareholders and for our hotel owners. We will need both to drive top line revenue growth but also to better manage the cost side of our business. In doing so, Starwood could become a leaner, more nimble company, one that is less bureaucratic and one that makes decisions faster. That\u2019s why over the past two months, we\u2019ve had a companywide task force taking a concerted look at the costs associated with running our organization and putting each of our various programs under a microscope to determine what works well and what should be strengthened and conversely what efforts should be jettisoned or sun-setted. As a result, we will be reducing overlap and redundancy, we also can and will give our divisions more flexibility to better adapt to local market conditions and situations. And I\u2019ll particularly note we\u2019ll be reducing our overhead costs. Tom Mangas will further cover our plan to generate $25 million in run rate SG&A savings in 2016 and beyond and how we\u2019re also freeing up between $50 million and $60 million in centralized services monies for redeployment, the higher priority spending designed to stimulate revenue growth. As part of our cost cutting work on corporate SG&A, it does make sense to call out one specific saving among many because leadership starts at the top. To show that we\u2019re serious about getting leaner and serious about being more sensitive to costs, my first decision in cost cutting was to cancel the lease on Starwood\u2019s G-IV private aircraft. The vast majority of my travels since stepping in mid-February has been on commercial airlines. The opportunity to reduce our overhead expenditures in ways that will not affect our hotel guest negatively, not even one iota is well underway and will continue. With that here is Tom Mangas, our CFO to review the quarter in more detail. Tom Mangas : Thank you, Adam. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us on the call. I\u2019ll focus my remarks on our results in the first quarter, our guidance on the second quarter and full year, our restructuring efforts, and an update on our balance sheet. Worldwide systemwide REVPAR for same-store hotels in the first quarter was up 5.2% in constant dollars and 1.9% when accounted for foreign exchange impacts. The REVPAR growth was in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter and in line with our expectations. Worldwide systemwide average daily rate increased 2% in constant dollars and occupancy grew 180 basis points in North America and 230 basis points internationally. Our management and franchise fees or core fees grew 1.6% versus 2014, below our expectations of 3% to 5%, driven by about 50 basis points of additional FX headwinds in the latter half of the quarter and weaker Maldives, Macau and Southeast Asia performance. Constant dollar core fee growth was approximately 5%. Management fees, franchise fees and other income decreased 3.2% versus the last year, primarily due to a large termination fee in the first quarter of 2014. We had exceptionally strong performance at our owned hotels in the quarter with worldwide same-store owned hotel REVPAR up 8.4% in constant dollars. This was well above our expectations and reflected strength across almost our entire portfolio of hotels. Because of that strong REVPAR growth, we were able to drive margin improvement at owned hotels of 110 basis points. At the brand level, we were very pleased with our international and North America Aloft REVPAR growth of 24% and 13% respectively. At our vacation ownership and residential business, we exceeded our expectation with earnings of $50 million. These results were driven by strong resort performance, as well as an adjustment to our loan loss reserve as result of continued improvements in the quality of our loan portfolio. The planned spin-off of our vacation ownership business remains on track and our team\u2019s done a hard at work on the Form 10, which we expect to file with the SEC within the next couple of months. We still expect to complete the spin-off in the fourth quarter of this year. SG&A expense came in 4.2% below last year\u2019s levels. While some of the cost decrease is due to timing differences, we\u2019ve been taking a hard look at our costs. During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded restructuring and other special charges of $31 million. This included $8 million for cost restructuring activities for which we are already reaping benefits. These charges also included $7 million related to the departure of our former President and CEO in February, the establishment of a $6 million reserve related to liabilities assumed in the 2005 acquisition of Le M\u00e9ridien and finally, cost associated with the planned SVO spin-off. We expect to incur additional expenses during the year as we restructure our business to improve our efficiency and become a linear, more agile company as Adam outlined in his remarks. I\u2019ll cover what to expect in more detail as I\u2019ll review our full year guidance. With our solid hotel top-line, strong vacation ownership results and our focus on costs, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $274 million, above our expectations and earnings per share before special items of $0.65. At the end of the quarter, our pipeline stood at 490 hotels, representing 110,000 rooms, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Now, I\u2019ll turn to the trends we\u2019re seeing around the world and how that plays into our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2015. Starting with North America, systemwide REVPAR for same-store sales in the first quarter was up 6.8%. The rate grew 4.1% and as I mentioned before occupancy expanded roughly 180 basis points. We saw double-digit REVPAR growth in the West with exceptionally strong performance at our hotels in San Francisco and Phoenix. Systemwide REVPAR at our hotels in the South grew over 8% with solid performance in Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale in particular. Hawaii remained weak due to the continued impact at our properties, due to lower inbound travel from Japan. As expected, our hotels in the North did not perform strongly with REVPAR up only 4.6%, driven down by the market REVPAR declines in New York City which has seen a large increase in supply over the past year. REVPAR at our owned and managed hotels in New York was approximately flat. We were pleased to see that across the New York region our hotels grew REVPAR index nearly 500 basis points and our owned and managed hotels in New York region grew REVPAR index by over 800 basis points. Offsetting the marketplace REVPAR weakness in New York, we saw double-digit REVPAR increases at our hotels in Boston and Chicago. Many of you have asked what trends we\u2019re seeing in our business due to the strong dollar. Looking at our SPG numbers, we did not see a material decrease in the number of international travelers inbound to either the U.S. overall or New York specifically in the first quarter. We have however seen a decrease in the average daily rate in New York from those international guests, which we believe is a pricing effect resulting from a stronger U.S. dollar. Forward bookings indicate that we may see decline in a number of inbound travelers to U.S., but at this point it is hard to quantify. Group demand in North America has been good with group revenue in the quarter up over 6% at our owned and managed hotels. Corporate group was very strong, up nearly 10% versus last year. That was helped by revenue production in the quarter for the quarter up double digits. Looking ahead, group revenue production into all years was also up double digits. That increase in production on top of that previously strong group bookings has moved our group revenue on the books for 2015 up mid single digits versus last year. That\u2019s an increase from the lower single digit pace we had in the fourth quarter of 2014. Transient performance in the quarter was up 4%, driven mostly by increases in rate. As we look into the next quarter and the rest of the year, we expect North America REVPAR to remain strong with continued expansion of both rate and occupancy. Turning to Latin America, overall REVPAR grew 4.7% in the first quarter, including roughly 70 basis points of REVPAR index gains. As has been the case over the past few quarters, performance has been varied across countries. REVPAR in Mexico continues to grow strongly, up over 20%, driven by very strong resort performance which benefited from the cold winter to the north. Brazil REVPAR was down this quarter as a result of the continued weak economic situation. Despite no material improvement in the Argentine economy, the performance at our hotels has stabilized there. Looking ahead we expect similar trends across Latin America. We\u2019re seeing encouraging trends in Europe with REVPAR up 5.1% in constant dollars, ahead of our expectations. Keep in mind, the first quarter in Europe is the seasonal low period for our mix of hotels, so it typically does not have the same weight as other quarters. Performance in Spain and Austria was very strong and Germany had a good book of tradeshow business. Looking ahead, we expect system wide Europe REVPAR for same-store hotels to be slightly softer against the strong year base. While we expect performance at our hotels in the south of Europe to be strong, we are seeing weaker trends elsewhere in Europe. In contrast to what we saw in the U.S., the stronger U.S. dollar seems to be having a positive impact on travel to Europe from the U.S., Middle East and China. Transient pace in Europe for the second quarter was up over 10% versus last year. We\u2019re seeing a double digit growth and demand for U.S. and Middle Eastern travel into Europe and an increase of roughly 30% in Chinese travel into our European hotels which we attribute to the weaker euro. REVPAR in the Middle East and Africa was up 0.8%, reflecting the continued challenges in Africa. In the Middle East where REVPAR was up 1.6% in constant dollars, strong performance at our hotels in Abu Dhabi was offset by weaker performance at our hotels in Dubai which have been negatively impacted by a lack of travel from Russia, but again partially offset by higher volumes of Chinese travelers. At our Dubai hotels, we maintained high occupancy and grew REVPAR index. We expect performance in the Middle East and Africa to remain soft in the second quarter. Turning to Greater China, REVPAR was up 0.4%; performance was pulled down by weaker demand in Hong Kong and the impact in Macau of the government anticorruption campaign. REVPAR in Mainland China was up 3.2% with REVPAR index up 70 basis points. We expect the current trends to continue in Macau and Hong Kong. In Mainland China we expect to see REVPAR improve modestly in the second quarter. REVPAR in Asia Pacific excluding greater China was up 5.7% in the first quarter in constant dollars. We saw a strong REVPAR performance in Australia, Japan and Thailand where business is returning following last year\u2019s unrest. The positive performance we had been enjoying in Indonesia reversed in the first quarter with REVPAR down, driven by new restrictions on government meetings at hotels and lower inbound travel to resorts from Russia, Australia and Middle East. While the situation in Indonesia will likely persist into the second quarter, we expect overall regional performance to benefit from continued improvements and performance in Thailand and India. Now turning to guidance : We expect worldwide systemwide REVPAR for the second quarter to be in the range of 5% to 7% on a constant dollar basis and 525 basis points lower on an actual U.S. dollar basis. That will result in core fees being roughly flat to last year. We expect total management fees, franchise fees and other income to be down 2% to flat. This is lower than core fee growth due to a large termination fee for one hotel that we received in the second quarter of last year. We expect owned hotel REVPAR to be 4% to 6% in constant dollars and 1000 basis points lower in actual U.S. dollars. We expect our vacation ownership business to deliver earnings of $40 million $45 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter should be in the range of $290 million $300 million and adjusted EPS should be $0.70 to $0.74. For the full year, we are holding our worldwide systemwide REVPAR range of 5% to 7% in constant dollars. The dollar has continued to strengthen following our last earnings call and impact of FX for the full year is now 450 basis points on a REVPAR range. Versus 2014 FX is now roughly a $45 million headwind to 2015 EBITDA. Core fees should increase 3% to 5% and total management fees, franchise fees and other income should be approximately flat due to the approximately $35 million in non-recurring termination fees in 2014 associated with five hotels. Net, we expect 2015 to be a return to a normalized level of exits which we think is a good thing for the long-term business. We expect owned hotel REVPAR to be up 4% to 6% in constant dollars, 750 basis points lower in actual U.S. dollars. Remember full year owned EBITDA will be $43 million lower this year due to the hotels we sold during 2014. We expect our vacation ownership business to deliver earnings of $150 million to $160 million for the full year as we expect the favorability we saw in the first quarter to hold and extend in the coming quarters. We are taking our guidance range for SG&A for the full year down to minus 3% to minus 1%. This reduction reflects the work we\u2019ve done subsequent to the end of the first quarter as we began developing a broader cost reduction plan that we expect to finalize in the next few weeks. We expect the restructuring will ultimately result in an annual run rate SG&A savings of approximately $25 million. That said, we expect second quarter SG&A to be up 3% to 5% due to our Tribute Portfolio launch and incremental Aloft marketing investment. In addition to the impact on our P&L, we expect the cost restructuring result in savings in our centralized services of approximately $50 million to $60 million, which we plan to redeploy to more effective guest impacting spend, like advertising. As we are in the initial stages of carrying out these plans, the specific timing of the charges and savings are still unknown. However, we expect to report further restructuring and other special charges totaling $30 million to $35 million over the next several quarters with the initiative expected to end sometime in the middle of 2016. The second quarter will likely see the largest charge as we intend to move quickly including exiting our airplane operations as Adam mentioned. We\u2019re also conducting a review of several technology projects implemented in recent years to make sure we are deploying our resources against the key business drivers of our hotels. Depending on the outcome of those reviews, there could be additional charges if we determine that it changes strategy for those technologies as wanted. We will update you on that review when we report our second quarter 2015 results. Our expectations for top-line growth and the lower SG&A should enable us to deliver total adjusted EBITDA of $1.185 billion to $1.210 billion and EPS before special items of $2.94 to $3.04. Net we\u2019re fully offsetting FX headwinds, we have experienced since our last earnings call and increasing our full year guidance range on the back of our new cost savings effort and the strength of our vacation ownership business. Our outlook for cash flow from operations is essentially unchanged from our last guidance. Turning to our balance sheet and capital return. We ended the quarter with ratings agency leverage of approximately 2.5 times and 2.8 times for S&P annuities respectively. As you may have seen in our 10-K, we did repatriate roughly $385 million of offshore cash in the first quarter to reduce debt. During the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share and repurchased 1.6 million shares at a total cost of $123 million. We continue to anticipate total repurchases of $300 million to $350 million for the full year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Stephen, who will open the Q&A. Stephen Pettibone : Thank you, Tom. We now like to open up the call to your questions. In the interest of time and fairness, please limit yourself to one question at a time and then we\u2019ll take any follow-up questions you may have if time permits. Tina, can we have the first question please? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Adam, you mentioned a number of wins in the quarter for the company and it seems like you\u2019re on the path to being positioned well and you\u2019ve reversed some of the hurdles that you previously had stood in the way for growth. So with these early wins in your pocket, I\u2019m just wondering what the thought process was behind the strategic review announcement today? Adam Aron : Felicia, it\u2019s always good to talk to you but given the question of our strategic alternatives, I am going to pass it to Bruce Duncan, our Chairman. Bruce Duncan : And I would say Felicia that again when we made the change to new leadership, our focus is on what we can do to accentuate growth. And we think that again we could always focus on maximizing long-term shareholder value and we think there is an enormous opportunity and change in our industry. We thought this is the right time to fully explore the full range of strategic financial alternatives. Again, when you look at Starwood, we got an industry leading global platform and best in class premium brands. And we just want to look at all alternatives available to us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : I wanted to just go back to your comments around Sheraton which obviously REVPAR is at a discount to other brands in that upper upscale segment. Was it your suggestion that you can raise the REVPAR for that brand without asking owners to invest more in the brand or yourself invest more in the brand? Could you just regroup what you said on that? Adam Aron : I\u2019ll be happy to. So let\u2019s start with Sheraton. The management team presented a 60-page presentation to our Board of Directors about diagnosing the current situation of Sheraton and what we can do about it. When you think about how important Sheraton is as a brand right now, the fact that somewhere in the neighborhood of $9 billion flows though our 430ish hotels in 75 countries with the Sheraton flag, it just reminds you how important a part of Starwood, Sheraton is. We have some terrific Sheraton properties around the world and we have some hotels that need more focus on the fundamentals of delivering service quality to our guests. In my prepared remarks, I said that what we\u2019re going to be announcing at NYU is fairly broad and sweeping, literally it\u2019s a 10 point plan to improve Sheraton\u2019s performance in the marketplace. It took Sheraton some time to get into its current state. So it\u2019s going to take the Sheraton brand some time to improve but improve we think that it will and we think it\u2019ll improve two ways. One, for people who have Sheraton hotels today entrusted to us, we think we\u2019ll be delivering better top line revenue and better bottom line profitability for our owners. We also think it\u2019d give more encouragement to the hotel developer community generally that Sheraton is a brand that is a good place to entrust their hotel assets. And if you look at the numbers in our first quarter announcement, Sheraton was the biggest single number of new openings and Sheraton was the biggest single number of signings, so in terms of the rooms added to our system. So, again I\u2019m being a little circumspect on what are in those 10 point plan because that\u2019s something that we\u2019d like to announce closer to the NYU conference than today. But we were very clear that we said that we did not think this would drive incremental cost to our bottom line. Not because we weren\u2019t going to invest any money in taking Sheraton forward as a brand but because we\u2019ve done so much hard work over the past 10 weeks and our senior leadership team working together in looking at how we spend our existing centralized services moneys and by cutting out the $50 million to $60 million that Tom Mangas and I both referenced. By cutting out some lower priority programs that produce returns that are more marginal and redeploying those moneys in the things that we think will have much more impact, we can deploy the same amount of moneys we\u2019re spending now and investing now but do in a way what we think we get significantly greater return. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent : Can you just talk about capital allocation buyback and total cash return? I guess I want to put all of this, if you have a strategic review in place, how do you think about buyback, total cash return, the timeshare spin and also your ability to recruit new people for some of these opportunities that you\u2019re discussing? So, it\u2019s all in the parameter of the strategic review change, how does that affect your capital allocation, timing on timeshare spend and your ability to recruit new people? Adam Aron : This is Adam, I\u2019ll take the recruit new people and pass the call off -- pass your question off to Tom. Just Monday and putting out the announcement of the executives who\u2019ll be leading our brand efforts, we were able to announce that someone who had been a Starwood veteran for a decade who left our company eight or nine years ago and is today the President and Chief Operating Officer of a legitimate but smaller hotel company is going to be rejoining Starwood, so that certainly is a example that in real time that we can attract talented people to our company. We also announced a number of internal promotions where some very able people inside our company were given a new chance to shine. As to capital allocations, I\u2019ll let Tom respond. Tom Mangas : So, right now, we\u2019re not changing any of our guidance points; we are very early in the strategic review process. And as Bruce said, all ranges of options are on the table, nothing\u2019s off the table. But until we go through the process and come to a conclusion, we\u2019re maintaining our current guidance. We\u2019re maintaining our current leverage levels of 2.5 to 3 times on an S&P measurement basis of net leverage to debt and proceeding with our repurchase program where we indicated in our last call and it\u2019s sustained in this call, a $300 million to $350 million repurchase program and proceeding with the spin. And we\u2019re running the business the way we have laid it out. And when we conclude a strategic review reprocess I\u2019m sure the board will reveal those changes at that time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry Curtis : Good afternoon. Turning to the midscale brands, Aloft and element. In your effort to increase distribution in the midscale segment, are these the two brands that are going to lead you or are there others under development? Can you give us more information about how you get better penetration in the midscale segment? Adam Aron : Well, just so we give a comprehensive answer to your question, we are looking at other brands with the company, but specifically with respect to the midscale segment, Four Points, Aloft and elements are the current vehicles that the company has at our disposal. We have 300 of them worldwide. While that\u2019s significantly subscale to our competitors, it\u2019s significantly ahead of starting a new brand from scratch we started with hotel number one. So at the moment, we\u2019re writing with Aloft, element and Four Points; we certainly do want to take a look internally about whether we should add additional select serve or mid serve brands but we\u2019re nowhere in a position close to want to be able to publicly announce that we will do anything other than go forward with Four Points, Aloft and element. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Shaun Kelley : Maybe to follow-up on earlier question but another strategic one. So, as we think about all the things that are going on, whether it\u2019s launching Tribute; cost initiatives; the Sheraton repositioning; the timeshare spin and then the broader strategic alternatives, my question is more probably for Bruce. But the question is, does that -- do you begin to impact at all the type of candidate you\u2019d be looking for when you\u2019re trying to dual track and hire a CEO, at the same time you\u2019ve already embarked on some of these pretty significant initiatives and changes? Bruce Duncan : Again, our search for the new CEO is proceeding as previously announced. We are doing a thorough search process with both external and internal candidates. And again, it\u2019s on a parallel track and we\u2019ve retained Korn Ferry and we want to complete the search in a timely manner. We\u2019re encouraged with the candidates we have. And again we\u2019re committed to identify the right leader with the relevant global experience to fill the CEO role and accelerate the company\u2019s growth. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about the candidates we\u2019re seeing. And again, we\u2019re going to do this in a timely manner. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Joe Greff : A couple of questions for Bruce. One, I think at the outset of the call Bruce, you mentioned in the context of talking about the full range of strategic alternatives you were exploring; you said this is an exciting time for the industry and the company. From your perspective, from the board\u2019s perspective, can you elicit on that comment a little bit? What do you exactly mean by that specifically? And then second part of that question, are you finding it more difficult to get external candidates to interview for the CEO spot given like it\u2019s official today but just given the potential for Starwood to explore strategic alternatives that might not necessitate an external candidate being hired? Thank you. Bruce Duncan : All right, let me start with the first one. Again, we\u2019re excited because when you look at what Starwood, the position we\u2019re in now and the strength we have with our unparalleled high-end global footprint and a reputation for innovation; we\u2019ve got a great platform. You look at the work Adam and Tom and the team are doing in terms of accelerating growth and building upon our world class brand. We\u2019re pretty excited about the opportunity we have. But we think again we can even do more and that\u2019s what everyone is working on. I also think that if you look out and you see the world today, the capital markets are good that we think consolidation, it\u2019s interesting to look at and I think that we\u2019re going to pursue all alternatives. And we think that that is the right thing to do in looking at how we can maximize value for our shareholders. But again, we\u2019re going to take all the time we need on this to come up with the right solution that works for our shareholders, our business partners and our associates and we\u2019re pretty excited about the position we have, that Starwood has as it is today. I would say in terms of the second one, in terms of attracting talent, I think there is no question that certain people you won\u2019t be able to attract given what\u2019s going on. But what we\u2019re seeing right now we\u2019re pretty excited about the candidates we have in the pool and again we\u2019re proceeding in a timely manner on that. And in the meantime Adam and the team is moving full speed ahead executing on the strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Robert W. Baird. David Loeb : This one is for Bruce, although not about the process per se but just given your time on the board and say over the last 10 years what\u2019s been the view of the board and of management in terms of looking at broadening the brand offering, including moving more aggressively into lower end brands? Can you give us a little historical perspective there? Bruce Duncan : Well again, I would just say that from our standpoint what I think is unique about Starwood and it\u2019s very special, is our dominance in the upper upscale and luxury area. I think it\u2019s fantastic. Again, as Adam pointed out, we\u2019re a little subscale on the limited service areas with our three offerings and 300 hotels. But we\u2019re very excited about the position we have. And the issue now is as we look for the financial alternatives, is to look at what\u2019s available and look at what we can do that makes the most sense. And we\u2019re going to be doing that and we\u2019re going to do a thorough review of both the strategic and financial alternatives we have in front of us to move our growth up. David Loeb : And is this the first time that\u2019s come up or has it been something that been discussed over the last decade? Bruce Duncan : We\u2019re not going to talk about -- there is no future in the past, but we continually have discussions in terms of how we can move thing forward, maximize value. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Bhalla with FBR. Nikhil Bhalla : Adam, you talked about doing asset sales and sort of having them culminated by the end of 2016 which by that definition kind of implies that asset sales are going to accelerate versus what was said under your predecessor. So, question here is one, what do you have to give up to get it? What are you going to be doing differently than what was contemplated during your predecessor\u2019s time? Thank you. Adam Aron : Well, just to be clear, the $3 billion target by the end of 2016 is exactly what the company has heretofore laid out as if timeline. The $800 million target for 2015 plus the $200 million and $250 million on top of hotels going with the SVO spin are also in line with the company has previously announced. So, there is not an acceleration as implied in your question. What is true however is our confidence that we will get this done. And in prior periods, some of you in this call might have been critical about Starwood about where we laser like focused on asset sale dispositions. I can promise you that we are now, and what we are doing differently is making sure that any internal roadblocks or bottlenecks that slow down decision making are removed. And we can come the grips with opportunities for Starwood fast and sometimes opportunities for Starwood involve growth and sometimes opportunities for Starwood mean capitalizing on how transaction markets and disposing of hotel assets all the while retaining long-term management the franchise agreements on an expeditious timeframe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeff Donnelly : Just a question for you, Bruce; I\u2019m curious if you are already a third of the way through asset sales and in the process of spinning out timeshare, can you talk about what the catalyst was for the decision to explore alternatives that wasn\u2019t going to be accomplished by those initiatives? And I guess as a follow-up, do you give equal odds to a strategic brand acquisition as you do to maybe a partial or outright sale? Bruce Duncan : Again we\u2019re going to explore all strategic and financial alternatives, so everything is on the table. So, we\u2019re not going to speculate to which one -- what we end up doing. But again we\u2019re focused; we\u2019re going to take all the time we need to get the right answer. And from our standpoint, that\u2019s the focus. In terms of we like the position we\u2019re in, we think we have a wonderful position as we stand but we think that this is the right time to look at the markets; you look at the capital markets; it\u2019s the right time to look at all alternatives and we\u2019re going to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : I guess I was going to ask you whether you think the company\u2019s biggest challenge is its brand positioning or whether it\u2019s too much owned assets. So I don\u2019t know how much you will address that question but I also was going to ask you what do you think is the driver of the acceleration in REVPAR in China as well here after Q1? Adam Aron : Well, on this issue of brand positioning versus owned assets, Robin you\u2019ve sort of posed almost as a dichotomy; they\u2019re unique and different situations. My own view is the company is on a declared path to go asset light. We\u2019re highly confident in our ability to deliver on the asset light strategy and we\u2019ll do so. On the issue of brands in terms of an opportunity, while we sit with some very strong brands and several of Starwood\u2019s 10 brands are real powerhouses in their categories, there are others of our brands that are not. And I\u2019ve already talked about the fact that we\u2019re going to turn the company on its head and focus on Sheraton which is 40% of our company. With respect to facility in China, let me pass it to Tom. Tom Mangas : Yes, I would simply say that as you look at the results in Mainland kind of specific, we think that improvement comes out of Mainland China. As you saw just a really tough February period there, Chinese New Year which for the entire market the REVPARs were down almost high single digits; we just think that was a Chinese New Year phenomenon; we saw March whilst down, not nearly down that same level. So, it\u2019s simply a trending assessment where we think that the second quarter is going to be better than some of the market dynamics we saw in the first quarter. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Two questions surprisingly on fundamentals. First, one of your peers earlier talked about there being a weather impact on both U.S/ and systemwide REVPAR in the first quarter. You guys made some comments about the Northeast being slightly softer. Anyway, you could quantify the percent of weather impact to REVPAR? Second question, can you just talk about the Aloft REVPAR growth in the quarter, why it was so strong? Adam Aron : I\u2019ll take weather. I live in the Northeast United States, it was cold this winter. Beyond that if you look at our REVPAR performance in North America, we had a good first quarter. That\u2019s one of the many reasons why we were able to increase our guidance range for the year. So we\u2019re -- we haven\u2019t taken the time to try to look back and quantify a weather impact per se and we\u2019re pleased with the results that we posted in North America in Q1. As for why Aloft is improving, Tom why don\u2019t you take that one? Tom Mangas : Sure, I mean what I\u2019d say, we\u2019re beginning to get critical mass and our marketing programs are starting to take hold. And so what you\u2019re seeing is our RPIs are growing dramatically. So our Aloft REVPAR index grew in North America but grew even more substantially in the rest of Asia, Europe and Africa, Middle East where we\u2019re putting lots of hotels. So, I think it\u2019s an element of -- a matter of getting critical mass and marketing focus here which is a lot of what our plans are about in this year including up spinning marketing support in the second quarter to continue to accelerate that growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : But the question on guidance, just parsing out the different moving parts, there seems to be a lot of changes quarter-to-quarter. And so by my reading, you had a beat in the first quarter and then you\u2019re raising the full year essentially by that amount and maybe slightly above that but we\u2019ve got G&A savings; we\u2019ve got that offset by a little worse on the FX side. Can you tell us, maybe articulate what your expectations are for the U.S., specifically for the balance of the year? Tom Mangas : So, let me answer the first part. So, we are increasing the full year guidance by $10 million, it is largely on the back of our vacation ownership success in the first quarter and carrying through to the year and on the back of SG&A, offsetting the FX headwind. And so that is how we\u2019re delivering the full year. Relative to North America, North America has performed in line of our expectations this first quarter and we really haven\u2019t materially changed our outlook for the North America region in the year ahead versus what we had at the beginning of the year and I expect it to perform in a similar range as it performed in the current quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Guys, in the past, you often would or the prior management team I should say would often talk about the owned real estate business and the thoughts around potentially trying to spin that out into a REIT structure. One of the pushbacks I believe was always the scope and the friction cost. Is that something that is on the table today and is that even feasible in your view from a size perspective as well as the geographic skew perspective? Tom Mangas : Let me first say that I think as we do the strategic review process, any of these ideas, package could back on the table as Frits mentioned in our call in February, we did try a bundled sale process in the first-half of 2014 that didn\u2019t go anywhere and that was part of our delay in getting asset sales out the door in 2014. I do think we suffered from a lack of critical mass. But U.S. assets that could fit well in a REIT structure; we\u2019ve got several assets in Europe and so I think it is in Central and South America that can\u2019t benefit from that kind of REIT spin. So we have been pursuing a course of one-off asset sales and as Adam said, I think we are expecting to have a I\u2019ll call more evenly balanced distribution of asset sales based on what we in the pipeline for disposals in 2015 than what you saw last year. But again as I said, we\u2019re not taking anything of the table in the context of the strategic review. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James & Associates. Bill Crow : Let me first, Bruce and Adam, give kudos to the board for actually taking some concrete steps here over the last six months. It\u2019s very much appreciated. My question really has to do with the strategic review and how that might impact unit growth. I mean that\u2019s been the challenge to Starwood for a while and if you\u2019re a developer and owner, how do you convince them to sign a long-term contract with you if you may be owned by somebody else in a year or the strategic review is undergoing? Adam Aron : We have some very strong brands. And no matter how the future of this company unfolds, our brands will endure; our brands will be potent; our brands can only be stronger than they are today. And those will be the messages we\u2019ll be carrying out to the hotel ownership and development community. As I said in my earlier remarks, we\u2019re also going to get much more aggressive in our communications with owners, and our flexibility in dealing with owners, and are being responsive to owners. And this is a relationship business in many respects, and don\u2019t underestimate how powerful it is if the senior management team of Starwood is in active dialogue with those people who control assets and are trying to figure out where they should best go. So, we have every confidence that we\u2019ll continue to fair well in getting developers and owners to entrust their precious assets to the brands in the Starwood. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : A quick question on select service. What is your appetite to use the balance sheet to increase ownership in the short-term to accelerate the growth in that segment? Adam Aron : This is Adam, I\u2019ll take it. We have a significant appetite to use our balance sheet to accelerate growth and we\u2019re already doing it right now. We\u2019re in active dialogue with one owner and one developer and after another. If there is an opportunity to get to package with some owner developers and multiple hotel assets in select serve that\u2019s appeal to us. If your question is much bigger and broader than that in terms of when we use our balance sheet in a huge way to accelerate our growth select serve segment that\u2019s a question that harkens right back to the strategic and financial alternative review that Bruce discussed before. And we\u2019re not going to make a comment beyond statement that Bruce made which we think is important and clear and speaks for itself. Stephen Pettibone : Thank you, Adam. I want to thank all of you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest in Starwood Hotels and Resorts. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s Starwood Hotels and Resorts\u2019 first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to hand today's program over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, President and CEO of Marriott International. Please go ahead. Arne M. Sorenson: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. For those of you who joined our call early, we hope you enjoyed the music, courtesy of our new global marketing partnership with Universal Music Group. UMG is the world's leader in music with a portfolio of top labels including Capitol Music Group, Def Jam Recordings and Island Records among others. This partnership will enable us to better engage next generation experience seekers with Marriott Rewards member-only access to UMG events and concerts. British singer and songwriter, Ellie Goulding, helped launch this partnership last month with a live performance at the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel. Stay tuned for more exciting events coming up around the world. Speaking of entertainment, as of the second quarter, we were the first hotel company to offer Netflix programming in our guest rooms. Our collaboration with Netflix reflects changing consumer preferences in how guests want to access and watch content while they travel. We expect to offer Netflix in more than 100 properties by the end of 2015. Our Moxy brand is hitting the road and will be showcasing its model guestroom around the country. Built for transport in a shipping container, the Moxy guestroom mark-up made its debut at Alice in LA earlier this year. Now not only will it be on display but it will also be the setting for a new YouTube eight-part series. Created by Marriott's content studio, the series will be hosted by comedian, Taryn Southern, creator and star of Taryn TV. She'll interview and gossip with guest celebrities revealing their travel habits and quirky experiences on the road. So watch for this coming up on YouTube. Before going further, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, July 30, 2015, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our Web-site at www.marriott.com/investor. Before we get into our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about two industry questions. First, there's been a lot of discussion about the strength of demand and the pace of RevPAR growth. Undoubtedly a slower pace of RevPAR growth is likely to occur at some point in North America as economic growth matures. Trees don't grow to the sky. In fact, you may recall, at our Analyst Meeting last year that we started our four year RevPAR growth rate scenarios with a 4% handle. While this slower pace is likely at some point, we think it is premature to call it today. Based on our data, we believe North American industry RevPAR growth will be solid for the foreseeable future, impacted quarter to quarter by calendar shifts and unusual events. Our RevPAR results support this view. Our system-wide North American RevPAR rose 5.1% in April, 4.7% in May and 6.4% in June. Early in the quarter, our results were constrained by civil unrest in Baltimore and flooding in Texas. Recent group bookings are very strong. North American Full-Service Group business booked in the second quarter for all future periods rose over 8% year-over-year. In fact, meeting planners are worried about securing availability more than negotiating hard on rate. You've heard a lot about the tough third quarter comparisons. Last year, our third quarter North American Full-Service Group RevPAR was very strong benefiting from the favorable holiday pattern. As we started 2015, our group pace for this year's third quarter was down 2% reflecting those tough comparisons. Since then with strong short-term bookings, our third quarter pace has improved to plus 3%. Given this improving group business and our continued strong transient demand, we expect North America system-wide RevPAR will increase 4% to 6% for the third quarter. Our fourth quarter should be even better. Group revenue pace for our full-service hotels for the fourth quarter is up 9% today. Given the tight supply of meeting space at many hotels, we would expect fewer last-minute group bookings and therefore we expect our actual group revenue growth rate will be closer to 7% when the quarter is over. With this strength, we are expecting fourth quarter North American system-wide RevPAR to increase 5% to 7%, probably biased a bit to the upper end of the range. Net-net, our RevPAR expectations for 2015 are fundamentally unchanged from a quarter ago. We expect 2016 will be solid as well. Already roughly 55% of our expected group business is on the books and group revenue pace is up about 7% having improved 3 percentage points in the last 12 months. It's a bit early for us to outline our RevPAR expectations for 2016 but STR is forecasting U.S. industry RevPAR to increase roughly 6%. Supply is another common question about our industry. In the U.S., the modest pace of economic growth combined with lender caution has constrained lodging supply growth for the past five years. While construction starts are picking up, STR doesn't expect U.S. supply will reach even the historical average growth rate until 2017. But there is more to the story. Today new supply is largely in the limited service category and focused in secondary and tertiary markets. In fact, in STR's under-construction, final planning or planning U.S. pipeline in the U.S. over 55% of the new rooms are outside the top 25 markets, and many of these markets haven't seen significant supply growth in a very long time. Development and ownership of new hotels is very diverse. Lodging Econometrics reports that over 900 unique owners are building hotels in the USA today, with merely 85% of them controlling just a single project. Financing is easier and averaging 70% to 75% loan-to-value, yet developers remain very selective about the rooms they choose. Lodging Econometrics also reports that Marriott International brands account for a quarter of the U.S. under-construction pipeline, well ahead of our 11% existing room share. This preference for strong brands is also revealed in recent conversion activity. While we typically expect to see a greater number of conversions in an economic downturn, high levels of U.S. conversions have persisted even as the economy recovered. Marriott has benefited from this flight to quality. The successful launch of the Autograph brand followed more recently by industry copycat brands reflects this reality. By the way, at quarter end we had 86 Autographs open worldwide with another 42 projects in our development pipeline, making it one of the fastest hotel brand launches ever. Looking ahead we believe conversions to our system are likely to step up as our new Delta brand will focus on the conversion market. In just two months we have already received inquiries regarding the possible conversion of more than 50 hotels in the U.S. and Canada. Including Delta, we expect to open roughly 55,000 rooms in 2015, reflecting roughly 8% gross room additions. We believe our growing share of hotels is largely due to our strong brands and revenue platforms. In fact, guests booked roughly $12 billion of gross room reservations on Marriott.com globally in the last 12 months, with roughly $2 billion on Marriott Mobile alone. With nearly 52 million members, Marriott Rewards puts us closer to our guests, rewards their loyalty and allows us to better understand their needs. We are pleased with our record 250,000 room pipeline but it's not just room volume that sets us apart from the competition. With our strong RevPAR index, concentration in higher room rate markets and brands as well as profitable and consistent long-term contracts, our rooms generate better terms and greater value than implied by the room numbers alone. Our effective royalty rate for our North American franchised hotels in the second quarter was 5.4% of gross room sales. While royalty rate increases only apply to new signings, relicenses or renewals if we apply our current published stabilized royalty rates to the same top line, our effective franchise royalty rate would total 5.8%. Even our newest brands are delivering attractive royalty rates. At contract stabilization, our more than 60 AC and Moxy hotels in the domestic pipeline should yield franchise royalties at 5.5% of room revenue. On a year-to-date basis, we've signed roughly 40,000 managed and franchised rooms worldwide, including the acquisition of nearly 10,000 Delta rooms. With strong long-term contracts, we expect these new managed and franchised rooms worldwide will deliver over $85 million of annual stabilized fee revenue. There are many ways to grow hotel business. In the absence of a strong brand, one could drive rooms growth with significant capital contributions or fee concessions to owners. One could also employ short-term agreements, offer easy termination provisions and accept poor quality conversion candidates. These approaches drive unit growth but not much value. Unfortunately, anecdotally we are hearing that competitors most under pressure to drive unit growth are offering such deal concessions. We don't intend to take that path. With our strong brands and a meaningful pipeline, over the next few years we expect an increasing pace of unit openings at attractive economics. Solid RevPAR growth and increasing unit growth should continue to fuel improving returns on invested capital, growing cash flow and steady and significant returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. From 2012 to 2014, we returned over $4 billion to shareholders. We now expect to return over $2 billion to shareholders in repurchases and dividends in 2015 alone. We are bullish about our future. Now I'd like to turn things over to Carl to talk more about our outstanding second quarter results. Carl? Carl T. Berquist: Thanks Arne. Our second quarter was strong. Lodging demand remained solid and constant dollar worldwide system-wide RevPAR increased 5.3%. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87, roughly $0.07 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.78 to $0.83. $0.03 of our outperformance came from better than expected general and administrative expenses, including $0.01 each for lower legal expenses, lower net development expenses and good overall cost control. In addition, we picked up about $0.01 from favorable G&A timing, offset by about $0.01 of transaction and transition cost for the Delta acquisition which was not in our second quarter guidance. We booked a $0.09 gain on the redemption of our preferred equity stake in the Grande Lakes and Desert Ridge Resorts, offset by an unfavorable $0.04 per share associated with an anticipated loss on the sale of a hotel and undeveloped land. System-wide RevPAR in North America rose 5.4% and occupancy reached 78%. Group RevPAR rose roughly 6% with room rates up about 5%. For transient business, we continued to reduce the volume of special corporate business in favor of a greater volume of higher-rated retail business. Looking across the markets, we saw very strong system-wide RevPAR growth in the quarter at our hotels in Washington DC, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver and San Francisco. In contrast, San Antonio RevPAR declined in the second quarter due to flooding and Baltimore experienced group and leisure cancellations. In New York, our system-wide RevPAR increased 1% in the second quarter and New York's group pace for the third quarter improved. While room rates at full-service hotels in New York are compressed by limited-service additions, our system-wide occupancy in the city reached 90% in the second quarter. DC had a great quarter with strong group business. Just 15 months after opening, the Washington Marriott Marquis is performing well with nearly 80% occupancy in the quarter. As predicted, Marquis is helping to drive convention business to the city. Outside North America, second quarter system-wide comparable RevPAR rose nearly 5% on a constant dollar basis. On an actual dollar basis, international RevPAR declined 5% year-over-year. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased 5% with strong performance in Mexico and at resorts and leisure destinations in the Caribbean. For the full year, we expect RevPAR will increase at a mid-single-digit rate with a tough third quarter comparison to last year's World Cup in Brazil. In the Asia-Pacific region, second quarter constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose nearly 6% with particular strength in Japan and India and easy comps in Thailand. System-wide RevPAR in Mainland China increased more than 7% reflecting strong results in Shanghai. RevPAR in Hong Kong declined due to lower inbound China travel while in South Korea RevPAR declined due to the MERS outbreak. For the full year, we believe our Asia-Pacific RevPAR will increase at a mid-single-digit rate. In Europe, constant dollar RevPAR rose 4%. RevPAR increased due to high attendance at group events in Germany, strong demand in the U.K. provinces and strong leisure demand in Spain. France remained weak even with the low euro as leisure travelers selected more reasonably priced venues. Room rates from U.S. travel to our European hotels increased 7% in the quarter with particular strength in Germany, Austria and Great Britain. We expect our Europe RevPAR to increase at a mid-single-digit growth rate for the full year. In the Middle East and Africa, constant dollar RevPAR increased nearly 1%, constrained by the earlier start of Ramadan. We expect to see much stronger results in the third quarter as an offset. For the full year, we expect a mid-single-digit constant dollar RevPAR growth for this region as well. Turning to margins, house profit margins at Company-operated hotels in North America increased 80 basis points reflecting stronger pricing and lower utility costs. Worldwide house profit margins also increased 70 basis points. Our house profit margins reflect the new accounting guidelines for the lodging industry which require that service charges be included in property revenue. Excluding the impact of this accounting change, we estimate our North America house profit margins would have improved 110 basis points in the second quarter. Base fees rose 9% in the quarter reflecting higher managed hotel RevPAR, higher food and beverage sales and unit growth. In addition, limited-service portfolios recognized $5 million of deferred base fees in the quarter. As expected, incentive fees were flat in the quarter reflecting roughly $5 million of lower incentive fees from a few full-service hotels under renovation, a $2 million lower fee due to a shift in timing of fee recognition at one resort, and a $4 million negative impact from foreign exchange. Incentive fees were also constrained by weak results in South Korea and Hong Kong. In contrast, incentive fees for North America Limited-Service hotels doubled in the quarter with particular strength in the Courtyard brand. With the completion of a public space and rooms renovation program over the past five years, pruning a poorly positioned property and strong demand, over 60% of domestic managed Courtyard hotels paid incentive fees in the second quarter compared to 35% in the year ago quarter. Worldwide, 59% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 45% in the year ago quarter. In North America alone, 55% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 32% in the year ago period. Franchise fees increased 14% in the quarter. Most of the improvement was due to unit growth, RevPAR improvement and ramping royalty rates. We also saw higher royalty fees and relicensing fees associated with hotel transactions and contract renewals. With a robust hotel resale market in North America, we relicensed over 75 U.S. franchised hotels during the quarter. In most cases the new agreements reflect higher stabilized royalty rates and regularly include a commitment to make property improvements. In the last 12 months, we estimate owners of North America franchised hotels have committed to nearly $1 billion in property improvement program. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $60 million in the quarter compared to $70 million in the prior year. Results reflected the renovation of the Charlotte City Center Marriott, preopening costs for the New York EDITION and lower residential branding fees. Depreciation and amortization totaled $32 million in the quarter compared to $47 million in the prior year. You may recall that we booked a $15 million impairment in the prior year. General and administrative expenses declined from the prior year largely due to easy comparison to last year's $7 million revaluation of our Venezuela Bolivar exposure. Our preferred equity stake in our Grande Lakes and Desert Ridge hotels was redeemed in the second quarter yielding proceeds of roughly $120 million and a gain of $41 million. We also recorded a loss of $22 million on the pending disposition of a hotel and the sale of some land that will be developed as a hotel project. We expect roughly $100 million in proceeds from these two transactions sometime in the next 12 months. Foreign exchange reduced our pre-tax income in the second quarter by roughly $9 million, largely in fee revenue. For the full year, we expect FX will reduce our pre-tax income by roughly $30 million. These amounts do not reflect the impact of exchange rates on travel trends. For Marriott International, our adjusted operating income margin in the second quarter increased from 47% to 50%. We repurchased over 9 million shares during the quarter for nearly $715 million. Our fully diluted weighted average share count in the quarter was 7% lower than in the prior year and over 25% lower than five years ago. As Arne mentioned, for the third quarter we expect worldwide constant dollar RevPAR will increase 4% to 6%. We expect total fees will increase roughly 5% to 7% with incentive fees likely to increase at a low teens rate in the seasonally slow third quarter. You may recall that last year's third quarter included $15 million of recognized deferred base fees and $9 million of franchise relicensing fees. We expect our owned, leased and other results in the third quarter will total $50 million to $55 million. Our renovation of the Charlotte City Center Marriott and lower termination fees year-over-year should constrain growth in the quarter. G&A expenses in the third quarter should decline modestly year-over-year with lower legal cost and an easy comparison for foreign exchange. Last year's third quarter reflected $4 million of unfavorable FX due primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. Turning to the full year, compared to our prior guidance, we've tightened the range of RevPAR growth as we are already halfway through the year. With 5.5% to 6.5% constant dollar RevPAR growth, we expect our fee revenue will increase 10% to 11%. We've tweaked our full year fee revenue estimate a bit from our prior guidance due to the tightened RevPAR range, unfavorable foreign exchange and more modest incentive fee growth in Hong Kong and South Korea. We've improved our estimate for depreciation and amortization from our prior guidance by about $10 million due to a refinement of our Protea and Delta purchase price allocation estimates and lower depreciation from assets held for sale. We expect our full year general and administrative expenses will total $630 million to $640 million, a roughly 3% to 4% decline year-over-year. Compared to our prior full year guidance, our lower estimate for G&A reflects lower legal and net development expenses and better overall cost control. Partially offsetting these savings is roughly $10 million of transaction and transition cost for the Delta acquisition which was not previously in our guidance. All in all, we expect fully diluted EPS will total $3.10 to $3.18 in 2015. Compared to our prior guidance, we have included the $0.05 of net gains booked in the second quarter offset by the $0.02 of Delta transaction and transition cost for the full year. We expect adjusted EBITDA will increase 13% to 15% for 2015. Investment spending could total $600 million to $800 million including about a $140 million in maintenance spending and $135 million for the Delta acquisition. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. We've already recycled more than $750 million from asset sales and loan repayments to date in 2015, including the redemption of our preferred equity stake in Grande Lakes and Desert Ridge and the sale of the Miami Beach EDITION, the New York EDITION and a Courtyard in Paris. Included in these year-to-date proceeds is roughly $40 million from the redemption of a preferred equity stake in another hotel that we received just this week. We expect to return at least $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, we'll take questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : You talked about cash return to shareholders of $2 billion, which is up by about $250 million from last quarter, but your EBITDA guidance is actually down a little bit. So I am wondering where the sort of incremental $250 plus million, was that maybe an acquisition you had looked at doing that you're not doing now and so that cash ends up going to shareholders or kind of what's the delta there? Carl T. Berquist: I think part of it is, Robin, they are redemption of some of these preferred stakes that we have in hotels that are occurring this year as well as the $100 million that we have on the market right now for the land and the hotel that we're doing. And we think our stock is a 'buy' right now, so we want to get out there and buy it. Robin Farley : Okay, great, that's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, just to clarify, you have EBITDA lower at both ends, RevPAR is being raised at the bottom and lowered at the top but EBITDA is lower at both ends, is that mostly the Hong Kong and South Korea fee revenue that makes the EBITDA not as favorable as the RevPAR changes? Arne M. Sorenson: Absolutely, it's the international markets, it's Seoul and Hong Kong would be the two most significant. Both are big incentive fee contributing hotels for us in those markets. And then a little bit of foreign exchange impact around the world would be the two biggest things on fees. Obviously when you get to the EBITDA calculation, you've got a bunch of adjustments going in different directions including the building in for the first time of $10 million or so of Delta transaction and transition costs which are rolled into that G&A number. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask you just a little more on potential acquisition activity, I'm not talking about Starwood but more thinking about things like Delta and Protea, and Delta seems like it's really more of a conversion vehicle for you and Protea was more about establishing a footprint in an area where you were underrepresented, and as you look forward, do you think you need more conversion brands potentially in the limited-service or midscale arena or are you more interested in kind of locking down your footprint maybe outside of the U.S. more aggressively? Arne M. Sorenson: The way you framed the question, I'd probably take option B over option A but in some respects it's obviously a theoretical question. Deals become available in the market with sort of a certain definition, and as we've talked about before, I think Delta and Protea and Gaylord, AC, I think all of them have some similarities in that we found them to be pretty compelling financial propositions with acquisition prices sort of in 8 to 10 times fee range, something like that, within a short period after closing and accretive to us therefore from a value perspective. I think when we looked at Protea, we were expanding into a part of Africa where we really didn't have presence and we found not just a portfolio of great hotels but we found a collection of good leaders down there who could grow our business in Sub-Saharan Africa. I think in the abstract we wouldn't have been necessarily all that eager to add another brand but would've loved to do the growth with the brands we already had, but of course it came with another brand and that brand had strength and everybody is going to keep it. When you look at Delta, it was really sort of a [indiscernible]. I think the way we underwrited that deal was as a way of getting an existing portfolio of hotels, getting a greater strength in Canada which is obviously both a strong market in its own right and a great contributing market to travel to the United States, back and forth, and the deal sort of stood on its own from that perspective. I think in the months since we've closed now, just three months, we've been pleased \u2013 we're hopeful for this but we've been pleased to see that there's a strong appetite from our partners including in the United States to explore growing the Delta brand with us here. And so we think it will add a sort of extra piece of value to us as we go forward. I don't think that we are particularly looking for additional conversion brands, whether that be in the upscale space or other segments of the marketplace, and I think in some respects we would continue to say that our brand lineup is reasonably complete. We think we've got most of sets of both lifestyle and traditional brands in the industry and they are all performing quite well with good momentum, but we'll continue to kick all the tires that drive by. Smedes Rose : Okay. Can I just ask you, what was the share count at the end of the quarter? Carl T. Berquist: Common shares outstanding was 267.3 million shares, and then you have about 4.9 million of dilution, so diluted shares was 272.2 million. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven Kent : So a couple of questions. Can you first talk about your full-service RevPAR growth? It seems to be underperforming your select service RevPAR growth. Just some thoughts whether that's some part of the cycle or whether that's something to do with the brand? And then the second question is, you noted in your opening comments that RevPAR will be solid for the balance of 2015 based on some data, and I was just wondering what that data is, especially because it seems like the last-minute travelers is really the one who's seen the street pushing the rates pretty recently. Arne M. Sorenson: So let's take those in order. I think on the full-service RevPAR question, I would not take either of your suggested answer. I don't think it has much to do with our brands and I don't think it really has much to do with the cycle. I think you look at full-service hotels and you've got two things that are going on. I think the most significant is renovations. We had a number of quite substantial full-service hotels, big hotels that were under renovation in the quarter, probably had 0.5 point to 1 point of RevPAR impact, maybe something like that from those hotels alone, and we think those renovation comparisons will now get meaningfully easier in Q3 and by and large disappear as a headwind in Q4. And I think the second thing is, obviously New York is something we're all watching. It is the weakest big market in New York. I think it does tend to contribute a bit more to the full-service numbers than others. And so we see full-service performance. Yes, you're right, it's lower in the quarter than the limited-service hotels but we think it's going to come back as we get through the renovations piece and go through to get to the other demand points, which is a good way of transitioning to your second question. The data points that we would point you to are the ones that were in the prepared script primarily, and that is, group bookings for Q3, group bookings for Q4, group bookings for 2016 and when you look at also the strength of transient demand which has been steady throughout and of course transient bookings, you can't see much when you go past 30 to 60 days particularly with business travel because it's relatively short-term booking. The near-term stuff looks quite good and we'd expect transient pace to continue pretty well. Operator : Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Arne, you've been bullish for some time now looking back even at points when [indiscernible]. So now, as you look \u2013 and your comments at the beginning of your prepared remarks were crystal clear, as you look towards the rest of the year and into next year, what has changed since what you saw what happened early in the year in 2015, if you could just talk about that for a moment? Arne M. Sorenson: I said our perspective really has not changed fundamentally since a quarter ago or even two quarters ago. I think we've got some apprehension as a marketplace, in part maybe driven by the fact that we're in the sixth year of a strong lodging recovery. I think all of us kind of wonder how long can it last and we're constantly looking for clues that maybe we're reaching a point where we can somehow say that we're transitioning to a different phase, and I understand that. In many respects we look at the same questions and we ask the same questions here. We don't see evidence that would suggest that we're entering a different phase of the cycle. We see supply growth continuing to be low. We see demand growth continuing to be high. When you look at group business, when you look at pricing power, all of those things look good. And to be fair, I am not necessarily sitting here saying that RevPAR numbers that the industry reported last year or that Marriott reported in 2014 are the numbers that we'll get in 2015 or that we'll get in 2016, but I think we will see a solid mid to high mid single-digit RevPAR growth for comp store sales in the United States extending for some period of time, and when you think about the way that works in our model with good solid unit growth because of the strength of our brands, we will continue to produce an extraordinary amount of cash which can be invested back into our business or can be returned back to the shareholders, and I think that will continue to drive great cash flow growth, I think it will drive great growth in returns, I think it will drive a great growth in earnings per share, and that's what causes us to say we remain pretty bullish about what's to come. Felicia Hendrix : Thank you for that. And for my follow-up, just probably changing gears for a moment, in June you announced the partnership with TripAdvisor. I was just wondering if you could talk about the thought process that brought you to signing that deal and are there other opportunities in the OTA space or the non-traditional lodging space or non-traditional booking space that you see. Arne M. Sorenson: We've got a lot of respect for TripAdvisor. They have built a platform for customer reviews that has tremendous strength and obviously a broad application for hotels around the world. And we have been in a bit of a mating dance with them for some period of time, sort of feeling each other out and trying to figure out how the partnership would work between us, and what we found and ultimately caused us to do the deal with them was a partnership that was meaningfully more constructive for us than some of the other relationships that we have out there in terms of ability to control our inventory, in terms of customer data, in terms of ability to continue to offer specials or advantages within our tent of Rewards customers, and the cost of the reservations. So all of those things let us to conclude that TripAdvisor would be a great partner and we were really excited to get that deal done and to launch it and look forward to the way that it proceeds. Felicia Hendrix : And then just as far as anything else you could do in that space? Arne M. Sorenson: Nothing else that we would talk about at the moment. Operator : Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry Curtis : A couple of follow-ups. At quarter end, am I correct in calculating that the net debt ratio was around 2x and where would you expect it to be by year-end? Carl T. Berquist: When you calculate that, Harry, you need to throw in the leases and some other things as far as the rating agencies are. So we kind of look at an adjusted debt to an adjusted EBITDA and that when you throw in the leases, guarantees, some other things there, we're getting closer to 3x and we try to manage right around that 3x. Obviously it's not exact, so sometimes we're a little under that, sometimes we're a little over that, but we kind of target that. That keeps us in a solid investment grade rating. And so we'll manage that debt capacity relative to about 3x, but that 3x is adjusted for leases and guarantees. Harry Curtis : Okay. Then in a somewhat related question, you've given guidance for total investment spend of $600 million to $800 million. Backing out maintenance and the acquisition, that leaves about $425 million in additional investment spend. Where do you think you're going to be based on the pace that you are at now by the end of 2015? Carl T. Berquist: I think we'll be in that range. I think that range is still good range. I can't fine-tune it anymore than that right now. It's still \u2013 we're only in the midyear right now, but as we look out at our capital commitments over the next six months as well as we continue to grow our pipeline, I think that's still a good number to hold to, that $600 million to $800 million. Arne M. Sorenson: Harry, I don't have the precise numbers in front of me, but I would guess that of that $600 million to $800 million, 75% to 80%, maybe even higher, is identified. So if you're getting at what's the likelihood that we're going to come in a few hundred million dollars less than that range, I wouldn't put much likelihood on that. Harry Curtis : Okay, that's exactly where I was going. And just the last part of that is, what are the biggest chunks of that additional investment spend? Arne M. Sorenson: Carl has maybe got a list here but we are renovating top to bottom our Marriott hotel in Charlotte, we've just completed renovating top to bottom our Renaissance Hotel in the Dominican Republic, we have of course completed the construction of the EDITION hotels which is already done but was included in our first couple of quarters, we've got some technology projects which are in there and obviously technology spending is not what we think of first but we're probably doing $100 million plus of that in the year. Carl T. Berquist: Building couple of hotels down in Brazil. Arne M. Sorenson: We're building a couple of hotels down in Brazil, we'll open a Courtyard Residence Inn in time for the Olympics next year, so that money is going out. Laura E. Paugh: And then we've got some key money and some loan\u2026 Carl T. Berquist: So we have a few loan commitments that will probably fund later in the year. Arne M. Sorenson: Those sorts of things. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill Crow : Arne, there was a report out by a large corporate travel and expense management company looking at the sharing economy, I think everybody has probably asked the Airbnb question in a variety of ways, but the study indicated that corporate or business related travel bookings on Airbnb increased like 143% from one quarter to the next this year, and my question is not just how much are we losing share because it gets very small at this point, but as you talk to your corporate customers, can you tell us anything about the adoption of hotel alternatives at the corporate level which I think that's what we're all trying to gauge? My follow-up to that would be that on a call last week, one of the REITs suggested that the brands are willing to renegotiate some of the occupancy thresholds for reimbursement of Rewards points in stays, and is it possible that that would have a incrementally positive impact on larger markets next year or whenever that happens? Arne M. Sorenson: I'm not sure if I totally understand what the second point was. Obviously let me talk about that first and I'll get to Airbnb and the sharing economy. When you look at redemption rate, so that is Marriott Rewards or our competitor's equivalent members ultimately cashing in their points for free stays at hotels, there are a number of complexities in the way those redemption rates work. They vary a little bit I think from company to company but there are some trends which are important obviously in a rising rate market which we've had the last five or six years. I think many platforms have seen that the amount of points that are needed to redeem in a like for like hotel probably need to go up a little bit because the rates have gone up and therefore the cash that needs to be distributed from the program to the hotel owner where the redemption occurred needs to be a bit higher. The other thing is, you've got different levels of redemption depending on the occupancy at a hotel. So the theory has been, if that redemption is displacing likely rack rate guest that would be available from the open market to pay for that room, the hotel owner ought to get a bit more than if the hotel was relatively empty and had rooms that were going to go down dark over the course of the night. We have changed some of those formulas in part because we saw that there was a little bit too much sort of internal gaming in the system and we wanted to make sure that we were benefiting our customers as well as giving fair compensation to our hotel owners. And so there is some conversation around the fine points of that. I don't expect changes that will be implemented further will likely be material in responding to something like the sharing economy. Obviously we are totally committed to making the Rewards program continue to be the strongest and most preferred loyalty program in the industry and that is about delivering value to our customers which we're going to continue to do but we want to make sure we do that in the way that our hotel owning partners understand to get the benefit of that. When you get to the sharing economy, I think you look at the increase quarter over quarter or year-over-year in business travel. To some extent that is still the law of small numbers. Overwhelmingly in this space you're talking about leisure travel, overwhelmingly you're talking about travel which is at relatively lower rates than would be available in a traditional hotel. And so while there are some business travelers, probably particularly younger business travelers who use these kinds of platforms for their business travel, they are still the exception rather than the rule. There's a lot we don't know for certainty and we'll watch, see the way this develops. Airbnb obviously gets a lot of attention for a reason. They've grown quite quickly and I think in many respects they are sort of a captivating idea. On the positive side we think it's quite good that Airbnb seems to be drawing travelers into the traveling marketplace sooner than they might otherwise be doing based on cost and that's partly a generational thing, that's partly a wealth demographic thing, but we are seeing more and more travelers hit the road both in the United States and around the world and that's a good thing and we think ultimately they are likely in some meaningful percentages to stay not just at Airbnb facilities but to stay in traditional hotels and we'll obviously compete to get as many of those as we can. When we listen to our special corporate and significant corporate customers, I think usually what we hear is that they would like to make sure that their people when they're traveling are taken care of and that the risk profile is acceptable to them, and there are attractive features of hotels when it comes to those kinds of considerations, whether that be life safety issues, whether that be security issues, whether that's simply the ability to find their people. I think there are some though where folks say, okay, actually if we can save money on this and if our people want it, maybe we'll do some event and so that's why you start to see some of his year-over-year growth. And again, we'll watch it, we don't think it's a significant factor in terms of impacting our business today and are optimistic that it won't become one but we'll have to watch it and see. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Greff with J. P. Morgan. Joseph Greff : I have two questions. You mentioned your 2016 EBITDA guidance came down primarily because of the Seoul and the Hong Kong hotels as well as an incremental adverse FX, so does that imply in the second half that your U.S. fees or U.S. related EBITDA relative to three months ago is actually flat to up? Arne M. Sorenson: It would be flattish, it might be down a tad, but not in terms of different expectations. Obviously we came in today with RevPAR numbers which are what right about at the bottom quarter of the guidance we gave you a quarter ago for Q2. So we said 5% to 7% and we ended up at 5.4% or 5.3% depending on which measure you're looking at. So that has some impact on the numbers but it's really not significant. That's why we say the expectations are essentially the same. Carl T. Berquist: And you know when you look at the percentage of the total EBITDA, it was more fine-tuning for those kind of things than anything else, Joe. Joseph Greff : Okay. And then on the capital return front, you obviously bought back more stock in the quarter than in recent quarters and you obviously upped your at least capital return target to $2 billion plus, for you to mimic second half capital return equal to the first half, what would have to go right, would that just be a lot more asset recycling and things of that nature or how do you view potential for that in general? Carl T. Berquist: I think the one thing you kind of look at in the first half, we recycled about $750 million worth of assets in the first half and we don't have that program for the second half. Our wagon is starting to go a little [indiscernible] on assets to sell and to recycle. So I think it would be difficult to have that same level during the second half relative to what we did in the first half. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Shaun Kelley : Arne, we've heard some of the bigger owners in this space to start to talk a little bit I think more aggressively about transitioning some of their hotels from managed to franchise and I'm just curious sitting there as the manager or the brand manager of a number of these types of hotels, not to get into any one specific, but does this have a big impact to Marriott in as much that you guys kind of worry about as you kind of see those transitionings occurring in your portfolio or are you pretty agnostic to those types of changes? Arne M. Sorenson: Both, I mean I think we are hopefully a great manager and also a great franchisor, and so we want to make sure we're growing in both sides of this business and we want to make sure that we're doing the right thing with our partners, both owners of managed hotels and owners of franchised hotels. It's an interesting dynamic and you hear lots of explanations for what's going on here. I actually think when you do the hard work and look at the performance of an individual hotel, really because our operating team in the United States has done a fabulous job in both driving top line performance and getting better and better in terms of delivering that performance to the bottom-line, I don't think usually this is about a short-term effort to drive better cash flow at the hotel, the conversion from managed to franchised. I think it is overwhelmingly about the recognition that there are more buyers of hotels that have flexibility to choose an operator than there are for hotels that are subject to long-term management contracts. Why? Because there are great franchise operators in this business, the best of whom are our partners, who really are looking only at buying hotels that they can operate themselves and those folks become potential buyers of hotels if they have the flexibility to manage them themselves and if that flexibility doesn't exist they won't be interested in looking at it. And so opening up that pool of buyers I think is the biggest reason that most of these changes have happened. We still get good fees. In fact, if we're not in incentive fees on a managed hotel, our fees tend to go up if they convert to franchised as opposed to managed. That can be a positive. The other thing that can be a positive is often with a change of ownership in a hotel, renovation will be accelerated, and so that's likely to bring hotel to brand standard faster than maybe the normal renovation cycle would be. So those are a lot of factors that go into this. It is not cataclysmic to us either way but we do want to make sure that we are as good a manager as we possibly can be, and attractive to the folks who are interested in looking for a third party manager of their hotels. Shaun Kelley : Great, thanks for the color. And my follow-up is just to kind of hit on the capital return theme which has been discussed, but I guess to ask it more directly, I guess first to Carl, do you think you pulled forward kind of any of the repurchases for your pattern throughout the year in terms of this year? And then I guess bigger picture, is there room next year to kind of duplicate a number that's around this size when you think about what you're going to have in terms of cash flow? Carl T. Berquist: We're not prepared yet to talk about 2016 and capital returns, but I think there are a couple of things to look out. One is, as we talked earlier about our leverage ratio of 3x debt-to-EBITDA or adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA, we can go up a little bit, down a little bit, and that gives you a little flexibility in the model to buy back more stock so to speak and get more aggressive now. As of the end of the second quarter, we actually came in a little under the 3x. So you could say we had a little capacity at the end of the second quarter on that. I think that the other item is just how much we can recycle when it comes to what assets are up for sale, and like I said, we've had a good recycling here in the first half of the year and in fact all of 2015 will be a healthy period of asset recycling. I guess what I would say is, kind of take a look at our Investor Conference where we looked out and said, what will we be returning over the next three or four years and how that's tracking relative to where we are with RevPAR and the asset and what we've done. I think it was $6 billion to $8 billion over that time period, over four year period, $6 billion to $8 billion, so pretty healthy shareholder return. Operator : Your next question comes from David Loeb with Baird. David Loeb : You've covered a lot of the really important topics but I want to drill down into another one, Arne, if you don't mind. With Moxy, I assume Moxy is going to be month a new build brand. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape in the development area for the low rent, cal it up or midscale, and below brand? Hilton has announced that they're going to have a new brand. And it seems like development results from other franchise oriented companies have been fairly poor. Can you just talk about how you see the competitive landscape and how you see the return profile for developers, like what will the cost per room be and how will they generate returns relative to building a Courtyard or Residence or Fairfield? Arne M. Sorenson: Moxy is interesting. Obviously we started it in Europe with our partners at Inter IKEA who with one of our European franchisees worked on us for a period of time and basically convinced us and made us disciples really of this notion that the economy segment in Europe ought to be reinvented. You look across that landscape in Europe, there were 2 million rooms in that segment and if you experienced any of those rooms it seemed like the product was trying to tell you, you didn't pay a lot for your room so don't expect much. And we thought with Moxy we could do something which was deliver considerable value to the customers, used great technology to cost-effectively build this product and therefore drive great return for our owners. It was something which was fun and people would talk about. Now we've got only one open so far in Europe at Malpensa in Milan. It's doing great, customer response has been fabulous, and we've got a pipeline in Europe of nearing 50 I think, maybe 40 to 50 Moxy hotels. We then had our franchisees in the United States looking at this, sort of understanding what it was and with them decided to launch it here earlier this year. We've now got 40 in our \u2013 excuse me, we've got about 15 signed but we've got a number of a few dozen behind them that we're talking to our partners about in the North American market. And what we're seeing is that there really is nothing like this brand in the U.S. It is lifestyle, it is economy, it will be mostly new build, it will be mostly urban, this is intended to be a lifestyle product, it is not intended to be simply another economy brand that we would roll across in tertiary markets across the United States. And I think that makes it quite different from anything that exists out there. Obviously we can't speak about what our competitors are talking about maybe doing in the future because we haven't seen really any definition around them. David Loeb : Do you think there's room to reinvent economy in the U.S.? Arne M. Sorenson: I think Moxy in a sense will do that, although again it would be more of an urban application. I think \u2013 I don't know, David, that's not really fundamentally what we're trying to do with Moxy. I think the Moxy experience we have in mind will depend a bit on an urban community and environment that can enliven that product, and when you get to a sort of tertiary market, that's a harder trick to pull off or maybe almost impossible in some respects. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : You started off your prepared remarks just talking about kind of the supply environment and lodging industry and you said that STR doesn't expect supply to kind of come close to long-term average growth until 2017. We have good visibility into 2015 and 2016, I mean there are a number of forecasts, but do you guys have a sense of what supply growth will be in 2017ko based off of your data and your analysis of the industry? Arne M. Sorenson: Let us start by confessing that Smith Travel and Lodging Econometrics data is better than ours. We do our best obviously to track our pipeline. We don't have people out there looking at who's pulling building permits from our competitors and trying to assess what's happening in that space. So our efforts rely to a meaningful extent on those folks who are trying to do that work both Lodging Econometrics and STR, and then in some to some extent extrapolating some judgment about what we're seeing through our system, but we do not have a secret crystal ball that we're prohibiting you from looking into. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker : Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted to ask real quickly with regards to Airbnb because that continues to be a recurring topic in conversations with investors. Obviously business travel is a big component of your business. Airbnb is now trying to get into that space and grow it. As you talk to your corporate travel managers, where do they put the priority on security, is that like number one cost of entry or is that something that they just kind of take for granted or don't even think about, that would be helpful? Arne M. Sorenson: Corporate customers are I suppose in many respects as different from any other kind of customers and so you hear different priorities from different places. We have big and really important corporate customers for whom security for their people is the primary feature. We have some for whom the primary feature is cost. I would think, sort of guessing, we haven't done, at least not that I'm aware of, a survey of every corporate client. It might be something that would be worth doing, but I would think that security and productivity concerns, predictability concerns would all rank quite high for the typical corporate customer of size. Ryan Meliker : Okay, that's really helpful. And have you had conversations with your corporate customers with regards to Airbnb and is that a topic that continues to come up? Arne M. Sorenson: Of course and my answers have been influenced by those conversations. Ryan Meliker : Wonderful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Rennardson with Jefferies. Ian Rennardson : Coming back to the supply situation, if I look at the STR data, I'm slightly confused about what you were saying earlier, Arne, about the geographic dispersion of that supply growth because the latest text from STR to me looks like that 15 of the top 25 markets are looking at supply over 3% of rooms under construction and 21 of the top 25 have got over 2% of existing supply under-construction. So I'd just like you to square the circle for me please. Arne M. Sorenson: The data we have is probably not inconsistent with that. About 55% of the rooms were in the secondary and tertiary markets or outside the top 25 is probably the best phrase to use. That means that 45% of the rooms obviously are in those top 25 markets. When we look at our top 25 fee producing markets in the United States, there are less than a handful where we see supply growth that looks like it's in excess of numbers that we should be concerned about. It won't surprise you that New York is on the top of that list. Operator : Our next question is from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Within Delta, it looks like you guys are off to a pretty strong start with that brand. You mentioned 50 potential conversions. Are any of these Marriott hotels and are you targeting specific competitor brands? Arne M. Sorenson: I think of the 50, I can't tell you for a certainty that there are zero Marriott hotels, but I think the answer tends towards zero. I think these are requests that have come in from our partners with conversion candidates from other brands. We're not sort of specifically sitting here and saying we're going to identify competitor's brand and go after that one, but I suspect as we see what ultimately happens here, we will be able to reach some conclusions about which brands are the best times for us to be efficient in and we'll communicate that with you when it becomes more of a reality. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then you mentioned some of the competition was increasing their I guess competition for trying to get unit growth. Are you more concerned about the economic terms of new deals or just the non-economic terms? Arne M. Sorenson: We're concerned about both but very much to include the economic terms. Again, this is anecdotal. We have no ability to get insight into what our competitors are ultimately negotiating other than what our partners tell us they may be hearing and it won't surprise you that if what our partners tell us comes up in the context of a negotiation there is always some bias to exaggerate the great terms that might be offered by somebody else. But having said that, anecdotally we see that some of the terms that have been put out there are deals that cannot create value in any traditional sense when you look at the cost capital or you look at the cost associated with adding a hotel to a system, and seem to be driven by a desire simply to add rooms. Operator : Our final question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Just one here on group, could you add some additional color there, sounds like you guys have done a good job improving 3Q from down 2 to up 3 and 4Q kind of has seen a little bit of a contrary move but it sounds like it's due to last-minute bookings kind of being reduced, so what's going on with the booking curve in group and how do you see that kind of 7% figure for 2016 evolving over the next maybe 6 to 12 months? Arne M. Sorenson: I think the group data is without exception encouraging. I think those numbers that you ticked through, they each have a little bit of a story obviously to \u2013 in the abstract it doesn't sound like plus 3 in group booking for Q3 is something to write home about, but given the way the holidays work in the quarter, given that it's a seasonally weak corporate group quarter except for the month of September, and given where we came from, we think it's come along well and we're pleased with the way it's moved. The fourth quarter numbers I wouldn't view as being concerning in any respect. The prepared remarks were really only meant to communicate that the 9% growth we've got on the books at the end of the second quarter for Q4, our guess is will not hold only because occupancies are high and therefore we won't have the space to take as much short-term bookings as we took last year. And I suspect as we get into 2016, we'll see some of the same dynamics. I suspect we'll start 2016 with relatively more of the full year group business on the books at the 1st of the year than we started 2015 for, and what that suggests \u2013 I wish I had data for you, I don't at our fingertips, I don't know Laura or Carl whether you do, but undoubtedly we're seeing the booking window lengthen for group business, and we'll make sure a quarter from now we get some specific data out there to help you people understand how that window is lengthening. That's one reason I think you look at this statistic of bookings in a quarter for all future periods. That's a way of thinking about \u2013 it's sort of neutral in a sense to the length of the booking window, and that was that 8% figure for Q2 of 2015. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And just following up on that, you mentioned 55% booked. Is that similar to where you were last year, and then maybe that 7% figure, how much is kind of rate versus rooms? Arne M. Sorenson: I don't know off the top of my head about 55's comparison to last year but I would almost guarantee you it's higher now than a year ago. In other words, that our booking window is lengthening, so we've got a bit more business on the books today for 2016 than we did a year ago for 2015. When you look at the 7% plus revenue, I think we're about 50-50 room nights and rate contribution for 2016. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks very much. Arne M. Sorenson: Okay, any other questions? Operator : No, sir, there are no further questions. Arne M. Sorenson: Alright, we've exhausted you all. Thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in Marriott. Get on the road and come stay with us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Marriott International 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Call. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

During the speakers' prepared remarks, all lines will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. It is now my pleasure to hand today's program over to Carl Berquist, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, October 29, 2015, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. So, let's get started. Third quarter diluted earnings per share totaled $0.78, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance of $0.72 to $0.76. We beat EPS guidance largely due to lower-than-expected G&A spending, favorable G&A timing, the beneficial impact of a joint venture true up, and the favorable net impact of share repurchases. These items more than offset weaker than expected incentive fees from hotels in North America and the Middle East. Third quarter worldwide system-wide RevPAR increased 4.5% on a constant dollar basis, 2.2% on an actual currency basis. In North America, system-wide RevPAR increased 4.2% in the quarter, reflecting the unfavorable holiday pattern and difficult comparisons, evidenced by the fact that over the last two years combined, North America third quarter RevPAR increased 13%. In Europe, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased over 9% in the third quarter, benefiting from the weak euro and strong special events in Germany and Amsterdam as well as greater Middle East travel to Berlin, Munich, and London. Travelers from the U.S. made up nearly half of our occupancy improvement in the region. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR rose 5%. Strong demand drove India and Indonesia RevPAR up at double-digit rates. RevPAR at hotels in Mainland China increased more than 4%, with Shanghai RevPAR up more than 9% alone. Mainland Chinese outbound travelers filled hotels in Thailand and Japan in the quarter, but they did not favor Hong Kong, where occupancy rates declined. In Korea, the MERS outbreak earlier in the year continued to constrain lodging demand. In Africa, RevPAR for our recently acquired Protea Hotels in South Africa rose nearly 9% system-wide for the quarter. While Protea RevPAR stats are not included in our comparable RevPAR results, they still show the strong performance of this new brand. For our comparable hotels in the Middle East and Africa region, third quarter RevPAR increased 4%, which was lower than expected due to that region's instability and the impact of an unscheduled extended holiday period in September. Across our managed hotel system, house profit margins benefited from improved productivity and lower food and utility costs, increasing 40 basis points domestically and 50 basis points worldwide. Global fee revenues totaled $465 million in the third quarter, 4% higher than the prior-year. Foreign exchange reduced fee revenue by approximately $8 million. Incentive fees alone were reduced by $4 million from foreign exchange. Our year-over-year growth in incentive fees reflected strong limited service performance in North America and the addition of our Delta Hotels in Canada, offset by the foreign exchange headwinds, renovation impact and the modest RevPAR growth among significant incentive fee paying hotels, including hotels in Hong Kong and Seoul. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses totaled $54 million in the quarter. Results reflected strong credit card branding fees offset by the impact of renovations at our Charlotte City Center Marriott Hotel and lower year-over-year termination fees. General and administrative expenses improved to $149 million in the third quarter, compared to $172 million in the prior-year. Prior-year results included a net $4 million Venezuela currency devaluation charge. Compared to guidance, G&A expense in the 2015 third quarter benefited from solid cost control, lower-than-expected Delta transition costs, and some favorable timing on initiative spending. For the full-year, our G&A spending is roughly on target, 6% lower than 2014. Turning to our fourth quarter outlook for North America, our long-standing strong group revenue pace in the fourth quarter supports our 5% to 7% RevPAR guidance. Outside North America, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR will increase 3% to 5% on a constant dollar basis. Our fourth quarter international outlook is about 100 basis points lower than our last guidance, largely due to political disruption in the Middle East and weaker results in Hong Kong. Globally, we expect constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will increase 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter. Combined with continued unit growth, fourth quarter fee revenue should increase 7% to 9% and earnings per share should total $0.74 to $0.78 compared to the $0.68 in the prior-year. For the full-year 2015, we anticipate EPS will total $3.12 to $3.16, a 23% to 24% growth rate over the prior-year. Full-year adjusted EBITDA could reach more than $1.7 billion for the year or a 13% to 15% increase over 2014. For the full-year 2015, investment spending could total $700 million to $800 million, including about $140 million in maintenance spending. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchase. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we've recycled nearly $800 million in proceeds from asset sales, loan repayments, and the like. Given the considerable amount of capital recycling this year, combined with strong operating cash flow, we expect to return more than $2.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year, a new record. Year-to-date through today, we've already returned over $2 billion to shareholders. Now to talk about our development pipeline in 2016 outlook, let me turn it over to Arne. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Carl. Good morning, everyone. I spent early October in China attending the HICAP Hotel Investment Conference and visiting hotels around the region. Early October includes Golden Week in China. This year, an estimated 750 million Chinese citizens traveled during that week. Airports, highways and train stations were packed. Chinese tourism is booming, and we are seeing the impact all over the Asia Pacific region, particularly in Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia. Strong demand at our hotels throughout the region is also driving hotel development, particularly outside of China. Over the last 12 months, our rooms pipeline in the Asia Pacific region has grown 14%, with more than half of the region's pipeline expansion coming from outside China. We are seeing growing development interest in our brands in Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and Australia, and we opened our first hotel in Taipei in the quarter. In the Middle East, we are likely to sign a record number of deals in 2015. We just opened the Ritz-Carlton, Cairo and plan to open the Palace Hotel in Jeddah as a Ritz-Carlton in 2016. We also recently signed agreements to convert the historic landmark Mena House in Cairo, located near the base of the Pyramids in Giza. After renovations, the property will open partially as JW Marriott and partly as a Marriott Hotel. In Africa, the integration of the Protea acquisition is nearly complete. Today, we have roughly 100 hotels as a result of the acquisition with more locations coming. Just this month, the team signed a Marriott Hotel and Marriott Executive Apartments in Johannesburg, our first Marriott branded products in South Africa. In the Caribbean and Latin America, our pipeline totals nearly 12,000 rooms with a growing number of managed and franchised limited service hotels in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. In fact, with the strength of our pipeline, by 2018, we expect to increase our distribution in the region by 75%. In Europe, our Moxy, Courtyard, AC, and Autograph brands are in particularly high demand. We've added more developers in that region with a focus on secondary and tertiary markets. As a result, our European pipeline has grown by a third in the last 12 months. For the Moxy brand alone, we already have 30 hotels in our European pipeline. In North America, our development pipeline reached 144,000 rooms at the end of the third quarter, a 20% increase over the past 12 months. Our limited service pipeline in North America reached a record 1,000 hotels at the end of the third quarter. Our AC and Moxy brands are moving fast in North America with attractive locations concentrated in urban markets. Together, these two brands have 82 hotels in the region's pipeline. Speaking of Moxy, this month I toured a sample room for two Moxy hotels that are expected to open in Manhattan in 2017. You can see a photo on Twitter. It's a very cool room that should resonate with younger, stylish travelers and those of us who just like to be. Marriott continues to garner an outsized share of the new construction in the United States. Once again, this quarter with only a 10% share of existing rooms in the U.S., Marriott brands represent more than one quarter of all new U.S. construction, more than any other company according to Smith Travel. We are doing well on conversions as well, globally, across all our brands. Year-to-date in 2015, we've converted 33 hotels with 6,000 rooms to our brands. Excluding M&A, we expect conversions will account for over 20% of our room additions this year. We are also starting to see conversions to our Delta brand. We expect the first U.S. project will open later this year in Orlando after a meaningful renovation. We currently have six Delta Hotels in our North American development pipeline. Our Autograph brand just passed its fifth-year anniversary, and there has been a lot to celebrate. Year-to-date in 2015, we've added 18 hotels to the brand worldwide, half of them outside the U.S. We expect Autograph will have nearly 100 hotels in the system by year-end 2015, making this one of the fastest brand launches we've ever seen. Worldwide, given the strength of our pipeline and the hotels that have opened year-to-date, we expect to add 7% to 8% more rooms in 2015, including the nearly 10,000 room acquisition of Delta. For 2016, we expect organic growth to accelerate to roughly 8%. We expect to remove roughly 1% per year from our system in both years. New brand platforms help this growth. Nearly one-third of our newly signed rooms in the last 12 months are in brands we didn't have five years ago and roughly 30% are luxury or lifestyle rooms. Owners agree that our brands have never been in better shape. We estimate owners and franchisees have invested $4 billion in the past five years in hotel renovations. New room designs and lobby renovations enhanced the value of our brands to our guests and returns to our owners. Since service innovations are ongoing, and Marriott mobile has taken off. In the past year, our app has been downloaded over six million times and reservations through the app are up 27%. Mobile check-ins and check-outs have reached nearly six million in just over two years. We also continue to introduce new and exciting opportunities for our Marriott Rewards members, including exclusive access to concerts and top entertainment, chances to win a once-in-a-lifetime Super Bowl 50 experience, and member-only NBA events around the world during the NBA global games. And it's working. The Wall Street Journal recently reported survey results that rated Marriott Rewards as the best program in the industry. We're also connecting with consumers and engaging with our customers like never before. At our headquarters, MLive, our real-time marketing brand newsroom and social media command center, has been busier than ever. A dedicated team of marketers review social data in conversations in real-time, identifying opportunities for our portfolio of 19 brands to engage with guests. We address travel issues, special events, and trending topics. In fact, the MLive team is live tweeting our earnings call right now. We are expanding MLive globally and will be opening up MLive Asia Pacific in Hong Kong next month. Now before turning to 2016 RevPAR, let me take a minute to reflect on current demand trends. It's obvious that many of you became anxious about our industry during the third quarter as STR reported softer year-over-year RevPAR numbers. To some extent, the early reaction to our earnings release last night seems to be the same. To the more modest RevPAR numbers we posted in Q3 foretell a weakening of the demand driven growth that began in 2010. While we cannot be certain about many things, there are powerful reasons to conclude the sky is not falling. We have known since the beginning of the year that the third quarter with its challenging holiday pattern would be a weak quarter, particularly for group and business transient travel. The actual results prove that out. Group nights were down modestly from the prior-year, as were special corporate rooms. The best indication that these statistics are driven by calendar and comparison issues rather than by fundamental demand trends is found in a few other real data points. As of the end of the quarter, our group business on the books for Q4 for our U.S. managed hotels is up in excess of 7% compared to last year. Our group revenue for all of 2016 is also up over 7% compared to year ago levels for 2015. These strong numbers are not the result of historic bookings only. In the third quarter itself, our North American system-wide hotels added in excess of 7% more group room revenue for all future periods than they did a year ago. And of course, we continued to post record hotel occupancies. Similarly, when we look at early returns for the fourth quarter, the data is comforting. Based upon month-to-date figures, we expect RevPAR in the U.S. to be up roughly 6% in October. When all is said and done, what we see seems fairly clear. The demand led recovery that began in 2010 is alive and well. To it, we should see additional growth from existing new unit openings, where Marriott is one of only very few companies that are seeing strong unit growth trends. So, let's talk about our RevPAR outlook for 2016. Our budget process is just beginning, and there are, to be sure, many uncertainties around the world. We are unprepared to offer EPS guidance yet, but we would like to share our early thinking. In North America, we expect system-wide RevPAR will increase at a 4% to 6% rate in 2016. As I mentioned, group revenue pace for 2016 is up more than 7%, including roughly 3% increases in average daily rate. We expect special corporate rates will rise at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016 for comparable customers, but also expect to improve the mix of our business, increasing the proportion of full retail rate business in our North American hotels. STR is forecasting 1.4% supply growth in the U.S. in 2016 and 2.2% demand growth. With record occupancy in many markets, transient pricing is likely to rise as downtown demand compresses to suburban properties and peak season demands spills over to shoulder periods. Outside North America, we expect our international system-wide RevPAR will also increase 4% to 6% on a constant dollar basis in 2016. In Europe, weak demand in Moscow and Istanbul are likely to coincide with high supply growth in those markets. In Germany, supply growth should be modest, but fewer affairs in Germany should constrain RevPAR growth. For Paris, RevPAR should strengthen with the Eurocup in June and July. Strong demand in London and Amsterdam will likely be tempered by tough comparisons to special events in 2015. Given all this, we anticipate that constant dollar RevPAR will increase at a low single-digit rate at our European hotels in 2016. Europe contributed about 7% of our fee revenue in 2014. In Greater China, we expect mid-single-digit RevPAR growth in 2016, reflecting continued economic growth in that market constrained by weak mainland travel to Hong Kong. Our Asia Pacific region generated nearly 9% of our fee revenue in 2014 with about half coming from outside Greater China. And here the picture is brighter. South Korea should see much stronger results as hotels in that market face easy comparison to the 2015 MERS outbreak. Similarly, easy comparisons and better economic growth should help, Thailand. We expect the Indonesian economy will show strength due to significant infrastructure construction, and we believe growing international arrivals in Japan will drive RevPAR higher in that market. All combined, we anticipate mid-single-digit RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region in 2016. For the Caribbean and Latin America region, we expect strength in Mexico and the Caribbean, will drive 2016 RevPAR for the region at a mid-single-digit rate. In 2014, the Caribbean and Latin America represented nearly 5% of our fee revenue. For the Middle East and Africa region, a recent demand has been hurt by political instability in some markets and fewer international arrivals from Europe and Russia. For 2016, we are modeling a mid-single-digit RevPAR growth for the region, assuming stabilization in Egypt and continued economic growth in Saudi. The Middle East and Africa region represented 3% of our fee revenue in 2014. We'll have more information to share with you in February; but for now, we are looking at worldwide system-wide RevPAR growth of 4% to 6% on a constant dollar basis and unit growth of roughly 7% \u2013 or excuse me, 8% gross and 7% net. We know these metrics drive meaningful growth in cash flow and earnings and look forward to sharing with you guidance built after our full 2016 budgeting process is complete. For now, we are confident 2016 will be another good year. We appreciate your interest in Marriott, so that we can speak to you, as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. So, Arne, thanks for all the color. Really helpful particularly, given all the lodging earnings calls we've been listening to for the past couple of days. Just had a question on October and we know from STR and we know for some comments that your peers have made, that October was weaker than expected due to lower than expected transient demand. Tough comps aside, I'm just trying to dig into the drivers here. Do you think that what's happened in October is a blip, and why do you think it's slowed? So, acknowledging that the visibility in your industry is kind of low, I'm just wondering if you expect that to improve. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. One of the dangers, of course, of all of this is, we've got so much data and it comes out really currently. So, you get Smith Travel coming out every week. You obviously are all struggling to get through one earnings call after another from participants in the lodging industry this week and next week. And I know we're sort of piling up on you and it makes it seemingly that much more imperative to assess these day-to-day or week-to-week figures, which is a little hard to do, of course. And the fact of matters, we've got numbers through basically last Sunday, which are the RevPAR numbers we referenced when we talk about 6% growth in October. And we can get anecdotal and, you know, some information about what's happening during the month on a week-to-week basis, but it's much better to analyze when the month comes to an end. What we see at this point is not very significant. Transient may be a touch weaker than we would have anticipated, but it's a touch. And, again, at 6% RevPAR growth, it still feels like a reasonably healthy number. Obviously, also this morning, we've got GDP news, with third quarter GDP out at a sub-2% number. We know GDP is highly correlated with demand, and you shouldn't hear our optimism or, I suspect, any of the voices from the industry, suggesting per minute that we will perform in a way that is disconnected with GDP performance. So, you know, that could be a piece of that as well. But, I think when we look at it, what we see is still strong appetite from group customers, still strong appetite from our corporate travelers, good performance from the leisure side, particularly when we're in holiday times of the year. And all of those things cause us to believe we should continue to see this RevPAR growth in this pretty healthy mid-single-digit range. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just something you said, was on group, was a good segue, so I'm just wondering, as you said, the group business remains really healthy. And just if you go back from your past experience and you look, think about all the past cycles historically, is it transient that's the leading indicator in the cycle, or is it group? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, neither really is a leading indicator; but transient is more or less coincident with GDP. Group would be very much a lagging indicator. At least when you look at group, stayed and paid, and of course, one of the \u2013 we now look, I think a little bit more than we did in prior cycles at group bookings in the quarter. But, the booking stats will probably be also coincident, I would guess, with the transient numbers. But, we still generally think we'd probably lag GDP numbers by, you know, a few months, something like that. Better would be looking at GDP data, I suppose. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. Can we look ahead into 2016 and discuss your buyback plans? Your leverage ratio seems to be at the moment at the higher end of the comfort level that you've outlined. And so, as part of your response, can you also talk about what your CapEx plans are in 2016 versus 2015? Is there any shot that you can get to over $2 billion worth of share repo in 2016? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we haven't done any of our budgets and planning for 2016 yet, so it's a little early to be looking out and trying to predict what our total share buyback would be in 2016. But I think, one thing you got to remember is that we had in 2015, Harry, we had a lot of asset sales, capital transactions in 2015, probably to the tune of about $800 million of capital was recycled, and the reality is we don't have a lot on the books today. As far as our, you know, to sell for next year. As far as our leverage goes, we're sitting right about three times when you adjust for leases and guarantees and all that, which is about where we would expect to be as of the end of the third quarter. So, as far as capital spending next year, right now, you would expect it to be what we average over the last several years. You know, we're always in that $500 million to $700 million range, $600 million to $800 million range. Some years it moves up a little bit, some years it's down a little bit, but you could probably count on it being somewhere in that neighborhood. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Very good. And then as a follow-up, Arne, if you could talk about there's an interesting disconnect between the performance in the base fees and the performance of the management fees or the franchise fees in the third quarter. And if you could talk a little bit about the reasons behind that. And to the extent, as you're signing new management contracts, are they at similar rates than your historic contracts? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, the answer to the second question first is a resounding yes. A couple of things going on in this. If you look at the combined base management and franchise fees, obviously, they are both driven by rooms revenues or gross revenues of the hotels. And when you look at actual dollar RevPAR in unit growth, you get a sort of implied growth of about 8.5%, something like that, in fees, and what we reported was a bit over 9%. Now the 9% I'm using, by the way, is adjusted for the special items that were called out in the press release. So, if you look at the press release, description of base management and franchise fees, you see in there, the year-over-year numbers for some deferred fee collections, year-over-year numbers for relicensing fees and the FX impact. So, you put those things together, you get the kind of growth, maybe even a little bit better than you would have expected from our unit growth and our RevPAR growth. Why a little bit better? Because sometimes you get some ramping in franchise fees, so as they get to year two or year three or year four, they're going up a little bit more than what they were before. That also is good confirmation about your second question, Harry, which is the percentages we're getting on these contracts for base and for franchise fees are remaining quite strong and stable, if not even growing a little bit. And then you get your question about, I think what you were also asking maybe was about really the difference in RevPAR between managed and franchised hotels. Is that right, Harry, or were you asking something else? Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: No, no, that's right. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think there, it's really a question of mix. We tend to be on average bigger in the managed portfolio than in the franchise portfolio. We tend to be more group reliant in the managed portfolio than in the franchise portfolio, and we tend to be more urban, more business destination in manage versus franchise. And all of those things play out with the weaker, relatively weaker group in Q3, and relatively weaker business, special corporate business in Q3, which, you know, relatively depresses the managed RevPAR numbers compared to the franchised. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. So, I had a question about the unit growth. You talked about the 8%. It looks like it's down about 50 basis points from the last call, and I know the release mentioned some delays in openings. And so, just kind of doing the math on that 50 basis points maybe slipping into 2016, is that when you talk about accelerating unit growth in 2016, would that still be the case if it weren't for the property openings kind of delayed? I guess, mathematically, it looks like that shift of 50 basis points is what makes 2016 accelerate. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Good question, Robin. Good morning. We have had, I don't know whether the 50 basis point is right, maybe, Carl or Laura can check as I talk about this for a minute. But we have had some openings shift from late 2015 we think into 2016. As we've scrubbed those, we think very few of those are projects that are actually at risk long-term. But there has been some slippage. I think there are different reasons for that in different parts of the world. As I mentioned, I was in China a couple of weeks ago. China conditions obviously have been less bullish in many aspects of their economy in the last quarter or so, and I think it's causing folks to rush a little less to get things completed, and as a consequence, we'll see some of those deals open in 2016 that we initially expected to open in 2015. And there are always some dynamics around the world, where things take a little bit longer than maybe we initially anticipate. That net-net could be positive for 2016, but I suspect we're also anticipating that some of the same dynamic will occur in 2016, so the bulk of the reason for our 8% organic growth number gross in 2016, is less about shifting of openings and more simply about the maturing of the pipeline. So at 8%, you're talking about, you know, roughly 60,000 rooms opening in 2016. Recall we signed 100,000 new rooms in calendar year 2014; and this year, we're obviously not done yet, but I suspect the numbers are going to be close to that figure; and so if anything, we should see that 2017 and 2018, we continue to perform at good, if not even growing gross opening numbers. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: A couple of questions, Arne. First of all, I think that what has happened in the investment space here is that investors are demanding actual proof that the cycle is not ending as opposed to taking it on faith when we hear commentary by you and Chris and other people. And I think over the last week, we've kind of shifted our expectations of proof into the first quarter of next year, given October commentary. Is there anything we need to be aware of for the first quarter of next year? Very difficult comps, maybe holiday shifts, anything else that might further delay this evidence that things are healthy? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: New Year's Day is on January 1 in 2016. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Easter will fall on a Sunday. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I don't. It's a good question and you can tell from my quip that maybe I don't know for certain about that. When we look at group bookings by quarter for next year, I mentioned we're up a bit over 7%. We're a little, a tiny little bit weaker than average in Q1 in the 5% to 6% range. Q2 is a bit stronger than the average for the full year. And then it looks like, and we have to go look at the calendar, but it looks like we're having a bit of a shift back of the fall holidays in favor of Q3 and maybe a little bit against Q4, because we've got a sort of gonzo set of numbers on the books for Q3, and a relatively weaker set of numbers on the books for Q4. When you average them all out again, we come up well above 7% for group bookings. That all suggests to me that the calendar issues are probably of significance more likely in Q3 and Q4 than in Q1 and Q2. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. The follow-up question really revolves around the development pipeline. We're seeing construction costs and labor costs, land costs increasing pretty dramatically across other parts of the real estate sectors. What are your developers telling you? What is the cost inflation out there, and how might that impact the growth of your pipeline? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I mean, they are certainly seeing both land and construction cost inflation. I think it varies significantly by market. The urban big destinations are seeing more of that as our sense than the suburban markets. And remember, a lot of our, the U.S. pipeline is this 1,000 hotels we talked about in our limited service brands. Some of those are urban projects like most of the ACs and Moxys that are getting underway now. But many of those are still in secondary and tertiary markets. And I think that the cost pressure there is meaningfully less. The other thing, we've got to keep in mind is projects still start notwithstanding that pressure, because you have both of the benefits of continued relatively cheap debt, and you've got better returns, because the results from these hotels are getting better every quarter. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Greff with JPMorgan. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Joe? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Joe, are you there? Operator : If your line is on mute, you need to, please unmute it. I'm sorry. Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Shaun. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Shaun. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, Arne, I'm going to apologize in advance for nitpicking on something so small, but just flag the comment and I think you sense the investor fear out there around some of the near-term data points. So, in the Q4 outlook, you made the comment that right now based on what you see, you're looking like you're probably closer to the low end of your range. And I was curious, with it sounds like October coming in at 6%, if you could elaborate at all on that. And again, this is just in the spirit of people who are, I think really looking for any real-time read on what's going on? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's a fair question. And I think somebody put out. And no, I don't remember who it was last night that, you know, if you thought you're at the lower end of that 5% or 7%, why didn't you just come out with a different number. And one of the fundamental points here is, we provide a range so that we can sort of contemplate a relevant, but a potential difference in the way the actual numbers ultimately come in. And we don't torture ourselves, and we don't torture our teams to try and change those models every time you get a new weekly data point. We do, you know, October is the most significant month of the three months in the quarter, so that 6% number, if it ultimately comes to pass is a comforting one. By the time you get into December, you've got less group reliance and much more transient reliance, which makes it a little harder to predict. And as a consequence, it's a little harder for us to sit here and say we can guarantee you what the December numbers are going to be, because a lot of that depends on transient business that has yet to show up. December is, of course, by contrast, the weakest of the three months in the quarter, because you slip more and more into non-travel periods and leisure times. We'd expect, though, that leisure business is going to be healthy, both in Thanksgiving and the end-of-the-year holidays, because you've got \u2013 that's what we've seen over the course of the year. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And I appreciate that. My follow-up is sort of a bigger picture question. But obviously all year long and really for pretty much the entire cycle, you guys have been very active on the stock buyback side of the capital return. But as we approach at least by duration standards made in later part of the cycle and we continue to hear a lot about strategic alternatives elsewhere in the sector, I'm kind of curious for, is there a time at which you start to think about perhaps dialing back and preserving some cash for opportunities that might emerge on the consolidation landscape? And maybe at a high level, if you could talk about how you're thinking about that, it would be great. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We've obviously participated, at least, in a small way, in some consolidation over the last few years, although those deals have always been like $200 million deals, nothing terribly significant. And we've obviously done some things around real estate, particularly as a way of getting some of the new brands off the ground, the three additional hotels we developed being the most significant of those. All of you have heard us talk in the past about not only being willing, but in some respects being eager to use our investing capacity to invest in growing in our business. If we can do it in a way that creates value for our shareholders, which means not simply chasing whatever the market prices are, that are out there, and it certainly does not mean doing real estate deals if our real estate partners are aggressive about doing real estate deals in delivering the growth to us in the organic way that we love so much. Carl mentioned, our leverage ratios at the end of Q3 were about three times, I think technically they were 2.93 times or something like that? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Just low. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And so even though, we've been really aggressive in buying back our stock, we thought it was a stunning buy in Q3, which is one reason the numbers were so big that we reported this morning. We are by no means over levered. We still have a machine that produces lots of cash, and we think we've got the ability to both be aggressive in buying back stock in the years ahead, but also be aggressive in whatever opportunities pop up, if they pop up, to participate in growing our business through our use of capital. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : We have a question from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay now? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey. There you are. You figured out the phone, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Figuring out the phone is almost as difficult as forecasting RevPAR correctly. But when you think about 2016, I know you characterized it, Arne, as sort of early thinking on 2016. When you think about the performance of the incentive management fees in 2016 versus 2015, would you say they have a sort of more historical base trend or relationship with RevPAR, particularly given the relatively easy year-over-year comparison in 2015? And then further on the net unit growth forecast for 2016, how are you thinking about that in terms of full-service versus deluxe service? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So let's see, incentive fee growth, think about \u2013 let's just think together about 2016 versus 2015, because we don't really have a number to give you, and won't until we get through our budgeting process. Obviously incentive fees have been impacted meaningfully by FX this year. Hopefully, we will not have that same pronounced impact next year, which would suggest that more of the constant dollar RevPAR growth as opposed to the actual dollar RevPAR growth should be coming through and helping that incentive fee number grow. We have had weakness in some big incentive fee markets this year in the U.S., New York, and Washington outside in markets like Hong Kong, Seoul, and some of the Middle Eastern markets. Is New York going to be a meaningfully different story in 2016 and 2015? I wouldn't think so. I think we'll continue to see in New York very high occupancy, good strong rates, and in absolute terms, a very healthy market. But it's a market that will continue to see supply growth and as a consequence, we wouldn't put that at the average level of RevPAR growth for the U.S., for example, today. Washington group bookings look better next year, which is a little bit unusual, because usually an election-year in Washington is not a great year for the hotel business, because the politicians are out on the hustings; but group business, I think if I remember right, is up in the 5% to 6% range for Washington. And so, Washington might be a little bit better than it's been in the past. Seoul will be better, I would think, assuming they don't have the MERS crisis. They do still struggle with their dominant company is Samsung, which is, responsible for nearly half of their economic GDP I think, and Samsung is in a very competitive place today. But I'd be interesting to see how they perform. Japan should perform well. The team in Hong Kong is not certain what the fate for that market looks like. Certainly, there has been much less inbound business from China in 2015, which has had an impact on our China numbers and particularly our incentive fees. I don't know that there's much we can look at that will help us decide whether that's going to do better or worse in 2016 and that will be relevant to fees. But sort of going through all of that, I would think that the numbers for incentive fee growth will be better than what we've seen this year, but we'll still have, you know, dependency on where exactly is that RevPAR growth coming through, and is it coming through in the markets which are bigger incentive fee contributions than others? Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the other question about full-service versus... Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Other questions about full-service versus limited service openings. I would think rough order of magnitude that, oh, it's 50%-50%-ish U.S. versus rest of the world in openings, maybe 55%, maybe a little over 50% in the U.S. and a little bit less in the rest of the world. Of the U.S. portion, I think it's something like 80%-20%, maybe even a little higher than 80%-20% in favor of limited service hotels. So, it's still a relatively rare full-service opening. We do have, and again, I don't remember off the top of my head, what full-service hotels are well under construction now and opening next year; but I suspect we've got a couple of big ones that are getting near opening by the end of next year. Unknown Speaker : Joe, you might also take a look at our Analyst Day last year. In Carl Berquist's presentation, we showed you the relative market sensitivity of incentive fees. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: By geographic market. Unknown Speaker : By geographic market, yeah. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. The one thing I wanted to kind of get some color on was it looks like Moxy and AC have 82 hotels signed. That's obviously a pretty sizable chunk for new brands to the U.S. Can you give us some color on, are you guys offering any incentives, are you doing anything to really drive those brands? Obviously, we've seen some competitors try to launch new brands in ground-up developments here in the U.S., and they haven't gotten that many openings in 10 years. So, what do you think you're doing differently that's really leveraging that to drive those, and also is there more upside for more new build brands in your portfolio? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, that's two or three questions, but thank you, that's good. I think the AC story is the one that I think is easiest to sort of boast about a little bit, but not just from a perspective of Marriott's role, but the perspective of the way that has evolved with our partners in the United States, and none of this is new, of course. We bought AC a few years ago thinking it would broaden our distribution in Spain, where we were weak. We thought we were getting a brand and an operating company at a relatively low point in the economic cycle, and both of those things caused us to think it was a deal worth doing and we did it. We didn't think at the time, it shows you maybe how dense we are, but we didn't think at the time that AC was at all relevant to markets like the United States. We thought maybe we could get some growth in other markets in Europe, but nothing really beyond there. To some extent, it took our franchisees, some of whom had been to Spain and seen these hotels, to come back and say, you know what you ought to grow AC in the United States, we'd love to grow it with you. And what they saw was a lifestyle upscale hotel that could fit nicely within our brand and our strategy to grow a lifestyle portfolio of brands. And so, they pushed us, and we ultimately thought that was a brilliant idea and so we launched it. But in many respects, we launched it with our partners. And what they see is a brand that fits wonderfully in our lineup already. They know how our brands perform. We did very detailed work on costing this with what the model rooms should look like and what the general approach to the operating model and public space was. And in short, it became clear that this was a project that broadly penciled. So, folks could get in, build it at fairly economic terms and drive strong projected cash flow returns. So, while we haven't been out there trying to grow AC for very long, we've got five open, as we speak, and a very strong pipeline, and if anything, that momentum is building a net pipeline. Moxy, to some extent, is a similar story, but it's a year behind AC. So, we obviously started that as a brand-new brand in Europe with two significant partners there. We're off to a good start in Europe, and similarly our folks in the United States said this is pretty interesting. Why don't you think about bringing it here? And so, we've done that. Now for neither of them are we doing anything significant in terms of promotion. I know that some of the early Moxy deals are in Manhattan, and we are participating in a few of those with some mezzanine debt financing, which is not dramatically unusual in a market like Manhattan, but it probably was maybe a little bit more necessary because it was a brand-new brand. But other than that, I can't think of any incentives that we've applied to that. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nothing unusual. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of your last question, is there more upside for more new brands, hopefully one day yes, but we have nothing that we've got up our sleeves at the moment in terms of new organic brand launches in the United States. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: And how about any holes in the portfolio that you think might be filled nicely by incremental tuck-in acquisitions like you've done recently with Gaylord and Delta and Protea? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think many of the deals we've done recently give us a broader distribution in markets where we've been weak. And so, the brands are as much geographic as they are completion of gaps in the brand lineup. We don't see many gaps in the brand lineup, but hopefully we'll see opportunity in the years ahead to continue to grow in some geographic markets where we are relatively less distributed, and some of that growth may come with brands that we don't already have. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Arne. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, Arne, Carl and Laura. Just a couple of questions. First, the Autograph collection had relatively weak RevPAR growth of 1.6%, while independent hotel RevPAR in the third quarter was strong. Is this what we should expect from Autograph? I think there are some larger properties there that might be moving that around, but maybe you could explain that. And second question is, what sort of markets are you seeing new supply in? What would you call out major cities or major geographic regions? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So a couple of things here. The reference to Smith Travel independent hotels, I think it's really important to know that Smith Travel independent hotels is not a segment of the industry, which is a lot like the Autograph brand. Look at the average rates and average occupancy of that segment as reported by Smith Travel, and you'll see that they are posting significantly lower rates and significantly lower occupancy than upper upscale or luxury or even upscale for that matter. Independents in that report are mostly about hotels that no longer can carry a quality brand and so have in some way fallen off of it or in some way are operating in markets which are different than the typical market. So, I don't think that comparison fits. Now at the same time, Autograph is, while it's grown quickly, is a relatively small portfolio. We have in the Cosmopolitan, for example, in Las Vegas a 3,000 room hotel that is a \u2013 can have a significant impact to the RevPAR numbers that we report year-over-year. We know when we look at the way the Autograph collection is performing, that that portfolio has taken about 10 points of RevPAR index since converting from being independent to being part of Marriott's Autograph collection. And so, we are absolutely certain we are driving outsized market results with the conversion of those hotels to our brands. Question two from Steve? Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.: It's about supply. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Manhattan would be the first, of course, New York. That market has seen 30% of their supply growth over the last handful of years. I suspect we will see continuing supply growth in New York for the next few years, so that would be one. I think Miami is certainly in the luxury space, has seen supply growth, and I suspect we'll see some more of it in the next couple of years. But probably not in a way that is as dramatic as what's happened in New York. Carl, any other U.S. cities you can think of? Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : U.S., nothing like New York... Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Nothing that comes to mind is significant. Then you get overseas, of course, Dubai, and some of the Middle Eastern markets are significant with supply growth. We called out Istanbul. Istanbul and Turkey have seen significant supply growth. I think those two places would be the ones that come top of mind. Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Sorry if I missed this, but any color on how corporate rate negotiation is going for next year? And then also Hilton touched a little bit high level on recent OTA negotiations. Can you give any color if you've had similar? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We did have in our prepared remarks some comments about special corporate rates for next year. We think mid-single-digit RevPAR growth, so in the same range as the RevPAR range we provided for the full shop. I suspect we'll see that some \u2013 we continue to call some of the lower rated special corporate business. We've done that a little bit in the last few years. I think we've been probably as aggressive as any in the industry in both driving those rates and to some extent being willing to take a little bit more risk by saying to some of the lower rated special corporate accounts that we're simply not going to take you and we hope that you will come back and participate in our hotels at a rack rate. And I suspect we'll do some more of that next year. But it's still early in the process, and so I would take that as directional comments not necessarily as something that's totally proven, but mid single-digit. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: OTA. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Our comments would be a bit like Hilton's yesterday. There's nothing that we can publish specifically about the results of negotiations. We do think that the kinds of principles they've talked about are the same sorts of things we've talked about, which is we want to make sure we have as much ability to yield our rooms on various channels so that at fuller occupancy times we have the contractual right not to have every room available on every channel, no matter how expensive those channels are for us. We also want to make sure that we've got the ability to do what we've been doing, which is deliver value to Marriott Reward members booking directly with us, which we've done through free Wi-Fi and other tools like that in the past year or two. And so, we continue to pursue similar kinds of philosophical aims and feel like we're making good progress on that. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, on other Asia Pacific, you said you expected that to be up mid-single-digits next year, but all your commentary seems pretty positive. I just wanted to see if I'm missing something. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I mean mid-single-digit we would say is reasonably positive. So, that... Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I mean, I guess compared to other regions, other regions you kind of highlighted like, there's some gives and takes versus other Asia Pacific it was all pretty positive. And I mean, using your peer, Hilton again, they, I think, guided more to the higher end of the range. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. One thing important to keep in mind, China is obviously a significant market when it comes to the region as a whole. Probably roughly half of our total distribution in Asia-Pacific is in Greater China. We talked about Hong Kong being weak-ish. We talked about Q3 China numbers being relatively good, particularly in markets like Shanghai and (59:56). But when you look at China, you see different stories from place to place. And it's really important to keep in mind that portfolios of hotels depending on their maturity can have reported numbers in a quarter which are very different. The longer somebody has been in China with broad distribution, the fewer ramping hotels they'll have. Ramping meaning newly comparable. And so, when we look at our numbers in Greater China this year, we see less contribution to our RevPAR growth from ramped hotels than we have in most of the last few years because our portfolio has gotten to be quite sizable. But we still see that we have grown RevPAR index in China by four to five points in 2015 alone, building on top of some great years in the past so that our RevPAR index is now in the 125 range, which is a huge premium over competing hotels in the market. A long-winded way of saying, our RevPAR at mid-single-digit next year for China is still a very strong number. We will be even more mature in China with hotels that we've got open than we were this year, and so we'll have less of that ramping effect. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to circle back on your third-quarter RevPAR performance in North America at 4.2%. I understand the whole industry was impacted by the calendar shifts and things that have been spoken about. But your RevPAR gains were so far below what Smith Travel put up for the third quarter and below the other companies that have reported. And I was just wondering if you could comment on any kind of market share shift or maybe concentration that maybe hurt you more than others or anything you're seeing along those lines? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely. I think it's a perfectly fair question. It shouldn't surprise you to know that when we look at market share, which is the best measure to look at, it's not in comparison against Smith Travel, I'll talk about that in second. But when you look at market share numbers, we lost a little bit of market share in Q3 in exactly the kinds of hotels that you would expect. Group business was weak, and therefore, our convention center hotels, which we have more of than most of the industry by a significant measure, were hotels that lost a bit of market share, why? Because often a big 1,500 or 2,000 room hotel will have within its competitive set hotels which are meaningfully smaller and, therefore, are less reliant on group business than the market than we are. And if you adjust for that and a bit of renovation activity, we see our performance as being roughly comparable to the market. Now when you compare it with Smith Travel, Smith Travel is reporting every single hotel open in a given market and how that RevPAR compared to what happened in the past. We report RevPAR only for comp hotels. So, those are hotels that have got two years' worth of stabilized comparative performance. And when you do that, you are taking the fastest-growing RevPAR, year-over-year RevPAR growth hotels out of a comparative point. So, we have tried to calculate what our RevPAR would be, if we use Smith Travel numbers, and basically those growth numbers would be a point to two higher than what our reported numbers are. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. First question, when you think back to the scenarios that you gave on your Investor Day a-year-and-a-half ago, would you look back and say that, for example, net income for 2017 at this point looks on target, conservative or aggressive? And also other metrics such as incentive management fees. I guess if you were to go back in time, would you say, wow, these are too conservative given what's happened and what we expect or they are in line with those original expectations. And again, I understand that that wasn't guidance, it was just scenarios, but if you could give some thought on that? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'd suspect we find some things that are a bit better and some things that are bit worse. But all-in-all, it's probably still a model which is relevant. Now we should be careful in saying that. I don't want to communicate for a second that we've got a brand-new three-year model, which is sitting in my right, which shows that the numbers for 2017 are the same as what we published for you last year. But just thinking about the drivers, I would think that unit growth is probably a bit stronger than what we had. I would think that the share repurchase activity that we've done and the impact of that is a bit better than what we had in that model. In other words, not only have we bought significantly, but we probably bought at marginally better pricing than we had in that model, and earlier. And so, I think both those things are positives. RevPAR itself, I'd have to go back and look at that \u2013 look at the forecasts we used. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We were at 4% to 6%. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We were at 4% to 6%, and we kind of tapered the RevPAR growth just because we thought with each year of economic recovery we should obviously expect a bit less. But I would think we're maybe not far off, certainly within the same broad range. So, put all those \u2013 by the way, incentive fees, my guess could be a bit lighter. Because when you look at what we will actually report in incentive fee growth this year, substantially impacted by FX which we would not have anticipated when we did that model that we published for you a year ago. I suspect we would see FX impact on fees generally being tougher and probably the incentive fee growth numbers being a bit weaker than what we had in that model. But put all those things together, I suspect you're probably still with the relevant model. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-up question, when we think about incentive management fee growth for next year, you know let's just hypothetically say, for currency neutral in a currency neutral scenario and let's say occupancy is flat next year, what level of ADR growth would you need to have in order to at least be flat year-over-year for incentive management fees? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know that I can give you that. I mean I think in the U.S., you probably need to have, I don't know, three percentage RevPAR growth. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : 3%, I would think just to break even. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: 3% to have flat margins. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Flat margins on 3% revenue growth means your incentive fees are growing 3%. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you get to the rest of the world, the formulas differ. And by the way, in the rest of the world, we'll have a number of full-service hotels that are in year two or three or four of their operation, which means they're probably growing faster. And hopefully, if you've got flat FX, we'll see reasonably healthy IMF fee growth next year. But we're going a little far afield here in the sense that we're building on things that we really need to go through our budgeting process in order to give you... Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That's still more complex thing. Yeah. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...something that's reliable. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Do you mind if I sneak one last question in? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You can give it a try. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Just what is your income sensitivity, what is the latest income sensitivity to one additional point of net room growth? I know you've given that in the past. What is that currently? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Net room growth or net RevPAR growth? Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: No, room. One additional point of, percentage point of room growth in say 2016 is worth how much in net income? For example, you know, you said you've given the outlook. Was it 6% or around 7%? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All I would do is say that's worth one point increment in fees. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And probably the admin \u2013 if your base model has got admin in it, you probably don't need to add any admin to go with that. And so that drops down and run it through your normal tax rate that Carl has got in the P&L model, and that would be your number. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: I wanted to circle back to corporate. I'm curious about the tone of your discussions with corporate customers during rate negotiation season. Do you get a sense that their plans consist of stepping up, maintaining or reducing travel as we head into next year? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's maybe stable to up a bit. We don't hear a regular commentary that would suggest that they're going to try and cut back on travel. At the same time, it probably shouldn't surprise you that not many special corporate people come in, in the context of a negotiation and say we're going to dramatically increase our volume next year. But I think on balance, we see continued good tone in that group of customers. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Helpful. Thanks. And then second on the topic of OTAs, could you provide an update on how the Trip partnership is progressing? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's off to a very good start, but we're not going to share any statistics with you yet. And whether and how we do in the future, we'll have to see. We announced it I don't remember precisely the date, I would think about the beginning of the third quarter, maybe a little bit before. We didn't actually go live on TripAdvisor until we were well into the third quarter. So, we don't have a full quarter yet worth of results, but we like what we're seeing. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Jeff. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Arne, you were telling us recently a more aggressive cancellation policy has benefited occupancy. Can you estimate for us how much that might have helped occupancies, and maybe what plans you have for 2016 to broaden either the hotels that applies to or any plans to expand that policy to be even more restrictive? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We followed most of our competitors. I don't know if I can tell you exactly where every single person is, but we saw most of our competitors move to a 24-hour cancellation window from a same-day cancellation. And we did the same thing roughly first of the year, if I remember right. And what we've seen that is particularly gratifying is a reduction in the number of folks that get walked. So, that's a little bit different point than the one you raised. So, in the past, with same-day cancellations, you actually didn't know who's going to show up into your hotel until the day ended. And as a consequence, you had hotels all over the place trying to say, all right, we know that some percentage of our customers won't show up, because they've got free ability to cancel until the last minute. And so, let's do some overbooking in order to make sure that we've got guests to fill those rooms if somebody cancels. And we've seen that because of this 24-hour cancellation rule, we've got a lot of that walk the business down, which obviously is not something that anybody likes, if you are being forced to walk. The other thing what we see is, we've got high occupancy days, meaning days above 96% that are 5% more of those days than we did a year ago. And I think that's also driven by this. I think for those that were less aggressive about overbooking and risking having to walk folks, they've now got that much more clarity to put business on the books and drive the occupancy even higher. But I think also this is driven by good healthy demand as well, so it's not purely a function of the cancellation policy. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. And just I'm curious what are the industry and economic variables that maybe push you to the top or bottom end of your 4% to 6% outlook for the U.S. market next year? Are there specific thresholds to GDP or other variables you need to see? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think so, no. I think about demand and GDP as being correlated. So, the better GDP is the better chance we have it being towards the higher end of that. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's actually on transient. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And maybe just one last question on advertising costs. I'm just curious, as you ramp MLive and others social media channels, can you curtail more traditional advertising channels, or is it all kind of incremental at this point? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, that's what we're doing. We have essentially a fixed percentage that is contributed to pay for sales and marketing initiatives from hotels. We do have more dollars coming in because of the number of units that we're adding to the system, but we're not increasing the charge-out rate in given hotels. We are spending in areas that we haven't spent in the past to do things like make movies and do social media and do all sorts of fun stuff, which we think actually is succeeding very well. But we are \u2013 to find dollars to do that, we're having to spend less in some areas that we've spend money on before. That would certainly include traditional TV advertising. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Operator : Our final question comes from Chris Agnew with MKM Partners. Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Chris. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC : You talked about your share of U.S. supply growth versus room share. Can you provide same data points for Europe and Asia? I know that encapsulates a lot of different stories, but can you give us a broad overview, and also what is industry supply growth in Europe and Asia, if you can share that? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Those are all good questions, Chris, and I think you're going to stump us here on the last question. This is a little bit different measure than you talked about, but we do try and track in Asia-Pacific, our market share of new deals that the industry signs. And it's a little hard to get, but a number of our principal competitors are willing to share through a clearinghouse, okay, how many deals did you sign in the quarter across particular regions of the world, and we think we are doing great, that we've got \u2013 this is not \u2013 the industry as a whole necessarily this will probably be the bigger lodging companies, and what share of the total signings of all those companies do we have? And we think in a market like Asia-Pacific, where we have been certainly in the full-service and luxury tiers where we are most focused in that part of the world that we are in first quarter or second quarter after quarter and that our share is dramatically higher than our current distribution. So, that's an example of the kind of data that we see that causes us to believe that we are seeing some of the same kind of dynamics that we see in the United States, where the data is much more available. In the United States, you've got both STR and lodging econometrics that look at essentially all new industry deals, and it gives us all an ability to both have a third-party measure but also look at it with our own eyes. Europe, I don't have, at least not top of mind, quite the same insight, but our teams see that our pipeline is growing well, and we think the brands are competing well. So, I'm sure, we're taking meaningfully more share in the development side than we have of the existing hotel distribution. Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks. And maybe just one more, hopefully a quick one. Can you give us any color on transient demand maybe by source demand in terms of different industries? Thanks. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I don't have that. If you give us a call, we can help you with that. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, give a call. The only thing I think we know is that the weakness in oil makes some markets like Houston weaker than other markets. And obviously, you can identify which markets that the industry segment is most relevant to, and there we see some customers that are under pressure, and we see demand trends which are weaker than in the rest of the world. But if you look at technology, you look at finance, both significant customers of ours and what you see is good health. And I actually think that the data around RevPAR by market is less about the industry of customers than it is about supply in some of those markets. The demand trends still remain quite strong. Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC : Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you all very much for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in Marriott and look forward to welcoming you into our hotels as you travel. Carl T. Berquist - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Marriott International's third quarter 2015 earnings call. Please enjoy the rest of your day.",

KG (United Kingdom) Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Marriott International's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Before we get started, I'd like to thank Carl Berquist for his outstanding financial leadership over the last 14 years. During his tenure as CFO at Marriott, we announced the Starwood deal, acquired AC Hotels, Gaylord, Protea, and Delta, and created considerable value by spinning off our timeshare business. Further, he bought back nearly 150 million shares of stock at an average price of $47. He brought us through the tough times in 2009 and 2010 and like many of you, Carl remains a Marriott shareholder. Thank you, Carl, for everything. I'd also like to welcome Leeny Oberg to the CFO position. Also a great leader, Leeny brings a wealth of Marriott experience including project finance, international finance, corporate financial planning and most recently CFO of our Ritz-Carlton organization. She started her career in banking and her Marriott career in Investor Relations, so I know she well understands the Street. As always, before we get into the discussion of our results, let me first remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed and/or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today, are effective only today, February 18, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. To begin, the biggest Marriott news in 2015 was our announced acquisition of Starwood. The transaction is on track and we expect to close around midyear 2016. The S-4 went effective yesterday. We expect a proxy solicitation will be mailed to shareholders of both companies on or about February 19 to stockholders of record as of February 2. And the special shareholder meetings for both Marriott and Starwood are scheduled for March 28. We are seeking government approval for the transaction in multiple jurisdictions. Starwood's timeshare spinoff and merger with ILG is proceeding on schedule and we do not expect this transaction to delay our acquisition of Starwood. While we are on track, Marriott and Starwood are still separate public companies and are limited in the information we may share with each other and you. So our discussions today about RevPAR, booking pace, pipeline, unit growth, EPS guidance and so forth are for the Marriott business only and do not reflect the impact of the acquisition. Like you, we eagerly await this afternoon's comments from Starwood about their business trends. So let's get started. Attendance at ALIS Conference in L.A. this year was a bit light due to the deluge of East Coast snow but there was still a lot of conversation at the conference. And the number one topic was the disconnect between stock performance and hotel fundamentals. Let's start with two facts about this business. First, it is cyclical with demand highly correlated to GDP growth, capital investment and the employment. Second, it has seasonality and can be sensitive to holidays, group bookings and special events. In any given quarter, it's sometimes difficult to see which of these aspects of the business are most impactful. This was true in the fourth quarter. System-wide North America RevPAR grew 5% in October, roughly 4% in November and just under 3% in December. We believe it was the modest growth in GDP in the fourth quarter that constrained our transient business particularly premium rated business. As we typically have little group business during the holiday season, we turn to price sensitive travelers, opening discounts for AAA members, seniors and others. As a result, our fourth quarter occupancy still reached near record levels, although room rates were modestly weaker than anticipated. Other factors also came into play. In Houston, system-wide RevPAR declined 8% in the quarter reflecting weakness in the energy sector. While occupancy in our New York hotels remained very strong at 88%, our RevPAR growth in New York declined 1% as new supply constrained pricing. In San Francisco, RevPAR growth moderated from earlier in the year rising only 6% in the quarter as high prices detoured guests to more affordable destinations like Los Angeles where RevPAR saw a double digit increase. Make no mistake, business travelers are on the road. While the energy and manufacturing sectors were weak in the quarter, we saw significant strength in technology, professional services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, automotive and media. In fact, room sales from our nearly 300 largest corporate customers increased 4% in the fourth quarter, 7% excluding energy and manufacturing companies. And near-term transient trends in North America are improving. System-wide total transient revenue increased roughly 2% in December and nearly 2.5% in a very snowy January. For February, transient revenue on the books is up nearly 4% to date. For the full year, our special corporate customers tell us they expect to travel at least as much in 2016 as in 2015. And with special corporate negotiations nearly complete, we expect special corporate pricing to increase at a mid-single digit rate in 2016. Group business is even stronger. North American group revenue in the fourth quarter increased 6%, and attendance at meetings exceeded expectations. Catering revenue also increased 6% with considerable last minute food and beverage upgrades. New group business booked in the fourth quarter for any period in the future increased 10% year-over-year. Group revenue booking pace for the first quarter of 2016 is up 2%, reflecting the shift in timing of Easter year-over-year. Not surprisingly, the second quarter is much stronger with revenue pace up 9%. For the full year 2016, group revenue booking pace is up 7%. Incidentally, with very high occupancy rates and limited hotel meeting space, groups are booking earlier. Group revenue booking pace for 2017 is up 8%, while 2018 is up 9%. So what does this mean for RevPAR guidance? With the tough Easter comparison, we expect 2% to 4% RevPAR growth in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect North American RevPAR growth at the upper end of 3% to 5%. Our full-year outlook is tempered a bit from our October view due to incremental weakness in the energy and manufacturing sectors and a modestly lower GDP growth assumption for 2016. Elsewhere in the world, economies in Italy and Spain are recovering nicely, while German economic growth has cooled with fewer exports to China. Despite Russia's ongoing recession, we saw higher domestic demand in our hotels in Moscow in the fourth quarter. Security concerns continue to weigh on demand in Paris and Brussels and to a lesser extent in London. In 2015, Europe represented 7% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect Europe's RevPAR to increase at a low single-digit rate. In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR declined in the fourth quarter due to security concerns, low oil prices, and Dubai oversupply. For 2016, we are modeling low single digit RevPAR growth, as expected infrastructure investment in UAE and Qatar, economic growth in Africa, and easing comparison in Egypt should improve results late in the year. In 2015, the Middle East and Africa represented 3% of our worldwide fee revenue. In the Asia-Pacific region, China's economic growth moderated in 2015, yet mainland China RevPAR still rose roughly 4% in the fourth quarter. Chinese consumers continue to spend. In fact, international travel from Mainland China to our hotels in other markets increased 31%. In India, the improving economy drove RevPAR up 12%. In 2015 the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 8% of our worldwide fee revenue. For 2016, we expect the Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow RevPAR at a mid-single-digit rate, with continued strength in India, Japan, and Thailand. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, solid economic growth in Mexico is driving both RevPAR and hotel expansion, while the Caribbean remains an attractive venue for groups and an appealing warm weather playground for tourists, particularly after they dig out from under two feet of snow. We have seen a few cancellations due to the Zika virus and are watching this carefully. Hotels in affected areas are fogging outdoor areas, providing mosquito repellent for guests, and dealing with areas of standing water. While Brazil remains in recession, we are hopeful that the summer Olympics will lift RevPAR in that market in 2016. For the full year, we expect RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in the Caribbean and Latin America. In 2015, the region accounted for 4% of our worldwide fee revenue. All in all, we believe our worldwide system-wide RevPAR will grow at 3% to 5% for the year. Our system grew by nearly 52,000 rooms in 2015, 11,000 in the fourth quarter alone, taking our system to nearly 760,000 rooms worldwide. New owner and franchisee signings in 2015 reached a record 104,000 rooms, taking our development pipeline to more than 270,000 rooms, another new high. Our brands continue to be preferred by hotel developers. According to STR, at year-end 2015, 27% of hotels under construction in North America were affiliated with one of Marriott brands, more than any other hotel company. Outside North America, in recent years we've enhanced growth and increased speed to market by decentralizing decision-making, tailoring brands to local market tastes, and building relationships with local partners to drive development. This has really made a difference to our limited service brands. In fact, in the past five years our limited service portfolio outside North America has more than tripled to 316 hotels, with another 250 hotels in the development pipeline. Consistent with this strategy, yesterday we announced a long-term agreement with Eastern Crown Hotels Group for development of Fairfield hotels in China. Demand for economy-tier lodging has grown rapidly in China in a relatively short period of time, as the middle class has rapidly expanded. Eastern Crown is targeting 140 signed deals over five years, including 100 Fairfield hotels expected to open by 2021. Worldwide with our strong brands and deep development pipeline, in 2016 we expect our rooms will increase by roughly 7% net of deletions. While not included in our growth targets, nevertheless we expect our worldwide system will take a significant leap forward with the completion of the Starwood acquisition. This transaction will expand our presence around the world, broaden our appeal to younger travelers, and increase the growth opportunities for Starwood's valuable brands. In addition, the combination of Starwood's leading lifestyle brands with Marriott's strong presence across the select service and luxury tiers as well as our convention and resort segment will create a very attractive portfolio that should be more appealing to guests and meeting planners, and thus more appealing to owners and franchisees as well. We believe the transaction offers meaningful opportunities for shareholders, hotel owners, and hotel franchisees through enhanced growth and improved efficiency. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood's brands by leveraging our hotel development expertise and strong relationships. We continue to estimate that we will achieve annual run rate synergies of at least $200 million by the second full year after closing. Excluding transition and transaction costs, we continue to expect the transaction will be EPS accretive in the second full year after closing. We know you have many questions about our brand strategies, integration plans, and specific efficiency opportunities. We don't have answers for you today and ask for your patience as we work through these decisions and plans. We believe this transaction will create substantial value for Marriott and Starwood shareholders and look forward to working aggressively towards its completion. In Marriott's history, there have been a few profound decisions that changed the company's course and launched us to greater success. In 1979, we sold our first portfolio of owned hotels and became hotel managers. In 1993, we created Host Hotels, further reducing our real estate focus and stepping up franchising. We became a pure-play lodging company just five years ago with the spinoff of our timeshare business. We believe this acquisition is as significant. It will make us the largest hotel company in the world, focused solely on management and franchising, with a very strong portfolio of great brands, powerful loyalty programs, and terrific prospects for the future. Now to provide more information about the fourth quarter and our 2016 outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny. Leeny? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Thanks, Arne. Marriott is known for its quality brand portfolio and asset-light business model. For those of you who have followed us for a while, you also know we're serious about transparent disclosures and delivering high returns to shareholders. While the Starwood transaction will do much to change Marriott, it won't change those commitments. I'm looking forward to getting to know as many of you as possible in the coming months. So let's look at the results. 2015 was a great year. Worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 5% on a constant dollar basis. Total fee revenue reached $1.9 billion, constrained by about $32 million of foreign exchange. Incentive fees in North America increased 18%, largely due to strong performance at our limited service hotels and our California and Florida resorts. For the full year 2015, the percentage of North American hotels paying incentive fees increased from 36% to 63%. The increase in the number of hotels paying fees was largely due to three portfolios of limited service hotels that earned $7 million in incentive fees in the full year 2015 and are expected to earn higher incentive fees amounts in 2016. Incentive fees from our international hotels declined during the year, primarily due to $15 million of foreign exchange headwinds. In the fourth quarter, worldwide system-wide RevPAR rose 4% on a constant dollar basis and 2% on an actual dollar basis. Total fee revenue in the quarter increased 6%, constrained by $12 million of foreign exchange. Our hotels did an outstanding job in the fourth quarter, as they focused on the bottom line. House profit margins at company-operated hotels increased 90 basis points in North America and 70 basis points worldwide. House profit per available room rose faster than RevPAR, up 9% in North America and 7% worldwide. Fourth quarter incentive fees in North America increased 20% to $33 million, with particular strength in full-service hotels in Florida and Washington DC. Incentive fees in international markets declined 12% in the quarter, reflecting tough foreign exchange comparisons and a few weak markets in the Middle East and Latin America. Owned, leased, and other revenue declined 7% in the quarter largely due to weaker revenue growth at a hotel under renovation and unfavorable foreign exchange. Net of expenses, owned, leased and other increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to higher termination fees and lower preopening expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 4% in the quarter reflecting $5 million in transaction costs associated with the Starwood acquisition and higher net hotel development costs. We received $62 million in cash in the fourth quarter for our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton hotel. For the full year 2015, we recycled nearly $950 million from asset sales, investment redemptions and note collection. Our fourth quarter tax rate was lower than expected, largely due to the St. Thomas transaction and a favorable IRS settlement. We expect our book tax rate to be roughly 32.3% in 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, our 2% to 4% expected RevPAR growth and continued unit expansion should yield $475 million to $485 million in fee revenue. We're expecting $13 million in lower relicensing fees for the quarter versus last year. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of expenses should be flattish in the first quarter due to tough comparisons to last year. As I mentioned, we recently sold the St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton. As an owned hotel in its seasonally strong first quarter of 2015, the property earned nearly $6 million. First quarter G&A should total roughly $160 million. We still have a tough comparison to $13 million in favorable litigation settlements in the prior year. Our G&A estimate does not include Starwood acquisition related expenses. All in all, we expect EPS for the first quarter will total $0.81 to $0.85. For the full year with 3% to 5% worldwide RevPAR growth and roughly 7% net unit growth, we expect fee revenue will increase 79% to reach roughly $2 billion. We expect roughly $30 million negative FX impact on year-over-year fee revenue growth in 2016. Even including FX impact, we expect incentive fees will increase at a 10% to 15% growth rate with continued strength in North America. We expect full-year owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, will increase roughly 20%, reflecting the impact of completed hotel renovations and higher branding fees from residential sales as several projects should begin sales during the year. Further, we expect higher credit card branding fees with growth in new accounts and cardholder sales. We expect general and administrative costs will increase 3% to 4% in 2016, a 3% to 4% decline on a per-room basis. Net interest expense should increase to roughly $160 million, reflecting both higher borrowings and higher interest income. All combined, we expect 2016 fully diluted EPS will total $3.69 to $3.86, an increase of 17% to 23%. Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 should grow 10% to 14%. We understand there are a variety of opinions about likely economic growth. Our 2016 outlook assumes roughly 2.5% growth in U.S. GDP. For those of you with more bearish economic views, we believe that flat U.S. GDP would still likely yield roughly 2% RevPAR growth at our hotels in North America given today's supply environment. Given our significant management and franchise business, we expect this scenario would still yield mid-teens 2016 EPS growth and high single digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Remember, our guidance excludes the pending Starwood acquisition. We expect the P&L impact of Starwood will be very noisy in 2016 due to the transition and transaction costs. We will provide more information about the transaction during the second quarter earnings call. Investment spending in 2016 should total $450 million to $550 million, including about $100 million in maintenance CapEx spending. With few owned assets remaining, we expect asset sales and loan repayments will total roughly $200 million to $250 million. Our business strategy enables us to grow rapidly in a strong market and continue to deliver attractive returns in a weaker one. Compared to 2007, today we have 40% more rooms in our system worldwide. Our development pipeline is deeper. Our cash flow is less volatile. We are out of the timeshare business, and while we still earn attractive incentive fees, those fees represented only 17% of fee revenue in 2015 compared to 26% in 2007. Today, we estimate that a one-point change in our RevPAR outlook across our system for the full year 2016, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $25 million in fees and roughly $3 million of owned, leased and other net. Even after completion of the Starwood transaction, we intend to remain a solid investment-grade company with strong access to capital markets. We will be out of the market until after the special shareholders meetings, but expect to resume share repurchases as soon as possible thereafter. In fact, we expect to return more than $2 billion to shareholders in 2016 through share repurchases and dividends just from our legacy Marriott business. With the Starwood transaction, returns to shareholders could be meaningfully higher. As we approach the integration of Marriott and Starwood, we've identified a few guiding principles. We will continue to put people first. This is our cultural touchstone because taking care of associates enables them to take care of the guests. We recognize customer service is the foundation of every lodging brand and RevPAR premiums. Throughout the integration process, we intend to drive results for owners and franchisees to help enhance the value of their hotel investment. For shareholders, we will continue to look for ways to leverage the scale and opportunities from this transaction, to drive value beyond the base case synergies we've outlined for you, and we intend to do all of this as quickly as possible. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Laurie, we'll take questions now. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. I do have questions on the deal but I know that you probably wouldn't be able to answer, so I'm going to stick to asking about your incentive management fees. Just looking at the percent of properties paying and I know that the full year number is more relevant than just the percent that we're paying in Q4. You're above your previous peak, and as is your RevPAR, and I guess your international mix. Do you have a view on where that may go to across the range of your RevPAR guidance in 2016? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : I think next year you could expect the percentage of hotels earning incentive fees to go up a few more percentage points. Not a whole lot more than that. There is obviously some seasonal variety, depending on whether it's first quarter or fourth quarter in terms of how we recognize incentive fees, but I would expect that it could go up slightly next year. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : And then just to follow up to that, I guess in terms of the actual dollar amount, because you had a big increase in terms of percent of properties paying. But the dollar fees, the Q4 decline, part of that was related to FX which I guess on a year-over-year basis may not be as big of a negative in 2016. But how would you expect in terms of dollar amounts it will correlate to that kind of increase in properties? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : I think next year, you could look to our incentive fees getting hopefully back up close to where our peak was in 2007. So, the guidance that would be at the top end of the range, if that's where we hit. But I think broadly the 10% to 16% increase of the guidance that we've given does take into consideration some FX impact, but largely represents the fact of a few more percentage points of hotels earning incentive fees. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : And again, I will say North America is the biggest driver of this bus in 2016. You're going to see really strong incentive growth from the North American properties. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. And, Carl, best wishes. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Good morning, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: And welcome, Leeny. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Thank you, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So if you guys could, talk about the challenges that you face integrating the two companies and their systems. We're getting several questions about going back to the Ryman acquisition. I guess the question really is, what are you doing to be as thorough as you can so that you avoid some of the pitfalls? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : It's a good question. I think we are hopefully learning from the experiences we've had in the past few years. You can, to some extent, look at the Gaylord acquisition and the Protea and Delta acquisitions as warm-up acts for this, I suppose. And hopefully, we're getting better at it. Now at the same time, obviously, Starwood is a much bigger deal than any of those were, which presents some positive differences and then some greater challenges. I think on the positive side, Starwood is hopefully less distracted by the process of the sale of the company. And you've got a big talented group of folks over there running 350,000 rooms or so. But I know the Starwood team, with our encouragement, is very much focused on continuing to drive sales and to drive the development engine. And we've taken steps to try and put our arms around those teams of folks so that they are as little distracted by this as possible. I think some of the other deals we did early, it was that sales engine which looked like it got distracted during a sales process and to some extent between the negotiate \u2013 or the signing of a deal and the closing of a deal. And we're doing everything we can to plan for integration of systems and integration of business units between now and when we close so that we can implement those as quickly as possible. And we're optimistic at this point that this will go well. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Arne, are the systems relatively comparable? How much of headwind do you have there? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : It won't surprise you to know there are many systems. On the property level, the property management systems, they both have the same core engine running them. And I think actually unlike in prior deals, we will not try and move all of one portfolio of hotels to some other property management system from the one that they've got, and instead find a way to make those systems communicate above the property in a way that hopefully will be much easier. But then you get to some places like email systems or the like, which are very identical. But other systems which are unique and have been custom developed by each of Starwood and Marriott. Generally, our plan is as quickly as feasible to move to one system, not two. By doing that, we think we will provide efficiencies to our hotel owners and franchisees. We'll provide ease of operation, and we should free up resources to invest in loyalty program system and some other things, which are much more strategically important. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: My second question is probably for Leeny. Is there much share repurchase baked into your earnings guidance this year? And if so, is it weighted? How is it weighted, and what are the assumptions on the acquisition price? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : So as we talked about before, Harry, the numbers that we're looking at in all the things that we're talking about today reflect only Marriott, core legacy Marriott. So obviously, we would assume that and hope that once we've acquired Starwood that you would see share repurchase go even higher than the numbers that we've presented. But what we've talked about is that we could see total capital return to shareholders of over $2 billion in 2016; that will have the roughly similar payout on the dividend side and the rest in share repurchase. First quarter is obviously quite constrained, and basically what you've seen us buy to date is probably pretty much it given that now until shareholder vote we're out of the market. But then we look forward to being back in the market as aggressively as we can and look forward to still hitting those numbers assuming all goes well for the rest of the year. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: But is $2 billion baked into... Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : And I would \u2013 sorry? Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Is the $2 billion or say$1.5 billion baked into or included in your earnings estimate guidance? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Yes. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, all right. We'll follow up in a little while. Thanks very much. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Hi, Felicia. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Hi, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Arne, it was helpful in your prepared remarks to give us some color regarding what happened to your transient business in the fourth quarter, so thank you for that. Just looking forward, you've given us some nice detail about what the forward group bookings look like and what your corporate negotiated business looks like. I'm wondering as we look to 2016, how are you modeling for transient and leisure segments? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : I think the transient obviously is both business and leisure. You get the leisure piece of it, but I think we will see transient grow in about the same range. Let me just talk a little bit more about the philosophy around our RevPAR guidance of 3% to 5% for 2016, which has been noted obviously in a number of early reports that have come out that that's a point lower than what we thought a quarter ago. What's changed between then and now, I think we look at a world in which there's obviously more anxiety in the marketplace. There's a bit more anxiety about what GDP growth is going to look like in 2016. And as a consequence, we've been a bit more conservative in the forecast that we've provided. When we look internally at our own budgets that are rolled up by hotel, and this is a U.S. focused comment obviously, I think our expectations have maybe declined by about 0.5 point from where we've guessed they were a quarter ago. And that's why we mentioned in the prepared remarks that our expectation is towards the higher end of that 3% to 5%. But there's enough uncertainty out there that we thought the 3% to 5% range is probably a more constructive place for us to be than to try and move it by only 0.5 point. It gives us a little bit more room to see what happens with GDP growth. Transient business is the hardest to predict because it does not really have much of a long lead time, particularly with business travelers. There you're really talking about days or maybe a week or two. Leisure tends to be a little bit longer than that. But what we see is, again, reasonably encouraging. The sky is not falling when we look at our data. That is profoundly the case when you look at group business, but it is also very much the case when you look at transient business. We mentioned the 2.5% transient demand in January. We look at U.S. system-wide RevPAR numbers, and they were up a hair over 3% in the month of January. And we think that probably had nearly a point impact because of the blizzard on the East Coast. And so all things considered, that's not bad and we'd expect February to be better. That's a longer answer than you asked for. But generally, we would expect transient to be a bit lower than group but still in meaningful mid-single-digit range. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No, that's great color. I appreciate that. And then at the high end, you said now twice that you think the high end is achievable. At the high end, are you assuming that 2.5% GDP growth, or are you assuming something higher? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : No, it's probably in the 2.5% range, 2.2% to 2.5%, something like that. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Agreed. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Hey, Shaun. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And, Leeny, welcome on board. So I just wanted to maybe ask a little bit more about some of the feedback that you received, Arne. Really since the last time we were able to ask you in this format, you've obviously been able to collect some of the feedback on the deal from the owner community, which is probably the most important constituency out there. So I'm just curious on the thoughts around how they're reacting to the combination and any impact you think that could have on your ability to sign deals between now and the time the integration plans are a little bit more clear. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : The owners and franchisees love it. They absolutely love it. They understand the strategy behind it. They understand the power that can be driven by the system. Obviously, each of them will ultimately look at it from a very selfish perspective, which is okay, what about my hotel in this market and what is the impact there? And we're still early. They're still early in trying to understand that piece of it. But I think most of them, and certainly those that are largest in size and most institutional in flavor see this as something that should drive good economics, not just for Marriott and Starwood shareholders, but great economics for them as well. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And if there \u2013 sorry. Go ahead. I was just going to say if there was one callout or sticking point that they're excited about, when we spoke with some of those probably bigger institutional owners, they mentioned leverage on distribution costs as being one key thing. But is there anything that comes up time and again in your conversations with them? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Again, they're going be looking for the things that they always look for, which is top line synergies and margin improvement, and there are opportunities in both of those places. So when you think about revenue synergies, and they're the hardest things for us to put a number out there. We don't have one for you now. Hopefully, when we get to a point of digesting the acquisition and sharing in more detail with all of you our plans, we can be a little bit more specific about it. But the basic notion is how do you take these two leading loyalty programs in the industry, Marriott Rewards and SPG [Starwood Preferred Guest], and create something which is even more powerful, and by doing that, take greater share of the business for the members of those two programs and drive top line revenue for the hotels that are in the system. I think when you get to the cost side, we'll find hopefully that we are less reliant on the most expensive sources of third-party business over time. I think we'll find that there are opportunities in procurement. I think we'll find that there are efficiencies in systems costs that can be driven in as a result of going to one system instead of having two. And I think we'll find lots of opportunities to really, again, both drive the top line and the bottom line. So we feel really good about this. I think the only thing we hear in response to the deal that is a community that says please reassure us is Rewards and SPG members want to make sure that their points are protected and that they don't have anything to fear. And we've been assuring both of those communities that the principal reason for our doing this deal is actually to redouble our commitment to them and make them feel even better about their loyalty to us so that they need not be worried. But I think so far it's going great. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Hi, Joe. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Good morning, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And, Leeny, welcome to the front as well. Two quick questions for you all. I think one of the themes we will hear this earnings season and certainly you guys are touching on it is the solid group production we saw in the fourth quarter. Are you seeing any trend change in the level of group production? I know it's early here in the 1Q to date. And then, I have a follow-up. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : No, we're not. The only thing we've seen and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks is we are seeing a bit of a lengthening of the group booking window. So we talked about how in the fourth quarter we had an increase in group bookings for all future periods of about 10%. Actually, when you look at that by year, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the weakest booking year-over-year would be 2016. That is not a function of a slowdown in demand. That is a function of the fact that bookings are already up 7%, and there's not that much space left. And I think that's something we're likely to see continue here as long as the trends continue in the way that is implicit in our guidance. Otherwise, there is no \u2013 nothing that gives us cause for concern. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And at this point, how much of your anticipated group bookings are on the book for this year? And how does that compare to historical trend? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Oh, let's see. Have you guys got that number? It's about two thirds. Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : A little bit better. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Actually, a little bit higher. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : That's on the books. Let's see. 77% is what they've got here compared to 74% a year ago. So about three points higher. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then my follow-up question, if \u2013 remarkably the development pipeline keeps growing, which is a good thing. Are you seeing anything here in the 1Q where we should be bracing for a more moderate performance or a moderate level of growth in the development pipeline? And that's all for me. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : I think that's going be a really interesting question, and Leeny jump in here with your perspective. But I think the weakness in the financial markets, which does impact confidence particularly among financial players is making debt financing, I think, more difficult today than it was a few months ago. And as a consequence, I suspect that some of these deals which have recently been signed will be harder to get financed than deals that were signed maybe a year ago. And so if there's a risk here in the near term, it is that some of these deals either will get delayed to some extent, or some may even be killed if debt financing cannot be made available. It's going to vary a little bit by type of owner, partner or franchisee partner. I think those that are \u2013 tend to be more in the center part of the country, more conservatively financed, more regional banks probably will continue to be less impacted by this sort of increased anxiety. I think those that are less institutional, more classically project financed as opposed to balance sheet financed, I think there is a greater risk that some of those projects may be delayed. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Hi, Ryan. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: I just wanted to ask a question and I don't know how much color you can give versus can't give. But just wondering how Starwood's guidance this morning lined up to your expectations as you guys were underwriting the deal? Obviously, their 2016 guidance came out a lot lower than consensus expectations. I know your guys' driver of the deal wasn't 2016 numbers, but just wondering if you guys envisioned something similar to that, or any color on concerns surrounding how their business is operating relative to that disappointing \u2013 those disappointing expectations that were put out this morning. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : We saw their results when you saw their results. So, we will \u2013 probably as soon as this call is over, actually maybe while this call is going on, we are looking at exactly some of those questions. We've had a chance basically to do a quick \u2013 I've had a chance to do a quick read through of their release. Don't have any real insight to it. Not surprisingly, the weak foreign currencies have a more profound impact on their business, given their international mix than we do. And that is a piece of things. That piece is not surprising, obviously. We see proportionately the same sort of FX impact to our business going forward. But we'll have to digest those things. And again, this is not a deal that is based on one quarter's numbers or necessarily even one year's numbers. But a deal that we think is very attractive both financially in the long-term and strategically. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Arne. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Good morning. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just in terms of the deal that you signed with the Fairfield brand in China, in the past when we have discussed similar select service deals in China, I think the issue has been the per-unit profitability and the infrastructure that you have to build to drive that. So, I guess what has changed to drive this deal? Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : So first, the most important part is to look at the partner in this particular situation, and that is we're working with one of the largest hotel operators in China on this particular deal. So from a standpoint of having a knowledge based infrastructure capital experience with these kind of projects, frankly, we couldn't ask for a better situation. They know the markets. And I think from that standpoint, it will allow us to leverage a large number of hotels quickly and get them into our fee stream by working with somebody like that. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : We looked at a couple of alternatives in this broad area in China over the last few years. And the concerns that you raise were the kinds of concerns that we had. We feel obviously better about this deal than other ones we've looked at and decided not to pursue, in part, because of the strength of Eastern Crown as a franchise operator and in part because of the structure of the deal. But I think increasingly like some of our competitors we want to make sure that we are playing in all of the segments which are relevant to the growing China middle class and not purely being in the luxury space which is really where we've been so far. And this is a way for us to get there. We'll continue to expand the Rewards program and I think expand the familiarity and breadth of our brands to Chinese travelers. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. For the 2016 guidance you guys mentioned that you're guiding owned EBITDA to increase 20%. Can you just help us think about how much of that growth is recurring versus one-time, thinking specifically about the branding fees on The Ritz-Carlton Residences? Is that something that you are expecting to continue in 2017 and 2018? Or \u2013 yeah, any color would be helpful. Thank you. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Sure. No, that's great. No, I appreciate the question. First of all, I would say the three areas that we mentioned, roughly fairly even. So when you look at where the growth is coming from, whether it's the owned, leased hotels or these branding fees or the credit card, it is \u2013 the growth is split fairly evenly between those three. And frankly, they're all pretty sustainable. These, on the hotel side, we're looking at several hotels coming off of renovations which is great and they've got some nice growth in those numbers. On the residential sides, we definitely are now seeing kind of the \u2013 that business has really picked up from 2013 through 2015 as you saw the residential market rebound. And so as we look out into the future, we've got a number of other projects coming onboard in 2017 and 2018. So I would look for that to continue not necessarily to grow at quite the same growth rate that it's growing in 2016 but certainly in terms of continuing forward to look as strong as it's looking in 2016. And then the credit card business, obviously, this is all ultimately to some extent tied to GDP and how consumers are behaving but assuming we continue to have an economy that marches forward, we look for new cardholders and increase spend to add those credit card fees. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb of Baird. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Leeny, welcome back to the public world. Great to have you back and you obviously have big shoes to fill for Carl but you have our confidence. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Well, thanks. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. I don't know how much you want to say on this, but can you just talk about whether you have any influence on the pace of asset sales at Starwood or what you're thinking about going forward about the pace of asset sales once they are your assets? And how do you think the market has changed over the last, call it, 90 days? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Well, first of all, I will say we are \u2013 you're right in the kind of first supposition. We're totally separate companies and we actually are still competitors for the time being. So any sort of direct influence on these asset sales is nonexistent. But certainly in terms of our asset light model, it won't surprise you that we would like to recycle the capital as fast as practicable and turn those into good solid management agreement and be able to recycle the capital for our shareholders and look forward to doing so. I think you've heard that we expect once the transaction gets going \u2013 once the integration occurs that we're looking at $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of cash coming from the asset sales, we would continue to look forward to seeing that. In terms of the market out there, as you know, it's very asset specific, very asset dependent. We are not involved in the details on each asset sales. So I can't really comment particularly about how we would see those. But at the same time for high quality assets like the ones that Starwood has, we would look forward to them continuing to see a robust buyers' market forum. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So just to follow up, is it fair to say that your view is that none of Starwood-owned assets need to be Marriott-owned assets longer term? Nothing is sacred here. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : I would say longer term being the operative word, we're not going to say whether it's six months or 18 months that we would expect to have recycled them. But yes, fundamentally, philosophically yes, I would agree with that. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great, thank you very much for the candor. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, your Asia-Pacific RevPAR growth was pretty healthy, up 4.7%. Could you just talk about China in particular? And then, separately, I am just trying to understand and I understand if you can't discuss this part, but just the relationship with VAC and Starwood's relationship with Interval International. Are there risks to licensing fees for Marriott and how have you started to think about how you're going to feed customers to the two separate timeshare companies? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Let me start with the Asia piece, particularly China. Obviously, we've been bombarded with news about the Chinese economy over the last couple of quarters. Most of it not very positive in what we read in the papers here. And obviously a big chunk of that is related to their manufacturing and export business. To some extent, it's related to their infrastructure spending, and to some extent to their financial markets and financial institutions. I think underneath all of that you've got China continuing to move towards a consumer economy. You've got a growing middle class that has resources to expend on things other than bare necessities. And as a consequence, I think we see in our industry and certainly at Marriott, stronger performance in China than you might expect from reading that newspaper. Obviously, it is a very big market. And so the performance in different cities will vary from place to place. We had some of the numbers in our prepared remarks. Shanghai continues to be a very strong market all the way through 2015. Hong Kong, by contrast, has been a market which has been under pressure, in part because of the political implications of some of the street protests and other decisions that are made that derive from that. But then you look at other markets like Japan. China visitation to Japan was up something like 25% or 30% last year, if memory serves. And it is driving great performance in our Japanese hotels. And you see that sort of growth in outbound China business continuing to perform really well. And what we see so far in 2016 continues to make us quite positive about China. Now to be sure, the China New Year has shifted from January to February. So we'll have to get through February and see exactly how the dust settles. But we're feeling pretty good about China and we're feeling pretty good about Asia. When it comes to MVW and ILG and their interest in the loyalty programs, this is a \u2013 it's going to be a really fun set of issues to work through. And obviously, we've already talked about the strategic importance of using these loyalty programs to both grow our loyal customer base and to intensify our relationships with them. And we think SPG and Marriott Rewards give us a perfect opportunity to do that. At the same time, we have in MVW and ILG companies, which are keenly interested in making sure that they can continue to market Marriott timeshare to the Marriott Rewards folks and Starwood timeshare to the SPG folks. Similarly, we have credit card partners in those two programs, AmEx with SPG and JPMorgan Chase Visa with Marriott Rewards. And we'll work through those things with both. We don't fear either of those issues, though, and think actually that we will find a way to create great value for us and our customers as well as for those partners. Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I'm looking at the $30 million of increased ForEx headwind this year. I'm looking at the dollar index. It's roughly flat this year \u2013 or year over year. So what's driving that? Did you have any currency hedges on? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Right. So... Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Are you talking about 2015 fourth quarter or 2016 numbers? Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah, 2016, the $30 million total ForEx headwind. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Right. So that actually includes the benefit of the hedges in that number. And generally, the thing I would caution you to remember is we have basically 25% of our fees come from outside the U.S., and then only a third of those do we hedge. So for example, whether it's the yuan or the South African rand or things like that which we don't currently hedge, so you're looking at two-thirds of our international fees coming from unhedged currencies. So that's where you're seeing some of the numbers in 2016 relative to 2015. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then can you do anything for some of these loosely hedged \u2013 or, I guess, loosely pegged currencies, anything on the \u2013 yeah, I guess any way you can hedge that with debt? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : In terms of \u2013 no, in terms of the debt that Marriott takes on, no. I think we're always looking at new ideas on the hedging side and hedging the fees. But to be quite honest, in many cases the costs of those hedge are so prohibitive that it's really better off to stick with the risk. Now I will also say that we do \u2013 we are hopeful that the dollar doesn't strengthen at the same kind of rate that it did in 2015 in 2016, and I think our forecast does take into consideration that we're not expecting quite the same level. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then looking at that 3% to 5% RevPAR growth for the year, how much of that comes from occupancy gain? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Not much, I would say it's probably in the ballpark of 75% to 80% rate and the rest occ. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, all. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Hey, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Arne, let me follow up. I think it was Joe's question on construction financing. You did indicate that it looked like there might be a slowdown there. Do you expect Marriott to get more aggressive in providing mezz or other financing alternatives for would-be developers? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : No. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, easy question. Easy. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Is that clear enough? Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's clear. I appreciate that. One question on geographic footprint, if you go back a year and look at where Canada was and then you fast-forward through Delta and then with Starwood, I'm just curious. How big a contribution do you get out of Canada now? And the same question on China on a pro forma basis with the Starwood deal. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : China will be much bigger than Canada for us, even with the Delta acquisition earlier last year. I don't know that I can pull those numbers off the top of my head. I think China will \u2013 when we close the deal, will be something like 250 open hotels between Marriott and Starwood, and gross fees that must be in the $150 million to $200 million range, I would think, something like that. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So you think maybe 15% of EBITDA or something coming from China, is that a... Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : $150 million to $200 million would be less than 15% of EBITDA. I think combined EBITDA must be in the $3 billion range. You can pull the numbers out from our respective statements and put something together on that. And Canada, I can't \u2013 I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head, but I would think that they are half-ish or maybe even less than that of China. And China, it won't surprise you to know is obviously growing faster. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So no concerns, though, that you've bulked up in two markets that are maybe from a macro perspective facing some challenges? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : No, not at all. And I actually don't \u2013 in a very short-term perspective, you might have some of those questions. I think when you look at the long term, particularly China, we are extraordinarily enthusiastic about the future potential of that market, both for travel in that market and the importance of outbound China travel, and both depend on our having strong distribution and brand familiarity in China. I think the issues in Canada are \u2013 only time will tell. But if you're referring to the energy market and the impact that that has on the Canadian economy, I think our bet would be that that is more transitory than permanent, albeit we do have a long-term perspective. So while we're not making a forecast on oil prices at the end of 2016, we would expect that the Canadian economy, which has a lot going for it in terms of a workforce and global integration, will be a market that continues to grow for the foreseeable future. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great, thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Good morning. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : So I've got two questions here. The first one is on the U.S. portion of the RevPAR guidance for 2016. I'm just wondering. Is that a top-down forecast based on U.S. GDP, or is it more bottoms up based on the various markets around the U.S.? And if it is based on the bottoms-up market analysis, could you give us a little more color on what you anticipate for some of your major U.S. markets? And then one follow-up after that. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : It's more bottoms-up. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Bottoms-up. Bottoms-up. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : It's more bottoms-up than top down. You can tell from the comments we made earlier about the difference between a 0.5 point decline in our bottoms-up approach and a roughly one-point decline in the guidance that we're giving you this morning. So there is a bit of a flavor that comes from the judgment that we've applied to it. But our planning process does not really fundamentally start with the GDP forecast. It starts with \u2013 when we get to this point of the year particularly, it starts with budgets at the hotels. And they're looking at some supply trends, but essentially much more demand trends in their market. And if you look across, have you guys got 2016? We would expect that New York is going to continue to be a fairly challenged market with barely positive RevPAR growth I think is what we've got in the model, maybe in the 1% range, something like that. Laura E. Paugh - Senior Vice President- Investor Relations : Group pace was up about 2% in New York. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Group pace is better. And so that may help us get to that number. But I think that's going to continue to be a market we slog through. I think the oil patch will continue to be difficult markets that we slog through. But I think the bulk of the markets we think should perform more or less within the range of what we've talked about. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay, that is helpful. And then secondly on \u2013 just on the capital returns forecast of $2 billion, as per the release, it does look like capital spending or rather investment spending is coming down by two \u2013 $250 million from what occurred in 2015. And so I am just wondering what the delta might be, given that capital returns are also down by maybe $200 million as well. Is it loan repayments, is it asset sales? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Right. So great question. So you answered part of the question yourself in terms of the reason why expenditures are down, and that is Delta. From the standpoint of when we were talking to you a year ago, we knew that we were going to be spending $130 million odd on Delta. We also knew that we had some more CapEx to finish putting into our EDITION hotels. So that really makes up the bulk of the difference in terms of the CapEx spending. But then when you look at the amount of recycling that we did do in 2015 and what that led to in terms of share repurchases, the real difference when you look into 2016 is, number one, we're starting off a bit under-levered. So if you think of something like a point, 0.1 times on our leverage ratio gives you share repurchase capability of close to $200 million. And if we started off at 2.8 times, and our typical number is three times, right off the bat you've got $400 million of additional share repurchase capacity without really doing anything. Then you've got a little bit \u2013 as you spoke of, a little bit less in CapEx. And then, frankly, we are able to lever up a little bit with our growing EBITDAR and you put those together, and that gets us to our $2 billion, or over $2 billion. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Leeny. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz of Telsey Advisory Group. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi. Good morning, all. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Hi, David. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Hey, good morning. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Thank you. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : You're welcome, so two questions. One is when \u2013 Arne, you mentioned earlier that you expect the acquisition of Starwood to be accretive by the end of the second full year, I believe, was what the statement was. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : In the second full year. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : In the second full year. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Right. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : I assume that excludes the impact or the benefit of any share repurchases that may occur as a consequence of the deal, correct? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : I'm not sure it goes quite so far as to exclude any. I mean what our base model assumes is that over the course of the first couple years or so, we will get the combined larger company back to sort of the three times debt-to-EBITDA target that we've talked about for years. There are some things we still don't really know in detail. Actually, a lot of things we don't know in detail but part of this is making sure that we assess how many dollars are trapped offshore and work through the planning process to see whether they can be brought back to the U.S. and used. And we don't know how long that's going to take really. Starwood has work that is underway there and we have some sense for what the options are there. But we've got a lot more work to do. And so it's a longwinded way of saying we do have some assumptions about share repurchase over the first few years in the model as with all of our share repurchase assumption that tends to have stock prices when we buy back stock at sort of normal multiples and growing stock prices whether you look at the Marriott standalone model or the combined multiple. And so they are not as profound in driving EPS accretion as you might think. If you sat here and said okay, well, what if you buy back all the stock at today's stock price, for example. But we'll work through that. I think there is \u2013 just to state the obvious, the more we can convert the acquisition of Starwood to a cash deal by buying back stock sooner particularly at the kind of values that the market is attributing to the companies today, the more we like that deal. And it becomes something which is a no-brainer attractive transaction for us. And so where we end up exactly in this, we'll have to see both what happens with stock price and what happens with the cash management issues that we need to get through. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : So thank you for that. And if I back up one step farther and leading to what the cash is that is available for share repurchases, I start to think about the owned properties that you will be acquiring. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Correct. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : And while we can perhaps make some assumptions around what those properties earn and what would be a fair multiple, and we can \u2013 I think we have talked about on the call the questions around who the buyers are and their ability to pay, one of the unknowables for us is what the tax basis is on those properties today. My question is, what happens to that tax basis by virtue of the acquisition as we go through it? Because ultimately that helps us estimate what the gross proceed \u2013 what the net proceeds will be on an after-tax basis? Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Just a couple of thoughts there. The $1.5 billion to $2 billion that Leeny referenced before is net of our estimate of what the taxes would be. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Right. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : And it is not \u2013 it's not enormously punitive to the transaction. It's in the, if I remember right, 10% to 15% range of gross proceeds, something like that. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : Right. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : There generally, though, is not an impact on tax basis from the transaction since we're acquiring the stock of the parent company. And whether those assumptions turn out to be exactly right, we'll have to see as we get further into it. You're right, though, to talk about asset sales because that will be one of the things that has a significant impact to both the amount and pace of share repurchases. I think it's \u2013 without getting into the details, it is crystal clear that from an earnings perspective, these hotels can be sold in every instance at a dramatically higher multiples than what the earnings contribution are from them. When you look at EBITDA multiples, it becomes a little bit closer but even there it's a great portfolio of assets that we would think in virtually all instances. And again take this all with a little bit of grain of salt since there's still a lot we don't know. But in virtually all instances, we would think that the prices available would be at higher EBITDA multiples than the companies who are trading at which just gives us that much more conviction that we ought to continue with the strategy we've had for a number of years which is to be focused on management and franchising and not on owning real estate. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Perfect. Thanks very much. Good luck. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : You bet. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon of Berenberg. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Good afternoon. I was just curious on the net additions you are looking at this year. I think you're looking at net additions of 7%. I think you were just a touch lower of where you are hoping to do in 2015. Is this partly a fall-over from some openings delayed for 2015 to 2016 or should we be thinking that you can hit that level of run rate from the pipeline you have got now going forward? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP : So a couple things. Mostly, I would say, it is not that it is delayed deals moving. There probably are a handful that could fall into 2016 that we had hoped would be in 2015. But overwhelmingly, it is the steady progression of our pipeline turning into real hotels. There is about half of it, just when you think about it. We expect about half of them to be limited service North American hotels. And when you saw the signings that we did of over 100,000 in 2015, it should give you good confidence about that number. So I think in general feel pretty good about it. And again, at the margin, a little bit higher percentage of overall relative to openings in 2015 we would expect to be from limited service in North America, which again, they seem to be going along like clockwork. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay, thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director : Okay, thank you all very much for your time this morning. We appreciate your interest in Marriott, and look forward to welcoming you in our hotels all around the world. Have a good one. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Marriott International's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Operator : Welcome to Marriott International First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only-mode and the floor will be open for your questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Arne Sorenson : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining e today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director Investor Relations.  First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Security's Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today April 28, 2016 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. So let's talk about the first quarter. In North America comparable system wide REVPAR rose 2.4% in a quarter. In January North America system wide REVPAR rose 3.1% despite the severe East Coast snow storm. In February REVPAR rose 3.4%. In March REVPAR increased only 1% as group meeting planners avoided the week before and the week after Easter. All in all we estimate the shifting Easter holiday period reduced our system wide REVPAR growth by about 1% as coined for the quarter.  A natural first question would be why with 2.4% North America system wide REVPAR growth in Q1 do we think 3% to 5% growth is still the right range for the year. So our group business on the books gives us confidence in the remainder of the year including higher transit room rates that are likely to come with stronger group compression in the second and third quarters. In fact April REVPAR through the 23rd is up 5.2%. Group booking pays for our full service hotels in North America is up 7% for the rest of the year.  First Quarter REVPAR growth was strongest in Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the California Desert, while REVPAR in Chicago and Philadelphia declined due to unfavorable city wide calendars. System wide REVPAR at unlimited service hotel rose 2% in the quarter constrained by a combination of weak demand from the oil and gas industries and new upscale supply. REVPAR at Ritz-Carlton increased more than 6% as recently completed renovations pushed both occupancy and room rates higher and the early Easter increased leisure business. Particularly in Lake Tahoe and Bachelor Gulch where the snow was deep and the skiing was great.  SER expects overall U.S. supply growth of 1.7% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017. Interestingly in the last six months financing for new hotel construction in the U.S. has become more conservative. We understand that leverage levels on a new construction loan has declined from 70% to 75% a year ago to 60% to 65% today. Loan pricing and recourse levels have increased. In certain markets construction costs are also higher, particularly labor. While we are not likely to see a material change in supply growth in the near term longer term we believe these conditions should discourage marginal new projects from going forward and could delay others. While new industry construction could moderate in the U.S. over time we believe our brand conversions will likely accelerate. Our autograph brand raised 100 hotels worldwide in just six years largely due to conversions. With 19 brands today and soon to be 30 brands we now have even more opportunities for meaningful unit growth through conversions. Elsewhere in the world in the Caribbean and Latin America the good news was Mexico where REVPAR rose nearly 30% in the first quarter. This expanding economy offers great opportunities from limited service development along with very strong REVPAR growth. Our warm weather resorts benefited from the shift in Easter in the first quarter but concerns about the zika virus triggered group cancellations in some markets in the region.  In Europe the economy grew modestly in the first quarter and system wide REVPAR rose nearly 3%. The tragic events in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul depressed occupancy rates in those markets with some spill over concern impacting REVPAR results in London as well.  Elsewhere in the UK REVPAR remained very strong. In Spain the economy is rapidly recovering and our hotels benefited from strong demand from UK and U.S. travelers. Instability in the Middle East and North Africa further enhanced Spain's appeal as a vacation destination. Demand for our German hotels remain strong in the quarter with favorable fair business in Cologne and Berlin. In the Middle East geopolitical unrest and low oil prices depressed oil results in much of the region while UAE occupancies remained over 80% room rates were lower with new supply on the market. For Egypt there were fewer flights to the Red Sea Resorts while in Sadia Arabia hotel demand was constrained by lower government spending. Looking ahead Ramadan will start in early June this year, about two weeks earlier than last year which should hurt second quarter REVPAR comparisons in the Middle East. In Africa our Protea Hotels performed very well helped by strong local business and international tourism attracted by the weak South African Rand. Protea system wide constant dollar REVPAR rose nearly 15% in the first quarter and we expect that it will increase at a high single digit rate for the full year.  Our Asia Pacific region performed better than expected in the first quarter while economic growth in China has moderated. Consumer spending on travel remains strong. Shanghai and Beijing had very strong results in the quarter with REVPAR up in the high single digits. Nearly 60% of mainland China hotel demand comes from mainland Chinese travelers and their numbers are growing.  In the first quarter the number of domestic Chinese travelers visiting our hotels in that market increased 7% while the number of mainland Chinese travelers visiting our hotels abroad increased 25%. Thailand and Japan were particular beneficiaries. Hong Kong continued to see weak mainland China demand due to its strong currency pegged to the U.S. dollar. In India the economy is strengthening and first quarter REVPAR was at 14%. We see significant development opportunities outside North America, particularly from limited service hotels.  Today our international limited service development pipeline totals nearly 250 hotels with more than 47,000 rooms, a 30% increase in the last year. In Europe after adding manpower to our development effort in recent years we already have 70 limited service hotels in our development pipeline including more than 40 Moxy and AC hotels. In India \u00bd of our existing properties and 60% of our pipeline hotels are in the limited service brands. In China we recently signed a deal with eastern crown to launch Fairfield by Marriott. While none are yet in the pipeline we expect to have 140 Fairfield's signed in five years and 100 hotels opened by 2021. In Mexico we already have 20 limited service hotels open and another 16 in the development pipeline. Finally in the Middle East our limited service hotels, Court Yard, Fairfield, Residence Inn and Protea represent 40% of our pipeline in that region. Our unit growth is strong around the world excluding Starwood we expect our worldwide room distribution to grow by 8% growth or 7% net in 2016. Based on SER industry pipeline data one in four hotels under construction in the U.S. will fly one of our flags and worldwide one in seven hotels under construction will be flagged with a Marriott brand. We are already the biggest hotel company in the world when measured by total rooms opened. We signed over 100,000 rooms in both 2014 and 2015. Those signings give us great confidence in our openings in the years ahead. With our Starwood acquisition we will become a more global company, able to better leverage global trends and seize opportunities. Following the acquisition we estimate more than one-third of our rooms and fees will come from outside the U.S. We've talked a lot about the synergies in this transaction and the economies of scale that are inherent in this business from GNA to reservations to the frequent traveler program to the back of the house. We expect a recognized meaningful top line and bottom line improvements over time and unit growth should benefit as well. With a broader brand portfolio we will be able to offer the right brand for each asset and market. This means we can play in more sand boxes than many of our competitors winning the highest value opportunities.  We still expect the Starwood transaction will close midyear 2016. We are awaiting regulatory approvals from the EU, China, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. In the meantime we continue to do the blocking and tackling to driver results and improve our business. In March we introduced Marriott board member rates designed to reward loyalty members who book direct. The list of member only perks continues to grow. Loyalty points, mobile check in and check out, free Wi-Fi and now lower rates. Today 65% of transit room nights comes from rewards members. This month we announce enhancement to the rewards part of Marriott rewards offering a wide array of curated special events and opportunities. In addition an initial group of elite members will be invited to participate in a new elite concierge service. By developing a relationship with a member the concierges will be able to anticipate their unique needs, ensuring the member's preferences are recognized and their desires are met before, during and after their stay. And for golden platinum elites guaranteed late checkouts should make traveling both more pleasurable and more productive.  Marriott's competitive advantages are numerous. Strong brands, wide spread distribution, powerful sales channels, loyalty program and reservation systems, back at the house efficiencies, owner and franchisee preference and most important culture focused on our people. We also know that success is never final so we are working to be even better. Now let me turn things over to Leeny from more about the quarter. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.87. Four cents ahead of the miss point of our guidance of $0.81 to $0.85. Fee revenue was in line with our expectations. Results on our owned, leased and other lines contributed about $0.05 without performance including $0.03 from branding fees from residential real estate and our Marriott Rewards credit card and the balance largely coming from performance of our owned and leased hotels. Adjusted, general and administrative costs were better than expected by about a penny mainly due to open associate positions. Interest in taxes were about $0.02 unfavorable largely due to some discrete tax items in the quarter. All in all it was a solid quarter. Total fee revenue increased 5%. As you know 2016 is a leap year. The extra day in the quarter did not impact our REVPAR statistics but we estimated added about 1% to our property level, revenue and fee growth in the quarter. Base fees rose 4% reflecting REVPAR and unit growth offset by more than $4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange.  Incentive fees increased 13% reflecting roughly $3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a $2 million favorable recognition of a differed incentive fee. Worldwide 63% of managed hotels earned an incentive fee in the quarter compared to 48% in the year ago quarter. In North America incentive fees rose 23% with incentive fees for our limited service brands up 40% alone. Franchise fees were flat year over year. Strong unit growth and REVPAR improvement were offset by $15 million of lower relicensing fees and $2 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Owns, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $81 million in the quarter, 29% higher than the prior year largely driven by higher branding fees associated with sales of Ritz-Carlton residences and our cobranded credit cards. Our leased hotels in Tokyo and Jaragua showed much better results as they came out of renovations but those results were offset by foregone owned profit from our Ritz-Carlton Saint Thomas Hotel which became a company managed property late last year. Adjusted, general and administrative expenses increased by $10 million largely reflecting routine cost increases. This quarter we benefited from $10 million lower reserves for guaranteed funding while the 2015 quarter benefitted from $12 million associated with favorable litigation resolutions. We repurchased nearly 4 million shares during the quarter for approximately $225 million. We expect to complete the Starwood acquisition midyear and expect to resume share repurchases in late 2016 once our leverage ratios return to targeted levels. For our second quarter our guidance assumed the Starwood transaction will close sometime after June 30. For Marriott's legacy business we expect second quarter North American system wide REVPAR will increase 3% to 5% reflecting strong group business already on the books. We expect international system wide REVPAR will increase 2% to 4% reflecting strong Asia Pacific trends offset by weak REVPAR in the Middle East. We expect Marriott's fee revenue will increase 6% to 8% in the second quarter.  We expect our owned, leased and other results in the second quarter will increase roughly 25% with continued strong branding fees, lower preopening expenses and higher profits from our owned and leased hotels. We expect G&A will increase 2% to 5%. Adjusted net interest expense should total roughly $40 million. All in all we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA will total $495 million to $510 million, an increase of 8% to 12%.  Adjusted EPF should total $0.96 to a $1.00, an increase of 10% to 15% year over year. This forecast assumes no share repurchase during the quarter and does not include Starwood transition and transaction cost. Turning to the full year we expect worldwide REVPAR for Marriott's Legacy business will increase 3% to 5% combined with 7% net rooms growth we expect our 2016 fee revenue will total roughly $2 billion consistent with our forecast in February. Owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses should total $310 million to $315 million about $10 million ahead of our February forecast largely due to stronger residential branding fees.  We expect our full year adjusted general and administrative expenses will total $645 million to $655 million about $5 million better than our last forecast largely due to the open associate position that we mentioned about Q1. For the Marriott Legacy business 2016 investment spending could total $450 million to $550 million including about $100 million in maintenance spending. Excluding Starwood we expect to recycle roughly $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments through 2016. Making an EPS projection for the full year of 2016 is difficult given the uncertain timing of the Starwood transaction. To assist you modelers however for full year 2016 we expect Marriott standalone adjusted EBITDA will total $1.9 billion to $1.965 billion, about $15 million better than our February forecast. Given that 2016 transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point we are not including these costs in our guidance but rather expect to break out such expenses as actual results are recognized as we did this quarter. When the transaction closes we estimate that we will issue roughly $136 million Marriott shares and increase total debt by roughly $3.5 billion representing an estimated $20 million in higher net interest cost per quarter.  Incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction will depend on purchase price accounting evaluations that have not yet been completed. In a recent 8K we estimated incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction at roughly $52 million per quarter. Like you we will rely on Starwood's forecast of their REVPAR growth, unit growth, asset sale assumptions and adjusted EBITDA for their business. We eagerly await their first quarter results in 2016 outlook.  Our results in 2016 are likely to be messy including Starwood by the end of this year we expect to be back to our targeted leverage range and have resumed share repurchases. We expect most of the corporate level, cost energy associated with the transaction to be in place by the beginning of 2017. We are committed to completing asset sales promptly. Including Starwood we could see continued strong unit growth in 2017 even with our larger size. Also we continue to believe the transaction will be earnings per share neutral in 2017 before including the benefits of possible revenue synergy. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We will take questions now. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix. Felicia Hendrix : Hi, good morning, thank you. My first question which the first question is a two-parter. So Arne I think what's on a lot of people's mind is the kind of Easter shift. So you talked about April being up 5.2%. I'm just wondering how much of that comes from Easter and then also as we know April you know Hilton said yesterday that they expect May to be weaker and then June to pick up, are you seeing the same thing? Arne Sorenson : Well yeah those are sort of detailed questions. I'm going to also sort of give you a general answer to the question that you haven't asked but I think is the top of the mind for everybody. As we said in the prepared remarks we think the negative REVPAR impact was about 1 point in Q1 to the shift of Easter. The impact of Q2 could be about the same. Obviously the impact of one month of April would be larger and it could be nearly 2%. Important to keep in mind though that last week April still has Passover in it and so we'll look at the impact when the dust ultimately settles and give you more precise calculations but it would be something close to 2% we would think for April. When we look at our group bookings which of course are the clearest long term data that we have we see April and June relatively better than May but we see good group for Q2 as a whole we see good group for Q3 as a whole. Q4 okay but not quite as good as Q2 and Q3 and as we said in the prepared remarks we've got about 7% increase group revenue on the books for Q2 through Q4 compared to the same time last year. The biggest question at the moment obviously is not so much about group but is about the [ph] trends and demand. So let's maybe start with basics. The transit demand correlates most closely with GDP growth. Statistics out this morning show that U.S. Q1 GDP growth was only 0.5%. Anemic even in the context of the fairly moderate U.S. economic recovery we've been witnessing the last few years. The question for all of us including for you is do we expect the U.S. economy to perform at higher growth rates in the quarters ahead. We do. It seems reasonably clear that sentiment was profoundly negative early in this year in that it has improved significantly since January. That plus other statistics around employment, growth and other things which suggest that the economy is poised to perform at better than that 0.5% number in Q1. Based on our information as opposed to GDP information the U.S. market seems to us to be characterized by a number of short stories if you will. Let me give you a few examples. Houston weak because of the weakness in the oil patch. New York weak primarily because of supply growth but also maybe a bit because of the strength that the U.S. dollar and its impact on international rivals. Miami weak probably mostly because of the weakness in Brazil one of the great source markets for Miami and to some extent maybe growth in luxury supply. San Francisco very strong reflection of the strong health of the U.S. digital economy. Of course LA also quite strong. Now our biggest customers also tell us things that are quite different. Many of them tell us that their book of business is solid and reflects continued health in their business and from their purge of strength in the U.S. economy. Some wrestling with a flattish top lines seem to be turning with greater attention to managing costs including their travel budgets. Now when we roll all of these antidotes together you will have these markets. What we see is a collection of short stories but not a common theme let alone the same author. So our view as reflected in our continued 3% to 5% REVPAR growth guidance is that we expect the U.S. economy to continue to bump along with moderate GDP growth and therefore moderate occupancy growth which when combined with ADR growth should deliver 3% to 5% REVPAR growth for the year. Felicia Hendrix : And Arne just quickly and then I'll go follow up on that. Previously you said that you're expected to come in at the high end of that range. Is that still a view? Arne Sorenson : Well the 3% to 5% is still the range that we think is appropriate. This question that I just addressed is a question that we're talking about internally as well and of course we've got forecasts that get rolled up from our properties around the world. We also have maybe a slightly more conservative view here based on recent trends but generally all of those forecasts are above the midpoint of that 3% to 5% range and we would think as a consequent it's at least as likely we are at 5% as we are at 3%. This will though depend on what happens with transit demand in the quarters ahead. Felicia Hendrix : Okay, that's all very helpful. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. May be aware, there is an ultimate hurdle that sort of forces the timing which is at the end of two years. So basically at the end of 2017, they have to be 40% complete with their ability. So the easy math is to say that's 20% per year or 5% per quarter. I think we all know that to assume linearity it would be a little silly because these things get off to a little bit slower start, there is always more complexities in them etcetera. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Kelly. Sean Kelly : Good morning everyone. Leeny in your remarks towards the very end where you're giving some helpful pieces of the merger I think you mentioned that corporate level synergies were expected to be in place by 2017. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. Is the corporate level component, how much of that or I mean directionally at least is the $250 million that you guys have outlined and how much do we think is going to take more time? Leeny Oberg : We expect and aim to put into place so that starting January 1 you would see as a run rate. You would see that for the year we would achieve those $250 million synergies. Now that's obviously going to be on an adjusted basis Sean because we will continue to have some transition costas on certain technological systems we've got to run parallel systems until we get them put together. So you know by that standpoint we would hope by the end of 2017 that we've got that largely done but I think on a good basic solid running the company run rate you should see that in place in 2017. Sean Kelly : That's helpful and then I guess as a follow up you know for the last quarter you have been talking and highlighting about being more on a residential branding fee side. Could you just talk a little bit more about why that comes through or is that recognized when residential units come online or is it recognized when you guys are signing contracts for stuff in the future. Leeny Oberg : Sure. Absolutely. You're right. It clearly not quite as predictable as all of us would like. Let me talk a little bit about the residential branding fees. As I'm sure you know these stem from projects and often they are connected to our hotels, but the stem from residential projects where our brand is a part of those projects and we earn a fee on the sale of those residences. We are not paid for those until they are not only sold but they are actually closed. So number one you've got something that opens so it's a little bit hard to predict exactly the pace of the sales and then the pace of the closings but we have a project. Waikiki is a great example of one in Hawaii that began selling late last year and it's just been selling like hotcakes and basically we expect it to sell out this year, 300 units and we had had it more spread across the year while it turns out it was largely done in Q1 because it was so popular. The good news is this is a business that has been although it is clearly cyclical related to the financing of real estate it has been growing very nicely for us particularly internationally. So when you look at this year's fees the average over the last call it five years has been about $15 million dollars a year. We do expect this year for that number to be closer to double that but when you look over the next few years Sean I think you're looking at a number of residential branding fees that probably is likely to be in the high 20s because we've got a great pipeline of projects that are moving along. Arne Sorenson : By the way these projects are all fee projects for us so we're not developing these like residential ourselves. Leeny Oberg : Right. Arne Sorenson : So one of the issues on the predictability is we're not running either the building or the sales of this process. We've got to wait until the unit is closed before we know for certain when we recognize those fees. Sean Kelly : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley. Robin Farley : Great thanks. It looks like your incentive management fees of the percentage property paying incentive paying as your fees jumped up quite significantly year over year. Is that a level that you expect to see on full year basis, that kind of increase? Leeny Oberg : Yes it is actually. It jumps up meaningfully largely because we had three managed portfolios of limited service hotels that IMS is calculated on a portfolio basis. So when they all come. You know when they hit that target they all jump in to be in an incentive fee territory so it's actually about 160 hotels that jumped in Q1 this year as compared to Q1 last year that jumps into incentive fee territory. Now I will say year over year the incentive fee last year for the full year we did end up in the 60s for IMS fee participation and we expect that to be similar this year, but in the Q1 last year in the first quarter those limited service hotels were not in incentive fee earning territory. Robin Farley : Okay. That's helpful. And one follow up if I could. You mentioned the cost savings to be fully in place kind of it sounded like the start of 2017 which I think is a little bit earlier or maybe you just sort of hadn't committed to a date where they would be fully in place but should we still think about; I think you had previously said the transaction was going to be neutral to earnings per share in 2017 and 2018 so that maybe it wouldn't be accretive or I don't know if that implies that it would be accretive in 2019 but does that time frame move up with the comments this morning about costings being in place? Arne Sorenson : Let me just provide the typical warning which should be obvious. I think everybody. We haven't closed the transaction yet so there's still a lot of details that we don't know. Leeny in fact mentioned in her prepared remarks that the depreciation and amortization for example will not get finalized until the transaction closes because given the amount of stock that we're using in the deal the amount that we pay really will not be defined until actual closing because it will be derived in significant extent from our own share price. Obviously the other aspects that start with operating business that until we close we won't understand with real detail. Generally though what we think though is that 250 million dollars' worth of synergy run rate which Leeny talked about for 2017 is included in our assumptions about a roughly neutral EPS impact from the transaction. It is probably the first time we've held it out there as being 1117 as opposed to a second year I think is the way that we talked about it before. And again we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that that happens because we can't guarantee it but we think that with that we will get a relatively neutral performance on EPS. I think the upside from that accretion in other words will be driven more by revenues synergies and margin synergies at the property level and how that drives unit growth and then of course what we do with the powerful and substantial cash that's going to be generated by this confined business in either investing or returning that capital to shareholders. Robin Farley : And then the same thought on the accretion in 2018 versus 2019 or timing. Paul Silverstein : Stay tuned. Leeny Oberg : Yeah. A little too soon. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Harry Curtis. Harry Curtis : Good morning. So Arne you mentioned that there are elements of economic improvement that you've seen. How is that being reflected or was that reflected in the pace of your bookings in April versus the first quarter? Arne Sorenson : Oh I actually don't have April group bookings if that's what you're talking about. I don't have April group bookings to date. I tend to get those at the end of the month, but we do have obviously the 5.2% REVPAR growth system wide in the U.S. stayed and paid for the month. Obviously a piece of that is the impact of Easter and you know I think what we would say is at the moment we see some positive signs compared to the last few months, but I wouldn't characterize our comments as sitting here and saying we've got a dramatic shift in transit this month compared to prior months. I think what we see is more steady than that. Again we look at the group data that we've got on the books and we look at sort of the current conditions and we still think this range is a solid one. I think it in fact does depend on GDP growth in the 2% range as opposed as those sort of 0.5% that it appears to be the case from Q1. Again our view is that that's what we're likely to see. Harry Curtis : Thank you and Leeny as a follow up to your comment about revenue synergies not yet spelled out in the transaction. Can you give us perhaps the top three or four buckets that you're hoping to get revenue synergies from? Leeny Oberg : Sure. First and foremost, you know as we move through it we're very excited about the growth opportunities that we see for the overall hotel portfolio from adding together Starwood into ours so I think from a unit growth perspective that first and foremost we see opportunities there. We also see some opportunities through a variety of our partnerships as we think about being a much larger company in ways that as we become stronger and bigger that we'll be able to capitalize on those and last but certainly not least is as we look at what we believe that we can do on the hotel margin side that we would benefit on our fees through being able to deliver better profits to our hotel owners. Harry Curtis : And on the partnership side is that really more revenue opportunity or more of a lower fee opportunity? Arne Sorenson : Lower across. You mean margin improvement? I think it's both. Leeny Oberg : Yeah I think it's definitely some on the top line as well. Harry Curtis : Got you. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Kent. Steven Kent : Hi. Good morning. A couple questions. One how is the new push for direct bookings been going? You and one of your competitors have been pushing it pretty hard. Do you think it's boosting your REVPAR growth at all, sort of what's been the reaction? I just wanted to ask an operating question before I ask a deal question which is could you just give us a sense as to how you'll handle the loyalty programs and the timeshare licensing programs whether you can give us an update on that? I tried to leave with the operating and then went to the deal question. Arne Sorenson : There you go. Thank you. The member only rates that we rolled out are very new in the market. We announced them about a month ago but they became effective a little bit after that. It's still quite early and we have not put as many dollars into marketing those rates yet. Obviously they are visible online and we're doing some things. I think the early response has been positive but it's too early to give you the kind of statistics that you've heard from some others who have been out there on market longer with us. We've obviously done it because we're optimistic about this approach driving an increase in direct bookings and driving that much more awareness of the advantages of direct booking.  With the sense of the loyalty programs this is going to be very much a work in progress. It is clear that we will be running the Marriott Rewards and SPG programs for some for some period of time. I would think that that's got to be more like two years than a year but part of that is systems driven. Part of that is making sure that we deal with our customers in a way that keeps them excited about these programs and has them participate with us in a way that they evolve. Of course as your question implies we've got a number of very powerful and strategic partners that are keenly interested in this program. Timeshare companies and credit card companies being of the most significant but they're not the only ones and we're going to want to make sure that we work with them in a way that is successful to them and respects their interest. We'll sort of keep you posted on this. Obviously we'd like to get to a place where we have a program which allows our growing group of loyal customers to have the benefits of the full portfolio of 5500 hotels plus another 2000 or so hotels which are in the combined pipeline whatever those precise numbers are and the ability to grow from there. So we'll be working to get as much functionality between those programs as we can and eventually hopefully a full merger but hopefully we'll see how that goes and we'll keep you posted on it. Steven Kent : Just from a direct booking side have you shared with your franchise user owners what the positive impact could be to their bottom line? Have you done that yet or is it still too early to even give them indications of how favorable that can be? Arne Sorenson : Well we have an ongoing conversation with our owners and franchisees with a number of advisory committees that are meeting with our leadership teams very, very regularly and we have been talking about doing this well before we launched it and in the context of that certainly have talked about the economic attributes of what we think is programmed to do. We haven't done that in a way that puts us in a position to give you a forecast for the impact but we'll keep you posted on how we think it goes as it develops over the months ahead. Steven Kent : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Greff. Joseph Greff : Good morning guys. Leeny Oberg : Hi Joe. Arne Sorenson : Hi Joe. Joseph Greff : Leeny with respect to your earlier comments about revenue synergies not being included in your 2017 proforma target for the Star reveal with respect to the timing of revenue synergies and this is also for you Arne, are they mostly intermediate or longer term in nature or could we start to see these emerge in 2017? Leeny Oberg : We could but again as Arne described before we're still several months away from closing. We've got a lot of work to do both looking at things related to the on property cost and comparing it to our system as well as how we look at all these partnerships. So it could but it's too soon to tell exactly when. Joseph Greff : And presumably you'll call out the transition cost each quarter? Leeny Oberg : We will be calling out the transition and the transaction cost each and every quarter. Joseph Greff : Great. My follow up is if we assume the midpoint of your guidance for the Q2 for the balance of the year would you expect group REVPAR to exceed transient REVPAR or how do you do that? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I mean one of the things obviously won't be lost on you but if you look at the release that we put out last night you can see a meaningful difference in the REVPAR for the manage portfolio of the United States and the franchise portfolio of the United States. Actually what we report externally is manage portfolio and then system wide and the manage portfolio is nearly a full point higher in REVPAR than the system wide numbers are. Joseph Greff : So in other words Arne you're not assuming a big corporate transient rebound in the back part of the year? Arne Sorenson : Again we would say steady maybe a bit better because of the weakness in the first quarter but this is not fundamentally based on a dramatically different environment than the one that we've seen over the last few quarters. I suspect the downside here is that if GDP is for the balance of the year more like the 0.5% in Q1 we're going to be towards the bottom end of this range or in theory it could be below that. I think that's unlikely given the strength of the group business in the books but obviously we can't know about transient business very far in advance. If we on the other hand see better quarters perform better which I would expect to be the case you know transient should perform a bit better than it did in Q1 and maybe Q4 but I wouldn't characterize it as a dramatically different environment. That's not what's built into our forecast. Joseph Greff : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker of Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker : I just wanted to talk a little bit about the group booking pace. You guys said early in your prepared remarks you were up for the remainder of the year; that is obviously a pretty strong number. You also had mentioned that one of the benefits of the group booking pace is an ability to have more transient pricing power. I guess the two questions I had was last quarter you had mentioned 2Q was a big acceleration in group base, I think plus 2% for 1Q versus plus 9% for 2Q. I am wondering if that is still the case. If you are still a plus 9% or if things have moderated a little bit for 2Q as we have gotten closer? And then the second thing is how are you guys thinking about the impact that your strong group booking pace will have on transient pricing power? Is there any way to try to quantify that? Arne Sorenson : Yes, a couple of things. I think our Q2 pace is probably down a little from that 9% but still in the high-single-digits 7%-ish. And Q3 would be in the mid-double-digits, so pretty healthy, be careful about assuming that that is an awful development. When we start a year with high group bookings it leaves a little bit less room for in the year for the year group bookings. And as a consequence we often see the full-year number sort of moderate as the year goes along and that is not a sign of weakness. The other thing that is really important to bear in mind here is that the group business has the most power to help with pricing of a hotel in high occupancy high demand months. So group business being up significantly in January which is a relatively quiet month or December which is a relatively quiet month, is going to be much less impactful in driving rates than in non-holiday impacted weeks and months like March, April, May, September, October, first half of November. And so, we think we have got, again, in a number of these times the group business should be more powerful in helping us drive rate in the transient space. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Just on the pipeline growth, you've been consistently growing your pipeline by about 10,000 rooms a quarter. The first quarter was slightly [indiscernible], just trying to understand if that was related to seasonality or some of the financing issues, Arne, you mentioned earlier. Or has there been any reluctance from developers to build your brands given the Starwood deal? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : The answer to the last part of the question is no. The pace seems to be steady for us. Remember one of the things, it is probably obvious to you, we tend to talk about our pipeline in round-ish numbers, 5,000 room increments usually as opposed to giving you the single number that we have in our pipeline, for the obvious reason that we can only be so accurate in our pipeline. I think one of the things that happens in Q1 is you end up because of some rounding probably with a growth that is more in the 5000 to 10,000 room range than exactly 5000 or below 5000. And so, that is what has driven it. We're seeing steady performance. You heard the prepared comments about debt markets being a little tougher in the early part of the year. I suspect as a consequence that particularly some of the more urban, more full scale, full service projects which are typically done with nonrecourse debt financing as opposed to a guaranteed borrower. Those debt markets are a little tougher today. And as a consequence I suspect we will see some projects pull back, but I don't think it is going to be significant for Marriott because of the strength of our brands. Thomas Allen : Okay and just my follow-up. Can you give us updated thinking by region on your 2016 RevPAR outlook? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Stronger in the West, weakest in the oil patch -- positive but probably not hugely positive in markets like New York. I think if then you go to the rest of the world we're all watching for Zika in the Caribbean and Latin America and that could have had a few points of RevPAR impact to us in Q1 in that region. It will certainly have a few points of impact at least if not a bit more in Q2. And we will see how that story plays out over the balance of the year. Obviously Mexico, that strength we expect to continue. Brazil, other than the Olympics, we wouldn't expect a lot of robustness from. You get to Asia-Pacific I think is going to continue to perform well based on the trends that we have talked about. Middle East because of Ramadan will look weak in Q2; I think it will do better in Q3 and Q4. There are important things that need to happen there. I did an interview with Arabian Hotel investment conference yesterday by videoconference. And for example Egypt has got to do more on airport safety I think before it gets a lot of European aircraft coming back into the resort markets but even to some extent Cairo. In Europe we were pleasantly surprised in Q1. Obviously the Brussels tragedy took place very late in Q1; that is going to have a more negative impact in Q2 than it did for Q1. But at the moment it feels Brussels and Paris focused in terms of weakness as opposed to Europe as a whole. So we would expect to continue to see positive sort of low- to mid-single-digit RevPAR growth in that market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Katz of Telsey Group. David Katz : So, I wanted to ask about the structure of management contracts that you will be acquiring from Starwood. I think over time we get a sense for the rhythm of incentive fees and how that kind of rolls for your Company. But what does that look like for Starwood and will you be making some major changes in those as you acquire properties and shift them from your own from an owned portfolio into a managed portfolio? And then I have one quick follow-up. Arne Sorenson : Will we be making changes in the management contracts or in our approach to disclosure, what are you asking? David Katz : I'm essentially asking are their management contracts different structurally from yours. Arne Sorenson : We don't think so. Starwood has been a very thoughtful and thorough manager we think. We occasionally because management contracts get filed in SEC filings by either hotel owners or by brand companies we have had some insight into specific management contracts. And generally the structures are the same and the rights and obligations of Starwood seem to be comparable to those of ours. Starwood, because they skew a little bit more full-service than we do, they also skew a little bit more towards managed as opposed to franchise than we do which will make this a more relevant question I think in terms of the incentive fee performance. We obviously can't give you any sense really on what their incentive fee growth could be year over year; we have got some assumptions in our model but we don't have any detailed inside view on that yet. But we would think generally it is going to be about the same. Obviously we think their biggest owner is our biggest owner as well in Host. And I think the structure of those deals, as far as we know, is very similar. David Katz : And I assume it counts if I follow up someone else's question, but on the subject of RevPAR growth, over the years we have talked about a point at which, all other things being equal, you are effectively profit or earnings neutral. And that RevPAR growth number is something greater than zero, as I recall it was something in the 3% range. As we move into next year, if one were to assume that RevPAR growth moderates, where do you expect that number to be for Marriott as it stands today and the combined Company? How does that -- where are you sort of profit neutral irrespective of any unit growth or other dynamics? Arne Sorenson : Let's break it down here. The core question there is most app with respect to the hotel level economics. And we will talk about Marriott's P&L in a minute. And you are absolutely right. We have tended to say RevPAR in the 2% to 3% range is typically what is necessary in order to maintain flat profit margins in percentage terms which would mean that dollars of profit at the hotel level would be up 2% to 3% just as the revenue line itself was up. Look at Q1 our actual results and we have got the 2.4-ish RevPAR growth, but hotel level margins up 90 basis points around the world. And that is a tribute to our operating team who continues to find a way to improve margins even with fairly modest RevPAR growth. So in that kind of environment we saw -- in an actual Q1 we saw quite modest RevPAR growth and hotel level profit growth on average going up more like the 4% to 5% range as opposed to the 2.5% RevPAR growth. I think when you look forward it is going to vary significantly market by market. U.S. labor costs obviously are going to continue to rise. Some of this will be driven by politics and other things. I think much more of it will be driven by the tightness of the labor market and the tighter it gets the more likely to see wage growth move. I would think we're likely to see 3% to 4%, maybe 3% to 5% wage growth in the U.S. in the next couple of years and as a consequence you are going to still need that 2% to 3% RevPAR growth to get sort of flattish margins. For Marriott by comparison we have got a number of different drivers. We have got the top line which is going to be driven by that same store RevPAR growth. We've got the incentive fees which are a share of them -- hopefully growing profits at the hotel. And then significantly we have got both the unit growth which is entirely incremental to that and the impact of what we do with the capital that we produce. And so all of those things I think would cause our fee growth to be significantly higher than whatever the RevPAR growth is in the market. I think simply if you have got 3% to 5% same store RevPAR growth and food and beverage is growing at the same pace we ought to see base and franchise fees grow at that amount for existing hotels plus some upside because of incentive fees. And then in addition to that the unit growth which we're talking about at 7% net of the units that we lose. That is a long answer to a short question, sorry about that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Loeb of Baird Capital. David Loeb : Arne, I kind of want to hit on the topic you've been talking about since the very first question but from a different perspective. What do you think is going on in corporations that is leading to pretty strong group business and good group ancillary spend, but relative transient weakness? Arne Sorenson : Well, again, that is where we come to this -- it's probably a bad metaphor, but this notion of a number of different short stories that don't have the same author. I don't think at the moment it is clear that this is a macroeconomic thing. I think this is instead a collection of stories that are driven by individual company dynamics. And I am not going to name companies because these are great partners of ours and I don't want to be trying to tell their stories publicly. But when you read the press you can see a number of big companies who are reducing headcount because of struggle to grow top line. You can see a number of big companies that have got activist shareholders that are forcing some focus on margins. But then you see a number of companies that are growing robustly. And a number of players in broad parts of the U.S. economy across industries, think about the accounting firms and the consulting firms and banks and some of those things. And what you hear from them is a level of economic activity that seems steady and that causes them to be fairly optimistic and as a consequence I think we end up with different RevPAR performance in different cities. And I think to the extent those stories are accurate, they tend to have a more pronounced impact on the short-term, meaning transient, than they do on the long-term, meaning group because as long as those companies are still performing well which generally they are, they are going to hold that annual meeting. They are going to make their commitments for what they need to do to launch their new products or to bring all of their customers together. And as a consequence they are going to hold the meeting that was booked a year ago or two years ago and they are going to book today the meeting that they expect to have a year or two from now. David Loeb : On a related note, the CEO of an ownership company said we're in or approaching a downturn in the industry. Do you see that? Arne Sorenson : I don't see that. I think there has never been a supply induced downturn. I shouldn't say never. I am most familiar going back to maybe the early 1990s, so think about whatever that is, 25 years I suppose. There has not been a supply induced downturn in our industry which means in effect that there has not been an industry induced downturn in our industry. What causes a downturn is a meaningful change in the demand environment. And that change is not going to occur unless we have a meaningful change in GDP growth and economic growth around the world, period. And so, that means for us and for all of you we have got to go back and say, okay, what do we think GDP is going to do in the quarters ahead. And the more pessimistic about that you are, the more pessimistic you should be about this industry because we're not going to drive -- yes, okay, we want to outperform and we will outperform, we did in the first quarter on RevPAR index, but by and large we're not going to be able to grow demand if economic activity is contracting because that will cause demand broadly to decline. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : I wanted to dig a little bit more in the group. You mentioned that those corporates are still booking those group meetings. And on prior calls I think you have noted group production in the quarter for future periods up 10% and 7% the last two quarters. Did you see a similar level of kind of production growth in the first quarter? And then also kind of 2017 and 2018 I think were noted to be pacing up high-singles, is that still the case? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I think when you look at bookings in Q1 for all future periods we were up about 5% compared to last year. But we for 2017 and 2018 would have been up sort of twice that level. And so that is a bit lower. Now to be fair we had very robust growth in the first quarter of 2015 and strong growth in group bookings in the first quarter of 2014. And I actually think built on that growth this is a good respectable number going forward. Vince Ciepiel : And then on a different topic on leverage and capital returns. You mentioned that you plan to get back to repurchasing once the targeted leverage levels are reached. On prior calls I think you threw out a few hundred million of potential share repurchase in 4Q, is that still the current thinking? Leeny Oberg : Yes, that is about right. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Patrick Scholes : Well, I wondered if you could help me clarify something here. I apologize, I may have misheard some of your commentary earlier in the call. But I thought I heard that you are not expecting a dramatically different environment for the rest of the year. However, when I run the math to get to that high end of your 3% to 5% range it implies a material uptick in RevPAR in the magnitude of 6.5% growth for the back half. How do I reconcile sort of those two different items? Did I miss hear? Arne Sorenson : I mean the commentary really is about the underlying strength in demand. And think about that as the transient business. I think we see continued modest growth in transient demand based on modest GDP growth and with it some pricing power. I think we do have a group dynamic as well though that overlays this and that is, to some extent, moving a little bit independently from what is happening in the demand environment because it has got a longer lead time and as we have talked about before, we have got a Q2 and Q3 group that is more robust than Q1.  A big piece of that is Easter but that is not the only piece of that, part of that is just the vicissitudes of the group booking cycle if you will. And so, when we roll those things together we suspect we will have a stronger headline RevPAR number obviously in the balance of the year than we did in the first quarter of the year. We were below the 3% in the first quarter of the year. So of by definition of that that way. But again, that would be a reflection more of a group and normalizing of the holiday time than a characterization by us that it depends on a dramatically more healthy underlying economy than the sort of 2% GDP number which we assume to be the case. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Follow-up question, what was your group RevPAR result growth rate for 1Q? Arne Sorenson : Low-single-digits, about the same as our RevPAR as a whole. And again, there you've got to remember you have got Easter there which is going to have a pronounced impact particularly on group. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but my guess is January and February our group RevPAR was higher than the transient RevPAR. And then because of March and Easter we end up essentially giving some of that back and ending up more or less in the same place. Patrick Scholes : Okay. And again, I could be wrong here. When I run the math on your group RevPAR expectation for quarter's two to four versus your previous guidance back in February it would seem that group pace has come down from about 7% to 5.5%. Is that correct that we have seen deceleration? Arne Sorenson : Order of magnitude that is right. Leeny Oberg : As Arne pointed out before, you should actually expect that to happen as you move through the year when a year ago you could be doing in the year for the year booking. So it's to some extent -- some of it is as you move through the year you would expect that to happen. Operator : There are no further questions at this time, sir. Arne Sorenson : All right. Well, we thank you all for your time and attention this morning and, as always, look forward to welcoming you into our hotels as you travel. Be well. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, President and CEO of Marriott International. Arne Sorenson : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director Investor Relations. Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today July 28, 2016 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. The big news this year for Marriott is the Starwood Acquisition. As you know we have received all of the necessary regulatory clearances throughout the world with the exception of China. We are in the second phase of China review and we have been working cooperatively with the regulatory authorities. Phase 2 review ends on August 9. We remain optimistic that we will receive clearance from China and will complete the transaction in the coming weeks. Before we move to specifics, let me make three observations about our results in the quarter. First, you will not be surprised that U.S. economic growth has been slower than we anticipated when the year began. In fact over the last three quarters, room sales of our nearly 300 largest corporate customers have gradually weakened from 4% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 2% in the first quarter and less than 1% in the second quarter. Fortunately group business remains strong and discounted leisure business has picked up the slack. With half of the year complete our second half North America REVPAR guidance assumes economic growth remains on the same slow pace that we have seen year-to-date. Second, with the stronger dollar we are seeing fewer international guests coming to our U.S. hotels. With the impact most pronounced in a few key gateway markets. We estimate the number of room nights occupied by international guests at comparable hotels in New York and Miami declined by 10% to 15% in the second quarter. For the U.S. as a whole, t he number of room nights from international guests in our hotels declined by roughly 3%. Third, specific regional issues have had a meaningful impact on REVPAR growth. Terrorism in Brussels, Paris and Istanbul, Zika in the Caribbean and Latin America, oil prices in Houston and oil prices and unrest in the Middle East to name a few. Combining the headwinds from the economy foreign exchange and regional issues Marriott's worldwide; systemwide comparable hotel REVPAR increased 2.9% in the second quarter just below our guidance. We were pleased with this performance because despite the environment REVPAR index data shows that we are taking share. Our already high system wide worldwide REVPAR index increased 90 basis points year-to-date as we extended our lead over our competitive set. We are also increasing our share of new development. Driven by the strength of our brands we are already the largest hotel company in the world. Our global system totaled nearly 780,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter and our worldwide pipeline increased to more than 285,000 rooms, nearly 15% higher than the year ago quarter. In 2016 we expect our worldwide distribution not including Starwood will increase by roughly 7.5% gross or 6.5% net. According to SER [ph] well Marriott has 11% of open rooms in the U.S. today. We have been selected to manage or franchise 30% of the rooms currently under construction, more than any other hotel brand company. Our large pipeline is particularly impressive given today\u2019s financing environment. New rules requiring banks to carry higher capital reserves have constrained lending, causing lender to be more selective on both refinancing and new hotel construction. This selectivity includes more conservative loan to value ratios, a bias towards smaller transactions and caution about concentrated exposures in individual markets. To our benefit, lenders continue to favor the strongest brand. While our business is cyclical our cash flow is less sensitive than you might think. We estimate that one point of REVPAR worldwide over a full year moves our fee revenue by only about 1% or $25 million, and one point of REVPAR moves the net results of our owned and leased hotels by about $3 million. Meaningful unit growth and low risk fee revenue yields terrific operating leverage. Our performance this quarter highlights the fact. Second quarter comparable worldwide actual dollar REVPAR increased 2.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% and adjusted EPS grew 18%. Our business throws off outstanding cash flow. We may make investments from time to time for particularly attractive management or franchise agreements on high value of hotels, we also buy and build great brands and businesses, we\u2019ve added five brands in as many years and the pending Starwood transaction will add another 11 brands. But if we can\u2019t find an attractive investment we return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past five years we have returned nearly $7.5 billion to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 130 million shares at an average price of $49 per share. We remain committed to minimizing owned assets and maximizing returns to shareholders. Our pre tax return on invested capital was 50% in the second quarter. Before I turn things over to Leeny, I\u2019d like to say I am incredibly impressed with the people at Starwood. Despite the disruption and uncertainty they have experienced over the last 15 months, the Starwood team has done a great job, acceralating their development pipeline, spinning off Vistana, launching new marketing initiatives and opening nearly 125 hotels all the while also taking care of the guests and managing the everyday business. Thank you. I\u2019d also like to say that I have never been more proud of Marriott associates; this team has done a lot of transactions over the last five years. From the spin-off at Marriott vacations worldwide in 2011 to the more recent acquisitions of AC hotels, Gaylord, Protea and Delta. With each of these transactions Marriott associates worked hard to first execute the transaction and then capture the strategic value of the deal, all while growing and managing our existing business. The Starwood transaction should be completed in the coming weeks bringing these terrific teams together. Both the Marriott and Starwood teams have done exhaustive planning to get ready and we are excited by our prospects. While we will see a lot of progress in the near term we expect that full integration will be a two year project. We are bullish about the power of the combined company. Starwood is known for its very strong brands, marketing knowhow and outstanding frequent traveler program. Marriott has a proven track record in creating and growing leading brands, improving underperforming brands and expanding distribution. The combination of Marriott and Starwood should bring even more including cost savings in G&A and hotel operations and revenue opportunities. We expect to accelerate the growth of Starwood\u2019s great brands and the ultimate combination of our rewards programs and Starwood preferred guests will create the most compelling frequent traveler program in the industry by far. Now, I\u2019d like to turn things over to Leeny to talk more about our second quarter results. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thanks Arne. In the second quarter we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.96, a 10% increase from the prior year. Adjusted for the Starwood transaction expenses, diluted earnings per share totaled $1.03 an 18% increase from the prior year. Adjusted EPS was about $0.04 to $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, fees were about $0.02 to $0.03 below those expectations due to weaker than expected REVPAR and lower than expected franchise re-licensing fees. Our owned, leased and other lines was about $0.01 shy of our expectations due to slightly lower than expected branding fees. G&A came in about $0.01 favorable to expectations. The joint venture line was $0.01 to $0.02 better than expected largely due to strong hotel performance. Finally, our tax rate generated $0.05 to $0.06 of better than expected EPS due to some favorable discreet tax items. Worldwide constant dollar system wide REVPAR rose roughly 3%. For our company managed hotels, worldwide house [ph] profit margins increased 60 basis points. In North America, company managed REVPAR rose 3.6% and house profit margins rose 100 basis points. House profit margins benefitted from productivity gains and lower energy costs. On a system wide basis, North America\u2019s system wide REVPAR rose 3.2% in the quarter with particular strength in Los Angeles, New Orleans and Atlanta. Transient REVPAR rose 2% in the quarter as we maintained our occupancy by opening discount channel. Group REVPAR rose 7% and catering sales increased more than 5% in the quarter. Overall group cancellation rates remained normal and attendance at group meetings met our expectations. Group business continues to look solid for the second half of 2016 with system wide North America group revenue paced [ph] up 5% although the timing of holidays will influence quarterly comparison. Third quarter system wide group revenue pace in North America is up 9% while fourth quarter pace is flat year-over-year. Encouragingly, 2017 group pace is up 7%. Outside North America, second quarter system wide comparable REVPAR rose 2% on a constant dollar basis or declined 1% using local currency. In Europe, constant dollar system wide REVPAR increased 3%. Germany\u2019s REVPAR rose 9% with strong group business REVPAR in Spain rose at double digit rate benefitting from a stronger economy and large number of guests that would have visited hotels in the Middle East in the past. REVPAR in France, Belgium and Turkey remained very weak. System wide REVPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased nearly 6%, South-Korea\u2019s REVPAR increased dramatically on easy comparison to last year\u2019s MERS outbreak. REVPAR in Greater China rose 3% with very strong results in Shanghai and Beijing and modest growth in Hong Kong. Economic growth increased REVPAR in India by 10% in the quarter. We saw occupancy declines in the Caribbean and Latin America largely due to weak economic conditions and the impact of the Zika virus. Occupancy rates were also lower in the Middle East and Africa region due to the earlier start of Ramadan, oversupply in Dubai, ongoing political unrest in many countries and the lower price of oil. Total fee revenue in the second quarter increased 4% with incentive fees up 16%. Base fees declined 3% due to a tough comparison to deferred fees recognized in the year ago quarter and unfavorable FX rate. Franchise fees increased 6% despite 3 million less in lower like in -- in relicensing fees reflecting pure asset sales among our franchise communities. Total incentive fees increased 16% with North America hotel incentive fees up 22%. Worldwide 64% of our managed hotels paid incentive fees in the quarter compared to 59% in the year ago quarter. In North America alone, 62% of managed hotels paid incentive fees compared to 55% in the year ago quarter. Owned leased and other revenues net of direct expenses increased 20% in the quarter reflecting renovations at the Tokyo, Ritz-Carlton and the Renaissance Jaragua, somewhat offset by the sale of our St. Thomas Ritz-Carlton last year. In addition, results reflect an easy comparison to last year\u2019s pre-opening cost for the New York addition hotel. Branding fees increased 14% with higher card holder sales from our co-branded credit card and higher sales of Ritz-Carlton residences. Reported general and administrative costs increased 11% or 1% when adjusted for the $14 million of Starwood related transition and transaction cost in the second quarter. Reported operating margins totaled 10% for both the 2016 and 2015 quarters. Adjusting for cost reimbursement and Starwood transition and transaction costs, operating margins reached 53% in 2016 compared to 50% in the prior year in the second quarter. Interest expense increased to $57 million in the second quarter, excluding the $11 million cost of a bridge facility commitment, adjusted interest expense totaled $46 million. In preparation for the upcoming transaction we raised $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt during the second quarter. The 5.5 year and 10 year notes were priced at the lowest interest cost for comparable maturities in the company\u2019s history. These offerings increased our long term debt to $4.1 billion paid off our standing commercial paper balances and increased our cash and cash equivalent to nearly $700 million. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margins totaled 65%. Making an EPS projection for 2016 is difficult. To assist the modelers, however we provided some P&L guidance for Marriott\u2019s legacy business for the next two quarters. For the third quarter we expect worldwide system wide constant dollar REVPAR will increase 3% to 4% benefitting from the favorable holiday pattern and strong group bookings including the Olympics in Brazil. Total fee revenue for the Marriott standalone business totaled $495 million to $500 million, 6% to 8% growth over the 2015 third quarter and adjusted EBITDA as expected to total $476 million to $481 million a 10% to 12% growth over the prior year. For the fourth quarter, we expect worldwide system wide constant dollar REVPAR will moderate to a 2% to 3% increase reflecting tougher holiday comparisons in North America. Total fee revenue for the Marriott standalone business could total $485 million to $490 million, a 7% to 8% growth over the 2015 fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to total $461 million to $471 million, a 15% to 17% increase over the prior year. We expect worldwide system wide REVPAR will increase roughly 3% for the full year of 2016. Given our expected 6.5% worldwide net unit growth and modest increases in G&A we anticipate that our legacy business will generate roughly $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year, 10% more than in 2015. We expect incentive fees to grow at a mid-teen\u2019s rate. Compared to our full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA forecast from last quarter, our current adjusted EBITDA outlook is $36 million lower at the midpoint with more modest REVPAR growth, some construction delays pushing hotel openings into early 2017 and fewer asset sales among our franchise community we\u2019ve reduced our fee outlook by $40 million including $10 million in lower franchise re-licensing fees. Elsewhere on the P&L, we\u2019ve reduced our owned leased and other net forecast a bit due to some fine tuning of our branding fee estimate while our new forecast for G&A is about $10 million better than our prior forecast. For the Marriott legacy business 2016 investments spending could total $450 million to $550 million including about $100 million in maintenance spending. Excluding Starwood, we anticipate recycling $200 million to $250 million through asset sales and loan repayments during 2016. Given that transition and transaction costs are uncertain at this point, we are including these costs in our 2016 guidance but expect to break out such expenses as actual results are reported as we did this quarter. Like you, we rely on Starwood\u2019s publicly disclosed forecast of their REVPAR growth, unit growth and adjusted EBITDA for their business. When the transaction closes, we expect to assume Starwood\u2019s outstanding debt issue roughly 136 million Marriott shares and increased net debt by roughly $3.5 billion for the cash component of the deal. Given we and Starwood are still two separate companies, we can\u2019t comment on the pace of Starwood\u2019s asset sales in 2016. But with the completion of the transaction you can be sure we will focus very quickly on getting back to our targeted leverage level as quickly as possible. With regard to future G&A spending, we expect to have our new organization largely in place by year end 2016, although some transition costs will carry over into 2017 and even a bit into 2018 as we integrate our systems and technology platforms. We continue to believe we will achieve $250 million in steady state annual G&A savings. Once the transaction is complete, we will work to prepare 2015 and 2016 pro forma adjusted quarterly income statements to reflect the combination. These statements should be ready sometime this fall. We believe the transaction will close in the coming weeks and now one more housekeeping matter for you. A typical schedule for declaring the third quarter dividend is immediately following our August board meeting scheduled this year for next week August 4. While we plan to pay a dividend in the third quarter, the announcement of the third quarter record and payment date made be delayed a bit until there is greater clarity around the actual transaction closing day. We appreciate your patience as we work through these issues and particularly appreciate your interest in Marriott so that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Crystal will take questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry Curtis : Hi, good morning, everyone. Arne your comments about the sequential trend in the economy were reasonably downbeat yet your level of confidence seems to be pretty strong relative to the second half and your forward bookings in group for next year are fairly decent. What gives you the confidence that it actually won't get worse from here because history does tell us that it has got a reasonable shot at getting worse? Arne Sorenson : Yes, well good morning Harry. Obviously the strength of the economy is the biggest question I think in terms of forecasting how we are likely to perform in the coming quarters. And to some extent is the place maybe you can see this up a little bit over the second quarter. I think as we guided a quarter ago we have an overly rosy view about the strength of GDP in the United States particularly and as a consequence we continue to stick with our 3% to 5% REVPAR for the full year that we have provided at the beginning of the year. I think today we have obviously experienced actual second quarter number which came in essentially right at the low end of our guidance in the United States and a little bit below the end globally when you factor in some of what\u2019s happening around the world. And that I think is fundamentally a reflection of lower GDP growth in the United States that wont\u2019 be anticipated. But it is still positive GDP growth, I think to some extent the question you and we could ask of ourselves is we what more solid, more confident in the kind of guidance we are giving today than what we gave a quarter ago. And I think the best answer to that is that we now are making forecast based on essentially the current face of GDP growth in the United States which is weak not on a more rosy scenario. Is it possible the U.S. economy performs worse than that, of course it is. But when you look at the range of economic data that comes out including recent employment reports and consumer confidence reports and corporate profits and some of those sorts of things, it looks to us like it\u2019s a reasonable good bet that the economy will continue to grow, albeit grow maybe somewhat anemically. And there does not appear to be data out there which would suggest that it is getting meaningfully weaker from a GDP perspective. But that is the question that continues to keep your eye on. Harry Curtis : Thank you. And my follow-up question is how quickly do you think you can get to your target leverage ratio? And the reason I ask that is at that point you'll be generating some substantial free cash flow and if you could give us your thoughts on possibly taking the dividend up which investors seem to be paying more or attaching more value through these days? Leeny Oberg : Thanks, Harry. As we said \u2013 as I said in my comments we'll obviously as soon as we get going with this transaction and close we'll be working on driving that leverage ratio down to our targeted levels of 3 to 3.25 as quickly as possible. I think as well and I think I would fully expect that we would be engaging in share repurchase and enjoying the flexibility that provides as we kind of move forward. We always will continue to look at dividend, but for the moment we are comfortable with our 30%, roughly 30% payout ratio and would expect that once we get the target leverage ratios down to the levels that we'd like that we would begin being back in the market for share repurchase. Harry Curtis : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I'm curious about the decline in the gross room additions for 2016. I guess, it was down about 50 basis, but I guess just given that we're halfway through year it seems like a lot of those projects would have been just sort of months from opening. So I'm just wondering how that supply could come down so close to when those additions were expected to hit? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I think it\u2019s good question Robin, and good morning. As we put out in the press release and the prepared remarks we have seen really some construction pace expand. And I would think about Europe and North America has been primarily examples of that. And that is about construction workers and supply and to some extent maybe a little bit about how essential it is to get open instantly. And I think in some respects that in a somewhat weaker market, somewhat more anxious market that allowing the construction to take a little longer is a rational thing that some of our partners are doing. And as a consequence we see that the construction pace has expanding just a little bit. We are not seeing cancellations of projects however and I think generally what we're talking about is projects that formally we would have expected to open probably in the fourth quarter of the year opening some time in 2017. We've looked really hard at the incoming deals in our development pipeline, and I think we've been pleasantly surprised to see that new signings in most regions of the world are comparable if not up a little bit compared to gangbuster year we had in 2015, including new deal signed in North America. And so we feel that actually it shows continued strong interest in growing with our brands and is not really a fundamental change, but is a bit of fine tuning on whether we open before or after New Year's Eve. Robin Farley : Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up. I'm just curious that your guidance for the full year being now at kind of a single point at that plus 3%, typically you give a range maybe early in the year is that sort of 200 basis points spread that, but even closing in on the year maybe 100 basis points spread. I guess just given the increase kind of uncertainty and visibility, I'm just curious why go with a more narrow range when maybe your visibility would theoretically be a little bit worst? Arne Sorenson : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We of course talked about that. And often we start the year with the two point range and I think fairly if you look back over the number of years we've been doing this, we probably keep a two point range longer than we should as the year progresses. We talk about two point range here that's the fact of the matter is to have a two point range at this stage of the year implies on the low end a much, much worst potential performance than we think is even potential. And on the high end in many respects requires us to envision a performance that is more optimistic than we think is really probable. And so, as we went through this and you can see obviously we give out four [ph] point range in our guidance for Q3 and then again for Q4. To some extend you can do the math and see how that impact, in the sense you could say that our roughly three is kind of like a 2.5 to 3.5 which would be the more normal range to look at. But we think we should be fairly close to three as the year comes in based on group and our present expectations about GDP growth. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Joseph Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : Good morning, guys. Arne Sorenson : Hi, Joe. Leeny Oberg : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Greff : Just a question on the timing or how you're thinking about the timing of accelerating your capital return, I think a quarter ago you mentioned that maybe share buyback can resume at some point in the fourth quarter. Are you still thinking along the same lines? And then just in terms of the capital return and accelerating that how contingent is that on Starwood owned hotel asset dispositions? Leeny Oberg : Great. Thanks Joe. So, obviously we would have loved to have been closed by now in terms of having this call. And as you move through the year, the later and later the close you get the harder it is to know exactly where we will be three months from now or four months from now given we haven't closed yet. We \u2013 I'm not going to pertain to know all the details about exactly where every transaction is on the asset sales side with Starwood and so we will need to get in there as soon as the assets \u2013 as soon as the deal closes and evaluate exactly where it is. I think we do continue to feel very comfortable that as quickly as we can we will be back in the market and whether that frankly happens to be towards the end of the Q4, the beginning of Q1 does depend to some extend on exactly which deals close in the fourth quarter and first quarter. But I think give or take a few months I think we see it exactly the same place we did before. It just again, we don't have specific visibility on exact timing of the closing of asset sales. And to get from where as we said before we would expect to be somewhere in the ballpark of 3.6 [ph] and then want to get down to 3 to 3.25 and if we don't close until sometime in August to get there by the end of Q4 definitely depends on the some asset sales. So, we'll be updating you as quickly as we can. Joseph Greff : Great. Thank you. And just a follow-up on the question regarding some of the delays in these project openings, Arne, would you characterize those delays has been driven more by economic uncertainty or do you talk workers and things like that, can you sort of help understand or amplify that please? Arne Sorenson : Yes. And remember this is the collective of decisions that are being made by our partners in many respects not by us. But I would say that it is probably in the U.S. more about construction pace and the level of construction that's going on around the country. I think in somewhere like the Middle East and Africa it's probably a little bit more about the sense that the market essentially that you don't need to rush to get it done. But they continue to move forward with it. I really don't think it is a significant or cataclysmic change. Joseph Greff : Good enough. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix : Hi. Thanks. I'll start with a bit of a housekeeping question, just you had mentioned that you're expecting the Phase 2 of the review in China to be complete by August. Is that it or is there another phase? Arne Sorenson : Well, the Chinese government does have the ability to take deals into a Phase 3, and obviously we can't speak for the Chinese government and have no regard for the fact that they've got to run their process in a way that meets with their needs. Having said that, we obviously are in communication with the staff over there, we've provided very, very significant amounts of information over the course for the last six or eight months something like that. And believe that the information that they need they have in hand and based on what we hear we are optimistic again that we should be done in the next few weeks. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Getting to larger picture questions, I was just wondering, Arne, you talked about and you clarified in some earlier comments about how you revised your view \u2013 how you're using GDP to generate your guidance going forward and that was helpful. So kind of in light of that as you look towards the second half of the year and given what is going on in business transient demand and in just in the corporate world. I was just wondering what level of business transient demand you're factoring into the guidance for the second half? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I'm not sure if I'm going to answer that, off top of my head. I think that the kind of pace we saw in the second quarter is more or less what we'd expect to take place over the balance of the year with one significant clarification. And that is in part because of calendar timing and in part simply because of the rhythms of group business, group is meaningful stronger in Q3 than in Q4. Plus 10-ish in Q3 and a flattish in Q4, obviously that puts us around plus five for the second half for the year as a whole. And so, I would expect that we will see a group B when you combined those two quarters a more powerful driver of RevPAR growth than a transient business, transient of course includes both corporate travel mostly during the week and leisure travel mostly during the week-end. We would continue to expect that leisure travel is going to be stronger than business travel. And that business travel will be kind of flattish maybe up a point \u2013 point or two depending on the way things go. I think if you wanted to be optimistic you might say that we're bearing some of the consequences of the incredibly pessimistic mood that corporate had as 2016 begin, think about our perspectives in the first quarter. And that's maybe a little bit of a lingering impact and if there is because of the economic data that's coming out or corporate profits or other things, a little bit less anxiety going forward, maybe we could see that improve a little bit. But again we're essentially forecasting that kind of steady state, weak corporate transient demand, not falling off a cliff in any respect but just sort of continuing to bump along. Felicia Hendrix : And then just to kind of understand on the leisure side, what we're looking at for the second half, I was just wondering how leisure transient grew in the first half and also how that compared to last year? Arne Sorenson : Leisure transient, so let's see here, we've got a whole bunch of quarters in front for us, I mean, just make sure we're getting this right. We're probably leisure transient year to-date in the four-ish range something like 4% growth year-over-year. When you look at \u2013 so I guess that gives you a comparison to last year as well. Felicia Hendrix : What about for all of that, like for all of last year, how does that? How did that grow? Arne Sorenson : You mean last year compared to 2014? Felicia Hendrix : No. I just mean how that leisure transient grew -- yes, how that leisure \u2013 what was the leisure transient growth last year? Arne Sorenson : We should make sure we get that for you accurately. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Leeny Oberg : Give me a call back and we'll see if we can pull back together. Arne Sorenson : I think 4% is the number you can be fairly clear about now. Year to-date, first half of the year about 4% leisure growth. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. That's helpful. And just one last quickie. Some of the companies that have reported so far as has said that they are looking or they're seeing weaker short-term group bookings, I mean, you gave us a lot of data on your group business and the pace and stuff and that's helpful. Just wondering if you've seen any difference between kind of small group versus large groups, or you're seeing any kind of difference in demand? Arne Sorenson : Yes, we do. Interestingly from months to months sometimes by size that the data moves around, so we've seen bigger groups probably strongest but it does vary a little bit month to month. I think there is a piece of as though which is about availability. We've got really quite please to see occupancy continue to grow in Q2 delivering roughly half of our RevPAR growth. Our hotels are quite busy and we have clearly seen the booking window expand which is certainly one of the factors that would be impacting in the year for the year group bookings. Felicia Hendrix : Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Sean Kelly with Bank of America. Sean Kelly : Hi, good morning. Arne, just looking back through the very opening comments you talked about some of the commentary and the trends from some of your largest corporate customers. I was curious as you see that trend unfolding is there any \u2013 are there any greenshoots that you guys are getting maybe anecdotally for many of those conversations as we start to lap some of things that oil and gas and some of the other things that maybe bringing down the broader corporate sector. I mean, anything people are talking about that probably isn't factoring in the GDP yet but that give you signs of encouragement? Arne Sorenson : No. I mean, I think the \u2013 still I think you look at the economic data, corporate profits and GDP growth will be the best indication to Europe where we think where that should go. Greenshoots, I don't know, I guess I sort of hesitate to use that phrase anywhere, but not surprisingly though when you look underneath averages you'll see relatively greater strength in the tech world than you will see to pick the other extreme in the oil patch. And Houston I think was down 10% if I remember right RevPAR in Q2, which is 10% of the oil patch in the United States obviously. And I think that's driven by bad aspect of our economy. The comparisons will get easier for oil certainly as the year ago along. I'm not sure that that means any of them will view business has been robust though in a way that causes them to get back to the level of activity that they might have had two years ago something like that. It does maybe mean that it shouldn't continue. It shouldn't decline from here I suppose that might be an optimistic way of thinking about it. But again, I think looking at corporate profits and GDP growth those are going to be the best things that drive the averages as a whole. Sean Kelly : That's helpful. And then, this one maybe a little bit specific, but just thinking about the sequential pattern as things unfold with all the shifts in the third quarter, could you give us a directional sense of due you expect RevPAR to improve as we move throughout the third quarter or the opposite, just sort of what you're kind of anticipation of how 3Q shapes up on monthly perspective? Arne Sorenson : I think we believe August and September will be stronger than July. Sean Kelly : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker : Hey. Just I was hoping you guys could give us a little color on how things are progressing with your member pricing initiative. I know it wasn't in your prepared remarks but are you gaining any traction in terms of stealing customers away from the OTAs, growing your loyalty program platform? And then also any impact in the short term that's having on your RevPAR growth outlook over the back half of the year by offering the discounts? Arne Sorenson : All good questions. Thank you. We are \u2013 I know one of our principal competitors talk about this yesterday in their call. They were a couple of months, maybe three months ahead of us particularly in the marketing of their programs, but their data is got a few months head start for us. But I think what we're seeing in our Marriott Rewards Member only rate is very encouraging. We continue to see a strong year-over-year growth in Marriott Rewards Signups. We see that occupancy contribution from the rewards program is in the high 50% of contribution to the hotels. We see strong growth in apps download and Marriott.com business and mobile bookings and all those things. So, we're encouraged by that. It has had a modest impact, we think on RevPAR in Q2 probably in the 30 to 40 basis point range on reported RevPAR, which in a sense you could look at and say that is a negative impact of it. But this is a long term question for us. And really what we want to make sure we're doing is communicating clearly to Marriott Rewards Members that will have value because we know them and because they have loyalty to us and make it clear crystal clear, sometime contrary to the advertising or perception that's out there in the market, but make it crystal clear that the rates through our channels are at least just good if not better than the rates that available anywhere else. And obviously if that drives a meaningful share shift towards our channels that's a good thing and that's the bet we're making and we think it\u2019s good bet. Ryan Meliker : Thank you. That is helpful. I understand the long-term benefits of this and I would never question that. I'm just trying to understand kind of what is built into your guidance. You mentioned 30 to 40 bps of RevPAR headwind in the second quarter. Are you building that type of RevPAR headwind into the back half of the year as well as this program continues to ramp? Maybe a little bit more as the program continues to ramp? How are you thinking about that? Arne Sorenson : I wouldn't think it\u2019s going to get any worst, but it is reflected in our guidance. Ryan Meliker : All right, that's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hey good morning. So you cut your G&A guidance for the year just I mean you have been very good in the past about streamlining cost I guess two questions one would be at what point or what level of REVPAR do you think you would need to make more drastic cuts and then two, how much kind of dry powder how much do you think you can cut there. Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Well, so let's take both of those. So first of all just in general you are seeing good solid cost controls. You are watching the company do what it should do in a modest growth environment which is being very careful to look with adding positions and the reality is as we prepare for Starwood, I think we definitely have been keeping a very close eye knowing that we are going to be able to have great efficiencies by joining up with Starwood and so really not just kind of adding necessarily before the merger where we have an opportunity to do it afterwards and do it in combination with the reorganization of how we want to run the company on a combined basis. So I think overall these are good solid the $10 million that you have seen is the what I would call a permanent sort of solid reduction in G&A relative to cost controls and I don't think we are imagining that there is with the current standalone Marriott business that we would be imagining that we are looking at an environment of needing to do a wholesale reorganization. We do continue to think that they are fantastic synergies related to the combination which as you\u2019ve heard, we are still confident that the 250 million of steady state savings in the combined company is achievable. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you and then just as my follow-up you mentioned earlier that you hadn't seen any pick up in cancellations rates on the group business. I am wondering if what you are seeing on the trends inside what level of cancellations rates do you typically see and how is that been trending? Thank you. Arne Sorenson : I am not sure I can answer the first part of that question. But the second part it's there about the same. We did make a change a year and half ago on our cancellations window so typical business would be until roughly the first of 15 or I can double check the calendar on this whether I am remembering it right but I think roughly the first of 2015 we began to require cancellations 24 hours before stay in other words the day before the check-in date. Prior to that time you could cancel up to 6 PM on the day of the stay. And that has obviously reduced cancellations in the last 24 hour period. But when you look after that time and look at cancellations day before 2-3 days before we are not really seeing the material change from what we have experienced previously. Leeny Oberg : That occurred in February 2015. Arne Sorenson : February 2015. Thomas Allen : Helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeffrey Donnelly : Good morning guys. Actually on the topic Arne, you experienced with those trends that you see positive or negative in group cancellations attrition in the year pace or can I hear on the coal mine that have called accurately for shadows future trends or do you find it's something unreliable indicator given your experience? Arne Sorenson : It's a good question. There is certainly in the group space if you have got a shrinkage that is recurring sort of real time so that groups are showing up with meaningfully lower number than what they anticipated before that could be a warning that group participants or the companies sponsoring groups are less bullish about things than they were when the reservation group booking was first made. But again, we haven't really seen movement in that. So there is not data there that would tell us be where because of that in fact you can tell from our comments about group, group is one of those things that we look at that give us some solidity in our point of view about the future and the group attendance has been good and food and beverage spending has been good and so we that's sort of reassuring. It's a good question around transient cancellations again I don't think we have seen the shift there but I don't I can't tell you whether in prior cycles that would be a canary in the coal mine my guess is it's not very much because corporate transient business is booked so short before the stay that actually it doesn't show up so much in cancellations but probably just shows up in the booking itself. Jeffrey Donnelly : Okay and maybe the follow-up in the perhaps this is for Leeny around the integration I recognize you probably got plan for all aspects of the Marriott integration but where in your mind do you think you are going to say some of the highest hurdles in the integration. Is it technology, is it branding and marketing, is it guest loyalty and maybe it's follow-up just so we can have our expectations that one to two years from now should we expect this will leave you guys to sort of a new state of the art technology system or you sort of more focused on just patching existing systems together? Leeny Oberg : Very good question. So couple of things, I would say we are still in the lands where we don't have kind of open sesame into all the information. So full knowledge about exactly how we are thinking about some of these technological platforms and merging them and what we will choose and exactly how we will do it remains to be seen. I think we continue to believe this is a two year process. But this integration of these two companies when you think about it kind of what we guided to get in there look at it and then figure out from the transition standpoint that it is a two year integration. It's definitely something that you should expect. In terms of loyalty, we have got a host of issues in addition to both the logical issues around platforms and reservation etcetera. We have also got some other things like credit cards and time share businesses where we need to work with our partners to get where we all want to go in terms of the relationship with the customer and that one is a little bit harder to pick exactly a time I think we have said before that we are hopeful by 2018 to emerge the loyalty program so I think the two year sort of estimate is for right now it's good as we can give you. Jeffrey Donnelly : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group. David Katz : Hi, good morning all. Arne Sorenson : Hi David. David Katz : Hi, so I wanted to just ask about the post closure asset sales program plan. How should we be, I assume that you have specific set of strategies around getting that done and as I listen to you talk about it in many respect it seems as though it is a forgoing conclusion that they will be sold and we do have a stated set of net proceeds coming out of that. Is there any color that you can give us around your assurances that it's going to happen the way you have mapped it out and some of the sort of issues in getting that done? Leeny Oberg : Great. So, you are right we have talked about in general what we expect to do in terms of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of asset sales over the next couple of years. Once when we do this deal so first of all you can tell what Starwood has done so far this year they have done a great job of moving through their assets sale program and getting some nice deals done. We like you basically take our cue from them in terms of hearing how they are doing on that front and from that perspective we know that they are talking to a number of parties out there about some very good sized transactions and we look forward to as soon as the deal is closed to getting much more involved in understanding exactly where things are with the negotiations and the terms of the deals and the pace of those discussions. So I wouldn't really be able to hazard where we are in Q3, Q4, Q1 of 2017 except to know that I am sure you have seen Marriott track record. And that is that we don't want to be a real estate owner and we will be moving as quickly as practicable to recycle that capital but frankly I would expect that you will hear more from us at the end of Q3 when we have closed and we have got a better handle on where things are. David Katz : So it sounds like there is a series of processes that they have begun. Leeny Oberg : Yes. David Katz : That you will be taking the reins on that are at some wide range of sages? Leeny Oberg : That's you hit the nail on the head. That's exactly right. David Katz : Understood, okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Hightower : Hey good morning everyone. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Rich Hightower : So I want to go back to an item in the prepared comments about the strategy in the second quarter of increasing occupancy via various different channels as a way to generate REVPAR. So it's sort of reminiscing of the heads and bed strategy that was employed much earlier in the cycle here and so my question is how much more occupancy or how much more REVPAR can you drive this way given that we are basically at or near a structural peak in occupancy and then going forward where will REVPAR come from if that avenue is eventually more or less closed off? Arne Sorenson : Yes, there is lots of business out there that we don't have in our hotels by definition obviously. We think we got about 11% of the rooms in the United States on a smaller share in the rest of the world usually dramatically smaller than that 11%. We tend to run meaningfully higher rates than the market as a whole. And we obviously do that with the purpose that's partly because of the way our hotels are squeaked in terms of their level of luxury and level of services that's partly about simply our approach to pricing. So there is lots of business out there that is more rates sensitive and can be persuade by us if we think it is in our interest to pursue it. Obviously we are also adding new units around the world. And whether that's 6.5% or 7% it is meaningful growth into our system and so we are with those new hotels making sure we can also grab new customers in order to fill them and do what we need to do and performance there has been great and so I think there is plenty of business for us to continue to go and grab. I think that business cannot always be grabbed at exactly the rates that the highest rate of business we have in the hotels but we do our best through revenue management and mix management and the like to drive optimal performance and I think we have done well with that. Obviously that's top line focus sort of number I would, let me stress something on the bottom line too and maybe brag about it a little bit. But I think the 100 basis point improvement in margins in the managed portfolio in the United States, 3% REVPAR growth environment is extraordinarily impressive and that is a bit about good management at the top line but it's also great management of cost elements of those hotels and both of those things I think tell you that we have got tools that we can use even in this sort of a anemic GDP growth environment that we are experiencing today that can cause us to deliver yes maybe it's lowish single digit REVPAR growth but when you put unit growth and cost management and capital return shareholders into the equation you end up with this high teens or maybe even better EPS growth. 18% EPS growth in Q2 and that's with $20 million less in gains on assets sales because we had that in Q2 of 2015. Rich Hightower : Okay that is of Arne, and maybe as a follow-up to that also related to prior comment you did mention that Marriott brands are continuing to take share from other than in the industry, but we are hearing a very similar story from some of the other big brands and so can you sort of describe the landscape of hotels of operators or branded, non-branded whatever where that share is coming from at this stage? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I mean I think there are two big American lodging companies that are these brands are in first demand and of course we believe our brands are in first demand and we have got that to support that but I think there is a significant shift towards quality, I think that shift in many respects accelerates when there is more anxiety in the market and whether that anxiety is manifested by the way the equity investor approaches it or by the approach that the lender takes we obviously talking about that little bit in the prepared comments. Lenders are more cautious today and that caution is also going to force them to put their borrowers in the position where they are going with the strongest brands that pose the least risk in weaker environment and that's very much sure benefit. Rich Hightower : Right and let me clarify that I did mean REVPAR index rather than development? Arne Sorenson : REVPAR index. Who are we taking it from well remember the way REVPAR index is done. It's not Marriott against company B, but it is how does the Marriott Marquee in Time Square in New York compared to the four hotels or five hotels or six hotels that they have in that hotels competitive set. And as a consequence in some markets it's going to be for the Marriott Marquee I don't know on the top of my head what competitive set is but I suspect that it's a number of the big branded hotels within about a mile with that hotel. In other markets we may have Marriott that is competing against a limited service hotel because that's the other \u2013 only other hotel in the market or some other products like that or some independent hotels and all of these get rolled up and when we talk about 90 basis points of index growth that is a collection of taking from lots of different kind of competitors. Rich Hightower : All right, that's helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie Research Equities. Chad Beynon : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to shift gears to Asia-Pac since you are one of the largest now in post deal close, I believe you will be the largest player in the market and you talked about some pretty positive things going on, on a forward looking basis and in the quarter. I am wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more where you are seeing the strength where the occupancy is coming from and then are we starting to see an improvement in the F&B and banquets side as we saw several years ago? Thank. Arne Sorenson : Yes, Asia is really a bright spot. You can look at it for total REVPAR numbers that we reported in the quarter we obviously call that a number of the individual markets but you look across the region and see more often than not good strong performance. Sometimes in markets like South Korea that is aided by an extraordinarily easy comparison because of the crisis last year but you look at India with its 10% REVPAR growth that is driven by core economic growth in the country China we talked about with Mainland China REVPAR of about 3% in Q2 and if anything that understates China's performance we did have a shift in the way we report REVPAR year-over-year which is something to do with service fees and service charges and some of the fine tuning of that which has about 2 point impact on reported REVPAR in China in the quarter. And so if anything China is doing even better than the numbers that we reported. We have been pleased with China on the development side year-to-date we obviously read the same newspaper that you do and there is some anxiety there as there is in many other markets around the world but it seems that people are continuing to move forward with projects that have strength. And then, on the negative side Hong Kong has been sort of tougher market mostly because Chinese visitation has, Mainland Chinese visitation has declined. Some of that is currency driven given that Hong Kong's dollar is essentially pegged to the US dollar and so as a consequence has become more expensive as the US dollar has continued to appreciate around the world. We wouldn't expect that Hong Kong is going to change for the better anytime real soon. But it's time, but I think across the region generally we are pretty bullish about Asia-Pacific. Chad Beynon : Okay. Thanks. My follow-up, asked in the quarter in the half year from a percentage basis and from a year-over-year basis very impressive for you and really particularly against your peers, particularly given the declining demands in the industries, so I am just trying to figure out if we do see REVPAR decelerate as you have guided. Are there many IMF players that are at risk of falling away or are those portfolios or operators that are just barely paying IMF so small in the grand scheme of your total fees from that segment? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Maybe Leeny will do that but before Leeny jumps in on this let me mention Australia given that you are with Macquarie, so I apologize for not having done that but Australia is a bright spot in Asia-Pacific. Chad Beynon : Appreciate that. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : So, on incentive fees you see that what we have got for the first half of the year and the back half of the year is fairly similar growth rate. Now we are looking so far this year where whatever 64% earning incentive fees and by the end of the year that will probably climb up a few percentage points. We have got a great breadth and depth now with greater international exposure across our portfolio where it's not quite the same in terms of the fall off. I think as long as we are staying in the kind of ballparks that we have talked about for REVPAR without a meaningful change I think we are in the right spot you have got the right kind of numbers. We aren't seeing that we automatically would have to kind of imagine that all of the sudden you are going to go back and reverse the one that you have. We have got a large portfolio limited service hotels that added nicely to incentive fees in Q2 and their performance looks to continue to be strong. So it's IMF performance was really nice and broad both North America as well internationally obviously impacted buyers from tough international markets but overall kind of strong growth overall. The other thing I would say on our IMF is that as you think about where we are from a margin perspective this performance is really top notch in terms of the kinds of IMF growth that we are having relative to the rep par growth it's really great performance and we feel great about the rest of the year in that regard. Arne Sorenson : Just one other comment on that. If you look at our reported numbers and pay attention to the managed page as well as the system wide page obviously managed hotels deliver the IMF. Managed hotels have a higher group mix than the system as a whole. We only really end up talking about REVPAR. We often don't talk about food and beverage and other contribution that comes from group but that does very much drive profitability of the managed hotels and with the relatively stronger group there is, I think all the things that Leeny said are that much even clear because that performance in those hotels should continue to be a bit better than those that are more reliant on transient and less on food and beverage. Chad Beynon : Okay. Helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Hi, I just have one more on group, trying to better understand the booking curve there on the prior call you noted group pacing up 7% for the second quarter. It sounds like group REVPAR did finish up at that 7% level now you are noting that group paces up 5% for the second half and based on what you are seeing with in the quarter for the quarter group bookings would you expect group REVPAR to materialize close to that 5% for the second half? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I mean, I think, its good question. I think our number for Q4 has gotten a bit better over the last quarter. I think we were obviously we are talking about three quarters a quarter ago left in the year not two and so we didn't give it to you for each quarter but I think we did say that Q3 was relatively stronger than Q4. I think Q4 numbers look a little better today than they did a quarter ago. My guess is that often the way this works is if Q3 for example were plus 10 or plus 9 point something in group business we are more likely to end up with group number which is a bit lower than that when the dust settles because there is not likely to be availability to take as much in the quarter for the quarter group business as we probably took last year. The opposite maybe the case for the fourth quarter though. So the fourth quarter hopefully will end up with actual group REVPAR numbers which are better than zero. How those two things balance out for the second half in the aggregate I couldn't tell you but it shouldn't be dramatically different than the kind of 5% number that we are talking about today for second half. Vince Ciepiel : Okay great. And then as a follow-up on that I think heading into this year group was pacing up seven and based on those comments it sounds like it will materialize close to five for the full year 2016. I think you are noting the 2017 is pacing up seven is it possible to think that 2017 could finish it close to 5% for group holding everything constant? Arne Sorenson : Yes, you are going \u2013 you are taking us well into next year and I think that's possible. I think that \u2013 the good news here though is the 7% booking is a really year-over-year comparison. So that is a data point that is compared to the same data point at the same time last year for 2016 and that is a real increase of 7% in group revenue. Vince Ciepiel : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of William Crow with Raymond James. William Crow : Good morning. Arne, I wanted to focus in on the Chinese approval real quick. It feels like its delay in the transaction by weeks or maybe months is this a straight yes or no vote by them? Is there a negotiation or demand for any changes as you operate in that market? And if we went into a phase three how long do you think that could take? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I don't think there is much more we can say than what we have already said. I will give a little bit more color. I don't obviously we have got folks in China that are helping us navigate through this and through them and through our teams we have been in touch with the Chinese authorities who are doing this process. I don't think it's political. I don't think it is extraordinary. I think it is the wheels of government working and as you can tell from our comments we expect we at least hope that we will be done here real shortly and be able to close the transaction. And close it on the terms that we have explained all of you. William Crow : Okay, I will leave it there, thank you. Arne Sorenson : Okay. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of [Indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on your guidance so obviously sounds like you are assuming safe stage GDP environment but how is industry supply factored into the guidance as well and is it possible that from the accelerating supply that we are seeing including some of the short term rental capacity is driving some of the softness that you are seeing right now on the corporate side? Arne Sorenson : Obviously REVPAR is a function of both supply and demand. Supply growing now at I don't know 1.5%, 1.6% something like that which is an historic terms is not particularly alarming maybe a little bit more than we have had last year or year before that but not a frightening sort of figure. It is very much factored into the guidance that we are providing both our supply growth and industry supply growth and we are trying to make a real world set of assumptions about the way we think our business will perform. Supply growth could be a little higher next year, but I wouldn't think it's going to be dramatically different than what we are seeing this year and that will continue to have an impact into performance. Generally an incremental point of GDP growth is about 2 points of demand growth for the industry and as consequence we could see occupancy for comp hotels continue to grow even in this kind of supply growth environment but it does depend on GDP growth and the more GDP lose of the more occupancy is likely to move. Unidentified Analyst : Okay that's helpful. Thank you. And then, you are obviously making some traction here with the direct bookings away from BOTAs but what sort of progress is being made with just the timing of when customers pay so I am specifically wondering about the percentage of reservations that are paid in advance versus on arrival. How is that trending and what can you do here to drive just more upfront payments? Arne Sorenson : We have in some markets of the world push advance pay, market it a little bit more aggressively. I know the European team has driven a significant increase in advance pay reservations. I can't tell you off the top of my head what the percentage of transient business is, that is advance pay in but I know it's growing. I suspect it's growing modestly for the company but not dramatically. And but that is one of the tools obviously that can be used as well. Unidentified Analyst : Okay thank you very much. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Crystal are there any other questions? Operator : No sir, not at this time. Arne Sorenson : All right, thank you everybody very much. Have a great summer. And keep travelling. Bye, bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. For those in the U.S., happy election day. We're pleased you're taking the time to listen to our earnings call, but we hope you also get to the polls today. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night, along with our comments today are effective only today, November 8, 2016, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. There are several topics we want to cover today, including our third quarter financial results, third quarter business trends, fourth quarter guidance, and our early look into 2017. But first we want to talk about the Starwood acquisition and the integration. This is the first earnings call for the new Marriott International. On September 23, we completed the most transformational transaction in the company's history. Including the pipeline, our global system encompasses nearly 1.6 million guest rooms today. Our near term priorities are straightforward; reach out to associates to knit the company together culturally; seize, as soon as possible, top line synergies; property cost efficiencies and $250 million in G&A savings, and do all this while remaining focused on our ongoing business, providing great experiences for our guests and driving returns for our owners and franchisees. Off to a fast start, our team did what no other large consumer company has accomplished. Within minutes after the merger closed, we linked three enormous loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest, further announcing that we would match member status between the programs. We immediately enabled our loyal travelers to earn points in one program and redeem in the other. In fact, over 3.3 billion points were transferred between the programs in the first month alone, while the first transfer and redemption reservation occurred just 15 minutes after we closed the transaction. That effort did not go unnoticed by customers and commentators. Blogger Gary Leff, who writes at View from the Wing, noted to his readers that no program has ever set up a mechanism to link accounts this quickly. And my favorite quote came from a loyalty member who tweeted, don't know if I'm more excited about linking Marriott Rewards, or the fact that pumpkin spiced lattes are back. Getting the loyalty programs right has been a big priority for us since the deal was announced. Today, we are pleased to confirm that only 16% of our combined 85 million members were members of both programs prior to the merger. This puts us in a tremendous position to capture incremental business. Immediately after closing, we also reached out to our largest B2B customers to tell them the great news and to begin cross-selling across our 30 brands. For our group business, we've seen over 1,000 lead referrals through the end of October between the Starwood and Marriott portfolios. We are moving quickly to reduce costs, both in G&A as well as costs for our hotels. Procurement is a near term opportunity. Starwood-managed hotels will begin transitioning to Avendra, the purchasing platform used by Legacy-Marriott Hotels and many other companies in the fourth quarter of 2016. Next year, we should see savings on OTA contracts. With its greater scale, Marriott has historically been able to obtain more attractive OTA contract terms. While savings to Starwood Hotels will vary by region, applying Marriott's contract terms should save Starwood owners OTA commissions, even assuming no change in OTA usage, with more savings expected in 2018. We know that you are anxious to hear much more about our integration strategy and synergy opportunities. But let us ask you for your patience. The hotel business is about details. Every market is different and every property is different. We can tell you we've reviewed and assimilated a tremendous amount of information from Starwood over the last six weeks and that we remain as enthusiastic about the transaction as ever. While the deal is very exciting, we are also focused on business fundamentals. While reported third quarter financial results included only eight days of Starwood results, today's outlook is drawn from an analysis of operating trends at both companies for all three months of the quarter. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and 2017 reflects the combined company. Clearly, North American demand growth continues to moderate. In the third quarter, hotels with the weakest RevPAR were generally in oil and gas markets, or in gateway cities affected by continued weak international visitation, or impacted by new supply. In the quarter, both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood portfolios did well in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Toronto and Washington, D.C., while both portfolios saw RevPAR declines in Houston, New York, and San Francisco. On a combined basis, North America company-operated group RevPAR increased nearly 7%, benefiting from strong demand and a favorable holiday comparison. Catering revenue continues to be strong. New group business is encouraging too. In the third quarter alone, Marriott and Starwood sales organizations booked a combined 3.6 million room nights for future periods. Measured by booked group revenue, the two companies booked 6% more business than in the prior year, with particular strength for stays in 2018 and beyond. In contrast, corporate customers are clearly cautious. In our last earnings call, we mentioned the trend in room sales among Legacy-Marriott's largest 300 corporate customers in North America, from 4% RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2% in the first quarter to less than 1% growth in the second quarter. For this quarter, room revenue from Legacy-Marriott's top 300 customers was flat year-over-year, as higher demand from professional services, retail and healthcare firms was offset by lower demand from technology, financial, energy and manufacturing companies. Looking ahead in North America, fourth quarter group RevPAR pace for our company-operated Marriott and Starwood full service hotels is down about 5%, reflecting tougher holiday comparisons combined with weak near-term corporate bookings. With greater availability, transient business should improve year-over-year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR for the combined system-wide Marriott and Starwood portfolios in North America will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter. Outside the U.S., third quarter performance of the Marriott and Starwood brands was very similar when adjusting for differences in geographic distribution. Across both portfolios in the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR growth was very strong in Brazil and Mexico, but was constrained by Zika in the Caribbean, weak economic growth in South America, and new supply in Central America. For the fourth quarter, we expect Zika will continue to be a problem for the combined portfolio, and without the Olympics, we expect Brazil hotels will more acutely feel the effect of their weak economy. As a result, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our hotels in the region will be flattish with the prior year. In the Middle East and Africa, easy Ramadan comparisons took Marriott and Starwood RevPAR higher in the third quarter, along with greater leisure business in South Africa and strong regional demand in Cairo. At the same time, many oil markets remained weak. Without the benefit of a holiday shift, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR for our combined portfolio in the region will decline at a low single-digit rate. In the Asia-Pacific region, Marriott and Starwood saw third quarter RevPAR improvement in India, South Korea and Shanghai, with declines in the Maldives, Macau and tertiary markets in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio should be flattish year-over-year, constrained by the cancellations that followed the death of the king in Thailand. In Europe, Marriott and Starwood occupancy in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul was weak in the third quarter, while our UK properties welcomed a greater number of Middle East travelers in the quarter. Hotels in Poland, Russia and Spain reported strong RevPAR growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR for the combined portfolio to be flattish year-over-year due to lingering terrorism concerns, weak group pace in London, Paris and Amsterdam, and tougher comparisons in Poland and Russia. Bottom line, we expect worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will be flat to up 1% in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to 2017, our North America outlook assumes a steady-as-she-goes economy and modestly higher supply growth. For the 2017 full year, North America revenue group pace for company-operated full service hotels across the Marriott and Starwood portfolios is currently up about 2%. For transient business, we expect current weak corporate demand to persist, although comparisons should get easier. We are targeting a higher volume of special corporate rate business for the coming year and expect special corporate room rates for comparable customers to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in most markets. We are aggressively marketing to leisure guests and adding contract business at attractive rates. As a result, for 2017, we expect North America RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, North American fee revenue from the combined Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 70% of worldwide fee revenue. Outside North America in 2017, we expect incremental constant dollar system-wide RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America regions should also be flat to up 2%, reflecting good performance in Mexico and Central America. In 2015, Caribbean and Latin America pro forma fee revenue from the Marriott and Starwood portfolios totaled 4% of worldwide total fee revenue. For the Middle East and Africa region, South Africa and Cairo should be strong, but we also see continued weak oil markets and risk of political disruption. As a result, we believe RevPAR will be flattish in the region in 2017. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Marriott and Starwood's Middle East and Africa region contributed 5% of worldwide fee revenue. For 2017, the combined portfolio in the Asia-Pacific region should see continued strength in India and Shanghai, more than offsetting weakness in Macau and tertiary markets in China, yielding a RevPAR increase at a low to mid-single-digit rate. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Asia-Pacific region fee revenue totaled 13% of worldwide fee revenue, with about half of that coming from Greater China. And finally, for Europe, we expect low single-digit RevPAR growth in 2017, with particular strength in Southern Europe and easier comparisons in Paris and Brussels. In 2015, on a pro forma basis, Europe contributed 8% of worldwide fee revenue. On a worldwide basis, we expect 2017 RevPAR will be flat to up 2%. Turning to development. For 2016, we expect our combined company should grow global rooms distribution by roughly 5% net of deletions. Project delays at both Marriott and Starwood have pushed a few openings to early 2017, but new deal signings remain very strong. As of quarter end, our combined pipeline totaled nearly 420,000 rooms. For 2017, rooms growth should accelerate to roughly 6% net of deletions. In the U.S., the combined Marriott and Starwood brand portfolio represent 14% of open rooms. Again, we have an industry-leading 36% of rooms under construction in the U.S., and 23% of rooms under construction worldwide. To be sure, leverage levels on new construction loans have moderated and construction costs are also increasing. While these conditions are not likely to change supply growth in the near term, we believe they should discourage marginal new projects from moving forward. They should also enhance our share of new construction as lenders continue to favor the strongest brands. Incidentally, our combined portfolio of hotels gained RevPAR Index globally in the third quarter and we are optimistic that we will see further gains as we realize revenue synergies. We continue to be optimistic about the Starwood acquisitions. Six weeks after closing, we've accomplished a great deal. We will continue to do the hard work necessary to be the best hospitality company for our owners, franchisees, associates, guests and for you, our investors. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny for a review of our financial results and some additional color on the fourth quarter and 2017. As I do, let me first offer my thanks to Leeny and the finance teams across Marriott and Legacy-Starwood. Closing our acquisition just eight days before the end of the quarter was not ideal. But they scrambled and they did it beautifully. Thank you all. Leeny? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you, Arne. As you saw last evening, we reported diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.26. GAAP results were constrained by $237 million of merger-related costs, including $186 million of severance and retention costs, $24 million of transition costs, $18 million of transaction costs, and $9 million of interest expense, partially offset by the eight days of Starwood's operating results. To provide visibility into Legacy-Marriott's performance in the quarter, we've adjusted third quarter results by backing out the eight days of Legacy-Starwood results and merger-related costs, as well as confirming the share count. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Legacy-Marriott business totaled $0.91, a 17% increase over the prior year. Compared to our July 27 guidance, adjusted fee revenue was $6 million below the midpoint of expectations due to more modest RevPAR growth and lower than expected application and relicensing fees. Still on an adjusted basis, our operating income of $378 million exceeded our guidance of $370 million to $375 million, as we saw good performance on our owned, leased and other net line, lower than expected depreciation and amortization expense, and better than expected G&A spending due to solid cost controls and some open positions. Adjusted fee revenue for the Legacy-Marriott business increased 6%, with incentive fees up 13% in the third quarter. While Legacy-Marriott RevPAR and unit growth drove fees higher, fees were constrained by $9 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Worldwide house profit margins for Legacy-Marriott increased 90 basis points for company-operated hotels, as many hotels are already focused on cost containment in a slower RevPAR growth environment. Strong results at our owned and leased hotels reflected recently completed renovations in Tokyo and Charlotte, the addition of two new hotels in Rio de Janeiro, which benefited from the Olympics, and stronger branding fees. Adjusted G&A increased 3% year-over-year. The increase in interest income reflected a larger portfolio of loans. Marriott's third quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger-related costs, totaled $474 million, a 10% increase over the prior year. So let's talk some more about the transaction. We've presented selected pro forma third quarter information on page A16 of the press release, assuming the Starwood acquisition and Starwood sale of its timeshare business had been completed on January 1, 2015, but using the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities as of the actual closing date of the acquisition. Incidentally, we expect to provide a more detailed pro forma income statement for historic quarters in the next couple of months after we fine-tune purchase accounting estimates. So combining Marriott's and Starwood's information, pro forma fee revenue totaled $723 million for the third quarter, an increase of 5.5% over the prior year, reflecting RevPAR and unit growth. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct costs, totaled $166 million, an increase of more than 21%. As I mentioned earlier, Marriott owned and leased hotels benefited from recently completed renovations in the Olympics in the third quarter. Results for Legacy-Starwood owned and leased hotels were also strong, particularly in Hawaii, Toronto, and Brazil. Starwood RevPAR at comparable worldwide owned and leased hotels increased more than 8% in the third quarter, with particularly strong profit flow-through. For the fourth quarter, we expect fee revenue should total $695 million to $705 million, an increase of 1% to 2% over prior-year pro forma fees. Our fee growth reflects roughly 5% unit growth. Fees are growing slower than units due to modest RevPAR growth in North America, lower RevPAR in the Middle East, and resulting lower profit flow-through and a modest decline in incentive fees. We also expect some negative FX impact, the impact of several contract changes, and some givebacks of IMF recognized earlier in 2016. We expect fourth quarter owned, leased and other, net of direct expenses, should total roughly $150 million to $155 million. In the year-ago quarter, pro forma owned, leased and other net included $3 million from hotels that have since been sold by Starwood and $11 million in termination fees. While Arne outlined our RevPAR expectations for the fourth quarter and 2017, in case you have a different view, we estimate that one-point change in our RevPAR outlook across today's combined Marriott-Starwood system, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $35 million in fees and roughly $8 million for owned, leased and other net. We expect depreciation and amortization will total $70 million to $75 million. Excluding merger-related costs, we expect G&A to total $235 million to $240 million in the fourth quarter, 16% to 18% lower than the pro forma prior year. Our anticipated fourth quarter 2016 G&A results should benefit from $8 million from a legal settlement, while the pro forma fourth quarter 2015 G&A included $5 million in Marriott merger-related costs. Fourth quarter operating income should total $530 million to $555 million, a 9% to 14% improvement over 2015 pro forma levels. As Arne described, we're working hard to integrate the companies as quickly as possible. We expect to finalize the organization structure for most regions and departments during the fourth quarter, but some may not be complete and in place until mid-2017. During 2017, we will also have wind-down costs included in G&A, related to some duplicate systems, facilities and other areas of overlap. As a result, estimating quarter to quarter G&A in 2017 is challenging, but we expect to see significant progress toward our expected $250 million in G&A savings during the year. We expect to realize the vast majority of the savings by 2018. For depreciation and amortization, you may recall that we estimated Marriott's standalone depreciation and amortization at roughly $130 million for 2016 during our last earnings call. In the 8-K filed on March 25, 2016, we estimated a run rate for incremental depreciation and amortization from the transaction would total $209 million annually. Combined with Marriott's standalone D&A would imply a $339 million annual D&A run rate for the combined company. Now that the transaction is closed, we've completed a preliminary allocation of our purchase price to the fair value of Starwood's assets and liabilities, which will be included in our upcoming 10-Q likely to be filed tomorrow. This current view puts incremental D&A at closer to $140 million to $150 million annually and puts total D&A for the combined company at a roughly $270 million to $280 million run rate. Compared to our prior depreciation and amortization estimates, our current view reflects updated information, a refined analysis of the value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the impact of Starwood's successful asset sales year-to-date and the classification of several owned assets today as assets held for sale. Purchase accounting rules provide a timeframe of up to one year from the date of acquisition to update allocations based on new information learned about the asset values as of the date of the acquisition. Therefore, in the coming year, there could be changes to these allocations and resulting catch-ups could impact our P&L on the D&A line. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. For the full year 2016, we estimate actual investment spending will total $425 million to $475 million. Included in this amount is roughly $75 million for investment spending for Legacy-Starwood brands in the fourth quarter. The Legacy-Marriott amount is about $125 million lower than last quarter's estimate, largely due to fewer development-related investments than previously expected. When we announced the proposed acquisition of Starwood, we outlined the opportunity to sell owned hotels for $1.5 billion to $2 billion over two years. Of this amount, Starwood has already completed the sale of five hotels for $325 million. Today, we own 15 hotels operating under the Starwood brand. In 2016, we believe these owned hotels could generate EBITDA of approximately $180 million to $190 million. Eight of the hotels are in North America, with the remainder largely located in Latin America. We believe we can monetize these hotels for north of $1.5 billion, with the North American assets likely to be sold relatively faster. We also believe there may be an opportunity to monetize some of Starwood's joint venture interests which could recycle additional capital. At this time, we aren't prepared to offer an estimate of proceeds. Our balance sheet is in a better position than we anticipated. As you know, the transaction took over 10 months from announcement to closing. During this time, both companies accumulated cash from operations, as well as proceeds from asset sales. Additionally, in conjunction with the transaction, Starwood used excess cash to reduce debt balances by nearly $800 million. As a result, at the end of the third quarter, Marriott had $8.8 billion in total debt and $1.1 billion in cash. As part of the acquisition, we reorganized the company's entity structure to facilitate the combined company's global operations. Given the new entity structure put in place as part of this reorganization, we expect global cash balances will continue to decline in the near term. Our debt ratio at September 30 is better than our earlier forecast by roughly 40 basis points, driven fairly equally by improved EBITDAR, higher overall cash balances from the delay in the transaction, higher confidence in our ability to use all of Starwood's cash and then to a lesser extent, better estimates of our increased lease commitments as a result of the transaction. We believe today that we are within the range of our targeted 3x to 3.25x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR credit standards, excluding the impact of merger-related costs and charges. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter. We know that you're eager for more information about the combined company. We will have much more to say about 2017 in February and when we hold our Analyst Day in March. But as you can tell, for now we feel very good about our brands, our business and our progress in integrating Starwood. Now let's get to your questions. So that everyone gets a chance to participate, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Thank you. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Wow. Thank you for taking me first. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: How about that. Good morning, David. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I appreciate that. There's a lot of interesting stuff to discuss in this and a lot of really good progress. But I want to focus on one particular issue, which is the ongoing book direct initiative. And I wonder if you can give us an idea about how you're viewing that relative to the owners? What impact you think that's having on RevPAR, on ADR in particular? And do you think the owners are seeing an offsetting or partially offsetting decrease in OTA commissions as a result of that initiative? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I \u2013 it's a good question David. I wish we could be more definitive about it. I think it's still relatively early in assessing the impact of this. What we've seen so far is encouraging to us. But I think, fairly, we don't have statistics that we can use that would prove to you that we have delivered true success from this yet. But the early statistics, we see a high level of signups, I think something like 800,000 or 900,000 incremental Marriott Rewards signups since member only rates were launched. I think we are getting through the din of the marketing battles. As we've talked about in the past, there was a perception that rates at our hotels were cheaper on channels other than our own, which has not been true for well over a decade. And we wanted to really find a way to break through that noise and make sure folks knew that they could get competitive rates by booking directly with us and going so far as to say there's a bit of a discount, actually, if you book directly with us we thought was a powerful way to get there. And so we're seeing good pick-up of that marketing message, good stickiness with the loyalty program. Obviously, though, the discounts are available to folks who would have booked directly previously, as well as folks who might be booking directly now for the first time, and that has \u2013 continues to have a very modest impact on RevPAR. We think in Q3, probably about 30 basis points. And we'll watch it as we go forward. Obviously, this is something we talk with our owners about with some regularity, and I think generally the community to include us and our owner partners is supportive of continuing to pursue this. So it's all systems go. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And on the cancel/re-book technology, what are your latest thoughts? I know I've asked this before, but what are your latest thoughts on how you might combat the impact of that technology going forward? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, the first thing to note is we don't see a material impact from that yet in any event. So we obviously continue to watch it. We're looking at cancellations generally, what's happening across our portfolio, and we're looking at it in individual markets. And I think stay tuned. That's something we'll continue to watch. David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you all very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Smedes. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Smedes. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. I wanted to just ask, you know, you're taking a little bit more of a conservative stance on your RevPAR outlook for 2017 versus your largest U.S. competitor. You're at 0% to 2%. And I was just kind of curious, what do you think you're seeing now that were a few weeks further on here than when they reported that maybe has kind of changed your view? Or are you just sort of just taking a more conservative outlook given what you're seeing in the economy? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We obviously don't know exactly how they came to the, what range that they've provided when they released earnings. So it's a little difficult for us to provide a real detailed comparison. Having said that, listening to the words that they used and going through our own process, I think there's a couple of things that we would say. One is, I think we would be providing exactly the same guidance if we were simply Legacy-Marriott. So the first thing to point out is this is not a range which is driven by the recently completed merger with Starwood. I think the second thing, and my guess is this is more or less the full explanation you'll get, is that we expect GDP to continue with the sort of anemic numbers that have been posted in 2016 as we go into 2017 and beyond. And it sounded as if one of our largest competitors was expecting a rebound of some sort in GDP. We hope they're right. Obviously, if GDP performs stronger, that will increase demand strength in our business, but we're building a model that essentially assumes we'll continue to bump along at the levels we've been at. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just sort of on that, I think on your last call you noted that group RevPAR was pacing up 7% in 2017 and you called it to 2% now. Is that pace of deceleration kind of normal as you move through towards the end of the year? Or is that a faster pace than what you would have expected? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think it's faster than we would have expected. If you go back to the full year, I think we started \u2013 and Laura can maybe pull this out as we talk \u2013 but I think we started 2016 with group business up almost 10% for 2017 compared to where we were at the first of 2015 for 2016. And I think we cautioned folks that that was not likely to hold because as we got farther into the year, we would see that we could book less because we had less capacity. And so we expected that we would tail down towards the maybe mid to high single digits. But I think the experience in the last quarter or so going from roughly 7% to roughly 2% is worse than we anticipated. I think there are a couple of \u2013 one positive thing that can be said next to that, when you look at bookings done in Q3 for all future periods, we were up about 8%, if memory serves. So people are still making commitments on group business and there's good growth. But when you look at the near term, when you look at group bookings in the year for the year, or you look at group bookings for the next 12 months, we see less robustness there. And to us that's a sign of some caution by corporate customers probably particularly who \u2013 in the sense that's where group business gets most like corporate transient business too. And there I think we're seeing companies be just a bit cautious and probably reflect the sort of anemic GDP growth environment that we've been all operating in. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the additional color. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I wonder if you can give a little bit of color on, it looked like the percent of properties \u2013 I think this is just Legacy-Marriott properties -- paying incentive management fees was down year-over-year. I wonder if you could give a little bit of color around that. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Right. Overall, we've got Legacy and Marriott. Just a couple interesting facts for you is that, in general, the percentage of hotels earning incentive fee for Starwood is slightly higher than Marriott given their international exposure. For us, it's actually down year-over-year only barely, only by one percentage point difference. So it's not really anything meaningful. And really is again reflection of certain markets experience for RevPAR. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then I wonder if you can give a little more color around the cut in the CapEx budget just for the Legacy-Marriott properties since three months ago, down by about $125 million. So it's a pretty significant percent of the full year budget that changed in the last three months, if you could give a little color. Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. As you know as we begin a year, we have a range of projects that we're looking at. Overwhelmingly, they're identified. And what happens as we move through the year, you're looking at the pace of those deals and, in general, I would say it's just that the deals continue to move forward, but they've been pushed out a little bit. So I don't think it's a reflection of deals dropping away, but more that they're taking a bit longer to put together. It ties in with what you're hearing in the lending environment that lenders are at the margin a bit more cautious. And as we're looking at, in some cases, putting in mezzanine loans, they're taking a bit longer to put the deals together. But they continue to be in our pipeline and we look forward to doing them as we move forward. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Morning, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: How are you? Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. I'm great. Thank you very much. The owned and lease segment was particularly strong. It's been strong all year. Can you talk about the components of that? And as you look into 2017, what would you expect to remain strong and what's going to face a tough comp? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So, hi, Harry. Thanks very much. So a couple things. I think when you look overall, let's first talk a little bit about Legacy-Marriott. Legacy-Marriott had strong owned, lease performance for its owned, leased hotels and then particularly strong performance on the branding fee side where we've had meaningful growth year-over-year compared to 2015. As you go into 2017, we're just in the process of putting our budget together now. So we wouldn't really be able to comment on anything specifically. But as you look at kind of tough comps across the board, again, we're continuing to look for our owned/leased portfolios to do well. And for the branding fees to continue, we've got a great pipeline of projects to continue to do well. I think the part I would point out is the owned/leased portfolio on the Starwood side, we clearly are seeing the impact of their sold hotels. So as you look at that going forward, you would see the owned/leased profits related to that that would kind of, on a year-over-year basis from 2017 to 2016, decline. And then you've probably got a couple one-off, like the Olympics in 2016, but again, the biggest impact, I think, will be the change in owned hotels on Starwood side. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. And just moving to the second question, I was really interested and may have missed something in \u2013 has there been a change in the way that you calculate your leverage ratio by incorporating or moving to EBITDAR? The reason I ask is that, is that part of the reason why you've achieved your target leverage ratio? And I'm guessing that the rating agencies are fine with it. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, so no change. No change in the way that we construct the ratio. As I pointed out in my comment, there were some changes relative to the calculation that we gave you a number of months ago based on better information. So whether it was the fact that you had better performance, particularly in Starwood's owned/leased portfolio where I talked about them being able to produce $180 million to $190 million of EBITDAR in 2016, to better information on the lease adjustment, for example, that's in addition to the debt in your calculation of total adjusted debt for your leverage ratio. So it really is better information than it is a change in the actual way, the methodology that we use in the calculation. And as I talked about in my comments, it kind of falls across a number of categories, including those items, and frankly, more cash. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So all systems go with respect to share repurchase then over the next even three months? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: (40:20). Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. So not to push, because I know you've all worked very hard, but it does look like you're well on your way to achieving your synergy goals. So wondering if there's any chance on surpassing those on the cost side. And I know it's early, but can you give us any color of maybe some early wins you might be having on the revenue side? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think the $250 million that we've talked about for G&A savings is still your -- the right target. It's certainly the target we're managing against. That is not a conservative external target which looks different from the target that we've got internally. And so, I would continue to look at that. To state the obvious, with eight days only of Starwood in Q3, I think it's difficult for you \u2013 for us, let alone you, to conclude how much of that $250 million we've achieved so far. But we're getting underway. We're getting underway very quickly. And as you can tell from our preliminary comments, we're really trying to set up the organization as quickly as we possibly can so that the change to people is behind us and so that people can be looking forward. And so we'll move at that. I think just to state the obvious, 2017 will be a bit messy because we'll have transaction and transition costs that will help you understand as each quarter is reported. They're a bit difficult, really, honestly, for us to predict by quarter at this point in time. But we remain optimistic by the time that we get towards sort of 12 months from closing, the lion's share of that $250 million, at least from a run-rate basis should have been achieved. We can't tell you sitting here today that we know for certain that every final dollar of that will be achieved by 12/31/17. I suspect there could be some areas where we're running duplicate systems or something else that creates some costs to slop into 2018, but we'll be very close. And to the extent we don't achieve the year-end, we'll, I think, get it fairly quickly in 2018. I think in terms of synergies for the hotels, both top line and bottom line, we talked obviously about the loyalty program. I think the early response from our customers about linking those programs and matching status is very comforting and that is exactly the kind of response we want and expect. It will hopefully drive larger share of wallet for us with an even larger loyalty community. And obviously, that's what we're focused on. And then on the cost side, we obviously talked about procurement. We talked about OTA commissions, but we're looking at essentially every relationship that the two companies have, whether they be about cost of systems that are proprietary to us, or third-party contracts. We're trying to make sure we deliver using the economies of scale that we've got and think that we can deliver top and bottom line improvements for our hotel owners in both portfolios. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then when you think about your unit growth going forward and you gave us some, or I guess maybe gave us some guidance, or one of you did, at the beginning of your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering, are you seeing an invigorated interest in the Starwood brands? And as you now market a consolidated portfolio to your owner and developer base, I'm just wondering, could there be upside to your unit growth forecast? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, the openings obviously are overwhelmingly driven by deals that we've already signed. Maybe even (44:05). Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I guess I was talking more about your pipeline. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, pipeline will be interesting. I think we are very optimistic that brands like Aloft and Element, which are very interesting from a customer perspective and I think have been something that the franchisee community particularly in the United States has looked at and been interested in. We have already seen that there is a strong appetite to grow those brands. I think Starwood saw that even before we closed the transaction with significant increase in the signings for those brands in the United States and we'll focus on those. We'll continue to make sure that we refine them without changing the kind of customer idea that they've got and we think we'll see growth of those brands accelerate quite significantly. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Helpful. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Patrick. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'd like to dig in a little bit more into the falloff of the group pace. Specifically, falling from 7% to 2%, what was it with the composition? Was it the occupancy or the rate or perhaps both that had really tailed-off in there? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, one thing we should specify is, we're comparing apples to oranges here just a little bit. The 7% is Legacy-Marriott. The 2% is the combined company. And we probably should have helped you a little bit better with that, I suppose, in the release that we put out. I think if you look at simply Legacy-Marriott, it's more like a decline from 7% to 4%. Now that's still a decline and it's still a decline of three points. So let's not use those statistics in a way that suggests your question isn't still relevant. I think the bulk of the impact is in volume. In other words, no, it's not rate. And it's simply this relative caution about near-term commitments. And, again, it would simply be repeating what we said a few months ago, but that is really mostly a corporate story, mostly near-term caution that does not seem to be impacting the kind of commitments they make longer term. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So Starwood came in with a sort of a weaker growth rate versus your Legacy. And I may have missed it. Did you give out statistics on 2018 for group pace at this point? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: All we said was that the bookings in Q3 for all future periods were up about 8% or 9% compared to what we booked in Q3 of 2015 for all future periods, which is positive. The 2018 numbers are up high single-digits, very high single-digits. I don't think they're quite 10%, but I think they're very close. And Laura will keep me honest here and make sure that we know which portfolio we're talking about. Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.: Legacy-Marriott for 2018 is up about 9%. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Legacy-Marriott. Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. That's it. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the deal close. So my first question is on the fee growth that you guys experienced and the outlook for the fourth quarter. So on a pro forma basis, I think the commentary was you're looking for 1% to 2% growth, which is probably a little lower than what we were looking for. Leeny, I know you broke out a few items that were headwinds in that number, but I was wondering could you give us a little bit more clarity or quantification on some of those and specifically the reversal on the incentive management fees? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. I think at this point, we wouldn't get into specific numbers, but I think you could see high single millions in terms of year-over-year, in terms of the delta, in terms of what kind of you're looking at across the board from the two companies having to suffer from everything from the Middle East to what was a change in FX and the impact of RevPAR going forward. So I think it's overwhelmingly incentive fees. And base and franchise are going to look a lot more normal relative to the growth in units and the growth in RevPAR. There are a few contract changes here and there that could impact the difference between franchise and managed, per se, but overall when you look at base and franchise, they're going to look very much in line with what goes on with RevPAR and unit growth. It's really incentive fees where you're going to see this combination of effects. The other thing, again, year-over-year, when you kind of adjust and look for full year, I think that is important to look at because you've got some quarter to quarter variations that affect this that when you look at the full year 2016 to 2015 on a combined legacy basis, you'll get something that looks much more like the mid single digits which you would expect overall from the portfolio given the RevPAR and unit growth. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And then maybe we can take that forward as we think about next year and probably again thinking about the overall, but maybe the IMF in particular. As you think about the RevPAR outlook that you provided, and I know you don't want to get into giving specific guidance this early on, but just directionally is it possible for IMFs to be positive next year in an environment where RevPAR is only growing with the outlook that you provided 0 to 2% and we're starting to see house profit margins probably peaking or starting to erode a little bit? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So a couple of comments. First of all, clearly next year, with the kind of RevPAR that we've outlined, we would be thrilled to end up with flat margins. We have done an incredible job with margins in the RevPAR environment that we've had this year. And perhaps in some respects, you could argue that we've gotten margin that now we will be happy to keep in terms of the margin improvement. So, I think on that standpoint, I wouldn't look to see higher IMFs as a result of any margin improvement with essentially what is a pretty low RevPAR environment. Now, we would expect to have unit growth and we expect to have unit growth internationally, which is going to obviously help our IMFs given the construct of our contracts there. Where it is tough to predict is this issue of where. For example, when you look at the Middle East this particular quarter that we're looking at, in Q4, you clearly see the dramatic impact of lower RevPAR on our IMF as we go into Q4. So I think that's where we need to get into the details on our budgeting process to look at the tradeoff between unit growth, internationally, as well as RevPAR, as well as then the performance of specific markets and what happens to their IMFs. So it's possible, but certainly too soon to tell at this point. Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.: Shaun, you should also remember that for Marriott legacy in 2015, we earned about half of our incentive fees outside the U.S. but combined with Starwood now, we're probably at about two-thirds of our incentive fees come from outside the U.S. So we're a more international company than we were in the past. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hello, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, folks. Good morning. Just, first question for Leeny. I was just trying to get my arms around the prospect of any kind of significant investment you see in technology going forward. And now that you've had some time with Starwood systems, can you talk about where you are at with just integrating all the major technology systems, reservations, accounting and what not so it's efficient for employees but also from a seamless consumer experience, whether it's mobile apps or the ability to do digital key and what not. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. You've definitely outlined our next 18 months. We are heavily involved in every single one of the systems that you described. I think you can start at the easy place, which is thinking about the hotels, and actually the way that they operate. And we are looking at putting them all onto the same back office system that we have at the Marriott Hotels. And that's a process that we'll be getting into absolutely as soon as we can. As we look at the reservations and the loyalty platforms, clearly there is a massive amount of work to be done. And it also, we need to take into consideration our relationships with our credit card and timeshare partners, and a lot of technology work in looking at what exactly it will take. So we can't give you a specific timeframe yet on the exact timing. But certainly moving in that direction. And as far as the fundamental systems of everything from company payroll and the way the hotels work, we are moving so that well into 2017 we will have everybody on the same system. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's useful. And maybe for Arne, there's been no shortage of ink spilled about the need for 30 plus brands. I think that question probably comes up just because of the subtlety of differences in pricing and positioning and the argument that every brand adds some degree of marginal cost. I guess in that regard, can you maybe talk about the incremental cost of operating another brand? And is it your longer-term plan maybe to provide more differentiation between brands so that (54:34) focus? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. We've said a couple of things here that are sort of obvious. I think if we had not merged with Starwood, would we be trying to build 30 brands from scratch? I think the answer is probably not. At the same time, having done this deal, the 30 brands all exist. They all have substantial capital that has been invested in them, particularly by the hotel owners who have made deliberate bets about which flag they put on their hotels. And we don't have the power to, nor the desire to, try and convince them that those bets have not been good bets. I think the other thing that's really important to recognize here is the biggest expense from a brand perspective, in theory, is about marketing the brands. And, obviously, that's the most expensive when each brand has to be marketed on its own. And in that context, you would want as much definition as you could have between brands. And it would still be expensive to go out and market each one alone. I think in many respects that's no longer our model, if it ever was. I think the principal model today is we go to market through our loyalty platform, through our dot com site, through our app. And those things allow us to essentially market a portfolio and offer through that portfolio an incredible range of choice to our customers, which drives, actually, conversion from looking to booking that much higher and makes the economics of each brand better, not weaker. And so you put all that together, and I think that's why we conclude that we're going to keep these brands and we're going to continue to grow them. I don't really think that there are material incremental costs to having a brand given that that's the business model that we have. Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: I just wanted to follow up a little bit about your outlook for 2017. You talked about corporate negotiated rates being up in the mid single digits. Can you give us any color how those conversations are progressing with some of your biggest corporate clients? Do you expect volumes to tick up? How are they thinking about things? Obviously, rate's a component. But you guys, obviously, want to try to lock in as much demand as possible as well. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, we said in the prepared remarks that we would increase, we thought, the volume of special corporate business that we brought in. And at the same time we said for like-for-like accounts we should see mid single digit growth. I can't tell you. I'm not sure we know yet what the average rate for the larger portfolio of special corporate compared to last year's special corporate volume will look like. In other words, are the new clients we're adding at the same rates? Or are they at higher rates because they're smaller? Are they in different markets? All those things will have to get worked out. We're still a bit early. I mean, we have generally made proposals to every one of our significant special corporate customers, and often we've heard back from them, so we've got some to and fro, but by and large, those negotiations have not been completed. And we think it's based on the early data we've got that we talk about the mid-single-digit increase on like-for-like accounts. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: No. That's helpful. And then I guess \u2013 and obviously, I'm not asking you to negotiate on the phone here. I'm just curious, as you guys are reaching out to some of your corporate clients, are you at a stage with RevPAR growth kind of in this low single-digit range to be willing to sacrifice rate for some type of volume guarantee? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, let me answer it this way maybe, and which I think can give you some comfort. While RevPAR growth rates have declined a bit, obviously, the occupancies of our hotels remain very high, particularly on nights and in markets where business travel is significant. So if you look not at full week occupancy, but you look at Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights, we're running chock-a-block, and that means even in a 0% to 2% RevPAR environment, we're not without some position in discussions with our customers to make sure that we're being fairly compensated for that occupancy, which is in relatively short supply. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just kind of one last thing that's a little bit bigger picture. Anything over the past 10 months that you learned associated with the Starwood transaction that you think will help you guys going forward that you didn't know going in? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: There's \u2013 I'm sure we can put down a long, long list of things. But I \u2013 let's keep it maybe a little bit in general. And maybe we can even back up a little bit. When we were in the summertime with significant news about whether we'd get approval and how long it was taking, one of the New York tabloids ran a story suggesting that we had buyer's remorse and maybe didn't really want to close the deal. That story had zero factual support, absolutely zero factual support. We never lost any enthusiasm for completing this transaction, and now six weeks from close, seven weeks from close, I guess, this Friday, we are enthusiastic as ever. And I think when you look at the report that we issued last night and we've been talking about this morning, what we see is a combined company with leverage levels already back to the levels that we target long-term with an enormous ability to produce cash, and we'll be back in the market with that cash buying back our stock. But we also see and we look at the third quarter EPS growth results and it's Legacy-Marriott because that's the only sort of apples-to-apples comparison we can do, but you're in a high teens percentage growth year-over-year. And we think the model's working extraordinarily well. We think the strength of the Starwood brands and the Starwood loyalty program have continued to impress us. And we should see that that development engine and the share of wallet we are enjoying from our customers should continue to expand. So we are very pumped up and eager to go. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot for the color, Arne. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just following up on those previous comments about buy-back, can you set some level of kind of market expectations for the level of buy-back in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. I would \u2013 something in the couple hundred million dollars ballpark is not an unreasonable area of expectation. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Then just a bigger picture question. You still have \u2013 you have these Starwood assets you're looking to sell. Can you just talk about your view on the current state of the transaction market? Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. As Arne talked about in his comments, clearly, there is some, just in general overall in the transaction market, there is some concern about the slow pace of economic growth. However, I think at the end of the day, what we see is that for brands that are very strong and in markets where there is demonstrated performance that deals can absolutely continue to be done. And so from that perspective, as I described, we've got, call it 70% of the assets in the U.S. and I would expect those to be sold relatively sooner than necessarily the ones in Latin America, and that for \u2013 in general for those hotels that they are strong assets and we're already engaged in discussions on a number of them and seen good strong interest. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, David. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Congratulations on your closing and I, as you know, I'm an avid reader of the tabloids. I did want to just follow-up on Harry's issue from earlier. As I look at what the debt balances are and I know, Leeny, you made some comments about what the debt balances were that you assumed at the closing. And then if I just, really from a high level, look at the debt balances and cash that you gave us relative to the leverage comment, I'll admit I'm finding a bit of a disconnect. How much debt did Starwood pay down, I suppose, is really the question? How much debt did you actually assume from them? And I would imagine all this will be ironed out when a Q gets filed. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Right. So you'll see the Q tomorrow and it'll be a little bit easier to take you through it in the detail. But just in broad terms, they did pay down roughly $800 million in debt prior to the transaction closing. So when you look at what we described, we've got basically the $8.8 billion of debt that we've got at the end of Q3 and we've also got $1.1 billion of cash. Okay? So kind of in and of itself you've got the scenario that we are in a better situation relative to the debt than we had expected prior. I think the other thing I would point out is that earlier when we were looking we had less comfort about knowing the details around their cash globally. And as a result of doing the entity restructuring that I described earlier, we are comfortable that we are going be able to use all of the debt \u2013 all the cash balances that we don't need to run our business to repay debt and use for general corporate purposes over the near term. And I think that probably when you compare it to where we were a number of months ago, we were at the margin a bit more cautious about knowing the details about what we would be able to do from a cash perspective. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Right. Is there some meaningful adjustment in there for bank purposes with respect to the leverage? In other words, if Starwood has a capital lease, is that something that gets added back or deducted from your debt balance, or is there any meaningful chunk in there we should consider? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Right. There's kind of a classic calculation where you take an NPV of the lease payment. And that, again, we've got more refined information on knowing what their required lease payments are over the next number of years as compared to what we knew six months ago. And there again, I think we benefited a bit from being more conservative in our estimation about the length, the size, the nature of some of those leases where we got some benefit probably not \u2013 certainly not a whole tenth of -- 10 basis points, but certainly some benefit there. I think the three biggest ones, as we described before, the three biggest changes to the 40 basis point improvement was as we described : just more cash overall, Being able to feel comfortable about our access to that cash; The level of EBITDAR which is refined for both their higher owned/lease performance and frankly the combination of the two companies combined performance on the latest trailing 12 months; And then the third that you were able to look at the actual amounts of cash that you have on hand. David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Got it. Okay. Thanks for your answers. I appreciate it. Good luck. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Good morning, congratulations on the transaction. Arne, with the deal done but obviously you got your hands full on the integration. But are you able to look at other industry issues like short-term cancellations and start to dedicate more resources, or is that just too risky to the new combined loyalty program? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, we talked about this just a little bit in response to one of the other questions that came in. And I don't want to go further than we're prepared to go. But I think the general point here is that the transaction was attractive to us, compelling to us, in significant part because of what we think we can do with the loyalty programs. And those loyalty programs, managed well, should allow us to drive that much more of our business directly from our most loyal members, which is the cheapest business for us to book because it comes and books to us to directly. And to \u2013 you don't do that just by being nice and good looking. You've got to do that by delivering real value to those customers because they're not going to be loyal to us unless it's in their interest to be loyal. And so we're working through those things. They include significant work around systems and the like that we use to have our relationship with them but also, how do we continue to make sure we're delivering value to them. And so, free Wi-Fi and member rates and mobile check-in and keyless entry and points, these are already things which are really available to our loyalty members, but not to other customers. And we'll continue to make sure that we're managing that in a way that hopefully will give us good protection against whatever sort of either threatening intermediaries or newfangled ideas that come out that are seeking to upend that relationship. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. And the follow-up. Arne, as you look at your franchise applications and you kind of use all your years in the industry as a guide, where do you think \u2013 what year do you think U.S. supply growth peaks, the cycle? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Oh, it's a good question. I just haven't thought precisely about that question. Obviously, a big part of it depends on what happens to GDP growth. So if GDP bumps along at 1%-ish in the U.S. for the next year or two, I suspect we'll see more hotels open than are signed to the pipeline for the industry. Obviously, the trick here is for a company like ours to do better than the industry does and we'll continue to be focused on that. But I think the \u2013 in that kind of operating environment, we'll probably see most of the hotels that are in the pipeline in the industry open, ultimately, but the pipeline shrink in its entirety, which I would guess would mean that 2018 maybe is peak in the U.S. Obviously, if you've got a stronger GDP environment than that, more projects will be started. And at some point you'll hit a \u2013 it'll hit a place where the total pipeline sort of stays at the same kind of level or conceivably it could grow, in which case peak supply growth could be later than that. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. That's it. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Take that for what it is, which is a off-the-cuff answer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, there. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Just a quick follow up on the loyalty program question, as a lot of my questions have already been answered. Now that you've gotten some time to take a look at some of the details within Starwood's loyalty program and unpack some of the differences and how they see the world and see customer value and all those sorts of things, where \u2013 if you had to pick two or three places in that context, where do you see the most opportunity to maximize the economics of the combined program eventually? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, and I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're getting at, but one obvious place where we think we have upside in terms of share of wallet, let's use a loyal SPG member, maybe an Elite member who, far too often in the past would find themselves in markets in which Starwood had no product. Think about particularly markets in which select serve hotels are much more prominent than full-service hotels. Starwood had obviously some Four Points, a few Alofts and precious few Elements. But you compare the number of those three brands that Starwood had across the United States with what Marriott had in Courtyard and SpringHill Suites and Residence Inn and Fairfield and the like, and there are thousands more places for those customers to stay with us now broadly defined as the new Marriott. And as a consequence, we should drive more share. And with that greater distribution, the loyalty program itself becomes more powerful. Obviously, one of the things that customers look for is what are the benefits I get in terms of suite upgrades or bonus points or access to lounges or other things. But also can I stay within that network regularly when I travel so that I can earn the kind of status and earn the number of points that I need in order to really get the free vacations or to get the other things that I want to get with those points? And so the breadth of distribution by itself is going to be hugely powerful in driving this. And then we've got to make sure that we are again continuing to deliver the right kind of value to the customers. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Right. That's very helpful. Is there anything in terms of the sort of the (1:13:49) level of generosity of the rewards in either program that you think is an opportunity or a deficiency versus prior? Anything like that? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: There are dozens of differences between the programs. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Right. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: And it'd be dangerous to focus on any one, but I'll give you one little peek under the hood. When we announced the deal in November of 2015, because Marriott was the acquirer, SPG members particularly were a bit nervous about, okay, what is Marriott going to do to the benefits that we like. And we of course tried to be reassuring in the words that we used. In a cynical era, I think people are not inclined necessarily to believe everything that's said. And so one of the things we did is with the Marriott Reward program in second quarter, if I remember right, we started doing suite upgrades and late checkout. And that was actually a powerful communication to the SPG members that actually Marriott is paying attention to what Starwood has provided to some for some period of time, and that's a reassuring sign. But we'll look at suite upgrades and redemption rules and all these other aspects over the course of the next few years and try and do right by our customers and obviously do right by the program. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. Just one for me just regarding the third quarter result. So on the North American limited service side of things, the performance for both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood and actually the industry from what we've seen from STR, was a little weaker than expected, yet we continue to hear that the corporate leisure customer is strong. So could you just kind of help us flush out some of the underperformance in the quarter? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I think the \u2013 it's interesting, if you look at our schedules, you see a bit of a difference between the managed portfolio and the franchise portfolio too. But if you look at the portfolio as a whole, the full-service hotels get disproportionate benefit from group business, and group business is stronger than corporate transient, particularly today. The managed Select-Service portfolio also skews, not as much as the full service hotels, but skews a little bit more towards group than the franchised Select-Service portfolio does. And so that's helpful, too. And I think the third thing is around geographic distribution. So when you look at Select-Service, when you look at the franchise portfolio, when you look at a lot of industry data, Select-Service hotels can skew more towards oil and gas markets. Think about markets that nobody had ever heard of before and a couple of years ago like Williston, North Dakota, and environs where you've got all this oil work that's happening out there. Select-Service hotels exploded onto the scene. There's not a single full service hotel in the whole area basically. And it's maybe a little less dramatic in markets like Houston, but you look across Texas, you look across many of these markets and you'll see that those hotels are competing in on average tougher markets, again, without the benefit of group. And that would be the bulk of the explanation. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Arne. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks for the question. Good morning. Had a quick question about Starwood's pipeline actually. I know there's a like-for-like comparison issue here, but it does appear that the pipeline may have stalled out a bit this quarter. I was wondering if there's anything idiosyncratic at play there worth pointing out? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, no. There's really not. So a couple of comments overall. Always looking quarter to quarter can make for some interesting comparisons because a lot can go on one to the other. So, I think you will find, in general year-over-year, you'll find some really strong growth across both portfolios and perhaps in some respects a better measure of how they're doing. At the same time, it clearly, when we look at it we are trying to make sure that we are taking into consideration exactly what is going on with either delayed deals or deals that are falling off. And so from that standpoint, we kind of trued it up. I think you'll find it's such a small difference when you look at how the two companies put their pipelines together that it's not anything particularly meaningful. We are excited about the level of interest. We've done a bunch of deals even since we've closed on the transaction and look forward to continuing to watch it grow. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's really helpful. Thanks. And just a quick follow up on net room growth expectations for next year. I know you mentioned in the past that you do expect to prune \u2013 I don't know if that's the right word \u2013 certain Sheraton properties that might have been under-performing in the past. Is that reflected within your forward room guidance? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Our best guess is 6% net growth next year and that's net of \u2013 best information we have on deletions as well. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Can you help me think about the P&L impact that is lost from selling $1.5 billion in assets? So, I guess, this year I think you're doing around $620 million of gross income on the owned/leased line. What does that look like after $1.5 billion in asset sales? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Are you talking on the revenue line or on the owned/lease net line? Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : The owned/lease net line. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. At this point, we're really not in a position to get super detailed. I think the easiest way to describe it is what we talked about from a EBITDA perspective, which is the $180 million to $190 million of EBITDA associated with Starwood's owned hotels. We also did talk about the fact that our depreciation and amortization estimates associated with the purchase of Starwood have declined relative to the earlier description. And part of that, I'd say roughly half of that, was associated with moving several of those hotels into the assets held for sale category which is, again, going to impact D&A. But it's not going to impact the owned hotels net. So specific numbers we'll be able to talk more about in February. I think for now, the EBITDA is probably the easier way to think about it. Obviously when we sell these hotels we'll end up with a great stream of management fees in managing the hotels. So it's one thing to keep in mind is that, although there is EBITDA that goes to the buyer of these assets, we're going to continue to have a great stream of earnings from them. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I'd just add \u2013 let me add one thing to this. It will vary a little bit by market around the world. Obviously, the U.S. assets are easiest to predict, but we've got some owned assets in other markets around the world. On average, though, you would expect that the sales prices we received should be at least at the EBITDA level if not higher that the company is trading at. And so the transaction should be accretive from an EBITDA perspective. And when you look at it from an earnings perspective after depreciation associated with owned hotels, they should be significantly accretive from an earnings perspective. Now, again, that's on average. We're not saying necessarily that in a higher cap rate market where the risk profile is actually quite different that we will necessarily always get proceeds which are higher than our EBITDA multiple. But I think generally across the average we should see this is accretive to the P&L and the balance sheet of the company. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, Arne, I just want to go back to your loyalty comments because Hyatt said last week that they've effectively converted 30,000 SPG members over to their loyalty program. And I know that's a small number in the grand scheme of things, but have you seen any tangible evidence of SPG members leaving presumably out of fear of just their points being diluted? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I don't think that's what they said. I think what they said last week was that they had offered to match Elite status to 30,000 SPG or SPG and Marriott Reward members. That doesn't mean they've converted them to be loyal to that company. Those folks are undoubtedly still members of our program and we're not giving up on them. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Joe Greff. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey Joe. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: What did we do to get you last in line? Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I don't know. I was going to ask you the same question. I could have voted four times. Just with regard to your comments on 2017 with the 6% net room growth. Given your comments about certain delays today, and I think you also mentioned it anecdotally the last quarter, is that rooms growth disproportionately weighted to the second half of the year? And then when we look at your totality of comments today and think about next year, and we look at fee growth, are we looking at fee growth that maybe the best case scenario or the most optimistic scenario is that fee growth approximates net unit growth? Or do you think we can get fee growth in excess of net rooms growth? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, okay. So I think on both those questions we should start by warning you we don't have a budget for next year. So we do have in this headquarters building someplace, I'm sure, a detailed schedule of when we think hotels are going to open. But we're not rolling that up necessarily in a way that's very digestible by quarter. Having said that, I would think to the earlier question about when supply growth will peak. I suspect we are continuing to see, on average, that we're opening more next year than this year. And we're probably opening more in 2018 than in 2017, which would suggest that there will be some back-end skewing to next year. I don't think it will be profound though. Obviously, we've opened a lot of hotels this year. We've missed a little bit this year, and those are slipping into 2017. But they'll be in early 2017. And so, I think the year as a whole should be fairly robust in terms of its openings. But again, I'd suspect fourth quarter will have more than the first quarter did, simply because we continue to ramp. On fee growth, obviously the two biggest inputs to the year-over-year fee growth is unit growth and RevPAR. And with 6% unit growth and 0% to 2% RevPAR growth, both can drive an increase in the top line, although it's obvious that the rooms growth will drive more top line growth than the rev growth, unless we're wildly conservative in that 0% to 2% number. The next piece of that is what happens with incentive fees. And I think there you end up in a 0% to 2% market with the real need to say, okay, what's happening in the high incentive fee markets for the company like New York, like Washington, like London and other markets around the world. And until we do the budgets, that's going to be a hard thing to give you much guidance on. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. I think we have exhausted all of you. But we thank you very much for your keen attention this morning. We wish you all, again, a happy election day. Get out and vote. And then get on the road and come stay with us. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will open the call for questions. It is now my pleasure to hand our program over to Mr. Arne Sorensen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Marriott International. Sir, the floor is yours. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Before we get started, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, February 16, 2017, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. Before jumping into our results and guidance, let me acknowledge the obvious. We've thrown a great deal of information at you in our press release and in the Form 8-K we filed late yesterday. Collectively, we are challenged by two things; first, the need to bring two companies together and create a baseline for all of us to have, to compare our guidance and then results against the past. Second, in the first year or so, we will have a number of incomparable or transitional matters, especially around integration costs and the speed with which we capture the G&A and other synergies post-merger. These factors make 2017 a bit noisy. We will do everything we can to help you understand the underlying results and to help you build your models. Thank you for your patience as we work through this together. We were very pleased with our performance in 2016. We purchased Starwood Hotels & Resorts on September 23, linked our loyalty programs, Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and Starwood Preferred Guest on the same day, and immediately began the work to realize synergies in the combination. On a combined basis, we grew systemwide rooms by more than 5% net in 2016, increased worldwide constant dollar RevPAR by 2%, and increased EPS by 16%. We are also excited about our prospects for 2017. We expect to grow rooms by 6% net, and we anticipate returning $1.5 billion to $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the year with likely upside from asset sales. Our RevPAR and unit growth guidance implies an impressive 15% to 20% EPS growth in 2017 compared to combined 2016 results. So, let's talk about the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter North American systemwide RevPAR rose 1.1%, just above guidance. RevPAR growth was strong in Washington, Atlanta, Toronto and Montr\u00e9al. Leisure business remained healthy across the system, particularly in our luxury brands. Overall, North American Retail transient RevPAR rose 5% in the quarter. For our corporate customers, sales to Legacy-Marriott's 300 largest corporate customers in North America rose 1%. You may recall, sales to these customers were flat in the third quarter, while sales to Energy and Financial customers continued to weaken, we were pleased that our sales to manufacturers strengthened, increasing 4% in the fourth quarter. Group RevPAR at North American hotels declined 1% in the fourth quarter. Much of this was due to the calendar comparison as the shift in Jewish holidays pushed group business into the third quarter. Gross profit margins for company-operated hotels in North America increased an impressive 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, despite company-operated RevPAR being up only one-half of 1%. Looking ahead to 2017, we continue to expect a steady-as-she-goes economy in North America. For the 2017 full year, North America group revenue pace for company-operated full-service hotels across the combined portfolio is currently up about 3%. Roughly 80% of special corporate business for 2017 is already priced at a low-single digit rate increase for comparable customers, but we are also signing up more accounts. We continue to aggressively market to leisure guests, and we're adding contract business at attractive rates. At the same time, we continue to see modest levels of corporate transient demand and somewhat hesitant short-term group bookings. Therefore, for 2017, we still expect North America RevPAR for the combined portfolio will be flat to up 2%. The obvious first question, of course, is do we feel more optimistic about 2017 than we did a quarter ago? The short answer is yes. There is considerable data that shows broad expectations for stronger GDP growth in 2017. We have also completed our budget since our last quarterly call, giving us greater confidence in our range than we had before. A somewhat longer answer to the question starts with our data. Looking at group booking trends and special corporate negotiations, and of course at Marriott and industry RevPAR data, we do not yet have clear enough proof that GDP is in fact growing at a higher rate, or that the greater prevailing optimism is impacting our business. For this reason, we have left our guidance for North American RevPAR at 0% to 2% for 2017, consistent with the budgets that roll up from our properties. Outside North America, RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America region declined 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting weak economic conditions in much of the region, and continued anxiety about the Zika virus in the Caribbean. For 2017, we are modeling a low-single digit percent increase in RevPAR in the region. We expect strong economic growth in Mexico, modest economic growth in Brazil and improvement in the Zika situation in the Caribbean. In the Middle East and Africa region, fourth quarter RevPAR declined 1%, constrained by a tough oil market, lower government spending, new hotel supply and concerns about political unrest, offset a bit by stronger results in South Africa and Cairo. For 2017, we are modeling flattish RevPAR growth for that total region. Fourth quarter RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased 1%. RevPAR was strong in India, Shanghai, and Malaysia while RevPAR was weaker in Hong Kong, Macau, and tertiary China markets. For 2017, we expect our Asia-Pacific region should see strength in India, Indonesia, Thailand, and Australia, more than offsetting weakness in the Macau and South China markets, yielding a RevPAR increase at a low- to mid-single digit rate. And finally, for Europe, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 2% with strength in the UK, Germany, Spain and Russia, somewhat offset by continued weakness in Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul. For 2017 we expect a low single-digit RevPAR growth with stronger results expected in southern Europe and easier comparisons in Paris and Brussels. All-in-all we expect worldwide systemwide RevPAR will increase 0.5% to 2.5% in 2017, a bit more bullish than our guidance in November. Owners and franchisees are pleased with the performance of our brands and are developing more hotels under our flags. New owner and franchisee signings last year totaled 136,000 rooms, twice the level of gross room openings, taking our development pipeline to more than 420,000 rooms. If you look at deal approvals instead of signings, our 2016 results included almost 150,000 rooms. Congratulations to Tony Capuano and our development team around the world. At year end, the combined Marriott and Starwood brand portfolios accounted for just 14% of all industry rooms opened in North America. Yet according to STR, we had an industry-leading 36% of rooms under construction in North America and 22% of rooms under construction worldwide. Financing for new construction remain tight and construction costs are increasing. While STR data for 2016 revealed a 33% increase in U.S. industry rooms under construction, the data also show only a 10% increase in rooms in final planning. By the way, we have nearly a 40% share of those final planning rooms in the U.S. Developers are clearly favoring projects with strong brands. It's been 147 days since our acquisition of Starwood. Prior to the transaction completion, Marriott Rewards and Ritz-Carlton Rewards adopted several SPG firsts for Platinum members, including late check out, upgrades, and concierge services. At transaction closing, we immediately allowed guests to link their Marriott Rewards and Starwood Preferred Guest accounts. In September, we launched our 30-brand worldwide advertising campaign. You may have heard the ads, which we call You Are Here as you were awaiting the start of today's call. They are currently running in media markets around the world and can be viewed on Marriott's YouTube channel. In October, we announced an industry-first benefit for holders of our co-brand credit cards, allowing them to earn bonus points for stays at hotels across all 30 brands. Our owners and franchisees are hearing from us often, thanks to a robust communications platform established in November and we are hearing from them as well as many are participating in new owner-advisory boards. The first Starwood Hotel began to purchase goods and services for Marriott's procurement partner, Avendra, in December, and last month we rolled out our guest satisfaction tracking system, Guest Voice, to over 1,300 hotels. We also launched an innovation lab for our Aloft and Element brands at the American Lodging Industry Summit a few weeks ago to crowd-source real-time feedback on some of the exciting brand enhancements being considered. We expect to showcase these brands again at the NYU Lodging Conference in June. At the property level, we are leveraging Marriott contracts to reduce OTA and procurement costs for hotels. In addition, we are encouraging hotels to buy locally and in-season to further reduce costs and enhance quality. By the way, our procurement contracts also help new hotel development as lower prices for equipment and fixtures reduce the cost of new hotels too. In revenue management, we have identified opportunities to improve the mix of higher-rated business in many hotels. For the Element brand, we believe a greater focus on extended stay sales will improve both the top and the bottom line. In operations, we have identified opportunities for collaboration among our managed hotels, from negotiating more favorable service contracts for hotels located in proximity to each other to jointly chasing group leads. We also anticipate savings as more hotels participate in above-property shared service arrangements. In our hotel development organization, we've combined Marriott's deal philosophy with Starwood's great brands, which we believe will yield more secure and longer-term agreements as well as enhance relationships with owners and franchisees. And finally, we have seen significant investor interest in our owned hotels. We completed the sale of the San Francisco St. Regis in the fourth quarter and are encouraged with the progress of several other deals. We won't, however, declare victory or model them into our guidance until the deals close. All-in-all, we are pleased with the pace of integration. Our people are working very hard but they've made amazing progress. I'm incredibly proud of them. The underlying strategy of bringing these two companies together remains sound, and we are excited about the increasing benefits of the transaction for owners, franchisees, associates and of course, our shareholders. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny for a review of our financial results and some additional color on the first quarter and 2017 outlook. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you, Arne. Good morning. Given this is the first full quarter of combined Marriott and Starwood results, let me take a minute to describe our earnings release disclosures. Pages A-1 and A-2 of the earnings press release include GAAP reported results, including Starwood's results beginning only on September 23, 2016. Pages A-3 and A-4 reflect the combined Starwood and Marriott business performance in both years. Specifically, the presentation of adjusted results excludes merger-related costs while the presentation of combined financial results exclude merger-related costs and assume the Starwood acquisition and spinoff of Starwood's timeshare business occurred on January 1, 2015. Combined financial results also use the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities as of the actual closing date of the acquisition. We've also provided hotel RevPAR statistics on pages A-8 through A-11. These statistics are prepared on a combined comparable basis, including Marriott and Starwood brands for the quarter and the full year, although we've highlighted only the largest North American brands. Fourth quarter reported diluted earnings per share totaled $0.62. GAAP results were constrained by $136 million of pre-tax merger-related costs, including $55 million of severance and retention costs, $59 million of transition costs, and $22 million of transaction costs. Adjusting for these items, diluted EPS totaled $0.85, at the high end of our November 7th guidance. Compared to the midpoint of our guidance, we outperformed about $0.02 in fees, largely due to better-than-expected RevPAR growth and incentive fee performance; about $0.03 on the owned, leased and other line related both to better-than-expected owned hotel profits and stronger branding fees from our credit card business and residential sales; and about $0.01 on the G&A line due to lower administrative costs. All partially offset by about $0.04 on the tax line, largely due to a tax rate change in France and an unfavorable mix of earnings. Fee revenue totaled $713 million in the quarter compared to combined fee revenue of $688 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 4%. Fee revenue was $13 million higher than the midpoint of our November 7th expectations. RevPAR growth was at the high end of expectations for the quarter, and operations did a terrific job by increasing house profit margins by 30 basis points worldwide. Fourth quarter owned, leased, and other net of direct expenses totaled $169 million compared to combined results of $165 million in the 2015 quarter. The flattish year-over-year results reflect higher credit card and residential branding fees and strong results from owned and leased hotels, particularly the newly renovated Sheraton Centre Toronto and the Marriott Charlotte City Center, offset by lower termination fees and the impact of the sale of Starwood Hotels. We outperformed our November 7th guidance on this line by $16 million, due to better-than-expected results at owned and leased hotels, as well as better-than-expected branding fees. General and administrative expenses totaled $234 million in the quarter, $4 million better than our guidance and $50 million better than the prior-year combined amount. Compared to fourth quarter 2015 combined G&A, the 2016 fourth quarter benefited from general and administrative cost savings, an $8 million favorable legal settlement, and $4 million in net foreign-exchange gain. Depreciation and amortization totaled $71 million in the quarter compared to 2015 combined D&A of $81 million. The $10 million decline year-over-year was largely due to the impact of hotels that were sold or moved to assets held for sale during the year. To sum up the results, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $577 million meaningfully exceeded our guidance of $530 million to $555 million. On the tax line, the fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 35.6%. As I mentioned earlier, the rate was higher than the 32.5% expected largely due to an unfavorable mix of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions and the impact of a tax rate change in France. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, which excludes merger-related costs, totaled $756 million, an 11% increase over the prior-year combined amount. Full year 2016 combined adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $3 billion, 9% over the 2015 combined results. So let's talk a little bit more about 2017. In addition to our earnings release, we also filed an 8-K yesterday with combined information for our businesses by quarter for 2015 and 2016. It also includes combined RevPAR statistics by quarter for both years. The 8-K disclosures and the 2017 guidance presented in our earnings release reflect a slightly different income statement presentation than the 2016 actuals presented in yesterday's earnings release. In the 8-K and our 2017 outlook, we have re-classed credit card and residential branding fees, which totaled $210 million in 2016 from the owned, leased and other revenue line to the franchise fee line. We're making this change because we believe branding fees are more akin to franchise royalties than bottom line hotel profits in the owned, leased line. Incidentally, application and relicensing fees as well as timeshare fees were historically shown in franchise fees, and they will continue to be there, while termination fees will remain in our owned, leased and other line. For the full year 2017, we expect fee revenue will total $3.175 billion to $3.245 billion, reflecting roughly $35 million to $40 million of foreign-exchange headwinds and flattish incentive fees year-over-year. Fee revenue from application, relicensing, credit card, residential and timeshare totaled $350 million in 2016. Of this amount, roughly 49% was earned in our credit card business, 28% came from timeshare royalties, 13% came from relicensing and application fees, and 10% was earned from residential branding fees. On a combined basis, we expect these various fees will grow to roughly $400 million in 2017. These fees typically grow with increasing new hotel development, residential project sales, credit card spend and hotel real estate transaction activity. In 2017, owned, leased and other net of direct expenses should total $345 million to $360 million, compared to $426 million for combined results in 2016. We expect lower termination fees in 2017. This, along with the lost earning of hotels already sold should reduce our results by about $38 million in 2017. Year-over-year, we also expect the weak Brazil and New York City markets will further reduce our results by roughly $20 million. Our 2017 owned, leased expectations include $170 million to $175 million for the 14 legacy Starwood-owned hotels. We estimate that a 1 percentage point change in our worldwide systemwide RevPAR outlook in 2017, assuming it was evenly distributed, would be worth about $35 million in fees and roughly $8 million on the owned, leased line. Our 2016 G&A number isn't meaningful given the delays in closing the Starwood transaction and the significant number of positions that remained open during the year as a result. We've estimated a more normal combined G&A for 2016 of $1.080 billion, calculated by assuming a typical 4% growth rate over the combined 2015 G&A amount. We expect G&A in 2017 will total $895 million to $905 million, a savings of $175 million to $185 million over this normalized 2016 level with such savings to be relatively back-end loaded during the year as integration proceeds. We expect to demonstrate a run rate of $250 million of annual G&A synergies by mid-2018. We estimate depreciation and amortization will total roughly $280 million in 2017. Purchase accounting rules provide a timetable of up to one year from the date of acquisition to update allocations based on new information learned about the asset values as of the date of the acquisition. As we mentioned in our press release, we expect to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017. The amount of the windfall tax benefit will depend on the number of stock awards vested or exercised in the year, our stock price at that time, and the share price when such awards were granted. We have assumed the windfall tax benefit will add approximately $0.10 per share to our EPS in 2017 with all of it recognized in the first quarter. Our earnings guidance assumes a 2017 book tax rate of 30.8% or 32.7% excluding the windfall tax benefit. We expect our cash tax rate in 2017 to be roughly 28%, excluding the impact of asset sales and transition costs. All-in-all, we expect 2017 fully diluted EPS will total $3.79 to $3.97, an increase of 15% to 20% over 2016 combined EPS. We expect 2017 adjusted EBITDA will total $3.075 billion to $3.175 billion, up 3% to 6% over 2016 full year combined adjusted EBITDA. We estimate a one percentage point change in the value of the dollar, assuming it was evenly distributed among all currencies, would be worth about $10 million in EBITDA. Today, one half of international fee revenue is denominated in just five currencies, and we hedge about one-third of our exposure in these currencies. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investments and share repurchases. Investment spending could total $500 million to $700 million in 2017, including about $175 million in property maintenance spending and $100 million for systems and corporate CapEx. We repurchased 8 million shares for $573 million in 2016. For the full year 2017, share repurchases and dividends could total $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Successful asset sales could take our cash returns estimate higher. For the full year 2016, Marriott recycled capital totaling nearly $285 million from asset sales and note collections and prior to the acquisition, Starwood sold assets for $316 million. We continue to expect more than $1.5 billion in dispositions of Starwood-owned assets over the next 24 months, including the $175 million we received in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the sale of the San Francisco St. Regis. Our approach to selling owned assets reflects the importance of getting full value for the hotel, as well as a strong management agreement and property improvement plans where needed. While we do expect to sell some hotels in 2017, our earnings guidance does not assume we will sell any of these hotels. As Arne said, our balance sheet is in great shape. Excluding merger-related costs, our debt ratio at December 31 was at the low end of our targeted 3 to 3.25 times adjusted debt to combined adjusted EBITDAR credit standards. For the first quarter of 2017, we're modeling RevPAR growth of 1% to 3% in North America, 1% to 2% outside North America, and 1% to 3% worldwide. First quarter RevPAR will benefit from the January inauguration week in Washington, D.C. and the shifting Easter holiday. We expect fee revenue will total $740 million to $750 million in the first quarter. Fee revenue will face about $6 million in foreign exchange headwinds, a tough comparison to last year's leap year and a 10% decline in incentive fees largely due to the impact of renovations, recognition of deferred fees in prior year and timing. Combined fee revenue from application, relicensing fees, credit card fees, residential fees and timeshare totaled $88 million in the 2016 first quarter, and we expect such fees will be flat in the first quarter 2017, largely due to a spike in residential fees recognized in the 2016 first quarter. We expect owned, leased and other net of direct expenses will total $60 million to $70 million in the first quarter. Year-over-year, we expect $13 million of lower termination fees and $4 million in lower profits due to the previous sale of hotels. With the $0.10 benefit of the tax windfall, we estimate first quarter diluted EPS will total $0.87 to $0.91. We know that you're eager for more information about the combined company, and we hope you can attend our New York City Analyst Day on March 21. As you can tell, for now we feel very good about our brands, our business and our progress in integrating Starwood. Now, let's get to your questions. So that everyone gets a chance to participate, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator : Our first question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hi, guys. Unknown Speaker : Hi, Harry. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Harry. Unknown Speaker : Good morning, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Good morning. I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on the number of brands that you have that \u2013 ones that might benefit from some rationalization or consolidation? And if there are any, would that increase the management focus and clarity also for your owners? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thanks, Harry. Basically, the short answer is, we're going to keep them all. We do have a \u2013 it's obviously a big portfolio of brands. I think we would acknowledge that if we were starting with a plain piece of paper, we wouldn't necessarily start 30 brands. But having 30 brands that already have distribution with strong owner investment in hotels that carry those flags, and recognizing that our principal tool for going to market is the portfolio and the loyalty programs. We think offering more choices and in some respects more brands is a positive, not a negative. To state the obvious, we will, over time, work with owners and franchisees to crystallize each of the brand positionings as much as possible so that we draw distinctions between them, and we're very much underway with that including with our owners and franchisees. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Very good. And a follow-up on your comments about incentive management fees for 2017. I would've expected them to grow somewhat just given the number of managed hotels, particularly internationally, that you'd expect to open. Can you give us some thoughts about what might be holding the growth of incentive management fees back for this year? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. At the end of the day, Harry, we definitely will see some growth, but what you've also got is a bunch of things impacting going the other way. And FX is the biggest one, really, when you look at that, and could be as much as $15 million year-over-year. And then you add to that, we've got some renovations going on as well as the fact that terminations of some of those hotels also are going to impact year-over-year incentive fees. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Are the terminations \u2013 is that a trend that is worrisome? Maybe a little bit more color around that? And that'll be it for me. Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, no. Really not anything above the normal \u2013 kind of the normal trend. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Robin. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Just looking at the percent of your pipeline that's under construction, I think it was 38%. That's a little bit lower than either Marriott or Starwood sort of on a legacy basis, as you were usually sort of closer to 50%. I'm just curious if there's anything in particular that is making that look a little bit lower than kind of what it typically might? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: That's a really good question, Robin. I think pieces of this are about the shift towards more international from domestic. And maybe to some extent, even when you're in the U.S. looking at select-serv assets, probably a shift more towards urban and away from the prototypical suburban assets. Obviously, the more you get to urban or full service or international, the more the preconstruction period lengthens because permitting takes a little bit longer, the projects tend to be custom and therefore, the architecture and design work takes a little bit longer. And I think those would be the \u2013 probably the principal factors that would bring that percentage down a little bit. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. No, great. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up is, your projected cost saves from the integration hasn't changed at all from \u2013 it seems like you had perfect visibility several quarters before the closing of the transaction. So, I guess I'm just sort of asking... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: That's really nice of you to say. Filling my ear (33:24). Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, so that \u2013 it's just perfect. But just curious if you think there are sort of still things to work through. In other words, is every dollar identified at this point? Are there areas that you haven't \u2013 I guess I'm just sort of asking in a different way like, if there's potential upside to that? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So a couple things, and thanks for the question because it is worth mentioning a little bit about the timing as we think about the way these synergies will roll in. As integration progresses, we definitely will see during the year, we would expect to see the difference between \u2013 when you look at the combined a year ago quarter-by-quarter, we would expect that these savings progress during the year and into 2018. So as we move forward, by the time we're kind of in mid-2018, we feel comfortable that, that $250 million, we can ring that bell. And obviously, we're going to keep looking. This is an ongoing process. It's not kind of a one-stop shop, so we will continue to explore everything we can do. But for the moment, we feel good about the $250 million. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Morning, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Morning, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Morning, Joe. How about that? Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Arne, you mentioned that part of your confidence or increased confidence or optimism in your 2017 guidance is rooted not just from looking at macro factors, but also from a ground-up forecast and budgeting process with your guys in the field. When you look at that, is there a big difference between RevPAR growth expectations for legacy Marriott branded properties versus what you acquired in Starwood? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: No. There are some differences, obviously, in the distribution of the portfolio. Starwood portfolio still tends to be skewing much more international toward the higher end chain scales. Obviously, their distribution of select service was less robust than the legacy Marriott brands. And so, that rolls up to some extent in different ways through those portfolios. But when we look at like-for-like markets, we see very similar RevPAR expectations. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then, Leeny, you talked about G&A and cost cuts. What's surprising and maybe you can just talk about it somewhat differently is if I look at your 1Q G&A guidance and full year G&A guidance, it kind of implies basically that G&A is sequentially flat on average, 2Q through 4Q versus the 1Q, which somewhat surprised me. Can you just talk about that and what \u2013 I guess not driving more of an incremental sequential improvement or reduction in G&A? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, so first of all, this kind of gets back to how we thought about putting together the kind of more comparable numbers of the \u2013 how we think about the improvements in G&A. The combined company numbers, when you look at those going quarter-by-quarter to 2016, you were really looking at a company that was already starting to get some of those synergies as you moved through the year. And so when you look at Q3 and Q4, you had a bunch of open positions and you were actually, in some respects, really getting those synergies in 2016. So then when you look at 2017 compared, we're going to continue to get synergies but again, you're looking at a combined company in Q3 and Q4 of 2016 as frankly, already getting some of those synergies given the merger was kind of semi-closed, not quite closed. A bunch of open positions. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think the other factor you've got going on here is there are, at times through this process, a bit of a step function. So when you look at G&A synergies against the baseline, I think we would say fourth quarter shows more synergies than the first quarter, for example. And it's through the end of the first quarter we will be beginning to sunset some of the transitional efforts that were continued after the date of close. I think we'll also get into early 2018 and there will be a time when we would also sunset some of the duplicative systems. And until we get to those points where we're actually flipping off some of those switches, we don't achieve final phases or the next phase of some of that spending. But Leeny's comment certainly is right. We have some comparison issues here, too, in the sense that we \u2013 Starwood started to achieve savings really in the second half of 2015 and both companies in anticipation of the close were already starting to look at synergies in advance of the closing. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: If you \u2013 Joe, if you look at kind of more of the way that I'm describing, looking at the two companies kind of premerger and normalize them with a 4% increase for 2016, and use that as your run rate, you will actually see that Q1 we show savings, call it, of 10% relative to those numbers. And by the time we get to Q4, we're at 25% on a more normalized basis. And that, so you actually are seeing a real progression in the savings, but it's just again, it's depending on what you're comparing them to. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And just one follow-up on that just so I'm thinking about this correctly and not to ask you to provide guidance for beyond this year, but just think about it in the big picture. Would you expect that incremental of $70 million of G&A synergies that, if we think that you finish this year at $900 million in G&A, does that grow with inflation and then you reap the benefit of $70 million? Or is there any incremental inflationary pressure to think about looking ahead to modeling that G&A number? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, so a couple of things. We are, in many cases, talking people here, so we are talking the reality of people that will be continuing to help us put the two companies together. But I will also say that as you get through 2018 that by the time we're in the third quarter of 2018, I think you will see the run rate reflect kind of the savings that we've talked about. Now, the timing of some of these integration costs of exactly \u2013 we call them wind-down, they're not perfectly predictable. So, kind of exactly the $250 million with 3% inflation, we'll have to see how that goes. But we're determined, when we think of it, as $250 million in 2017 dollars that obviously then overtime will grow. But I would expect that it's more kind of in the back-half of 2018 where we've kind of really been able to say the companies from a fundamental running standpoint are truly integrated and combined. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, folks. Leeny, this first question is concerning the $1.5 billion of asset sales you referenced. How many of those assets are with brokers are actively being marketed today? And is there a rule of thumb you can give us on sort of gross first net proceeds we should expect to the extent those are sold? I'm just thinking about things like taxes or any sort of mortgage debt or things that would impact net proceeds. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Well, we're obviously talking to folks in the market about all of them. So these were assets that were in many cases under active discussions before the transaction closed and as a team, we continue to march forward and then on several, but at that point, we're not \u2013 we're talking to folks in the market. Now, they're obviously all in various stages because each of the assets is different and each has its \u2013 kind of a separate situation whether you've got to look at ground leases or kind of elements that you're comparing on the PIP, et cetera. So, I can't really give you a prediction in terms of timing of the asset sales, but we do continue to feel good about the environment and good about our ability to get it done in the timeframe that I described. The other thing I would say, on the gross versus net proceeds is, they're going to really vary. They're going to vary quite a bit asset-to-asset and I would say that a good proxy to use is about 20%. But again, I will say that could be very different asset-to-asset. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just a second question is, I don't know if you guys might have... Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Just to be clear, when we think of our cash flow model, we've been taking that into consideration all along. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And just one other question is, New York experienced something of a unique and maybe unanticipated lift in November and December that's continued a little bit into this year. And some folks think it's like a post-election bounce, and others kind of attribute it to sort of short-term \u2013 like, new legislation against short-term rentals, like Airbnb. I guess my point is, to the extent it was the latter, legislative-related, the implication is that Airbnb has actually had a stronger impact on the hotel industry than maybe has been originally surmised. I was just curious if you had any color or insight on some of those trends? And maybe do you guys think differently about maybe what drove some of the lift in New York in the back half of 2016? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think we remain generally cautious on New York, and that's not really about an Airbnb impact either before or more recently in the wake of some of the legislative activity that's been underway. New York was, in our fourth quarter, just slightly negative on the top line. I think our expectations for 2017 would be that New York would remain ever so slightly negative, not positive. That is actually remarkably good performance in some respects, given that we've got supply growth at nearly 5% in both 2016 and 2017, which would suggest basically that we've got demand growth growing at nearly the same pace. And when you look at the last few months of last year, you look at what's happening in January, these are historically fairly soft periods. I think it is dangerous to draw many conclusions from them about nature of supply and demand in New York including the impact of shared economy platforms. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor that as we go forward, but we would expect that we will continue to have a pretty modest performance. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Smedes. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. You touched on this at the beginning, so I'm sorry if I missed it, but I noticed that the pipeline, while it's still obviously very large, was flat sequentially, and typically you show growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And I was just wondering if you could touch on that, of why it was flat? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, every year, we do a careful culling of the portfolio, the pipeline, as we get to year end to make sure that they are reflective of deals which are very much still in progress. Obviously, it was the first time we had a chance to do that since closing the Starwood transaction. I don't think we brought different standards to bear than we've brought historically to it, but we did call a number of thousands of rooms out of that pipeline in the fourth quarter as we got towards the end of the year. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then I wanted to ask you too, you mentioned that asset sales could bring in additional cash over the course of the year. Is there also an opportunity for some sort of loyalty program monetization that we've seen? I think Starwood had a deal with Amex several years ago, and Hilton talked about it a little bit yesterday on their call. Is that something that you might look to do this year or next year? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Absolutely. As you probably remember that we've talked about before, we've got two co-brand credit card partners, SPG with Amex, and JPMorgan Chase Visa for Marriott Rewards. And as we think about combining the loyalty program over the long run, we obviously are in discussions with both of those companies about these co-brand credit cards. So we'll be talking to them this year, re-looking at the entire deal between the companies. One credit card agreement expires in 2018, the other one expires in 2020. And we're very excited about, frankly, the possibilities there, but wouldn't be in a position to be able to quantify anything at this point. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I don't know if you... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Morning. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. I don't know if you've gone over this yet. I'm just curious on your raise for the international RevPAR, specifically what locations are driving that? And secondly, is it partly driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar with Americans traveling internationally going into your assumptions? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, those are all good questions, and I think it probably starts with neither of those suggested answers but simply that we have done the budgets. And a quarter ago when we did our earnings call, we of course had started the budget process and was looking at the data that we had. But since that point in time, all of our teams around the world have had a chance to build these budgets from hotel-by-hotel perspective. I think if you compare beyond that to sort of general expectations, we're maybe a bit more bullish in Latin America and optimistic that the Zika epidemic is getting behind us in terms of its impact, at least. It's obviously not over. And maybe we're just a tinge more optimistic about Europe too, although that is an up-and-down market. You've got places like Istanbul, which are in a world of hurt and other places, which seem to be performing a little bit better. On average, I think those two markets would probably be the place where we have a slightly more positive view. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Just, Arne in your prepared remarks you talked about how energy and financial customers weakened in the fourth quarter. Can you just elaborate on that comment? Just seems a little strange given the dynamics in those markets. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I think, there might be one place where the greater optimism would hopefully come to pass. You look at energy and finance, I think there is some optimism that the energy patch bottomed and that while we may not be seeing strong signs of a rapid recovery out of that level that we're not necessarily seeing further decline. I think we did see further softness in Q4, but the anecdotes and the comments that are coming out now are a bit more encouraging. I think secondly with respect to finance, matters are changing so quickly, almost on a day-to-day basis, but it's really the first of the year where you start to get this building momentum that there will be strong regulatory relief in the financial world and the optimism that is in some respects derived from that. If that optimism shows up in greater performance of those two segments of our economy, obviously that will be good demand from those customers. Unknown Speaker : And it was encouraging to see manufacturing turn up after being weak for a very long time. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: That's right. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning, everyone. To \u2013 maybe just to touch once more on the synergies and I apologize, because I know this can be a little bit confusing probably for this type of Q&A, but just specifically, Leeny, as we think about the baseline of $900 million of kind of combined G&A for 2017, I guess the question we keep coming back to is, is they really closer to the $65 million to $70 million of remaining opportunity or because the baseline is higher, I think we did the math on that kind of $1.080 billion that you talked about and grew it a little bit. We'd be coming out a lot closer to only maybe $25 million remaining. Again, not trying to get you to give us guidance or explicit guidance but just trying to understand of those two ranges, which one is probably closer to what's remaining? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I think your first one. Your first one. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I think the larger number is the better and more accurate way to both look at it and to what we expect. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Thank you. And then my second question is \u2013 the other question we've gotten from some folks is a little bit around the EPS guidance and specifically wondering could you just give us a little bit more color on your thoughts around sort of the both buyback timing and perhaps just general cadence because I think for some people they're probably expecting maybe their slightly larger buyback assumption or more importantly a different weighting as you thought about it across the year and obviously it's got an average impact in that number. So just any thoughts around sort of how you thought about that or modeled that would be helpful. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Absolutely. So as you know, predicting the timing of asset sales is pretty difficult. So that's the main reason that we wanted to basically give you guys a model that assumes no asset sales. And obviously, to the extent that we're having asset sales during the year, that could obviously change the impact and the timing of share repurchase for the year. But when you think about other than that, I would say, probably relatively speaking the way we do it would be fairly steady during the year and wouldn't surprise you. The only counter to that, I would say, is that as you remember, we do have cash balances that we are going to be able to avail ourselves of, if you think about where we were at the end of Q3. And when our balance sheet comes out, you'll see the cash number has come down by about $200 million that we've been able to avail ourselves of cash. And I'll use that opportunity to tell you guys that it's likely that the 10-K will be filed after the weekend, a little bit later than our typical filing, because of the all the purchase-price accounting work that we've got to do, we want to make sure that we've buttoned everything down so it will be a few days later. But when we think about those extra cash balances that we do expect to be able to have available to us for general corporate purposes, and end up the year, end up 2017 with a more normal, call it, $200 million to $300 million level of ongoing working capital cash needs. I would say, we think that we'll have the use of that cash in the first half of the year rather than the second half of the year, which would give you a little bit of weighting towards the first half in share repurchase. But other than that, pretty much steady as she goes. Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. So, Arne, in your prepared remarks earlier you gave us some nice color as to the reiteration of your RevPAR growth in North America, flat to up 2%. I'm just wondering, what do you need to see to get more bullish with that guidance? Is it just as simple as acceleration in GDP? Or are there other things? And then, I was also wondering how much corporate transient demand growth you would need to see in order to get to that high-end or even above of your North America RevPAR growth target? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I mean, obviously, upside can come from any one of the drivers of our business. Group, or business transient, or leisure. I think when we look at the year from today's perspective, we would say leisure feels the strongest to us. Probably then group, and probably then business transient. Again, business transient, if it improved, that would be a positive thing. I think the beginning of your question was, what you need to see before you start to articulate some sort of upside? GDP tends to strengthen a bit before it shows up in our business. In other words, we lag probably a little bit, not massively, but it could be a month or two or three, something like that. I think we're going to be cautious about claiming that we're in a different world until we start to see, either through bookings or through the stayed-and-paid actual RevPAR numbers, the kind of performance that would allow us to say, you know what, actually, that optimism is proving to be real. And we just \u2013 I think today you can, if you want to go out and find anecdotes to prove a point of view that things are better, there are some anecdotes out there. But if you actually go and look at the data with a cold, clear gaze and say, are you really seeing the kind of data that would show that our business is performing differently than we thought a quarter ago? We don't see that clarity yet. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And just since you guys \u2013 the transaction's closed, I'm wondering what you've learned regarding the Sheraton brand? And when do you think you'll be able to be making changes there? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We are already engaged. We pulled together our U.S. owners, for example, full-service owners in November or early December, I've forgotten the precise week. But pretty quickly after we closed the transaction. And that's a group of a few hundred of our principal owners of managed hotels and owners and operators of franchised full-service hotels. Won't surprise you to know that a big chunk of that conversation was about the Sheraton brand, and particularly with the owners of the Sheraton assets, to engage with them about where that brand should go. And that is about defining brand standards, but doing it in a way that's collaborative with them. And then it is about making sure those brand standards get implemented. And implementation means that for hotels that don't meet those standards, we move with due speed, I'm talking about due speed in a second, to either get them on to brand standards, or to get them out of the Sheraton brand. Due speed, I think, means not that you can publish a brand standard and then a month later start to have a public execution because that would not be fair to our partners in this. These partners are extraordinarily important to us. They need to have some time to understand those standards to assess whether or not it is economically rational for them to meet them. And if it is, given the opportunity in order to make arrangements for the financing and make arrangements for the work actually to get done in order to meet those standards. I suspect, however, we will see in 2017 that some of the hotels that are most obviously at the bottom end of the brand; in other words, they didn't meet whatever standards were in place already; they don't meet any likely standard that we end up with, that we'll see that renovations actually occur in some of those or some of those actually leave the system. So we are expecting to see some progress being made in 2017. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And then, once you kind of go through that process, how long does it take to cycle through your financial performance? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I'm not sure if I know exactly what you mean by that. I think \u2013 obviously, the RevPAR index numbers are non-GAAP, so they're not coming through our P&L but they are a really important measure of the way a hotel is performing against its competitive set or the way a brand is performing generally across the market. The Sheraton RevPAR index is a bit lower than fair share, not massively but a couple of points maybe below fair share. And we're going to try and move those numbers steadily from here, including hopefully, some progress in 2017. Obviously, our fee contribution from those hotels will rise, not just with market RevPAR performance but with whatever index growth we can take. Offset, however, by whatever loss of fees we will experience by the deletion of hotels that don't meet that standard. So, we'll work through that. Everything that we can predict with some clarity is built into our 2017 model. When you get into years 2018, 2019, 2020, that's obviously an area where we will try and illuminate more when we're at \u2013 together for our Analyst Conference in March. But we'll just continue to keep you updated as our thinking evolves with that. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. So this seems like a catalyst for a little bit in the future. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: From your lips. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Stephen. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: This is a little bit less of a modeling question, but Arne, I've heard you talk about how critical the richness of the travel and lodging experience is and will be in driving the business. While I recognize combining Starwood and Marriott is a huge task on its own and people are rightly focused on those cost synergies, what are the key benefits and opportunities you're excited about longer term from combining these two organizations as it relates to the customer experience specifically? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I think \u2013 the two things I would call out there are loyalty and then the emotional power of the brand portfolio. So the loyalty program, SPG and Marriott Rewards are absolute juggernauts. We have been \u2013 we've talked about this in a number of prior calls and in other contexts, but we have been very impressed by the enthusiasm and the dedication that the SPG loyalists, particularly, the elites have to their program. We see in it a sort of comparable level of commitment that we've seen in the Marriott Rewards program for many, many years. And while Leeny talked about credit card companies, we've also got great partnerships with the timeshare companies. We've got a technology platform that we've got to work through. What we can build with this loyalty program we think is going to be extraordinarily exciting and should help us draw a broad connectivity to a very large group of customers and a higher share of wallet from their travel. And that's long-term upside for the company. I think the second thing is around the brand portfolio. And it's obvious to all of us, Starwood in many respects with the launch of W nearly 20 years ago was the first big company to get into the lifestyle space. And that brand continues to be a very strong one. You look at the pipeline of hotels that are coming into that brand, it is both strong and they are extraordinarily exciting hotels. But then you look at not just Aloft and Element which Starwood added also in the lifestyle space but you look at EDITION, and Moxy, and AC Hotels and the number of entrants that we brought into the lifestyle space as well. And when you think about luxury and lifestyle particularly, these are places that travelers, when they dream about travel and when they think about the experiences they most intensely want to have, they are focused on brands like that. And I think the strength we'll have in that space when combined with the loyalty program should really enable us to not just work on the nuts and bolts of the integration but really on the emotional connectivity to the traveling public. And that, as you can maybe tell from my comments turns us on. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Fair enough. That's helpful. As a quick follow-up on the loyalty program specifically, how should we be thinking about the timing of the joint kind of program going forward? Is that tied to the credit card negotiations or are you thinking about it otherwise? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: It's tied to all of it. It's tied to all of it. I mean, we obviously got to get \u2013 the technology work is underway, there are two separate technology platforms and we've got to do the work necessary in order to have one platform. It is possible we could have one platform with two different program sitting on top of that platform depending on where we are with our partners. We've also then got a whole bunch of questions around the customer proposition, the programs have somewhat different rules around qualification for Elite level, around the Elite bonuses, around other things and we want to work through with our customers. And then of course, we've got the credit card and timeshare companies. And there are some issues which are relationship driven and some that are contractual driven. But we're going to work through those. You certainly should not expect that we will have one program anytime in 2017. Whether we will in 2018 is something we will work to maximize the chances for, but we don't have a date to give you yet. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful. Thanks again, and good luck this year. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. I know it's late so thanks for taking my question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Ryan. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yeah, I just wanted to ask a little bit about, I didn't think I heard it in your prepared remarks, the member pricing initiative. I guess a couple of things related to that. Number one, are you seeing any impact on RevPAR growth? Obviously, I would imagine it would be negative because of the discounting aspect, that's showing up over the past quarter or two. And then number two is, if you are, are you seeing any type of opportunity for RevPAR growth to maybe reaccelerate as you lap some of that impact later this year? And are you getting the benefits you are looking for in terms of being able to increase the loyalty program members? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, it's an interesting question, particularly the latter half of that. I think it's going to get harder and harder for us to have a calculation about what the impact of member-direct rates are, in truth. We \u2013 the last two quarters have talked about a roughly 30-basis-point impact to RevPAR, so that would have been in Q2 and Q3 2016. But the closer you were \u2013 we were to implementing that program, the more you had some sort of current baseline data, which allowed you to do some calculations. The farther you get away from it, you start to already have a bit of a difficult time knowing exactly where the booking would have come otherwise. And we're now in a business in which essentially these member-direct discounts are common across all the branded platforms. So our principal competitors are doing the same thing. That makes assessing what it would be like if we didn't have it more and more difficult to do. We are encouraged by the growth in sign-ups to the loyalty program since we've rolled out the member-direct rates by the awareness of these kinds of discounts, which we remain convinced will drive good behavior from our perspective, from our customers and the way they book. And as a consequence, I suspect we'll see that this continues much as it is in its present form. Does it impact? Do we lap it at some point? I suppose we do. I suppose in Q2 we start to lap it. But again, our calculation was 30 basis points or thereabouts in Q2, so it's not a massive number. And whether its additive or not, sort of Lord knows. I guess I would say it's built into our model, but I'm not necessarily sure that we focus precisely on that question either. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, you guys talked a lot about asset sales. Thanks for giving us an indication on San Francisco St. Regis as well. Have you thought at all about portfolios? Obviously, REIT stock prices have come back pretty meaningfully. Seems like there might be an opportunity to do a bigger portfolio transaction, but it also might come with a REIT, other than maybe one or two that might need to pay in the form of stock. Would you be willing to, A, do a portfolio transaction? And should we expect one? And then, B, would you be willing to accept stock for a transaction? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So thanks for the question. We certainly are willing to entertain all comers and happy to listen to anybody who's got an idea, and have thought about that. And frankly, we've spoken to a number of potentially \u2013 investors that would be interested in either part of, a partial portfolio or all. As you might imagine, in many cases, those are international buyers. But the reality is, we've got a really interesting kind of diverse group of hotels, and whether they are located in Buenos Aires or Canada, or they have ground leases or they have PIP needs, every single one of them has its own story. And I think we are now fairly firmly \u2013 never say never, but fairly firmly of the view that it's going to be much more onesies and twosies is going to be the best way to maximize the value of this portfolio. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. And then willingness to accept stock? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Again, we haven't contemplated that. I would say, not very. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I can't imagine that even if a buyer had to use stock that we'd necessarily have to take it. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: They can figure out a way to put the stock in the market the same \u2013 they did it (1:09:52). Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Fair enough. Just wanted to make sure I understood correctly. Thanks a lot. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: We're looking for cash. Operator : Our next question comes from David Beckel with (sic) Sanford C. Bernstein. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to quickly touch back on terminations that were mentioned as a headwind to IMF growth. I think last quarter, you mentioned that you expected unit growth, but I don't think there was any mention of terminations. So first question would be, did anything change? And then, how big of a drag related to terminations do you expect this year? And should we expect a, sort of, persistent drag based on your earlier comment going forward? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We won't have anything to say this morning about future years, but our expectations for 2017 are about the same number of \u2013 deletions is actually probably a better word than terminations from our system. We've been experiencing roughly a point, I think Starwood was a bit more than a point. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: We're a little bit under. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We were a little bit under, they were a bit over. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: And we still think that's about the right area. Now those stories, they are one hotel at a time. The most typical deletion is a hotel that doesn't meet our standards, and it does not make economic sense for it to be re-invented to meet our standards. And so we take it out. Now, we don't take it out without consultation with our owners and franchisees. But we essentially work towards taking that out of the system so that it can land someplace else in the probably lower tier of the hotel business typically. There are other circumstances in which we're subject to termination from an owner who doesn't want to keep us, or who is selling it to somebody else and they have different plans for it. And so, every story exists in this, sort of, annual model, but it's not at different levels, at least that's what we're anticipating in our guidance. It's not at different levels than what the company has experienced in the past. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: And, David, keep in mind that when we talk about unit growth on a net basis, we're really addressing it there. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Right. Right. No, that's really helpful. I appreciate that. And just as a quick follow-up, if I could, I don't think we discussed the effect of travel ban at all. I think, Leeny, you had mentioned something last night, but could you just fill us in on what you're seeing with respect to maybe corporate traveler or corporate planners and their reaction to the travel ban and how that may or may not impact their plans going forward? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, we don't have a lot of data yet that would say that this is a big deal in terms of stayed-and-paid experience in our hotels. Obviously, the seven countries that are called out in the Executive Order are not places where there's a lot of travel that comes to the United States. And obviously too, the Executive Order has been suspended by a ruling of the court, so it's not in effect. We, as a consequence, don't think that by its terms, it's a massive deal. Now saying that, we should stop and pause for a second. You've got individual stories of families who've been waiting for a long period of time to get visas or other permission to emigrate. And for them, there is no bigger story in the world than having those rights up-ended and uncertainty sort of race back into their lives. Having said that, there is a broad sense, particularly across the Middle East but across much of the world that the Executive Order is a really big deal and that the symbolism is wrong and that it is effectively a communication from the United States to the rest of the world that you should anticipate that either you're not going to be welcome here or that you may have difficulty getting in. And we think that's what has motivated the handful of stories that we've heard about already, which are typically group stories. And they are not, of course, international groups where folks are saying, you know what? I'm not sure I want to take the risk of trying to bring an international group into the United States, whether it'd be for a wedding or for a meeting because my whole group may not be able to get in. And so, we have some anecdotes about folks who have reached out to us and said, you know what? Rather than focus on that hotel in the U.S., why don't we look at what you've got in Canada? Or why don't you look at what you've got someplace else? And if we're hearing a handful of those anecdotes already, I'm sure there are a number that we're not hearing, which are groups who had not yet contacted us but who would have contacted us were it not for this Executive Order. But instead are maybe going directly to one of our hotels in another country or they're simply deferring their efforts to plan that business. So again, I don't think this is a measurable impact today. I don't think it is necessarily a substantial impact. I wouldn't expect, by the way, that it would have much impact on business transient at all because that tends to be the kind of travel that is most resilient. But I do think it is a place where to the extent we need to do things around security or around immigration, we should do them quickly so that we can get back to communicate to the rest of the world that subject to the revisions in those policies, we really want people to come here and see us and do business here and vacation here and take back their fond memories to their homes. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group. Unknown Speaker : Hi, David. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: David. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. Operator : David, if your line is on mute, can you please unmute it? Our next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC : Hey. Good morning, folks. Unknown Speaker : Hi, Rich. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Rich. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, there. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC : How's it going? One question this late in the call, a little high-level question. As you think about your North American RevPAR guidance of flat to plus 2%, can you give us a sense of how that breaks down among, say, the top 10 markets, the top 25 and outside the top 25? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: No. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC : (1:16:30) Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: New York and Miami, clearly. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, we talked about New York as being kind of flattish, so I would expect that, that is towards the lower end. But we've got that by market. I'm not sure it's terribly constructive to tick through all of those. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC : Oh, no, I didn't mean market-by-market but just kind of a gateway versus non-gateway sort of question boiled down. And if not, we can discuss it offline. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, why don't you give Laura and Betsy a holler on that. Let's see if we can help you navigate that. Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for staying on late here. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Bill. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Arne, I want to take one more shot at the G&A topic. If we just set aside the synergies, assume you're going to achieve those, how do you gauge the absolute level of G&A expenditures? And I'm curious whether your company as it continues to sell assets, you've exited timeshare, increased the focus on franchising relative to management, whether you've got an opportunity to maybe reengineer G&A to a lower absolute level, even after these synergies are completed. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question, and I think there are a number of different answers to it. Leeny has been very strong in helping guide the company through this area before close and after close and trying to build models, which essentially say, here is what we think we have capacity to spend and here's what we think we need to spend. Both those questions are relevant and they're different questions. And has essentially allocated around the business allowances, if you will, for the level of effort we think would be required to run this bigger platform. And that is, of course, it was influenced to some extent by our target to get to the $250 million of synergies. It also guided our settling on $250 million as a number that seemed to work. And so that planning is a piece of it. I think a second piece of it is simply listening to our teams and sensing the level of intensity and their demand for more resources, which obviously comes up frequently in companies all around. I would say one other thing, and that is I think in this last recovery, looking over the last three to four years, legacy Marriott has really done a fine job keeping admin cost growth at very, very low levels, and if you look over a 25- or 30-year period of time, where G&A has grown at meaningfully higher than 3%-ish kind of growth rates through other economic recovery cycles, in this one, we've been keeping an awful lot of focus on this, and keeping the growth rates down. And I suspect we'll continue to do that. Even when we can ring the bell to use Leeny's phrase, about hitting that $250 million target, we won't be done. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in the platform. I don't think getting rid of owned assets is likely to be terribly significant by itself because the bulk of our spending is about running a global public company, governance reporting, et cetera, that relates to that. It is about overseeing thousands of managed hotels and thousands of relationships with owners of managed and franchised hotels, and it's about the work we've got to do to refine and strengthen brands and provide the oversight of all of that. And that's not work that is likely to get any more intense in the years ahead. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me on here. So as you look to integrate your loyalty programs within the next year or two, are there any incremental costs associated with that? And do you anticipate any challenges in this process? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Oh, there are plenty of challenges. The technology and the partnerships would be probably where we would start. I think we've got good relationships and we've got good plans, and so we're quite optimistic about being able to navigate through all of that. But it's a lot of work, and don't hear our confidence as being a sign that it isn't. Because we've got many people that are focused on this and getting it done right. Are there any costs associated with it? There are, of course. I think the bulk of the costs associated with it, like the bulk of the costs of the program are really paid for by the system as we go through it. We need to make sure that those costs don't balloon and harm our owners and so we're doing everything we possibly can to manage that. But I wouldn't expect this to be a sort of regular impact to our P&L. Other than through the upside of hopefully larger share of wallet. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: As said (1:21:57), the synergies, at the end the day we see much more upside than we do downside in terms of on the cost and revenue side related to loyalty. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on your credit card comments. I realize you don't want to talk about any future contribution from any reworked deal. But can you just help me size up the current agreements? So if you're doing $3.1 billion in EBITDA in 2017, how much of that is coming from your current credit card agreements? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We said in the call, about 49%. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Right. So, about 49% of the $350 million that we talked about being this kind of pot of fees that are not tied directly to the RevPAR of hotels. And so, if you say roughly half of that is coming from the credit card relationships. And those are again, those are driven by credit card spend. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Okay. Thanks again. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our final question for today comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Good morning, everyone. There has been a little bit of uptick in optimism, but what are the hotel revenue managers thinking right now? Are they still going with the defensive heads-in-bed strategy? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I think so. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that we are adding some special corporate accounts to what we had last year. We think it is sensible to do that. Really what we're doing is we're running the business with an expectation, so this is about cost management, it is about driving top-line with an expectation that we're going to continue to slug it out in a pretty low-growth GDP environment. If there is strength in GDP, it's all upside. But if there is no strength in GDP, we want to make sure we're delivering the best results we can. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you all very much for your time and attention and bearing with us. We know we've thrown an awful lot of data at you, so by all means, give us a holler back if we can be helpful to you. Safe travels. Operator : This concludes the Marriott International 2016 fourth quarter and year end Conference Call. Thank you for joining us, and have a great day.",

LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Marriott International First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Marriott International. Sir, you may begin. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, May 9, 2017, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion today we'll talk about results excluding merger-related costs, and we'll compare 2017 results to prior-year combined results, which assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business was completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported results are in last night's press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. So let's get started. Over the past few weeks we held hotel General Manager conferences around the world from Toronto to Mexico City, New Orleans to Dubai, and London to Macau. At those meetings we discussed the tremendous potential of the new Marriott International, whether it was capturing economies of scale from our substantially broader distribution, capitalizing on opportunities for revenue and cost synergies, or building on the excitement about our loyalty programs. The enthusiasm and energy of the General Managers was simply terrific. We are successfully melding two talented organizations and it's exciting to see everyone working together. At every stop, there was tremendous optimism about our future. I expect our strong results in the first quarter will increase that optimism, given the extensive integration work that is underway, I'm proud of our Hotel teams around the world for their focus on running the business, taking care of guests and driving results. Across our company worldwide systemwide RevPAR increased 3.1% in the first quarter with a nearly 2 percentage point improvement in occupancy. Worldwide RevPAR index rose for both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood portfolios, increasing nearly one full point on a combined basis. Our operating teams kept their eye on the ball translating RevPAR growth into 100 basis points of higher house profit margin. We added more than 17,000 rooms in the quarter and increased the development pipeline by nearly 10,000 rooms. With the improvement in RevPAR and margins and continued growth in distribution, our first quarter combined fee revenue grew 6%, adjusted EBITDA increased 10%, and adjusted diluted EPS rose 38% over the prior year combined results. In North America, systemwide RevPAR rose 3.1% in the quarter. Our hotels in the greater Washington D.C. area benefited from January's inauguration and Women's March. Systemwide RevPAR in D.C. increased 15% in the quarter compared to the prior year and well ahead of our expectations. Performance in Hawaii also exceeded expectations. Strong transient demand came from both mainland and international guests, pushing systemwide RevPAR up 7%. The rough weather on the U.S. West Coast likely encouraged some last-minute bookings to the islands. Demand in Canada was particularly strong with comparable constant dollar RevPAR rising 10% in the quarter. This year is Canada's 150th anniversary and Montreal's 375th. With favorable exchange rates our hotels in Canada are hosting more international guests ready to celebrate. Laura is already packing her bags for the summer. While these markets were particularly strong, RevPAR also exceeded expectations in many other North American markets. Across the North American region, group RevPAR rose 7.7% year-over-year, benefiting from the events in Washington and the shift in the Easter holiday to the second quarter. Group RevPAR modestly exceeded our expectations due to strong attendance at group meetings while meeting planners continued to add last minute food, beverage and ancillary spending. Full year 2017 group revenue booking pace for all our North American full service hotels is up 1.6% over a strong 2016 group year. We've seen some weakness in new bookings from small groups in recent months, but with very strong occupancy rates at many hotels and 86% of our anticipated 2017 group business already on the books, space constraints have also made adding new groups more challenging. Meeting planners recognizing that meeting space is filling continue to book earlier in some cases for multiple years, a practice we have encouraged. By the way with nearly 4,500 hotels in North America we have a great selection for meeting planners whether they are booking a large meeting for multiple years or a small meeting for next week. In fact in the first quarter, group RevPAR at our limited service hotels increased 10%, and booking pace for our legacy Marriott limited service hotels for the full year is up over 5%. Transient RevPAR in North America was up nearly 2% year-over-year in the quarter constrained by the timing of Easter and high occupancy rates. At the same time, transient demand exceeded our expectations, and we improved the mix of transient revenue drawing more high-rated retail and corporate customers and reducing discounts. In the second quarter, we expect lower group business year-over-year due to the timing of Easter. As a result we expect North American systemwide RevPAR will be flat to up 2% in the second quarter, and will increase 1% to 3% for the full year. On a preliminary basis, April year-to-date RevPAR systemwide for North America is up roughly 2%. Our North America 2017 RevPAR guidance is 100 basis points ahead of the guidance we issued in February. To be sure, transient demand was better than expected in the first quarter and our outlook for full year transient business has improved a bit. But even in February, when we last issued guidance, we were expecting our first quarter RevPAR growth would be somewhat over the midpoint of our 0% to 2% RevPAR forecast. So moving our North America RevPAR guidance to 1% to 3% isn't quite as large a shift as it may first appear. In the Asia-Pacific region we're encouraged by recent economic growth. First quarter systemwide RevPAR increased 5% with strength in retail and corporate business. RevPAR in India and Indonesia increased at double-digit rates, while in Greater China systemwide RevPAR rose 5% with strength in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Hotels in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau outperformed our expectations in the quarter. Given these trends we expect our second quarter and full year RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region will increase at a mid single digit rate. This is higher than our prior guidance due to strengthening transient demand. RevPAR also exceeded expectations in Europe, increasing 7% year-over-year on solid transient and group demand, and strong international arrivals. European room nights sold to U.S. travelers alone increased at a mid-teens rate in the first quarter. Greater group business in the UK and Germany allowed us to improve the mix of transient business in those markets, and RevPAR growth at our Paris hotels was ahead of expectations. We expect our hotels in Europe will continue to show strength through 2017, and we expect our second quarter and full-year RevPAR will increase at a mid single digit rate, a bit higher than our last guidance. In the Middle East RevPAR growth in the first quarter was flat, consistent with our expectations. Geopolitical unrest, low oil prices, and lower government spending continued to depress hotel results. The good news was in Africa where RevPAR increased more than 18% with strength in Egypt. RevPAR in South Africa alone increased 9%, as the weak Rand continued to attract tourism to this great destination. Middle East RevPAR continues to be a challenge to forecast. While we aren't modeling a meaningful change in oil prices or government spending, comparisons should get easier in most markets as the year progresses. As a result we expect Middle East Africa RevPAR will be modestly lower in the second quarter, but improve in the second half, resulting in flattish performance for the full year 2017. In the Caribbean and Latin America systemwide RevPAR in the first quarter declined 2% year-over-year. RevPAR in Mexico increased at a high teens rate, while RevPAR declined in the Caribbean, largely due to lower leisure demand with the shift in the Easter holiday. Lower RevPAR in South America reflected a weak economy and oversupply in Brazil. You may recall that the Zika virus began to impact our business in February of 2016. We expect easier comparisons in the region late in the year, and stronger performance in the Caribbean in the second quarter, due to the shifting Easter holiday. This should yield a low single digit increase in RevPAR in both the second quarter and full-year 2017. With this solid improvement in international RevPAR, we expect second quarter and full-year worldwide 2017 RevPAR will increase 1% to 3%. Our full-year worldwide RevPAR growth outlook is about 50 basis points higher than our prior guidance, largely due to better than expected results in the first quarter, and improving demand in Asia and Europe. In the first quarter, margins at company operated hotels improved 100 basis points due to stronger RevPAR growth, better productivity, lower food costs and improved billing processes. Productivity was helped by ongoing service innovations such as Your Choice, our program that allows loyalty members the option to choose between daily housekeeping or bonus loyalty points. In the first quarter, our development pipeline increased to over 430,000 rooms, including 166,000 rooms already under construction. Today according to Smith Travel Research, one hotel in three hotels under construction in the U.S. and one hotel in four hotels under construction worldwide is associated with one of our brands. Our development success is impressive given the development climate in North America. While lending has eased for open hotels, financing for new hotel construction is challenging, with growing equity requirements. Construction costs have moved higher and we've seen some project delays in North America due to shortages of skilled subcontractors. Hotel development is picking up in Asia, even as new construction moderates in China and India. We are seeing an uptick in conversions in those countries and greater construction elsewhere in the Pacific Rim. We continue to see considerable limited service development interest in Europe overall with growing interest in Western Europe. Limited service hotels are also growing in popularity with Middle East developers, particularly in tertiary markets. Demand for our brands remains high and we are on track to deliver 6% net unit growth in 2017. Throughout the company our teams are making tremendous progress on the Starwood integration. We've already transitioned HR systems for Starwood Hotels in the U.S. and expect other continents will follow later in 2017. In March we added 36,000 associates to the Marriott payroll system. For our guests all our hotels worldwide are now on an integrated system for guest event and social media feedback. This summer we expect to publish harmonized global brand standards, which, along with regular audits, is an essential step in establishing property accountability and maintaining guest satisfaction. We've converted Starwood owned and managed hotels in North America to our procurement system. Elsewhere in the world we are reviewing and renegotiating vendor contracts to leverage our purchasing power. We are also using our purchasing platforms to track actual hotel spend to ensure the hotels realize the savings. We have already migrated all U.S. Starwood Hotels to Marriott's OTA contracts, Hotels in other continents will follow soon. This should reduce the cost of OTA bookings, as well as improve inventory control. We are rolling out Marriott's guest room entertainment platform to Starwood properties. This will lay the foundation for an enhanced television experience including On Demand streaming content and services. We are also enhancing the SPG app to enable guests at most hotels to take advantage of mobile check-in and checkout. In April we transitioned over 100 company operated Starwood Hotels in the U.S. to our above property shared service model for finance and accounting. We are on track to unify our financial reporting infrastructure in early 2018, and to realize a common technology platform for reservations and loyalty programs in late 2018. Drawing from both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood staff, cross functional teams are coordinating meaningful change in virtually every aspect of our company's operation. This effort is enormous and we are seeing meaningful results today, and even more just over the horizon. I'm incredibly proud of the many people working on this integration, and they have my sincere thanks. As you can tell, we are excited about our business, and encouraged by recent trends. Now to explain how RevPAR and unit growth translates to EPS growth, let me turn things over to Leeny. Leeny? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.01, $0.12 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance, $0.87 to $0.91. Fee revenue contributed $0.06 of the outperformance due to better than expected RevPAR growth, branding fees and incentive fees. Results on our owned, leased and other line outperformed by three pennies largely due to better than expected property results. Adjusted general and administrative costs were better than expected by about $0.03 mainly due to open positions and timing. Worldwide base fees increased $7 million or 3% over prior-year combined amounts, reflecting unit growth and RevPAR improvement offset somewhat by terminations, hotels that converted from management to franchise agreements, and foreign exchange. With higher RevPAR and growing distribution, franchise fees increased 10% in the quarter. Also, included in franchise fees are application fees, relicensing fees and fees from our timeshare, credit card and residential businesses. Together, these fees totaled nearly $100 million in the quarter, 14% higher than combined results in the prior year. Branding fees were particularly strong. Incentive fees increased 2% year-over-year in the first quarter constrained by deferred fees recognized in 2016, and unfavorable foreign exchange. At the same time, incentive fees were about $17 million better than expected, with $10 million of the outperformance coming from a significant number of North American full-service hotels and $7 million from hotels in the Asia-Pacific region. We expect roughly $5 million of our North America incentive fees outperformance at seasonal hotels will be reversed later in the year. Since hotels in the Asia-Pacific region typically don't have owner priorities reversals there are not likely. For the second quarter, we expect worldwide incentive fees will likely be flattish due to the timing of Easter. For the full year, with stronger RevPAR guidance and strong margins, we believe total incentive fees could increase at a mid single digit rate. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $81 million in the first quarter, a 6% decline from the prior year. Improved performance was more than offset by lower termination fees, which declined $7 million, and the impact of asset sales in the past 12 months, which reduced year-over-year results by $4 million. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses was $16 million better than we expected in the first quarter, largely due to forecast beats at hotels in Atlanta, Barcelona, London, Toronto, and Tokyo, as well as about $6 million in higher than expected termination fees. In the second quarter, we expect owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses will total roughly $90 million, compared to $115 million in the prior year. We estimate the negative impact of asset sales will be about $15 million in the second quarter, and we also expect lower results in Rio de Janeiro and New York. Our guidance for owned and leased hotels assumes no further asset sales this year. For the full year, we expect owned leased results will total $340 million to $350 million, compared to $426 million in 2016. The full-year comparison to last year's combined results includes a $40 million negative impact from asset sales, including the Westin Maui, $25 million to $30 million in lower hotel results, again largely in Rio and New York, and $15 million in lower termination fees. While asset sales reduced owned leased results they also increased management fees and free up capital for reinvestment in our business or return to shareholders. Adjusted general and administrative expenses declined by $36 million in the first quarter and beat our expectations by $17 million, largely reflecting cost reductions, open positions, and timing as the integration continues. We expect G&A will total $220 million to $225 million in the second quarter, and $880 million to $890 million for the full year. Compared to our prior guidance, the improvement in our full year outlook for G&A largely reflects the better than expected results achieved in the first quarter. We continue to expect to achieve our annualized $250 million in cost synergies by 2018, including over $200 million in annualized savings in 2017. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 10%. Adjusted EPS in 2017 should total $3.92 to $4.09. An increase of 19% to 24% over prior-year combined results. For the full year, we expect 2017 adjusted EBITDA will total $3.1 billion to $3.195 billion, an increase of 4% to 7%. You may recall that in our February guidance for 2017, adjusted EBITDA was 3% to 6% higher than the prior year. We've increased our estimate of adjusted EBITDA since February to reflect higher fees, lower G&A, and stronger profitability of owned and leased hotels, somewhat offset by the sale of the Westin Maui. As you can see on page A-10 in the release, our new estimate of full year adjusted EBITDA also reflects some fine tuning of the add backs to net income, including correcting the share based compensation line by $27 million. That amount should have been excluded, as it was the merger-related portion of the share-based compensation costs. Investment spending for the year could total $500 million to $700 million including about $175 million in maintenance spending. To-date in 2017, we have recycled roughly $320 million through asset sales and note repayments. Cash balances were high at quarter end as we received the roughly $300 million in proceeds from the sale of the Westin Maui on March 31. We repurchased over 10 million shares through last week for approximately $925 million in 2017. We anticipate returning over $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2017. Our guidance does not include the impact of possible asset sales beyond those already completed. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now. Operator : Our first question comes from David Katz with Telsey Group. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, David. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : I wanted to just probe a little bit more about the guidance, and I know you've given quite a bit of detail around a lot of things, but if I'm trying to balance between your perspective on the economic climate taken in total for the remainder of the year versus the execution of the integration and just the execution of the business combination, how much of your improvement today would you say you would allocate to both? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Oh, that's a good question. And I'm not sure we've necessarily broken it down that way in our internal calculations, although clearly, as we've noted, the driving \u2013 the most significant driving factors in our increase in our RevPAR guidance was the strength of the first quarter, including in North America and the rest of the world, and the momentum that's particularly occurring in Europe and Asia-Pacific. The U.S. results, North American results, as well as the global results, obviously were stronger in the first quarter in part because we took share, so we talked about one point \u2013 nearly one point index growth in both the Marriott and Starwood portfolios. And, you know, it would be hard fairly to attribute all of that one point increase to the success of the integration, but I don't at the same time think that it's entirely unrelated to that. And so I think, we are getting a little bit of juice that is coming from bringing these two companies together. At the same time, you know, clearly strength around the world was because of a stronger demand environment as well, so I think the economic \u2013 underlying economic situation is also contributing. I can't give you percentages for each. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Right. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: But both are a factor. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Got it and if we're looking at the \u2013 what's left of the owned portfolios of the combined company, Leeny, where are we in terms of selling things off and how we should \u2013 I heard you that you've guided as though the owned portfolio remains where it is. But what inning or what can you tell us about how much progress you've made, and what we might reasonably expect you to sell in the remainder of the year and into next year? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I think, David, we continue to be comfortable with the commentary that we've made before about selling over $1.5 billion of real estate by the time we get to the end of 2018. I would also say that we continue to be confident that there will be further asset sales in 2017. Beyond that as I'm sure you know, predicting the exact closing and timing of specific transactions is very hard to do, but I think, we're pleased with the progress, and we're moving along. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I wanted to clarify - Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Robin. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : How are you? Thanks. About group booking comments. It sounded like what you have on the books for the rest of the year, the pace is sort of like North American full-service group is up 1.6%, and I think, last quarter that you had said it was pacing up 3%, but I don't know if I'm using the same exact metric in both cases. So maybe you can \u2013 can you talk a little bit about, it sounds like then maybe it did slow in Q1. Just perspective. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, we were in the high 2%s a quarter ago, and again this is full-service in North America, so it's down about a point. And that's \u2013 you know, it's not entirely rare to see us \u2013 see those numbers moderate over the course of the year, as in the year group bookings are the only thing that obviously can \u2013 or we think, that obviously can raise those numbers. We made a point of explaining in our prepared comments that we think we got about 86% of the group business that we anticipate for the year on the books, and obviously occupancies are running high, which means that we are seeing the booking window lengthen a bit, and we are seeing a bit more growth in limited service group business than in full-service space. At the same time, I think there is still some cautionary \u2013 what \u2013 something cautionary there about the data. It shows that we've got group customers that are a little reticent to make big commitments, but generally this is pretty healthy. And so on balance, we would say don't be alarmed by it, and we see good growth going forward. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : And just based on how much you have booked for the year, where you're pacing now that up 1.6%, is that where you think the year ends? Or it sounded like you said maybe things could moderate during the year. So just want \u2013 is that \u2013 does it end up being only up 1%? Or just how do you think about how... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, that's probably the best single number we would have at the moment. The \u2013 it is kind of a funny year and I think you've heard this from some of the other players. Partly this is because of the holiday schedule and partly it's just the normal vicissitudes of group bookings. But Q1 and Q4 are the strongest quarters of the year, Q2 and Q3 will be a bit weaker and that makes it a little bit hard to forecast all of this stuff. But I would think that, you know, in the high 1s, maybe someplace in that place, would be the best single number we can give you today. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Harry Curtis, Nomura. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hey, good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Harry. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Harry. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Just following up on that line of questioning, how is the group pace looking for 2018? It's still early, but \u2013 and maybe if you can comment on price, as well. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Let's see here. The \u2013 we're up in the mid single digits, between 4% and 5% for North American full-service for calendar 2018. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. And then my second question, just going back to the possible asset sales, I just want to make sure that our assumptions are right. The balance of owned hotels in the Starwood portfolio, is that roughly 5,200 rooms in North America? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sounds about \u2013 in North America, I'll get you the specific numbers, but... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Including Canada, yeah. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Including Canada, that would \u2013 sounds about right. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay, and is it reasonable to think that roughly 300 a key is not \u2013 is an okay ballpark to be in in terms of its market value? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I'm not going there, Harry. Each \u2013 each \u2013 that's like kind of saying that Tremont in Chicago is the same as the St. Regis in New York is the same as, you know, Toronto Sheraton. You know, they're each one- just like our children, each one is very unique. Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Yeah, well, you know, you've got to throw out the pitch to get a hit. So, yeah, I'll just end it there. Thanks a lot. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. You mentioned the Starwood companies moving over to your the Avendra platform and benefiting from lower OTA fees. And I was just wondering if you could quantify just for sort of the average hotel owner, who's moved now and is enjoying these benefits, do you have a sense of what kind of margin expansion they might be seeing just sort of on average? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, first of all, Smedes, I would say so far, very little. So far, in general, this all happened during the first quarter in both cases. So really in terms of Q1 margins, although there's some great work done in benchmarking and working on a host of things across the brand, coming from OTAs and from Avendra, next to nothing. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, well, maybe then as those things are adapted more, and they have a little more under their belt. Do you have a sense of what it could do for the typical Starwood Hotel? Or legacy Starwood Hotel? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: It's going to vary so tremendously in terms of (32:31) ... Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: ... for OTAs. Because remember that in the U.S. it's going to be very different than overseas, and then again Avendra is largely a U.S.-base and there again if you're a suburban hotel that doesn't have a lot of group versus if you have a ton of group that buys lots of food and beverage, it's going to vary \u2013 it's going to really vary tremendously. But I will say, it will definitely, you know, be \u2013 it will be noticeable in terms of margins from the benefit, but I wouldn't be able to quantify an average. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And I just wanted to ask, you mentioned some hotels converting from management to franchise, and it's not \u2013 I mean, it's not sort of a thing as my kids would say, is that an issue going forward for Marriott? Are there a lot of options for people just to convert to franchise or is that just something that's sort of, well, kind of a one-off general sort of exception? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think, it is a trend we've seen for a number of years and is likely to continue, even as we grow the managed portfolio, particularly globally and in the big-box space with new hotels. I think, in many instances, we've seen some hotels get to the point where they need substantial new capital for renovation. Often they're sold in the context of bringing that new capital in, and there is more capital eager to invest in well-branded assets, well-branded assets that have flexibility on who's running the day-to-day operations, and we have seen that it is in our interests, as well, to make those transactions happen in a way that brings the capital interests, helps to bring them up to standard. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Particularly in North America. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. And which is very much a North American phenomenon. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. It's actually Anthony Powell here for Felicia. How are you guys doing? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good, how about you? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Anthony. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Doing great. You mentioned that you're seeing better higher rated corporate transient demand. Could you single out any industries that are driving that growth or any particular markets where you're seeing the strength? And also I believe last call you mentioned that you were trying to sign up more corporate contracts. How's that going? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I think generally, we are \u2013 we feel a bit more encouraged by corporate travel this quarter than we did a quarter ago in the guidance that we provided. But let's be careful about throwing all caution to the wind here. I think you've got, in the corporate travel landscape, lots and lots of different stories. Obviously the energy patch continues to remain relatively weak. In fact I think we were more optimistic about Houston a quarter ago than we are today. We sort of felt like we had hit bottom, and today I think we're a little less confident of that. By comparison, you look at the strength we saw in Washington, you look at the strength that we're seeing still in a number of western markets, we see companies that are reporting better corporate profits and I think as a consequence, we feel a bit better based both on the actual results in Q1, which to be sure was benefited by Easter, but also by sort of what we feel like is tenor in the marketplace. And we have moved more of our transient business, including business transient business, towards retail and to special corporate and away from discount, and so those things are driving a bit of a mix shift within the transient bucket. All good news. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it, thanks. And on your RevPAR index gain can you attribute any of that to customers allocating more of their travel spend to your system due to the merger or are you just better at selling and getting more groups into the hotels? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I think by definition it means we're getting a bit more of their spend, since we have relatively taken share of the industry. We don't get real time data that would allow us to know exactly how to calculate that, but we are encouraged. Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Great. That's it for me. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Patrick. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Patrick. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Question for you when we're thinking about your North American RevPAR guidance of 1% to 3%. I think, on a previous question you mentioned or indicated that group was sort of in the 1%-ish to 2% range. How do you think about your two other customer segments, the individual business travel and the leisure? Where would they fit in that range? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Maybe Laura or Betsy have got something precise here on that, but generally, I would think that leisure will be the strongest. You obviously have some markets which have got complexities around that answer, because of Zika or because of other trends. And obviously those comparisons will get easier as the year goes along, but generally I think we would say leisure is the strongest. The transient, business transient, is obviously the shortest booking and therefore the area we've got the least visibility into it. But I would think that corporate transient travel would be comparable, maybe a little bit better than group. And those are all North American centric numbers too. When you look around the rest of the world obviously you see different dynamics. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Can I ask a follow-up question? In your Investor Day, you had talked about some initial steps that you were making with Sheraton identifying sort of the lower-end properties and targeting them first. Can I get a \u2013 I'd like to hear a little bit of update on what's \u2013 how that's progressing. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, we are \u2013 we're encouraged by the progress we've made so far, and as we talked about at the Analyst Day, we have \u2013 we're well underway in conversations with our Sheraton owners and franchisees to make sure that we are getting the input we need to have from them to publish good, detailed brand standards for the Sheraton brand. At the same time, we have looked at both the bottom 25 and then the next bottom 25, so the bottom 50 Sheraton Hotels, and that's by and large relying on guest survey data and what the guests tell us about the way the hotels are being received. We are in discussions probably with 80% \u2013 80% to 85% of those owners of those 50 hotels. Nearly half of those 50, renovations are already underway. And we've got another handful or so where we've got plans that are fairly specific that are evolving. And so that gets us to close to 60% or so of those bottom 50 that we've already got good movement on. By the way, of those 60%, there will be 2 or 3 which we already think pretty clearly will leave the system, because it doesn't make sense for us to keep them and for them to get the kind of capital that would be necessary for them to meet brand standards. But all of that gives us encouragement, though this will be a multi-year effort. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning, everyone. Was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit more on the increase to the capital return guidance. So it looks like it moved up fairly substantially versus the last outlook provided. What was the kind of biggest driver, biggest surprise to where you \u2013 to what you'd provided kind of earlier? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So I think the easiest way to think about it, Shaun, is that you have the Westin Maui, which at $317 million at the end of the quarter, definitely gives us more room for the rest of the year, and then you've got the reality that our EBITDA was higher than we expected, and when you think about how you can lever that and use it, it gets you very quickly to $2 billion. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then sort of the same question as it relates to the costs and the G&A that came in in the quarter, Leeny, but as we think about the $210 million and you guys clearly said a piece of this is timing and related, but kind of what pieces or what components should start to ramp as we move sequentially through the year? And is there any possibility that ends up being, still being a little bit conservative as we just think about some of the puts and takes of the integration here? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I hope so. That's first and foremost. I hope that's conservative. So the way I would think about it is that about, call it not quite half, of the outperformance, I think, you could argue is timing-related, and really will be spent some time in Q2, Q3, or Q4. But then, also, as you think about the hiring that needs to happen in MEA and Europe from the close-down of that, that was definitely part of what ended up driving the outperformance, and all of that hiring is now ongoing, and so the rest of the quarters won't experience that same gap in openings that were held in Q1. So to make a long story short, we do think, when you put the numbers together, that there is probably a little bit more additional savings as we go through the year, but it's also going to be matched with the timing delays that we had in the spending in Q1. So that's how we really get to taking the beat in Q1, and kind of using that for the full year. The other thing I'll point out is that remember, if you're comparing to combined company results, that that \u2013 you have to be careful as we look at that quarter to quarter going through the year, because as we moved through 2016, you were finding that there were people leaving Starwood, so the quarter over quarter comparisons get more difficult. When you look at it the full year, as my comments said, we're comfortable that it will be at least $200 million of the $250 million achieved in 2017. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And, sorry, last one, but did you ever \u2013 had you ever given that $200 million before? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, we talked actually at our last call, we talked about thinking that we'd be roughly $185 million of this $250 million that we felt like in 2017. And frankly, now with the beat, I think we're confident that the $200 million is at least a good number for 2017. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just back to the topic of group and group pace for 2017, when you look at the components of the group pace, is there a big difference between association or large attendance group versus non-association or smaller attendance group? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Short answer is, I don't know. I would \u2013 let me just take a peek here at these notes. Looks like, in order of strength, association would be the strongest. Then corporate, and not surprisingly, you get into things like government, government would be weakest. But not a huge gap between them, between association and corporate. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then your earlier comments, in your earlier comments, Arne, you mentioned that financing for new hotel construction is challenging. Are you willing or are you getting requests to invest more in some of these new projects? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We're not really getting requests to invest in these new projects. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: No. Not meaningfully. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: The bulk of this is about select service franchise development in North America. That is not a place where we have ever really used our balance sheet in a material way, and wouldn't anticipate that that would ever change. I do think, you're not really asking this question, but I'll go ahead and talk about it anyway. I think because of land and construction costs and financing for new builds, I think we're likely to continue to see that 2015 was the sort of peak for signings of select service growth in the United States. And 2016 was obviously strong, as well. I think, 2017 will be strong, but will not be at the same levels that we saw in 2015. And the only way we'll see that ramp back up, I think, would be with definitive proof of a stronger GDP environment, and stronger performance environment, than is even reflected in the guidance that we're giving today. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everybody. Just wanted to talk, shift gears a little bit. Can we talk a little bit about Airbnb. I know it's a topic that hasn't come up in a few months. Seems like there's been a lot of regulation over the past few months surrounding Airbnb, whether it be in New York or San Francisco or across Europe or other cities around the world. I'm wondering if you're seeing, if that regulation is giving you confidence in your outlook, or if that regulation is actually starting to impact your numbers or whether you don't have enough visibility into that yet. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You know, it's a good question, Ryan. I think, the answer is that Airbnb and the home-sharing phenomenon has probably been less impactful to the RevPAR numbers that we've posted the last number of years than folks might first have imagined. And similarly, is probably less impactful today even with what's happening on the regulatory side in a number of cities and states. Now, we will continue to analyze this data as much as we possibly can to understand it, but I think by and large, they are serving a mostly different customer than what we serve at Marriott. They are skewed much more towards leisure. They are skewed much more towards a value-centric customer in the bulk of their business, and if their business is under pressure because of a regulatory environment, I'm not sure necessarily that that customer immediately pops up and shows up in our hotel suites. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: That makes sense. And then I guess, you know, as you think about Airbnb and where they might be going, you know, with the regulatory environment limiting their growth, it seems like there might be an avenue for growth as they potentially enter the OTA market with the idea that they've got proprietary inventory coupled with they already have access to that leisure traveler. Has any \u2013 is that something you guys have given any thought to, particularly as you're negotiating with the OTAs in terms of trying to get better commission rates given Airbnb's commission rate is so much lower than what you guys typically pay to the Expedias and the Pricelines? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, well I'm not sure that clearly Airbnb's total rates are all that different when you look at what they charge the host and the guest, and combine those two as transactional costs in the platform, but let's stand back maybe for a minute from Airbnb specifically. Obviously, we have spent a lot of time analyzing our relationship with intermediaries. We are interested in having those relationships work for us, as well as they possibly can, and be as cost effective as they can. That is about of course negotiating our relationships with them regularly when they come up, and fundamentally it's about making sure we got a loyalty program that gives us the power to have a relationship with a huge percentage of our transient guests, particularly. And we've got, you know, continued great news on the loyalty space with not just 100 million members that we talked about at our Analyst Day, but signing up a million a month or more, and we feel really good about the way that's going. None of our hotels as far as I know has a single room on Airbnb. They certainly should not have a room on Airbnb so we are not today looking at that company as an intermediary in a way that's anything similar to the relationships we have with other OTAs around the world. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: All right. That's it for me. Thanks there. Thanks, Arne. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Arne - Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Given all the \u2013 all the what you've already chopped on the integration and what lies ahead, I think you talked about a couple of the things out there for next year, where does the biggest risk lie? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, so the \u2013 I think, we're off to a good start on the integration, but I think, we are by no means declaring victory today. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. I think, the team is performing extraordinarily well in getting at that work, and they're incredibly energized by what has been accomplished and what we have to accomplish, and what we think we can achieve by accomplishing it. There are plenty of risks around. I think, if you identify one it's going to be around technology. And we are \u2013 you know, it takes longer, it costs more than any of us would like, and I don't think that's unique to Marriott or unique to the hotel business. I think, when you look across the corporate landscape, it is what we see in company after company. And we've got to make sure that we are moving as quickly as we possibly can, because these technology platforms will really allow us to drive, particularly the kind of revenue lift that we think is available, by having one reservations platform and one loyalty platform. And of course, secondarily also allow us to deliver these technology platforms at lower costs to our owners, because we'll be supporting one and not two. And even as we pull those platforms together and do all those things, we want to make sure that we are continuing to innovate and do the kind of new things that our customers expect us to do. So a recent example of that is our investment in PlacePass which is really an online or virtual concierge which helps our customers plan for their trips before going. It's a space that we're very excited about, but we want to make sure our technology platforms allow that to be linked to our loyalty sites and our dotcom sites so that we can drive that business even as we do that and other integration work. So long way of saying technology would be probably the thing that we are maybe most, what, frustrated by the cost, and time associated with it, maybe most fearful about it, but also most convinced that it will drive upside long-term to the performance of the portfolio. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. And then if, as an industry leader, I was wondering if you could give us some comments on a couple of headlines that are out there. The first one is the industry's efforts to lobby Congress regarding Expedia and Priceline. The second one is kind of this airline overbooking news and whether you guys have considered whether you need to make changes to your booking patterns, or, you know, to take away the risk of walk-in guests. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, there \u2013 those are two hot topics. Thank you for that. The \u2013 let's talk about overbooking first. We, about, oh, I don't know, a year and a half ago, two years ago, we expanded the cancellation window for our transient travelers from 6 :00 p.m. the day of arrival to midnight the day before arrival, and that was a very useful tool to reduce overbooking. We do have, in a couple of markets today, a few pilots where we're looking at going to midnight of the day before, so that would be sort of like 48 hours before, and there are a number of reasons we're testing that, but I think that could be helpful on overbooking, as well. Obviously, this is \u2013 there's nothing worse to it \u2013 for a traveler than to show up at a hotel with a confirmed reservation and not have the room there, and so we're trying very \u2013 we measure how many times we have to walk a guest. We obviously do pay for that first night if they end up someplace else, but it's still not a great experience. And so that's an area where we continue to put some effort, and obviously we'd like to be at perfection. We'd like to be full every night without a single room empty and without a single customer walked. Now, that's not necessarily something that we will ever achieve, but I think, we're making good progress on that. I don't have much to say about industry efforts on the Hill about OTAs. I'm not sure I know exactly what the AHLA is doing there. I know there have been things over the course of the last year or two years about real transparency. I think that is not so much about what the conduct of the big OTAs has been, but it is conduct of affiliates that pop up and somehow exist under their sites or exist independently, and may not really have the inventory, and so they may be selling rooms to customers who think they've booked a room in one of our hotels or somebody else's hotel and they show up and actually there's no record of that. And that's probably the thing that we want to be most thoughtful about, because even though we have nothing to do with that booking, it reflects poorly on us, because the customer thinks they've booked a room in our hotel. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you for your time. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from David Beckel with Bernstein. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thank you for the question. This is Bebe for David. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Bebe. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I was just wondering, you've been offering exclusive member rates for over \u2013 a little bit over a year now and looking back have the discounts provided the benefits you expected? Do you plan to continue to offer similar levels of member discounts going forward, or do you expect to curtail those over time? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think member discounts are here to stay. And the reason I say that is because we are encouraged by what we've seen. And obviously we want to make sure that through the loyalty program, we have the relationship with customers that is \u2013 that doesn't require them to sit down and do a spreadsheet calculation to figure out whether it's in their interest to be members of our loyalty program. But instead, where they know without having really to even think about it that if I concentrate my stays with Marriott, I'm going to get \u2013 I'm going to get great rooms, I'm going to get points for my stay, I'm going to get free WiFi, I'm going to get mobile services. And I think the member-only rates are a piece of that equation, which again, I think is working, and will continue for the foreseeable future. Bebe Zhao - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, thanks for sneaking me in. I've got two quick follow-ups. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: First on the net unit growth, what's the breakdown of the pipeline between legacy Starwood and Marriott brands? And how has the pipeline and associated process evolved since the acquisition closed? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Oh, these are good quizzes here, Stephen, at the end. I think the Marriott, legacy Marriott pipeline is proportionately a bit bigger than the legacy Starwood pipeline. So if you think about Marriott and Starwood before closing, Marriott was about twice the size of Starwood, I think in total rooms, 800,000-ish rooms to 400,000-ish rooms. And I think when you look at the pipeline, we're probably, oh, you know, 65%/35%, maybe something like that which would suggest the Marriott pipeline is a little bit bigger, which is not really that surprising. Marriott had many more brands playing in this select service place in the United States than Starwood did, and that's obviously where a number of these rooms in the pipeline from deals signed in 2015, 2016, and currently, are there. In terms of the way the process has changed, there are \u2013 there's nothing really revolutionary. I mean I think Starwood used a similar approach to valuing deals that Marriott did. There were some modest difference in the way the incentives worked for the developers. There are \u2013 which probably intensify the focus on value as opposed to just rooms, as we go forward. I think, Marriott, too, has had a bit different approach to territorials maybe, and particularly cross-brand territorials in some deals. But I view most of those changes as fairly minor, and, you know, as a consequence we've put the team \u2013 the development team was in place globally by the end of calendar 2016. They're working extraordinarily well together, and I think things are going swimmingly. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And then one other quick clarification. I think it was on Shaun's earlier question on synergies. As you captured a bit more in the first quarter maybe than what you expected, are you finding new opportunities, or is there simply a pull forward of things you had already identified? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I would say things that we identify, the best I can describe it, Stephen, is maybe in some respects happening a little bit sooner than we had expected. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks so much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Jared. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Just to ask the group question a little differently. Do you have the number for total group production in the quarter for all future periods? And then have you seen any change in cancellations or attrition? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: The cancellation/attrition story is generally quite positive. So there's less cancellation and attrition than would have been the case in prior periods. Group business, all group bookings in Q1 for all future periods was down modestly in revenue compared to the same time last year. However, last year was up massively from the same measure in 2015 and prior years. So while, obviously, we'd like to be up in every year over and over again, I don't think that the modest decline in revenue on the books in Q1 for all future periods is that concerning. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then, Arne, I think in the past, you used to provide the percentage of your North American hotels that were currently earning IMFs. Do you have that number? And where do you see the next direction for that number? Do you think it will be up or down? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I've actually got it, Stephen (sic) [Jared] (1:02:10). And if we're looking at the percentage, in the first quarter, we're looking at 60% in the total portfolio with about 47% in North America, as compared to a year ago, very similar worldwide. It's about 61%. This is on a combined basis. So this is for both companies. And I think in general, there's a very slight difference between a year ago and this year first quarter, and that's a result of one portfolio of limited service hotels that was barely in the money a year ago Q1 and was not in the money in Q1. Though, to be honest, we expect them to be in the money in IMF this year and 2017, so we'd expect it to kind of get back to where it was for the whole company. The only comment I would make where we see it going is that clearly with international, with the growth in the Asia Pacific portfolio which tends not to have owners' priority, as you might imagine, that is weighing more and more into the percentage of hotels earning incentive fees. While in the U.S., when you've got a midpoint RevPAR of 2%, it's very difficult to hold onto margins or increase them very much relative to earning more incentive fees. So, overall, if we continue to see this kind of RevPAR environment, you might actually year-over-year see North America's percentage not growing, but international continuing to grow. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you very much for the time. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. With the comment about group space being more limited now, are you seeing opportunity to up-mix the group for next year? I guess increasing the stands for more F&B spend on that side? And then on the corporate side, can you give an update of your top 300 customers demand from that segment and are you seeing a difference between select service and the full service hotels? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You said top 200 customers? What did you say? Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Top 300. I believe you guys give that statistic every so often. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Top 300. Well, that's news to me. On the group, generally, yes. I mean I think we are more focused on food and beverage and ancillary spend because of the volume we've got of group business, and I think that will continue to be the case as long as group business on the books remains strong. And I think the top 300 accounts generally are in positive shape. Now, we've got a sort of plus 4%-ish for Q1 for the top 300 accounts, but remember there we get the benefit of Easter, so March was meaningfully stronger this year than last year for business travel, because we didn't have that holiday. And I think that includes the group business as well, which is also primarily related to the calendar. But still net-net, again, it's a bit why we are encouraged on our expectations for the balance of the year. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then between the full service hotels and select service hotels, we're seeing a lot of supply on the select service but demand seems quite strong as well. So I wonder if the business traveler for select service is doing a little bit better than the full service. Can you comment on that? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think they're both actually performing quite well. And if you look at the RevPAR numbers which we published by brand. You'll see that the full-service hotels performed extraordinarily well in Q1. I think the select service portfolio was strong, though, too. And I think that's a sign that demand generally was strong in the quarter. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks. Most of my questions were answered. But if I could, just on the incentive fee front, when you guys think about some of the changes that you've made with the Starwood portfolio, including getting them on your pre-negotiated OTA rate and improving the RevPAR index, is there an opportunity there to see any kind of meaningful push in incentive fees? And what's the timeline on when we would start to see some of those thresholds be met? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So I would say a little too soon to talk about a real analysis of changes in exactly what may be going on with the threshold, particularly as we're really just getting going at putting synergies into place and working through all the portfolios. As you did see, our incentive fee forecast for the year, we've clearly moved up nicely relative to where we were in February. And so from that standpoint, as a result of the strong margin work that is going across in the combined portfolio, we actually had strong IMF outperformance in both Asia Pacific and in North America across the portfolios, so kind of great work across legacy portfolios. It's also worth mentioning that they have a much bigger share of incentive fees that are outside the U.S. and Asia Pacific, which obviously every dollar of RevPAR you get a certain share of that with no owner's priority. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Leeny. That's helpful. And then, if I could, if you guys \u2013 and let's just talk about the $880 million to $890 million range. If you're in that range this year, we would assume that you've kind of hit the $200 million number you referenced earlier. If we think about the incremental $50 million, do we kind of layer that in in 2018 and then assume some form of growth on the just core inflation within the SG&A line? Is that kind of how you're shaping it now for 2018? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. No, I think that's exactly right. I think we'll, obviously, be able to talk a bit more as we get further into the year about 2018. The biggest variable there is about wind-down costs, about how we work our way through making sure that, for example, we're combining the ledgers on the two companies, et cetera, and all of that we're kind of working our way through. I think as we've described it before, we've really talked about the $250 million, we would expect to really feel comfortable that it's kind of more in the latter part of 2018 that when you look at it on a quarterly run rate basis, you see it. But your general approach in terms of inflation with continued savings is right. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Bigger picture capital allocation question for you. Stock's at 15 times EBITDA. The market clearly likes buybacks, but when do those buybacks become less attractive, especially as you think about other tuck-in acquisitions or investment opportunities within the portfolio that might have better returns? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Great question. We look at it all the time. Certainly, first and foremost, we want to be investing in our business in value accretive ways. And whether that is by a contract, by a loan, by a brand acquisition, no matter how we look at it, first and foremost, we want to grow our business. But the reality is we've got a model that generates far more than we need to invest in our business, and we continue to be, as you can tell, from our share repurchase to date, we continue to feel great about returning our shareholders in kind of the balance that we're doing across a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: So as a follow-up, are you not seeing those other opportunities, or buyback still make sense at 15 times earnings? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: No, no, no, we're seeing opportunities, but as I was describing, our model, the reality, the $500 million to $700 million that we've described and the need to basically continue to grow our business that's in the model and we continue to expect to spend that. And to the extent there are other things that come along, we absolutely take a look at them. Mike J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. I wanted to circle back on April. I think you noted it was running up 2%. I'm curious how much of a headwind Easter was to April, and heading into the quarter... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Vince, make sure you heard the data. Year-to-date, April was 2%. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Got it. So I was curious, how much of a headwind you thought Easter would be to April? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Easter will be a headwind to April. And we don't have final numbers yet for April. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: But for... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: It will be a headwind for April and it will be a headwind for Q2. I would think that it's nearly 1 point positive to Q1 and nearly 1 point negative to Q2. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: That's right. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: And please take that as directional because we don't even have final April numbers yet. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Helpful, thanks. And then also just thinking about demand and specifically related to the occupancy gains, I think 1Q showed some nice growth and I'm curious within your full year budget how much you're thinking occupancy will play into it and if you think occupancy will be positive in 2017. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Globally I would think it will be positive, but I think in North America, much more likely to have RevPAR driven by rate as opposed to occupancy I think as the year goes along. Hotels are practically already quite full, and of course, it will depend a little bit quarter by quarter based on the holidays, but the contribution should be more rate-driven. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Telsey Group. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Thank you for allowing me back in. I just wanted to ask... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Are you back for more? David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : I'm back for more, first and last. It was some psychological theory I learned a million years ago... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: There you ago. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : ...primacy and recency. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: There you go. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : But, as we go through the model and we update all of the portfolio of brands, are there any updated thoughts about the range of brands? And, quite frankly, it seems like a lot, a long laundry list of brands, and how sustainable that can be over the very long term? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: No. We are thrilled by the number of brands we have and the range of choice that we can give to our customers, as we've spent obviously time talking about this at the Analyst Conference. There's no different thinking today than we laid out then. And we can all look at our 30 brands and our 1.2 million hotel rooms and say that's a lot, but it's nothing compared to the range of choice that's offered by the third-party intermediaries. And offering more choice to our customers is a great thing. And as a consequence, you should presume that we will continue with these brands and that our effort will not be about getting to fewer brands, but instead getting to emphasize the distinctions between brands and make sure we are driving the compliance, if you will, or the consistency of product quality and service quality so that the customers are experiencing something which is consistent with what each of those brands stand for. David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Appreciate it. Thank you for letting me back in. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our final question in queue today is a follow-up from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Joe? Operator : Joe, if you're on mute... Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you hear me, guys? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Now we can. There you go. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Obviously intuitively for the third quarter in a row, merger related costs decreased on a sequential basis. How much anticipated merger-related costs do you have for the balance of this year? And would you expect that to continue to go down on a sequential basis? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I think the best I could say, Joe, right now is that we have to look at this as we keep moving along and getting through integration. So we don't have a final number for you. I think over $100 million in 2017 is the right expectation. Obviously we've already had $51 million in Q1, so that would kind of argue that we'll continue to move through the year, but exactly where we end up, whether it's $100 million or a bit more, it's too soon to say. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And the $100 million that you're talking about would be on a pre-tax not post-tax basis? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes. That's a pre-tax basis, right. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you all very much for your participation and your interest in the Marriott story. We'd love to welcome you into our hotels as you travel around the world. Talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Marriott International first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued today along with our comments are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs, and we'll compare 2017 results to prior-year combined results, which assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business were completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior-year reported results are in today's press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website, at www.marriott.com/investor So, let's get started. We appreciate you joining us at this late hour. Travel schedules made it difficult to hold this call at our normal 10 :00 a.m. time slot. In fact, today we are here in Shanghai at the new stunning W Hotel, having just announced an exciting joint venture agreement with Alibaba. Larger than Amazon in terms of active users, Alibaba has over 500 million active users on their e-commerce platform, giving them tremendous reach to Chinese consumers. Alibaba's online shopping platform, known as Taobao, or Tmall, makes products available through general sites and storefronts that list the products or services for sale by category and brand. The Tmall travel site, called Fliggy, hosts over 10,000 travel merchants, offering everything from hotels and visa applications to airline services and vacation packages. We are impressed by the power of the Alibaba platform. Through a targeted marketing program late last year with Alibaba, we signed up 600,000 new Marriott loyalty members in just eight weeks. Drawing on resources from both Marriott and Alibaba, the joint venture will create a new Marriott booking portal on Fliggy with enhanced functionality, enabling Marriott to benefit from the broad reach and efficiency of Alibaba's digital Chinese language platform. The joint venture will manage Marriott's storefront, market directly to Alibaba's customer base, leverage Alibaba's IT and marketing infrastructure, and provide a link between Marriott's loyalty programs and Alibaba's loyalty program. The Marriott storefront on Fliggy will offer Marriott member rates and the opportunity to earn loyalty points for Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards and SPG members. The joint venture should enhance our service for Chinese guests when they arrive on property by enabling Alibaba's digital payment system, Alipay, at key properties worldwide across our portfolio. We also expect to broaden our offerings of guest amenities and services appealing to Chinese travelers to more hotels. We believe this relationship with Alibaba will enhance the appeal of our products to Chinese guests, further increase Chinese membership in Marriott Rewards, Ritz-Carlton Rewards, and SPG, and make travel easier. With the joint venture, hotel owners should see both an increase in bookings from Chinese travelers as well as a lower cost for these reservations. Five years ago, we held our Security Analysts Meeting here in China and talked about the tremendous opportunity this country offers. At that time, we noted that China was the third largest source market for outbound travel behind the U.S. and Germany. Today, China is the largest source market for outbound travel. At Davos this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping forecasted that Chinese tourists will make 700 million overseas visits in the coming five years. Not only large and growing, Chinese outbound travel is also maturing. Visa processes have improved at major destinations to facilitate travel and most outbound Chinese travelers are now traveling on their own rather than in a tour group. Fliggy and Marriott will help these travelers find products that are tailored to their interests and offer a seamless travel experience. We've opened a dozen hotels in China year-to-date, and today we have over 500 hotels and 170,000 hotel rooms open or under development in China. In fact, today China represents 8% of our worldwide rooms and 17% of our worldwide rooms pipeline. Here in Shanghai alone, we already have 52 hotels open or in the pipeline. As we've grown our presence outside North America, we have increasingly tailored our hotel designs and service offerings to local consumers and owners, and embraced technology to enhance the guest experience. This joint venture will further both of these goals by dramatically enhancing our online presence and linking it more closely with the Marriott on-property experience in Chinese for the Chinese traveler. While we are here in China to announce the joint venture with Alibaba, we are with you today to talk about earnings. Results in the second quarter were very strong here in the Asia-Pacific region. Constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose nearly 7%, exceeding our expectations. Comparable hotel RevPAR in Greater China increased more than 8%, driven by broad-based strong performance across Mainland China, particularly in cities such as Tianjin, Guangzhou, Sanya, Shenzhen, and many markets throughout Western China. Food and Beverage revenue in China increased 3%. In the second quarter, China represented roughly 6% of our worldwide fees. RevPAR in India increased 10% with solid domestic and international demand, while Japan's RevPAR rose 5%, benefiting from strong leisure travel during the cherry blossom season. We expect third and fourth quarter RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region to increase at a mid-single-digit rate with some upside potential. Now, over to Europe; our Europe hotels are benefiting from improving economic growth and greater U.S. demand, driven by the stronger dollar. As a result, Europe's RevPAR rose 7% on strong transit performance in the second quarter. Constant dollar system-wide RevPAR in the U.K. increased 8% with London up 12%. RevPAR in Spain also increased 12% as the economy has rebounded and U.S. demand has increased. RevPAR in Europe exceeded our expectations, as many markets bounced back from recent terrorism events faster than expected. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect RevPAR in Europe to increase at a mid-single-digit rate, also with upside potential. System-wide constant dollar RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America increased 4% with continued strength in Mexico, which was up 10%. Our resorts in the Caribbean increased RevPAR modestly as travelers returned to the region for the Easter holiday and Zika concerns continued to abate. RevPAR in South America declined 2% on weak economic trends. For the third and fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR in the CALA region will increase at a low-single-digit rate, constrained by weakness in the Brazilian economy and tough comparisons to last year's Olympics. RevPAR rose 2% in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting strong results in South Africa, but flat RevPAR growth in the Middle East. Sanctions on Qatar have reduced travel into and out of that country. Weak oil prices and lower government spending in several countries in the Middle East have also contributed to a bearish travel sentiment in the region. We are modeling a low-single-digit RevPAR decline in MEA in the third and fourth quarter. In North America, first quarter system-wide comparable hotel RevPAR increased 3.1%. In the second quarter, RevPAR rose 0.9% on strong leisure demand, in line with our expectations. Our RevPAR guidance for the third quarter is flattish and we expect the fourth quarter will be up 1% to 3%. While these growth rates seem to vary considerably, they are less volatile than they appear. Excluding the impact of the Washington inauguration in January and the shifting Easter holidays, we estimate RevPAR in both first and second quarter increased roughly 1% to 2%. And excluding the impact of the shifting Jewish holidays and the DNC and RNC conventions last year, we believe RevPAR in both the third and fourth quarter will also increase 1% to 2%. We would characterize this guidance as steady-as-she-goes. With this steady outlook for North America, we expect worldwide RevPAR will increase 1% to 2% in the third quarter and 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. Our development organization continues to fire on all cylinders. We expect to grow our system-wide rooms by 6% net this year. Our pipeline reached a record 440,000 rooms this quarter, which implies embedded growth of 36% of our current system size. In the second quarter alone, we added 36,000 signed or approved rooms to the pipeline. One third of these new room signings and approvals were legacy Starwood brands and 55% were outside North America. Today, we have the largest share of luxury hotels in the world with 426 luxury properties and 113,000 luxury rooms worldwide. Upon completion, our pipeline of luxury hotels should add another 200 hotels and nearly 50,000 rooms. That is over 40% growth implicit in the pipeline. Our brands are strong and continue to be preferred by developers and lenders alike. Based on STR industry pipeline, one in three hotels under construction in the U.S. will fly one of our flags, and worldwide, one in four hotels currently under construction will open under one of our brands. We are very optimistic about the long term. RevPAR is increasing in most markets around the world and our impressive rooms growth will continue to build economics, scale, and consumer preference for our brands. Our integration of Starwood is on track. While there is much yet to do, guest and owner feedback has been positive. I've said it before, but it bears repeating. I'm incredibly proud of the many people working on this integration, and they have my sincere thanks. We relish the opportunity to demonstrate to guests, owners, and you, what we can accomplish with all 30 of our terrific brands. Now, for more about the quarter, here's our CFO, Leeny Oberg. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you, Arne. For the second quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.13, $0.12 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.99 to $1.03. Fee revenue contributed $0.04 of the outperformance with about $0.02 due to better-than-expected property performance driving incentive fees, and $0.02 due to better-than-expected relicensing and branding fees. Results of our owned, leased and other lines outperformed by $0.02, largely due to a business interruption settlement, termination fees, and better overall results. Depreciation and amortization was about $0.02 unfavorable to our expectations due to fine-tuning of purchase accounting associated with the acquisition. We expect to finish purchase accounting adjustments affecting D&A in the third quarter. On the gain line, we recognized about $0.04 associated with the sale of the Charlotte City Center Marriott. Finally, taxes were about $0.04 favorable to expectations, reflecting a favorable tax settlement and greater tax benefits related to stock compensation. Compared to the prior year, total fee revenue totaled $849 million, 8% over prior year combined amounts. Base fees increased 1%, driven by unit growth and RevPAR improvement, offset somewhat by negative foreign exchange impact. Franchise fees increased 12% in the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase in franchise rooms year-over-year and growth in non-property fees. These non-property fees include application fees, relicensing fees, and fees from our timeshare, credit card, and residential businesses, which together totaled over $105 million in the quarter, 23% higher than combined results in the prior year. Relicensing and branding fees were particularly strong. Incentive fees increased 9% year-over-year, largely due to strong managed full-service hotel RevPAR in Europe and Asia, solid RevPAR improvement among managed hotels in North America, and good margin performance around the world. Global house profit margins at company-operated hotels improved 50 basis points during the quarter. While most of the improved margins were associated with RevPAR improvements in International markets, hotels also benefited from synergies associated with the Starwood acquisition, including OTA and procurement savings, revenue management improvement, benchmarking initiatives, savings on maintenance agreements, insurance savings, and lower loyalty costs. These property synergy savings could further improve in 2018. Global incentive fees exceeded our expectations by $10 million in the quarter, largely due to better than expected managed hotel performance in North America, Europe, and Asia. For the third quarter, we expect total fees will increase 5% to 7% on strong unit growth with flattish incentive fees. For the full year, we continue to believe incentive fees will increase at a mid-single-digit rate. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $102 million in the second quarter, compared to $115 million in the prior year. We saw a stronger year-over-year operating performance from hotels in Anaheim, Hawaii, Tokyo, and Toronto, as well as a business interruption settlement. Profits in the 2016 second quarter included $18 million from seven hotels that have since been sold. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses, was $12 million better-than-expected, due to the $5 million business interruption settlement, higher-than-expected termination fees, and better-than-expected results. In the third quarter, we expect owned, leased, and other revenues, net of expenses, will total roughly $75 million, compared to $116 million in the prior year. Our owned hotels in Rio have a particularly tough year-over-year comparison for the third quarter, given last year's Olympics. Profits in the 2016 third quarter included $15 million from hotels that have since been sold. Our guidance for owned and leased hotels assumes no further asset sales this year. For the full-year, we expect net owned, leased results will total approximately $355 million, compared to $426 million in 2016. The full-year comparison to last year's combined results includes $45 million negative impact from asset sales completed since the beginning of 2016, as well as lower hotel results in Rio and New York and fewer termination fees. Adjusted general and administrative expenses totaled $226 million, a $21 million decline from the prior year, reflecting continued cost reductions as the integration continues. We expect G&A will total $215 million to $220 million in the third quarter and $880 million to $890 million for the full-year, consistent with prior guidance. We continue to expect to achieve our annualized $250 million in cost synergies by the second half of 2018, including achieving over $200 million in savings in 2017. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% over combined adjusted EBITDA in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2016 included $18 million from owned assets that have since been sold. We expect adjusted EBITDA will total $770 million to $790 million in the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter of 2016 included $15 million in EBITDA related to assets that have since been sold. For the full-year, we expect EBITDA to total $3.131 billion to $3.201 billion. Full-year comparisons to last year's EBITDA includes roughly $40 million negative impact from sold hotels, including lower profits on the owned, leased line and higher related results on the fee line. Adjusted diluted EPS in 2017 should total $4.06 to $4.18, an increase of 23% to 27% over prior-year combined results. 2017 investment spending could total $500 million to $700 million, including about $175 million in maintenance spending. This includes the very modest amount we are investing for minority interest in the joint venture that we announced today. We have already recycled roughly $800 million of assets since closing the Starwood acquisition, including the sale of the Charlotte Marriott City Center for roughly $170 million, and receipt of a $60 million loan repayment last week, and we anticipate recycling another $700 million by year-end 2018, although no asset sales beyond those completed are included in our earnings or share repurchase guidance. With our success in asset recycling, we've returned considerable sums to shareholders. Since the closing of the Starwood acquisition, we've returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Through last week, we've repurchased nearly 16 million shares for approximately $1.5 billion thus far this year. Excluding the impact of future asset sales, we anticipate returning over $2.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the full-year 2017. This is higher than our expectations from six months ago, due to stronger-than-expected EBITDA and asset sales. We appreciate your interest in Marriott, and we know the hour is late. So, we'll limit the call to one hour, but Laura and Betsy will be available to take your questions afterwards. They are here in Shanghai, so please send an email and they'll call you back. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible on today's call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now. Operator : The floor is now open for your questions. Your first question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I don't know if it's a \u2013 this is something you've looked at, but can you tell what merger savings for the hotel owners ended up adding to your incentives management fees? In other words, where you would have just gotten some percent of that? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, so a couple things. I would say we are very pleased with the margin performance. And in North America, in particular, given the RevPAR environment, I would say the margin performance is terrific. We talked about shooting for something like 50 basis points in margin to get that as quickly as we can, and we see through what we've done so far that we are approaching that for this year. And from that standpoint, that would give us a little bit more on the incentive fee line, but I would say it's probably in the low-single-digits material, and not material, but low-single-digit millions on IMS (21:42). Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And maybe just one quick follow-up on fees. You called out branding and relicensing fees as being particularly strong in the quarter, and I think you raised the full-year by that amount. But was that just a timing issue? In other words, why only higher in Q2 for those things? Because I would think your branding fees would be more consistent, maybe, and would have added to the next two quarters, as well? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So, a couple things there. First of all, we've kind of got two things going on in the branding fees. One is residential and one is related to credit cards. On the credit cards, hard to predict exactly, but they do seem to be doing well so far. But on residential, they are tied to the sales of residential real estate and, frankly, they are fairly lumpy during the year, where they can be up or down $10 million just based on the quarterly progression of where these sales come. So, some of this is timing related, but as we look through the year, we basically took it and rolled it forward to the rest of the year. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hi, I've got a... Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Yeah, good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good afternoon. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I've got afternoon for you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We're not quite sure what time it is here. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Morning for us. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Exactly. So, just a housekeeping item. Do you have the ending share count \u2013 diluted share count at the end of the second quarter? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, we do. Hang on a second Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, we do. I have it for you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You got another question? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: 374 million shares outstanding, and on diluted, approximate basis would be 380.2 million. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. Very good. And then bigger picture question is, getting back to the U.S., we've got somewhat historic highs in occupancies and positive earnings trends at the corporate level, which should combine for a positive pricing environment. And so, I'm wondering, as you think about the next 18 months, are we seeing just the typical EPS growth lag leading to stronger RevPAR, or is there something else holding corporate travel budgets back? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question, Harry, and something we talk about quite a bit. I think there are a few factors going on here. I think GDP probably is still a better reference point for assessing demand than corporate profits are. Obviously, they're both averages of lots of economic activity and lots of participants in the economy. But GDP is a broader measure. Obviously, GDP has been quite anemic. The numbers that have been reported initially for the second quarter feel a little bit better at 2.6%. And if they really are meaningfully better, that will ultimately show up in demand. But GDP has been fairly anemic. Second, I think, is that the occupancy, you look at the quarter numbers are fabulous. System-wide across North America, we're nearly 80% for the full quarter, which is a pretty impressive kind of number. And so, you would expect a little bit more pricing movement. But, I think underneath that, you've got relatively more strength in leisure, which is more price-sensitive than the corporate business is. And I think one of the things we need to keep in mind is, while there are a few iconic companies in the lodging space, it sometimes looks like the industry is fairly concentrated, you've got to remember that we have thousands of franchisees who are pricing their own hotels on a day-to-day basis. And it is a market with radical transparency in pricing. And that may have some impact on our ability to move rates in this cycle compared to prior cycles. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: You all sound very perky for the hour. Impressed. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We're perky. Yep Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, I'm going to start out with kind of staying on this bigger picture topic and your last answer was helpful. But, I'm also wondering if you're seeing any significant differences in corporate travel spend from different industry sub-sectors. Within your largest corporate customers, could we be seeing just weaker corporate travel because industries like retail, oil, gas, and finance simply aren't going to be generating as much travel as they used to? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think that's a perceptive question. In fact, all of these averages hide underneath them pluses and minuses that vary dramatically from company-to-company and industry-to-industry. And, obviously, there are industries like oil and gas, the energy environment, which are much tougher than others. But even if you go to the technology space, for example, technology ranges from companies that have existed for many, many decades to companies that are just a few years old. And when you look across that segment, you'll see that there are companies in there that are being very cautious about travel and very cautious about managing expenses, and others which seem to be spending as if they're having a great party. And that pops up in different ways in different markets. But, I think generally, it leads to a sort of anemic corporate transient business. Especially corporate, which tends to be the bigger accounts, is weaker than sort of what we would call corporate rack rate transient. But even if you look at that and you're not talking about being up a point or so in the second quarter. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, a little more specific, I'm just wondering if we could touch for a moment on the individual property performance. So, luxury and upper upscale, for you guys, performed mostly in line with the STR Chain Scale data. But, peeling back and you're looking at different brands, the W brand seems to continue to underperform, but Marriott did, Courtyard also has been kind of underperforming for a few quarters. So, I was just \u2013 can you walk us through that? Maybe some of it has to do with business, but travel, but just wondering generally what's happening there? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, you've got to remember \u2013 start with the notion that STR industry numbers are being reported as all hotels, not just comp hotels. And so, you're getting new hotels that are just ramping that would not be in our comp numbers. We really are in the second year of performance where we've got true comparisons before we start to report comp. And that singularly is the biggest difference between STR's numbers and the numbers that we would report. We talked about this many times, but the core information to look at is RevPAR Index, and that's how do our hotels perform against the hotels they compete in market-by-market. And there we're performing quite well with modest increases in RevPAR Index in North America, and in other parts of the world, more significant Index, but we're really doing well. When you look at individual brands or individual markets, you mentioned W, for example, W is, I don't remember the number of open comp hotels in the United States, but it can't be much more than 25 or so, maybe even a little bit less than that. So, it's going to depend on our renovation in the hotel, it's going to depend on maybe a piece of Group business, something else. And it's hard to generalize from that kind of small portfolio anything about performance. We're in this brand-new W Hotel in Shanghai, opened five weeks ago. And when we look around the world, we see a pipeline and a portfolio of hotels in the W brand that is extraordinarily exciting. So, the brand is actually doing spectacularly well. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And on the Marriott and Courtyard side, is it also just anomalies there? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: That would be our true comparisons as opposed to all hotels in the market. Brands are doing fine. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: But, again, it's going to depend a little bit on the dynamics. So, in the second quarter, you've got \u2013 and this will be an impact in the third quarter, too. Marriott skews a little bit more towards Group than the industry as a whole. And so, in quarters, where Group is weaker, we're likely to see a little bit more modest performance of that brand, and in quarters where Group is stronger, just the opposite. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Stephen. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. You mentioned the $700 million of asset sales through 2018 that are still coming. Can you just remind us what properties are still being shopped, and how the market for these types of assets has evolved since the acquisition? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Good afternoon, Stephen. So, we've still got about 18 hotels that in some way, shape or form over time we'd love to recycle, and 12 of those are legacy Starwood. And if you think about where they are, you're talking kind of broadly in the Americas. So, 10 of them are in the Americas, 4 of them being in CALA and 6 in North America, including 3 in Canada, and then two in Asia-Pacific. And as we've talked about before, it's not purely the market that you're selling into, it's also a combination of things about whether there's a ground lease, whether there are other zoning things going on related to a certain hotel. And so, from that standpoint, we continue to click along through selling the ones that, frankly, have absolutely no \u2013 nothing that needs to be worked out. And then some things that we need to continue to work through several issues related to the possible sale. But, we continue to feel good about the markets that we're selling into, with the exception of ones like a Rio, for example, where we do have to consider whether it makes sense to perhaps hold on to them for a little while until things improve. But, I think overall, we continue to feel good about the ability to sell these hotels. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then turning back to the integration synergies and maybe a follow-up to Robin and Felicia's questions, how should we be thinking about the potential impact from revenue synergies at this point? And what do you think you've seen so far? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think we're still very early in the process. We are seeing great anecdotal results from our customers. I think the Index performance is really encouraging to us. In full candor, I worried that there could be some dip in top-line performance in the quarters immediately following the close, because of the impact, particularly on Group business from distraction that could have been relevant in quarters before we actually closed the transaction. And what we've seen would suggest that we're performing right through that in a way that's extremely strong. And I think a part of that may be that we are, in fact, taking more share from our customers because of the bigger portfolio here. It's hard to be definitive about it because we don't have, except through partners and only in a somewhat dated way, share of wallet information. We have what we achieve from our customers, and we obviously can analyze that. And secondly, we are continuing to evolve the loyalty program. So, we need to get to a place where we've got a single loyalty program with the simpler interface with our customers, which hopefully, will take place in 2018. But, at this point, we think that there has been revenue lift, but it's a little bit early for us to claim victory. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, good morning to you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey there. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. I apologize if I missed it. Did you say how your Group pace for 2018 is tracking? And also for North America in 2018 as well? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Group pace and \u2013 well, Group pace for North America is all we really have, I think, at the moment. Up modestly in 2018. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Modestly? Okay. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yep. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And then secondly, we're starting to hear a little bit about construction delays due to labor creeping into the development process. Is that something you're seeing at all as well? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think we are seeing the construction process take a little bit longer than we anticipated. And so, the opening seems to have slipped back a little bit by a number of months. We have seen essentially no cancellations, which is a good news. And the other bit of good news is, just looking at very current trends, we are seeing construction starts continuing to move forward with considerable momentum. So, I think the construction markets are tight. I think the labor markets are tight, but the deals are getting done. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from David Beckel of Bernstein Research. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Regarding the Alibaba joint venture, I was curious if you could tell us what percentage of your stays outside of China are Chinese guests, and how you think, if you know, that that benchmark is relative to peers? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, let's see if we can find \u2013 I don't know if we've got that, and it's (36:56) worthwhile, but, let's break this down, sort of think it through aloud. There were about 125 million outbound trips by Chinese last year. And that would include very nearby markets, which get substantial visitation, which would be Macao, Hong Kong, for example. But then also markets like Korea and Japan, increasingly resort destinations, Thailand, I'd call out and Australia, I would call out. And, I think in some of these markets, the Chinese are overwhelmingly the biggest visitors. Take Macao as an example. In other markets, they may be \u2013 I don't know if we've got... Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, in the U.S.... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: In the U.S. it would be tiny. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. 0.2 of a percent. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think the U.S. visitation is about 3 million Chinese visitors to the United States in total. And so, they're going to be a pretty small percentage of business in our hotels or in the industry as a whole. But, in most of these markets, it is going up 25%-ish year-over-year and has been for some period of time. And we see that in essentially all markets around the world. So, it's a bit of a small base in some markets, but the growth is fabulous and I think, it's going to be that way for many years to come. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Just as a reference point for you, roughly three-quarters of the Asia-Pacific travel right now is to Asia-Pacific, to other parts of Asia-Pacific, while the travel to, for example, for our hotels to the North America is 15% of their travel. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. That's very helpful, thanks. Just as a quick housekeeping, can you update us on your \u2013 the components of your RevPAR guide by Group, leisure, and business transient? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: For Q3 and Q4? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: For the full-year... David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: For the full-year, yeah. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: If you're talking about full-year in North America, if you're talking about 1% to 2%, I'd say a little bit higher on the transient side than the midpoint, a little bit lower on Group, but very, very close to each other. So, similar sorts of growth rates. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hello, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just with respect to your Alibaba announcement from earlier today, is this an exclusive deal? In other words, can they replicate this with other hotel brands? And how long \u2013 if it is an exclusive deal, how long is that period of exclusivity? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: There are some features of exclusivity in this deal for a period of time. And that's about as far as we'll go. We have a lot to do together. I think we are going to be focused on doing that together. And we're excited about it. I know Alibaba is excited about it. I think this is a joint venture that would not have happened had we not done the Starwood transaction. I think when the Starwood transaction was announced, Alibaba was one of the companies that saw it and said we are very intrigued by the size of this portfolio, particularly with luxury and lifestyle and sort of the aspirational kinds of hotels that are in our portfolio, and we want to do meaningfully more business with you, Marriott, to help you and to help us. And we think that working together, just the two of us, we can accomplish a lot that's good for us and they can accomplish a lot that's good for them. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And Arne, is it fair to say that the three-year outlook that you gave at the Investor Day doesn't incorporate any of the benefits from this deal in particular? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, that's right. But I think the most important part of the benefits of this deal will be driving hotel demand, which obviously will then come through our P&L and RevPAR and fees and incentive fees and the like. While we could conceivably make money on the joint venture itself, but that is not our primary focus on this. And I would caution you not to build anything into the model at this point until we can give you some more sort of color in that in the quarters ahead. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Right. As I described, Joe, it's a really very modest investment. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And just to clarify, I think your comment you made before, Leeny, about the $700 million by the end of 2018, is that asset sales, or is that all in total capital recycling? And is there a difference? I think there is a difference, but if you can clarify that. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: You know, it is asset recycling as the way we've described the $5 billion over time, but, obviously, that's overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly driven by hotel sales. I mean, there is, as you heard us talk about, there's a $60 million loan repayment that we just received last week from a loan that we had out. But overwhelmingly, it's asset sales. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker of Canaccord Genuity. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Ryan. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Ryan Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Just a follow-up on some of the asset questions you guys have had. We've heard from a lot of the REITs during this turning season that liquidity in the debt markets has really opened up. We, obviously, saw a private equity bid for one of the hotel REITs during this quarter. I'm just wondering is with the $700 million worth of assets that you guys have highlighted, you know, I understand from, Leeny, what you mentioned with \u2013 you've got some ground leases, you've got some other complications, is it realistic to believe that a portfolio transaction could be put together? Or do we think that's really off the table and is really going to be more one-off transactions going forward? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: One-off transactions. You've got a wide variety of everything from foreign countries to particular issues on ground leases to different kinds of hotels. Obviously, different kinds of investors who are interested in those hotels, so, absolutely I would say these are going to be onesies and twosies. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then the only other thing I wanted to touch upon was could you give us any color on how things are performing with the changes in cancellation policy that's obviously being going around the industry? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, it's been \u2013 I don't remember precisely, maybe a month, I suppose, since we announced that, maybe a little bit \u2013 June 15, is that when it was? So, six weeks. And what we've heard back has been encouraging. And we're not surprised by that. We did some beta testing in some markets before rolling it out as a brand standard, to see how customers responded to it. Nobody likes incremental restrictions on the flexibility of reservations, but I think most customers understand that we've got a need to manage our inventory and avoid walking people and doing those sorts of things. And as a consequence, the response has been just fine and we think really no impact on the business. Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: All right, that's helpful, thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning to you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Thomas. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, just on your North America RevPAR guidance, first half RevPAR guidance \u2013 RevPAR came in at up 2%, and you chose to cut the guidance to 1% to 2% from 1% to 3%, so, can you just talk a little bit more what went behind that? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, this will be repeating a little bit what I said in the prepared remarks, but if you look at the first two quarters, we reported at about 2%, but if you back out the impact of the inaugural, and obviously, Marriott has got a big presence in the Washington market, we're really running more at like 1.5%. And that's \u2013 essentially you could do that by taking February through June, if you will. And as we've said in the prepared remarks, if you look at Q3, which we say roughly flattish. Why? Because you've got the loss of the political conventions in July, you've got shifting of July 4 towards even more midweek than it was last year, which makes the week tougher, and you've got the shift in Jewish holidays into Q3 and out of Q4. And so, if you kind of adjust for those, you're probably in the same 1% to 2% ballpark. And you look at Q4, you obviously have the benefit in Q4 of the Jewish holidays having shifted to Q3. So, the reported numbers will be better. But we see there's still a sort of 1% to 2% range. Obviously, we debated whether or not we should leave our North American guidance at 1.3%, but we couldn't figure out a math that made 3% germane any longer. When you really look at the 1% to 2% reporting, we think that's kind of the pace we're running at. You can't have the results we've had year-to-date be flattish in Q3 and expect that you're going to get to a 3% number, so we thought it was better to narrow the range. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful, thanks. And just a quick follow-up, compared to your prior EBITDA guidance, did asset sales post May 8 have any impact on your new guidance? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, it did. If you think about it, the last guidance that we gave included the assumption that you had Charlotte for the full year. It was sold in June, so, as a result, you then drop that out for the rest of the year. Now, that's not a major impact, but it does have a bearing. It's going to be several million. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. That's what I thought. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Shaun Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. So, a lot of my questions have been touched on, but maybe just one on the guidance and then maybe one on China. But, the one on guidance would just be we've seen, as a lot of people have reported this earnings season, that some of the select-service type brands have underperformed across the industry. And as you guys look at what you're seeing in performance there, how much of that would you characterize as more about the corporate environment? And then how much of that do you think might start to have anything to do with supply? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Oh, I think \u2013 that's interesting. The corporate environment is probably, in some respects, less relevant to the select-service brands than to the full-service brands. It's not irrelevant. Obviously, you've got individual business travelers that are staying there, particularly midweek. But the portfolios are broad. They tend to be a bit more sub-urban, they probably tend to be more in energy markets than the full-service brands would be, and energy, obviously, is an industry that's tough. So, there's some dynamic of this which is about the distribution of that product. Could there be a supply piece to it, too? Of course, I mean, the supply growth which is occurring in the industry is disproportionately in upscale, not in upper upscale. And so that has an impact. But generally, our view is the sky is by no means falling in the select-service space. These are hotels that are performing quite well and are quite profitable, and when you look at what's happening on the development side, you see that our development partners want to do more of them, not less. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that. And then, like I said, switching over to China, and you had mentioned, I think, that 6% of your fees right now are coming from China, or something to that extent. What kind of growth rates are you seeing when you kind of add up the fact that you're obviously growing RevPAR extremely quickly at the moment in that market and also probably have a very healthy pipeline? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I could think it through with you, but certainly our fee growth is double-digit in China, maybe mid-teens or something even. But because we are getting 6% or 7% RevPAR growth, which is driving at least the same comp hotel performance, probably even a bit better because of incentive fees, not dramatically different because the way the formulas are, but a little bit better because of incentive fees. And we're growing units at much more than the 6% net, which is our average around the globe. It's probably unit growth more in the 10%-plus range. We can provide that to you supplementally at some point in time, but it's a very healthy growth rate, both in China and Asia-Pacific as a whole. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I'd say it's probably 13% to 15%. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Bill. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Your comments on your dealings with the larger corporate clients, sets up a pretty weak time of corporate rate negotiations this fall. And I'm just curious, last fall you had, I think, what were very strong results from special negotiated rates, and it really didn't follow through to any incremental business, right? We haven't seen it. So, I'm just curious, going into that period, it feels like we're negotiating from a much worse position. Is that fair to say? And do you focus more on occupancy as opposed to rate in that environment? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: It's a good question. To me, it feels comparable to last year's negotiating session on special corporate rates, maybe actually a little bit better. Don't under-appreciate the optimism, which still seems to exist in the market and in corporate America these days. And compare it to the point of view last August, September, and October, you're talking about a pre-election time. I think there was not a sort of robust optimism. Economy seemed to be producing, again, fairly anemic GDP growth. And I think in some respects, while that fairly anemic GDP growth has continued into 2017, there is still some optimism. You can see it reflected in certainly the equities markets and other places. That will flavor a little bit those sorts of conversations. So, I think when we get into those negotiations, we will, obviously, start with we're running high occupancies and your profits are good and talking about the terms that are a part of those contracts. And I suspect we'll sort of end up in the kind of range we negotiated last year, although we'll have to see. It obviously is something that we're just starting at this point in time. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. Arne, real quick, last quarter, you talked about franchise application volumes peaking in 2015 and being flat in 2016 and down in 2017. Has that continued as this year has progressed? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, I mean, I talked about the \u2013 that's really about select service growth in the United States and I think we signed more deals in 2015 than we did in 2016, when you adjust, obviously, for apples to apples and new brands and the Starwood merger and the rest, our numbers are continuing to go up because we are bigger with more brands. And there are some tremendous opportunities as we go forward. We look at the strength of \u2013 a renewed strength of Aloft and Element, for example, and what we hear from our franchisees, they are much more interested in those brands than they were in the past. AC Hotels is on fire in the United States as well as elsewhere, and Moxy looks like a global home run. So, there's some good stuff there. But, when you look at the United States, I think what we see is very healthy steady growth, but probably not at the levels fairly adjusted that we saw in 2015, and I don't think we'll get back to 2015 levels unless the economy with greater clarity improves from where it is today. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Safe travels. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Wes. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Looking over at the Greater China region, it looks like you have the most demand growth there, but that's the one region where you don't have any pricing power. And can you comment on when you think that region will get pricing power? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I'm not sure I'd say that it has no pricing power. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Right. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: China's obviously a very big market. Asia-Pacific is a very big market. Even you look within China, Shanghai trades very differently from Chengdu, for example. And in years past, what we saw is much greater strength in Shanghai than in a market like Guangzhou, although Guangzhou has started to turn decidedly more positive. And it's driven by occupancy and intensity of demand, and I think we'll see that we continue to have probably more ability to move rates in the strongest markets in the years ahead than we've had in the last few years. But we feel actually quite good about it. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then maybe just looking at that occupancy, it looks like it's only 70.8%, which is still well below the U.S. Not every market is comparable, but do you have a lot more upside on the occupancy there? Are these just assets taking a few years to stabilize? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I suspect they'll stabilize a little bit lower than assets in North America. But there is, within the comp portfolio, a lot of hotels that have opened relatively recently and a lot of markets which are just sort of being defined. And as a consequence, I think we'll see as they mature that they will continue to build occupancy going forward and that gap probably will shrink to some extent in the years ahead, because we'll have relatively higher percentage which are comp hotels \u2013 sort of truly comp hotels, in other words, stabilized hotels. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, everyone, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Leeny, just to kind of go back a little bit with respect to your incentive fees, obviously, all the parts are in place, your international business is growing well. I believe there was a line in the release that talked about more than half of your incentive fees were obviously coming from outside of North America, and you had about 64% generating incentive fees. In the first quarter, I think you guys guided incentive fees down 10% for the quarter and obviously grew nicely. For the 2Q, it was flat and grew nicely. For the 3Q, you had commented on flat again. All the elements are kind of in place to see some of the growth that we've been seeing, but it seems like the outlook around incentive fees remains somewhat tempered. Did we pull some fees forward in this year, or is everything fairly linear and we could think about a relatively robust back half, absent kind of the flattish guidance for the 3Q? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So, really good question, and definitely you point out something that is true, that we have, I think, been fairly conservative as we looked at IMF as we started the year. Part of it, again, if you remember, FX, I think when we started the year, we thought that we were going to end up with a stronger dollar through the whole year, and I think that we have seen some lessening of that impact. We've frankly seen stronger margin performance than we expected in some markets, which has been helpful, and so we've outperformed. There is the reality, the way that we book our incentive fees, that as you go through the year, you have the possibility of having to give some back, depending on the performance of the various seasons during the year. And I think it is the case that in Q3, given the RevPAR that we're looking at, we could see that that happens. But, as we've said, you've described the beginning of the year, we have moved to where we're talking mid-single-digits growth rate for incentive fees for the year, which I think does reflect the fact that we've had a bit stronger performance on the profit line than at the beginning of the year we anticipated. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Last year at this time, you noted Group for 2017 was pacing up about 7%, and right now it sounds like it's on track for a little bit shy of 1.5%. Curious if that's evolved as you've expected in the last 12 months. And then I think you noted Group for 2018 was pacing up modestly. Like, what's your best guess at how that evolves in the next six months? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, it's a good question. I think Group has softened a bit more than we would have anticipated. Now, we always anticipate, when we start a year with mid to high-single-digit Group revenue on the books above the prior year that we'll give some of that back over the course of the year because some of that is about booking earlier, and therefore having a bit less capacity in the year, for the year Group business. But I think to be fair, we're forecasting right now and believing right now that we're going to end up staid-and-paid Group business in the books in 2017 a bit less than what we would have anticipated when the year began. And I think we're seeing 2018 a touch more modest than we would have expected a few quarters ago. Why? You know, it's probably a little bit the lengthening of the booking window. It's probably a little bit tough comparisons. Think about that 80% occupancy, roughly. And we've been putting a lot of Group business on the books for the last few years, so that gets a little bit tough. But I think there's probably a piece of some corporate cautiousness that is preventing us from posting even better numbers. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then just as you think about the fourth quarter, I know there's some push/pull with the holidays, September, October. How is October pacing? And are you feeling really good about that month? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: October will be a great month. Now, part of that is the Jewish holidays that were in October last year will not be in October this year. But the Group business on the books for October, a benefit of that holiday shift, October will be a great month. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: And the fourth quarter will be a great quarter. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I should keep my fingers crossed and knock on wood when I say it that definitively, but October and the fourth quarter as a whole will be obviously a fairly strong quarter, certainly compared to Q3. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: And the difference in Group between the two quarters is marked. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: All right, I think this is the last question. So, have at it. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning to you guys. Arne, you referenced some upside potential in the back half for both Asia and Europe. How should we think about that comment in relation to the full year 1% to 3% RevPAR guidance? Does that imply upside to the guide or are those just \u2013 those two regions are just not really big enough to move the needle? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I think \u2013 well, they're big. And I think if you look at the year-to-date and you look at the guidance numbers, the relative softness in the U.S. compared to maybe our hopes, I suppose, has been at least offset by the greater strength that we've seen outside the United States. So, while we've brought down, for example, to 1% to 2% instead of 1% to 3%, the North American number for full year, we're sticking at a global system-wide number of 1% to 3% because we think that international contribution is at least as strong as the risks in the United States. How it ultimately pans out, we'll have to see. But we've done our best to reflect the best guidance we've got in the numbers we've give you this morning \u2013 this afternoon, I should say. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Okay. And then, Arne, I thought your point on pricing transparency this cycle perhaps may be holding back rate a little bit. I thought that was interesting. Can you elaborate on that a bit? Are you specifically referring to some of these third-party sites that are monitoring fares? Is it OTAs, home sharing, maybe a combination of all of it? We'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I think it's all of it. But it's not particularly focused on home sharing or the disruptors in the space. It's much more about just the ubiquity of information. And I think with each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel, quite simply, within our own system. So, you've got that transparency on Marriott.com just as you do through other platforms. And with an increasing participation in the industry of the franchise community with individual pricing decisions that are being made by individual hotels, I think that's the world we live in. It does not mean that there won't be ability to drive rate in the future. We do have the ability to drive rate, certainly on midweek nights and others where the hotels are effectively full. But I don't think it's quite the environment we might have had in years past where probably there's a little bit more flexibility to do that. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you all very much for your time and attention this afternoon. We appreciate your flexibility, particularly with the schedule change, to pull you in after the markets close instead of as they open. But we thank you, as always, for your interest in Marriott and we wish you the best for the rest of the summer. Get out there and stay in our hotels. We'd love to be able to welcome you. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

During our presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we will open the call for your questions. It is now my pleasure to hand our program over to Arne Sorenson, President and CEO of Marriott International. Sir, you may begin. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday, along with our comments, are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs, and we'll compare 2017 results to prior year combined results which assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare business were completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported results are in the press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. So, let's get started. This has been an eventful quarter, from Hurricane Harvey and its historic flooding in Texas, to hurricanes Irma and Maria and their relentless pounding of the Caribbean, Florida and parts of the southeast, to two earthquakes in Mexico and then the devastating fires in Northern California, all within a quick seven-week period. We have a presence in these communities, and our crisis management and property teams have worked tirelessly to ensure associate, guest and property safety. Not only have these events damaged property and upended lives, they have also impacted local economies, many of which are very dependent on tourism. As these areas repair, rebuild and recover, we encourage you to support their efforts. One Sonoma restaurant owner recently said to a New York Times reporter, there are so many people who want to do something. The most important thing we can do is to tell people we're open, we're here and we want them to come. So, let's talk about our quarter and the trends we are seeing in the business. Worldwide, system-wide RevPAR rose 2.1%, just above the high end of our worldwide RevPAR guidance. In North America, system-wide comparable hotel RevPAR increased 0.4% in the third quarter, a bit better than our roughly flat guidance in part due to the favorable RevPAR impact from the hurricanes. In the third quarter, leisure demand was strong and association group business was better than expected. While corporate, group and transient demand remains cautious, we've seen few cancellations, little attrition, and our funnel of new but unsigned group bookings is improving. Combined, the shifting Jewish holidays, the tough comparisons to last year's political conventions, and the day of the week shift in the July 4th holiday reduced our third quarter North American system-wide RevPAR growth by about 100 basis points, while the disruption associated with hurricanes Harvey and Irma increased North American RevPAR by about 25 basis points. Five hotels remain closed in Florida and another five are closed in Texas. In the third quarter, the Caribbean and Latin America region experienced two major earthquakes, three tropical storms and four hurricanes. The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were particularly hard hit. As a result of these efforts \u2013 events, we no longer include 18 properties in this region in our comp set for purposes of calculating RevPAR performance. We're excluding eight hotels because they have sustained severe damage and are taking few guests, and we are removing 10 properties because they are closed. For the revised comp set, system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 2% in the quarter largely due to solid RevPAR growth in Central America and better demand in Argentina. Third quarter RevPAR was flat in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting higher RevPAR in Egypt, moderate growth in South Africa, and an 8% RevPAR decline in the Middle East. Sanctions on Qatar have reduced travel into and out of that country while weak oil prices and lower government spending have constrained RevPAR growth in other Middle East markets. In the Asia-Pacific region constant dollar systemwide RevPAR rose 8% exceeding our expectations largely due to strong leisure demand. Comparable hotel RevPAR in Greater China increased nearly 11% driven by strong GDP growth, while RevPAR in India rose 7%. The strength in the China economy is being felt outside that country as well, where room nights sold to Mainland China travelers increased nearly 20% in the third quarter. In Europe third quarter RevPAR rose nearly 9% with strong leisure demand in Spain and Italy, and great fare (05: 59) business in Germany. Room nights sold to U.S. travelers visiting our hotels in Europe increased 11% in the quarter. Istanbul continues to recover with strong Middle East demand on easy comps. For the fourth quarter we expect RevPAR will increase 2% to 3% in North America as we benefit from the holiday shift and continued hurricane-related demand in Texas and Florida. North America group pace is up 5% for the quarter. For international markets, we expect RevPAR will grow 3% to 5% and worldwide we expect RevPAR will increase 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter. With the benefit of the third quarter's actual RevPAR and expected fourth quarter performance, we now expect full year 2017 worldwide systemwide RevPAR to grow 2% to 3%, up from 1% to 3% a quarter ago. We are only partway through our budget process for the upcoming year, but the early indications are that 2018 RevPAR growth will be similar to growth expected for full year 2017. In North America, we expect special corporate rates currently in negotiation will increase at a low single-digit rate, and in the absence of accelerated economic growth, special corporate volume for comparable customers is likely to be flat. Government per diems for 2018 vary considerably by market, but overall in the U.S. should rise 3% to 4%. Today's 2018 group revenue booking pace for our full-service hotels in North America is up nearly 2% and we believe that is a fair estimate of how group will perform. Assuming continued cautious corporate demand, we expect 2018 North American RevPAR will be flat to up 2% largely driven by room rates and slightly stronger in full service than in select service. For those of you who are modeling quarter-to-quarter RevPAR performance, recall that 2018 first quarter lodging demand will have tough comparisons from the 2017 inauguration and women's march in Washington, D.C. and an earlier Easter and Passover in 2018. For our international markets, we expect RevPAR will increase 3% to 5% in 2018 with strong mid-single-digit growth expected in the Asia-Pacific region, low single-digit growth in Europe, Caribbean and Latin America regions, and slightly positive RevPAR growth in the Middle East, Africa region. This should yield worldwide systemwide RevPAR growth of 1% to 3%. Turning to development, in the third quarter our worldwide development pipeline reached a record 450,000 rooms, which is 36% of our current system size, and worldwide room openings totaled 23,000 rooms, a new single quarter record. Our brands continue to be preferred by developers and lenders alike. Based on STR industry pipeline data, our brands continue to represent a leading 35% of hotels under construction in the U.S. and one in four hotels under construction worldwide. With eight leading brands, our worldwide pipeline of luxury rooms totaled nearly 50,000 at quarter end or more than 40% of our current distribution. In the third quarter alone, we signed or approved seven new luxury projects including the new Luxury Collection Hotel in Japan, a Ritz-Carlton resort in St. Lucia and an EDITION hotel in Arizona. Our worldwide pipeline of upper upscale rooms totals 132,000 with about half located in the Asia-Pacific region. The Marriott Hotels and Sheraton brands are particularly strong in Asia, while the Autograph and Delta brands are building a meaningful conversion pipeline in North America. Worldwide, our limited service pipeline totals 270,000 rooms with growing interest from owners and franchisees around the world. Five years ago, only one-quarter of our pipeline outside North America consisted of limited service rooms. Today, such rooms represent over 40% of our international pipeline. In the last 12 months, Marriott's gross room additions totaled 6.6% and deletions were 1.1%. New hotel signings remain strong, and our pipeline has grown 7% in that same period. We are not seeing project cancellations or any hesitancy to sign new deals, but shortages of skilled tradesmen, contractors, and subcontractors are delaying openings. This is particularly true of high-value, complex projects such as dual-branded hotels, urban properties, high rises, and large custom projects. Today, these non-prototype projects make up over half of our limited service openings in the U.S. Looking ahead, we believe the high demand for construction talent in hurricane, fire, and earthquake-damaged areas, continued political disruptions in the Middle East, and a growing proportion of complex limited service projects in the U.S. could further lengthen average construction periods by a few months. Despite these issues, we believe our leading 1.2 million room worldwide system will grow by nearly 7% gross in 2017 and roughly 7% gross in 2018. As you may recall, we have typically deleted about 1% of rooms each year. Today, we are estimating deletions across our entire portfolio will total 1% to 1.5% in both 2017 and 2018. This unusual level of deletions is largely related to the Sheraton brand. We expect 6,000 Sheraton rooms will exit the system in 2017 with another 4,000 rooms departing in 2018. We have launched a full-court press to improve the Sheraton brand. We are working to increase accountability, quality assurance, and capital investments while applying Marriott's systems and programs to drive the top line and reduce costs. These are still early days, but we believe we are making real progress and owners are noticing. In fact, we signed 3,500 new Sheraton rooms in the last 12 months alone, with representation from all of the continents. We've never been more optimistic about our business, our underlying competitive strengths and our long-term growth potential. The Starwood integration is on track. We have identified more synergies and more business opportunities than we anticipated. We continue to believe we will achieve $250 million of G&A savings and expect to do that in 2018 and we continue to improve our products, services, and systems to enhance the value of every room night. To tell you more about the quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny Oberg. Leeny? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you, Arne. For the third quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.10, roughly $0.12 ahead of the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance $0.96 to $0.99. On the fee line, we picked up about $0.02 of outperformance with about half due to better than expected hotel results and half due to better re-licensing and branding fees. Our owned, leased, and other line outperformed by $0.03 with about half from purchase accounting revisions for the Starwood acquisition with the remainder from strong hotel performance and higher-than-expected termination fees. G&A was $0.03 better-than-expected, sourced roughly equally from a tax credit, favorable purchase accounting revisions, and timing. Our gain line was about $0.01 better than expected due to a transfer tax settlement. And finally, taxes were about $0.03 better than guidance due to greater tax benefits related to stock compensation. Compared to the prior year, total fee revenue was $831 million, 8% over the prior year, and 2% ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. Base fees increased 1% over the prior year, driven by unit growth and RevPAR improvement and offset somewhat by negative foreign exchange impact and the impact of terminations and contract changes. Franchise fees increased 13% in the quarter, reflecting unit growth, higher RevPAR, and growth in non-property fees. These non-property fees include application fees, re-licensing fees, and fees from our timeshare, credit card, and residential businesses which together totaled over $105 million in the quarter, 24% higher than the prior year. We expect these fees will grow roughly 20% in the full year 2017 from $350 million to over $420 million. Incentive fees increased 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to strong managed full-service hotel RevPAR in Europe and Asia, and good margin performance at company-operated hotels around the world. Global house profit margins at company-operated hotels improved 40 basis points during the quarter. Hotels continue to benefit from synergies associated with the Starwood acquisition, including OTA and procurement savings, revenue management improvements, benchmarking initiatives, savings on maintenance agreements, and insurance savings. Our hotels are also benefiting from a 10 basis points reduction in our centralized charge-out rate for our loyalty program, and we expect to reduce such charges by another 10 basis points beginning in 2018. We expect additional property cost savings as integration proceeds. Adjusted owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $94 million in the third quarter compared to $116 million in the prior year. Since the beginning of the 2016 third quarter, we've sold five hotels, in each case retaining long-term management agreements. These properties contributed $15 million in profits in the 2016 third quarter, making a tough comparison for third quarter 2017. Growth in the 2017 quarter was also depressed by the tough comparisons to the 2016 Olympics in Brazil, weak results in New York, and renovations at two leased hotels in Europe. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of expenses, was $19 million better than expected due to $9 million of favorable purchase price adjustment, as well as higher-than-expected termination fees and better-than-expected results at hotels in Canada. Adjusted depreciation and amortization totaled $70 million in the quarter compared to $81 million in the 2016 third quarter. The decline was largely due to the impact of hotels that we sold or moved to assets held for sale. Adjusted general and administrative expenses totaled $201 million in the third quarter, a $36 million decline from the prior year, largely reflecting continued cost reductions as the integration continues. Compared to our expectations, G&A was $17 million better than the midpoint of our guidance due to a $6 million state tax credit, a favorable $4 million of purchase accounting revisions, and timing. In total, purchase accounting revisions in the adjusted third quarter income statement totaled a net favorable $16 million pre-tax. These represent the income statement impact of the final adjustments to the fair value of assets and liabilities, which we acquired in the Starwood deal. Congratulations and a big thank you to the finance team, who has worked tirelessly on this since completing the acquisition a year ago. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 7% over combined adjusted EBITDA in the prior year. The 2016 quarter included $15 million from owned assets that we have since sold. For the fourth quarter, we expect fee revenue will total $825 million to $835 million on higher RevPAR, unit growth, and margin improvement. The 20 hotels that are closed due to the storms earned $2 million in fees in the fourth quarter in 2016 and $12 million in fees for the full year 2016. We expect owned, leased, and other, net of direct expense, will total roughly $90 million in the fourth quarter compared to $109 million in the year ago quarter. Profits in the 2016 fourth quarter included $21 million from four hotels that have since been sold. Last month, we announced an agreement to sell Avendra, a leading North American hospitality procurement services provider. Avendra has been a terrific success and we believe the combination with Aramark should further increase scale and drive even better results to our hotels. We expect to receive roughly $650 million at closing for our 55% share of Avendra and such proceeds will be invested for the benefit of our system of hotels. We're currently developing these investment plans and will disclose amounts as they are spent. When the Avendra transaction closes, we will likely record a meaningful gain on the sale, but we expect to back out the gain from our adjusted EBITDA as a special item. Assuming no gain in the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter diluted EPS will total $0.98 to $1, and adjusted EBITDA will increase 1% to 3% to reach $762 million to $777 million. This is a bit lower than the implied guidance at the end of the second quarter, largely due to delays in G&A spend, the impact of the sale of the Toronto Sheraton, and lower depreciation associated with reimbursed costs. The fourth quarter of 2016 included $21 million in EBITDA related to assets that have since been sold, as well as an $8 million favorable litigation settlement. For the full year 2017, we expect adjusted diluted EPS will total $4.22 to $4.24, an increase of 28% over prior year combined results and we expected adjusted EBITDA will total $3.18 billion to $3.19 billion, an increase of 6% to 7% over 2016. Since the beginning of 2016, we've sold nine hotels, in each case retaining a long-term management agreement. These properties contributed roughly $90 million in owned lease profits in fiscal 2016 compared to $45 million expected for the full year 2017. Our 2017 outlook does not include any impact from the ongoing renegotiation of our credit card agreements with JPMorgan Chase and American Express. We expect to finalize our credit card negotiations by year-end or shortly thereafter, and won't likely be able to estimate the P&L impact to Marriott until early 2018. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investment and share repurchase. 2017 investment spending could total $550 million to $650 million, including about $175 million in maintenance spending. We've already recycled more than $1.1 billion of assets since closing the Starwood acquisition, including the sale of the Sheraton Toronto for roughly $270 million and the receipt of a $65 million loan repayment early in the fourth quarter. We remain comfortable with our estimate of $1.5 billion of asset recycling proceeds since the closing of the Starwood acquisition to year-end 2018, but expect few additional proceeds will be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. With our success in asset recycling, we've already returned over $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through last week, and expect we will approach a record $3.5 billion returned to shareholders for the full year. Compared to our expectations we discussed last quarter, our cash return to shareholder has increased due to roughly $350 million of incremental asset recycling, higher EBITDA levered appropriately, lower and a bit later capital spending, and higher working capital, including the impact from growth in our loyalty programs. The higher cash return is not related to the expected cash from the sale of Avendra. At September 30, 2017, our common shares outstanding totaled 366.4 million shares, 6.2% lower than the prior year amount. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Excluding merger-related costs, our debt ratio on September 30 was at the low end of our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.5 times adjusted debt to combined adjusted EBITDAR. As we typically do in our third quarter release, we've provided our preliminary view of 2018 RevPAR and unit growth today. Our hotels' budgets are not yet complete and we're still quantifying the impact of FASB's new revenue recognition rules, which will be effective at the beginning of 2018. You'll find a general overview of the new rules described in our third quarter 10-Q that we plan to file later today or tomorrow. Bottom line, this is an accounting change. It doesn't impact cash or the economics of our business. We expect to release fourth quarter and full-year results mid-February, and will work to provide 2017 results by quarter under the new revenue recognition rules as soon as possible thereafter. As you know, it's our practice to provide fulsome guidance for each upcoming quarter and current year. Given our continued finance integration efforts and the work to present 2017 results under the new rules, we expect our first quarter 2018 earnings guidance is likely to be a bit less detailed than usual. We appreciate your patience. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible on today's call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now. Operator : Your first question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Harry, how are you? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : Hi, fine. Good morning, everyone. My question is how can Marriott respond to the increase in pricing transparency apps, like Yapta and Tingo, particularly with respect to close-end bookings? To what degree is it impacting your ability to price higher than, say, the low single digits in an environment where GDP is actually beginning to accelerate? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question, Harry. I think, the \u2013 we obviously are taking a very careful look at the continued evolution of a number of these apps, and obviously, we live in a world with radical transparency in pricing, where prices are available for essentially every hotel at an instant notice. We are doing everything we can. I mean, obviously, the core platform for us is the loyalty program, and we continue to see that the room nights coming from our loyalty program are continuing to increase, approaching 55%, I think, across the world today. And that's a powerful thing. Obviously, some of these other booking platforms are not conducive to loyalty members, because they will not earn points associated with them. I think beyond that, steps around the redemption formulas for the loyalty programs, which we want to continue to adjust, we've already made some changes so that hotel owners have less incentive to drop rates at the last minute in order to meet the high occupancy redemption formulas that exist, or historically have existed both in our platform and in many of our competitors' platforms. I think similarly that the extended cancellation window of 48 hours, which we put in place a few months ago, is another thing which deals with overbooking risks, but also to some extent addresses this last minute \u2013 these last-minute booking trends. But stay tuned on this. This is something that will continue to evolve, I think, in the quarters and probably years ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead. Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet : I'm sorry, I appreciate it. I was just distracted. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay, no worries. Go ahead, Paula. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks. I know it's only one question, so I'm sort of torn, I wanted to ask a little more about that group pace 2%, whether that was a volume and price combined, but if I only get one question, I will go with the \u2013 I saw the increase in your capital return, and I know in the opening comments you mentioned some of it had to do with extra $350 million in recycled proceeds, but just given that your outlook for 2018 is sort of very consistent with your outlook for 2017, so given there's not a big change in the outlook, it was a bit step-up in capital. Was there anything else behind that? Was it a decision kind of not to do something else? Or \u2013 just wanted to get more color on that. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Robin, just because we like you so much, we'll answer the second question that you very artfully asked, which is... Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : I threw in there, yeah. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: A 100% of the group revenue increase next year is ADR driven, not occupancy driven. But Leeny will talk about that. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So, thanks, Robin. So, couple things. This is definitely solely a function that \u2013 repurchase this year of the results kind of turning out the way they are. This is not a function of something that we're looking out and seeing in 2018. I will say, to your point, in 2018, to remember that part of this really record high level of share repurchase this year is due because we weren't able to bring back (29: 11) roughly $500 million of cash as part of the Starwood acquisition that was sitting in a number of different structures that when we put the two companies together, we were able to bring home. We also had the reality that asset recycling is likely to be lower next year than it is this year. But I think, otherwise, you should \u2013 with the exception of those two things, you should look to see us continue to have very strong levels of share repurchase. And I should remember that Avendra, from the standpoint of Avendra, that the numbers that we're talking about here don't include the proceeds from Avendra and that when you think about the use of that cash, we will be giving you more detail about the timing of the proceeds. We're going to have to pay cash taxes on those proceeds, which will be meaningful, so, I wouldn't expect that they will have a dramatic impact on our share repurchase next year, and to the extent that we are able to use some of that cash, we will be able to fold it into the numbers that we give you guidance on. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Leeny, I think you gave a really good rundown of where you're at with the asset sales program, and I think, if I caught the numbers right, you said you had $1.1 billion that has been completed. That may have included some other recycling though, so could you just give us an update? It was a $1.5 billion target; how much is remaining for 2018? And then based on what you're seeing out there in the sale markets, is there reason or room to believe that you might have some things that you could kind of \u2013 there could be some room for upside to that number? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure, thanks very much. So, you're right, absolutely right. We're looking \u2013 let's just talk, for this \u2013 since the deal closed, yes, $1.1 billion. We had San Francisco, St. Regis was in the fourth quarter of last year. So, this year you're looking at total asset sale dispositions of, call it, $750 million and the rest coming from note collections for a total year-to-date of roughly $900 million, okay? So, when you think about that relative to the assets that are left, then to get to our $1.5 billion, that would argue roughly $400 million would be in 2018. And as you remember, I've kind of talked about the three buckets of assets, and we feel very comfortable that assuming the ones that are either easily sold and then also can be worked out, that that would get us to our $400 million in 2018. I think, we still believe that that will leave us a handful that, because of the dynamics in their particular markets, be it Rio or Aberdeen, Scotland, that we may need to wait a little while. But the $400 million related to 2018, we feel good about. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I thought I heard at the beginning we have one and one follow-up, is that not true? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I \u2013 that is what I said. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh, okay, good, I just don't want to break any rules. So, Arne, a question for you. So, your U.S. RevPAR growth forecast was a little better than we were expecting, and you highlighted some of the drivers behind that in your prepared remarks. But as we're thinking about the various segments of the U.S. both in terms of chain scale, and then also geographically, where are you seeing better growth than you thought you would see last quarter when you seemed more cautious and even a bit frustrated with some of the North American RevPAR trends? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think, the \u2013 obviously, the third quarter itself is a bit confused because of the political conventions and the Jewish holidays, particularly. We talked about the impact on the full quarter RevPAR of about 100 basis points. You can see in the reported numbers between full service and limited service that limited service performed a bit more than a point better than the full service hotels, 1.5 point better really system-wide in the United States. And the reason for that, really, is about those two non-comparables in terms of the calendar. It's full-service hotels that bear the brunt of both the loss of the political conventions in Q3 2017 and are more likely to be impacted by Jewish holidays landing in the quarter. The \u2013 also, because of those holidays, you end up, in the quarter, with relatively stronger leisure business. I think, when you look at the full year, not just the quarter, we would say leisure is the strongest. Secondly would be association group business, and then probably third would be all things corporate. And corporate remains \u2013 we used the word cautious in the prepared remarks. I think that's a very deliberate word to use. It's not weak in absolute terms. The hotels are performing well, and the corporate accounts are performing well, but I think there is a bit more focus on costs across the average corporate customer today than might have been the case in past economic recovery cycles. I think, the last thing to point out, it's a little bit counterintuitive maybe initially is the impact of the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, not counting the Caribbean, were a net positive in September, not a net negative. Probably most dramatically so in Texas where that was one of the weakest markets we had in the United States for the last year or two years, and fairly quickly, within days, recovery efforts are beginning and people who are looking for housing are filling up hotels. And so, the Houston market and Florida market drove a bit of the outperformance in Q3. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. And Leeny, if we could just move on to a question about the credit card deals that you're working on, and I know you said you'll have something to announce maybe by the end of this year, early next year and you're not really prepared to talk more about that, but I'm going to ask anyway. I think that there's a narrative in the investment community about the incremental cash flow that you can get from those deals, and I just \u2013 we're kind of calculating something a bit lower than what I think others are saying, and if you look at the transaction that Hilton \u2013 that transpired with Hilton, and if you think about the multiples of size that your loyalty program is, I think, folks are coming up with an incremental cash flow to you of $300 million, $500 million. We're calculating something a bit lower than that. So, I was just hoping you could maybe clarify how you're thinking about that. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So, let's go back just to a little basics on what we talked about last March, just as a reminder, that we talked about the kind of non-hotel revenue-related fees totaling $350 million, of which the credit cards were roughly half. So, call it roughly $173 million in the 2016 numbers. And we've talked about that \u2013 we talked today about how that $350 million will grow to over $420 million, close to a 20% increase, and that will be heavily driven by the strength of our credit card business which is \u2013 continues to grow really well. But as it relates to the new credit card deals, I can really only say the following, and that is that we are working with our partners. We \u2013 as soon as we have a definitive deal or deals, we will talk about it. And that we had said that these agreements have been some time since they've been renegotiated. So, two things : number one, we would expect from the passage of time that the deal has got better economics. And then number two, frankly, as a result of our combined platform, we believe there's additional benefit there. So that we do believe there will be great economic value, frankly, for Marriott International shareholders, for our owners through a more economic loyalty program \u2013 from the contributions from the credit card companies, as well as, frankly, for the customers who are going to be using these credit cards. So, there's tremendous value. But to get into the specifics of where those dollars fall, it's just too soon. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So just to \u2013 is the \u2013 because we're all in the business of trying to anticipate these things, is the math wrong to kind of take what the incremental benefit that Hilton got and to kind of assume that perhaps your loyalty program is four or five times greater and just kind of do the math on that? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: You know, so the first thing should be not surprising, and that is that I really can't comment on Hilton's program. How exactly the structure of their deal and how they \u2013 how the credit card companies, what they're so-called paying for i.e., how many points that then need to be paid for as a result of the proceeds that Hilton is receiving, right. When you think about it, a credit card customer is obviously doing all this spend and they're earning lots of points when they use their credit card. Well, those points have to be paid for. And then the question becomes how much do those points cost in the various programs, and then what else are you using the proceeds for relative to strengthening the program, and also bringing profits to the shareholders. So, I do agree with you. I think, a comparison probably doesn't make a lot of sense given that the programs are likely to be very unique relative to the businesses that Hilton has and the credit card portfolio that they have, as well as the one that we have. We're thrilled with the two credit card portfolios that we have now in terms of through Amex and JPMorgan Chase, and look forward to seeing what comes up when we are done with negotiations. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: We'll give you three, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's great. I have three questions, six parts each. My first question \u2013 good morning, everybody. My first question is, Leeny, in your full year 2017 owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expense guidance of $367 million, how much contribution in the first three quarters of this year is there from owned assets that have since been sold? Just so we have a base to think about for the next couple of years to grow up with? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I'm going to have \u2013 I'm looking to Betsy, but if I remember the comments right, it's $90 million for the full year in 2016, and it was $21 million in Q4 from the assets that were sold. So, that's the \u2013 that's the delta \u2013 that's the contribution in each \u2013 in the three quarters 2016 and one quarter 2016. And then year-over-year we just know that we'll have what we have in Q4, which totals $90 million versus the $109 million \u2013 Betsy's handing me something. Let's see what we have. Yeah, Q3 year-to-date, yeah, it's not laid out the same way. But again... Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.: Give us a call, Joe we'll get you... Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: We can talk to it separately, but I do think what you are looking for is the $90 million in 2016 and $21 million, and then year-over-year we do know that if we've talked about owned/leased being $90 million versus what it was $109 million a year ago, you know that $21 million last year was contributed only as profits from those assets that are no longer with us. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then my second question, final question, is it fair to think that given your range of RevPAR growth and net rooms growth for next year, with some incremental asset sale benefit, that this $3.5 billion of cash return, or thereabouts, is a sustainable level, absent some macro shock that moves some of those inputs that you talked about for 2018? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, so, that's what I was trying to mention before, Joe. We clearly \u2013 the $500 million of excess cash that we were able to bring back is \u2013 that was a one-time gain, so, that obviously is not something I can recreate every year. And obviously, the asset recycling this year at, call it $900 million relative to what it would take to get us to the $1.5 billion next year is obviously also going to be less. But, you know, at the same time, I think we see tremendous opportunities for the growth in the loyalty program, which tends, as it grows, to spit off more cash. So, with the exception of those two items and with continued strong growth in the company's EBITDA, we clearly see great, strong numbers for share repurchase, but can't really get into \u2013 we're not at the point in our budget process to be able to put certain numbers behind it. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Appreciate the thoughts. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. I was just wondering, Arne, if you could just talk a little bit about the tenor of your corporate customers when you speak with them. You mentioned some caution going into 2018, and it's just interesting, when we continue to see business CapEx spending go up and GDP forecast pretty good, I mean, what is your sense of kind of what is keeping people on the sidelines from either funding more group business or just more corporate transient business? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, and we've talked about this in the last few quarters, and I wish we could be more definitive than we really can be, but I think when you listen to the stories out there you see a broad range of individual stories where you've got, obviously good average corporate profit growth, better corporate profit growth than revenue growth, but some companies are absolutely punting it, and generally we see from them the kind of behavior in travel that you would expect from those companies. In other words, that they are investing not just in capital items, but they are investing in operating costs and spending time with customers and coming together and using our hotels, whether it be for individual travel or for group travel. I think, there are also a number of companies where they are struggling to find revenue growth, and they are getting \u2013 putting pressure on themselves and maybe, to some extent, getting pressure from the investment community to squeeze out profit growth in a relatively anemic revenue growth picture. And that's causing them to be a bit cautious on their spending on all things, including, sadly, travel. And when you roll all those averages together, I think, we are seeing a bit more cautious behavior, on average, from companies today than we would have expected, given GDP growth. And, obviously, one of the questions we get often today, given the GDP numbers of the last two quarters, the optimism in the market, people ask, are you seeing more healthy demand today from your corporate customers than a year ago for example, and I think, generally, we would say no, it's about the same. It feels to us like the economy is growing at more or less the same pace it was before. Now, we don't have any reason to question the GDP \u2013 reported GDP numbers which do appear to be a bit better, so the only explanation we can come up with is that there is just a bit more caution on the corporate side because of the stickiness of revenue growth on average. And, again, if we see better GDP growth on a sustained basis, I think that's a positive thing. And we may see some better performance come from that, but a little bit of it will depend on corporate behavior and whether it gets a little bit more bullish in our space. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And I just wanted to ask you \u2013 you guys announced this venture with Alibaba last quarter. Are you starting to see any benefits of that, or is it too soon? The RevPAR in China obviously continues to be very strong, is that helping (47: 09)? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We're off to a great start with Alibaba. We were doing some great things with them even before we announced the deal in August. Of course, we've got 11.11 coming up here in just a few days, which is a major Alibaba Chinese consumer event, and I think, we continue to work with them on loyalty particularly, with great sign-up from the kind of Chinese consumers we want to have. And so, we feel we're really off to a good start. The team is also working on some of the technology tools that are essential to drive even better performance going forward, but we're going to get great lift from this. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Arne, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how in 2018 you expect full service hotels to perform better than select service. Can you just elaborate on that a little? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, that's our instinct at the moment. Again, we haven't done budgets year-to-date, and I wouldn't invite you to think that it's dramatically different, but I think, we are seeing generally there's a bit more supply growth in the limited service space than there is in the full-service space, and that's probably the easiest thing to look at for the explanation between the two. I think, group business, obviously we've seen revenues up about 2% this year versus last. I think that should hold through the year. There is \u2013 I mentioned in one of the earlier questions that is 100% rate-driven, not room night-driven, so that's a better place to be than having that be driven by room nights because that gives us some opportunity both on maybe some incremental group business or some transient bookings that would be taken away from us if it was occupancy-driven. But that's the \u2013 those are the primary things right now. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. And then just as my follow-up, can you just touch on the direct booking push and the current relationship with the OTAs and the mix? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, there's not much new to report. The \u2013 we are obviously continuing to focus on our loyalty program, which I mentioned earlier, and we are seeing the contribution to our hotels around the world continue to grow from the loyalty program. That is really fabulous news for us and we're going to continue to invest in the loyalty program the way we've talked about, and the way some of Leeny's answers already hinted at this morning. And I think that will continue to drive our loyal customers into our own channels as opposed to third-party channels. We do want to continue to have a good relationship with the OTAs, where it comes to that occasional leisure traveler, and there are travelers who want to see that kind of range of pricing across portfolios, who are not particularly loyal to any system, and so we'll continue to do business with them. But I think, we will also continue to use the tools that we have to try and grow our own channels at faster rates than we've experienced the last couple of years. We're not in negotiations with any of the big OTAs until sometime later in 2018, and we'll obviously keep you posted on that. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. The first question is a bit of a hypothetical one around the tax cut legislation. Let's say hypothetically that did go through as proposed and you did see your cash taxes go down would you envision the use of that extra cash flow along the lines of dividends and repurchases, or would you see that more going to CapEx? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, as I'm sure you know, we first look to how we can invest to grow our business. So, the reality is the way that we run the shop is more to figure out what are the things that we can invest in, and then with what's left over, what's the best thing to do, which for us has been a choice to return it to shareholders, and we continue to believe that's the right choice. So, although you're right, we would expect there would be more cash, I think, the answer will continue to be that we want to invest in our business to grow and strengthen our platform, strengthen our brands, and add a lot more distribution, and do everything we can to make our equation for the customer the most powerful one in the industry. And from that standpoint we would look at it exactly the same way and then continue to return capital to shareholders. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, let me just jump in here and talk about this a little bit. Obviously, we have not been capital constrained in current times before tax reform, and so our approach has been essentially to do the kinds of investments Leeny described if they make economic and strategic sense to us. And to the extent there's not enough of those, and clearly there has not been enough of those because we're talking about returning $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, that tells you that there is that much extra capacity which is being produced by our company that we don't need to invest in our system. If you wave a wand and say tax reform is done, and our tax \u2013 cash taxes and book taxes decline by a certain amount, I don't think that, by itself, is going to change our capital availability, if you will. I think, the longer-term question would be whether or not that has the impact of reducing our cost of capital, which could \u2013 in some respects could go into a calculation about whether or not there are investments that make sense for us to do. But I think that's a longer term, more theoretical question, and the shorter-term question is it's probably likely to go back to shareholders, and when it does that's likely to go principally to American shareholders, which gets the dollars back into the American economy, and the American economy should benefit from that. Obviously not by Marriott alone, but by that sort of story working its way through the American economy. And that growth, in turn, should create jobs and should create more capital investment in the U.S. economy Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: And more demand for our hotels. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hopefully. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Very well said there. And then as far as my completely unrelated follow-up question, we're seeing InterContinental Hotels and Hilton making a push to get into sort of what we call the lower chain scale segment. Any thoughts on your end of opportunity there? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, we're obviously reading all the news that we can read. I mean, one of the things that is interesting to us \u2013 obviously we spent time at our analyst conference in March talking about the \u2013 our segment profile which is much more dramatically skewed to luxury and upper upscale and even upscale, and really, we're not playing in the midscale space at all. I thought it was interesting the statistic we put out in our prepared remarks that even in our limited service pipeline, 50% of those assets in the United States are really urban and much more \u2013 what \u2013 complicated, but that also means higher rated hotels than the prototypical suburban hotel that you might think of when you think about limited service. And obviously we want to continue to be very strong on the higher end of the market. That doesn't mean we're going to ignore those suburban or secondary markets, but we want very much for our brands to be playing in the place where people are most inspired by travel and where they have the strongest memories, and coincidentally where we can get the most profit contribution per room. And I think, we'll continue to stay focused in that space for the time being. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, folks. A few of mine have been answered. I had a question actually concerning rewards redemptions. I've been hearing from owners that you guys are looking at revising from what I would call a threshold, sort of a phase threshold on redemption travel, and I guess I'm curious. I would think that cliff-type threshold would create sort of an adverse pricing behavior, and I'm just wondering if you think moving away from that is actually beneficial for rates in the industry, because I would think owners tend to discount to get over that occupancy threshold? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: And that's exactly what I was trying to refer to in one of the earlier answers. We have moved already some, but I think we'll continue to move. Right now, it depends a little bit on the brand. Luxury has got a bit lower threshold, for obvious reasons they tend to run occupancies which are a little bit lower than the upper upscale hotels or the upscale hotels, but essentially the way it works now is once you hit a certain percentage occupancy, your redemption rate is meaningfully higher. And so, if I'm one room away from hitting the 95% threshold, it's in my interest to fill that room almost no matter what rate I get. Now, we've already got some gates that preclude them from giving that room away, or giving it away at a discount which is too profound, but still it drives behavior which is dropping rates closer to stay, and I think, if we can avoid that sort of cliff feature, which I suspect we will do, we'll end up with that much less economic incentive for hotel owners to drop rates as we get closer to the night of stay. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Have you ever quantified how much of a drag that creates? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We've looked at \u2013 we've looked at this and we've looked at the other third-party players that are out there. We don't think it's material, generally, today, but anecdotally we hear it pop up occasionally, and so, we think it's something we need to address. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And just one follow-up, if I could. Just one of your competitors talking about rebuilding their reservation system to incorporate, I guess I'll call it modern technology, and new forms of guest interaction. Do you think that the Starwood-Marriott combination allowed you to bring your systems to that level? I guess, I'd say sets a future standard? Or do you foresee the need, as you look about your own capital planning in the next three to five years to make a more significant investment in your back-of-house systems? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We have had extraordinary levels of investment in new reservations or modern reservations approach, as well as in property management system and some of the other systems already for the last couple of years, and obviously, one of the reasons we did the deal is we think we can be much more cost-effective by using these dollars to support one program instead of two programs. And we'll continue doing that. Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Just was wondering on RevPAR index, I know a big part of the merger, Leeny, you outlined the cost synergies, but there's obviously some revenue synergies. If you can move up the RPIs from some of the legacy Starwood assets, mainly Sheraton, wondering if you saw anything in the quarter that kind of portends positively for RPIs to go up? And then kind of a side question on that is, is anything assumed in 2018 in terms of higher RPI gains from the Starwood assets? And that's all from me, thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks very much and I'm glad you asked that question. In the quarter, we were up modestly in terms of RevPAR index, essentially in most segments and in most regions around the world. And we're quite encouraged by that. We've said before that the most powerful drivers of the lift from the merger are going to be driven by the combination of the loyalty programs and by the combination of the sales force and other efforts to drive top line. We are \u2013 we did, at closing, obviously drive good functionality between the two loyalty programs, but we are yet to merge them into one. We remain optimistic that we'll be able to do that in 2018, and I think when we get that done in 2018, there's every reason to believe we're going to drive better share of wallet. On the sales side, the bulk of the sales forces have just recently been brought together, and I think that will be helpful, too. So we would expect that we will continue to see some improved index performance in 2018 and probably particularly after 2018 when we get the single loyalty program put together. We're really gratified that we're off to a great start because, as we've said before, this is probably the highest risk time because the revenue we're experiencing in hotels today is, to some extent, driven by group bookings and other things that were done in earlier periods, including times when the uncertainty of the acquisition was most pronounced. And to not have a dip after closing is really very encouraging to us and, in fact, to have some index gain is pretty powerful. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from David Beckel of Bernstein. Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hello, good morning. This is Apple speaking for Dave Beckel. Thanks for taking my question. Another question on the tax reform. From your corporate partners you talk to, do you get a sense that their spending will meaningfully increase if the tax reform passes by the end of the year? And if so, do you believe your North American RevPAR could exceed the top end of your 2018 guidance range? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, and probably in the way you've asked the question, not necessarily. I have participated in a number of events with a whole bunch of our corporate customers recently, and I think generally the view from our corporate customers, not surprisingly, is if tax reform gets done, it will be a boost to the economy, a boost to their fortunes, and a boost to GDP generally. And in that sense I think they would be a bit more optimistic about growth. But we haven't necessarily said to folks, okay, if you get a tax cut, are you going to travel more? That seems a little concrete. There's obviously plenty of uncertainty about tax reform, both the timing and the details of what might get passed. Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Could I get your high-level views for international travel next year to the U.S. was sort of baked into your preliminary guidance, and we're seeing the Department of Commerce data showing international travelers are spending more money here but looks like the volume is actually down. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, to be fair, we are early enough in our budgeting process that I wouldn't say that we've been real specific about forecasting international arrivals to the United States as part of our budgeting process. A couple of statistics to remind you of. We think about 4%, maybe 4% to 5% of business in the United States is driven by international arrivals. You shouldn't be surprised to hear that the bulk of that is going to be in coastal destinations where international arrivals tend to be concentrated. The statistics we have about international arrivals to the United States in 2017 are frustratingly difficult to get. We obviously can look at our own system. There's Department of Commerce data, there is data that comes through OTAs and credit card companies and others that we're all trying to triangulate to try and sort this out. It looks like, though, that there has been a modest decrease in international arrivals to the United States from all foreign sources in 2017. That's not really all that surprising. That is in the context of what we estimate to be something like a 7% increase in global international arrivals, in other words, travelers crossing national boundaries and landing someplace else. And so the U.S. is declining in a market that is increasing globally, which means the United States is losing share. Does that change in 2018? We'll have to see. I would guess that we'll continue to see pretty powerful tailwinds which are driving growth in international travel. Think about China outbound business. We had some statistics on that earlier in the call; think about Asian GDP growth; think about European GDP growth. Both of those are positive areas and I think that will tend to drive travel, particularly leisure travel. We would love to see the U.S. while focused on security, which is perfectly appropriate, also continue to make sure that the rest of the world hears the voice that travelers are welcome to come and vacation here and do business here. And hopefully the U.S. won't continue to lose much share, but we'll have to watch that in the future. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, and then transitioning (01:05:36) last segment, for the Asia Pacific region, the consumer is quite strong, but are you seeing any uptick in business travel in Asia? Are you gaining corporate accounts? Are you gaining group accounts? Do you have a lot of share gain based on that high-single digit RevPAR this quarter? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I mean, you could \u2013 yeah, the answer is yes. You can tell from the absolute RevPAR numbers coming out of Asia, the China numbers that we put out this morning, our index performance in Asia has been spectacular. I mean, we are at enormous RevPAR Index premiums to the competitive market, and we're growing them substantially year-over-year. So there's a ton of good news coming out of that. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Bellisario of Baird. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just kind of thinking about 2018 but also more so just on a go-forward basis as you think about leveraging your larger platform today, what's the message that you're trying to send to owners, to operators as they're trying to push rate during corporate negotiations and enforce tougher group contract terms, for example? Basically how aggressive are you trying to be and are you taking more of a first-mover approach now given your bigger scale? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean that's an important question. Obviously, franchise operators are very much responsible for their own pricing, and we can make some revenue management tools available to them, we can use some tools which help them participate in corporate RFPs, for example, which we do. But generally they're going to make the decisions they think are the right ones to make. We are, though, in the context of that, trying to make sure that we do things like the 48-hour cancel, and whether that applies \u2013 should apply to the corporate accounts. And we obviously want to make sure that we are doing what we can in the managed portfolio to take advantage of the fact that we've got hotels that are running significant occupancies. And we think there is a pricing potential, particularly in these midweek nights when an overwhelming number of hotels are essentially full. And so we're doing the best we can to go through that. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. That's helpful, and then just one follow-up maybe for Leeny. Of the call it $510 million or so on the balance sheet, any of that left overseas or was everything bought back earlier this year? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I think there's a little bit more that we do hope over time to be able to get but that is \u2013 for the moment, that was all done earlier this year. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Chris Agnew of MKM Partners. Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC : Thanks very much. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC : Can you provide any update on the discussion with the two timeshare companies about access to the loyalty program? And could they hold up your plans to combine the program in 2018? Thank you. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Thanks for your question. Yeah, we're actively talking to the timeshare companies. As we've said before, to be able to fully completely unify our loyalty program, we need to work it out with both our credit card partners as well as our timeshare partners, and we are in the process of doing that right now and are hopeful that we'll get there soon. Christopher Agnew - MKM Partners LLC : Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: All right, well, thank you all very much for your time and attention this morning. We appreciate your... Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I have an answer to Joe Greff's question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay, go ahead. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So, we talked \u2013 Joe, just in case you're listening. I know you were asking a question about year-to-date owned/leased profits from the assets sold in 2017 in addition to 2016. We've given the numbers for 2016. For 2017, the hotel sold in 2017, the assets \u2013 the owned/leased profits through September 30 was $43.5 million. And with that, I think we're done. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: All right. Thank you all very much for your time and attention this morning. We appreciate the opportunity to welcome you all in your travels. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday, along with our comments today, are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. This quarter, we have provided a set of slides to assist with today's discussion. You can find them on our website at www.marriott.com/investor. In our discussion, we will talk about 2017 results excluding merger-related costs, the gain from the sale of Avendra, and the provisional charge associated with tax reform. These results will be compared to 2016 combined adjusted results, which also exclude merger-related costs and assume Marriott's acquisition of Starwood and Starwood's sale of its timeshare businesses were completed on January 1, 2015. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported GAAP results are in the press release, which you can find along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures on our website. There are a number of moving pieces in both our fourth quarter 2017 results and our 2018 outlook. In our remarks today, we will try to clarify those items to reveal the underlying business trends. Simply put, the fourth quarter was the icing on the cake to a terrific year in 2017 for Marriott. Compared to combined adjusted amounts in the prior year, 2017 fee revenue increased 8% to $3.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 8% to $3.2 billion, and adjusted EPS rose 32% to $4.36. As 2017 demonstrated, the global travel industry has never been more exciting, nor offered a better opportunity. Occupancy is at record levels with young travelers seeking adventure, retirees exploring exciting places, expanding numbers of international vacationers, and for business travelers making the connections to drive success. Technology is making travel easier to book, and strengthening economic climates are fueling the wanderlust. Marriott is seizing this opportunity. Our more than 6,500 properties and 30 brands provide a broad choice of aspirational destinations. Our leading loyalty programs leverage our distribution, driving guest preference and significant RevPAR index premiums. Our tremendous worldwide distribution and diverse brand portfolio enables our sales and marketing channels to be highly effective and efficient. And with our operating know-how, our team executes well against very high guest expectations, while driving hotel profitability for our owners and franchisees. Owners recognize this market opportunity and continue to seek out projects in attractive locations with our brands and platforms. In 2017, we opened 76,000 new rooms, yielding a worldwide net system growth of 5.6%. We also signed nearly 125,000 new rooms worldwide during the year, including 15,000 rooms that were conversions from other brands. Construction delays persist in many markets due to shortages of skilled tradesmen, contractors and subcontractors. Despite this, in 2018, we expect we will grow our worldwide rooms by roughly 7% gross, and 5.5% to 6% net. For 25 years, our powerful brands have enabled us to pursue an asset-light strategy that delivers both meaningful unit growth and high-value management and franchise agreements for our shareholders. But the lodging business is changing. It's not enough today to have outstanding operating scale and well-known brands. Today, hotel operators need scale to leverage technology, loyalty programs and booking engines, all of which are needed to meet ever-increasing customer and hotel owner expectations. In 2017, we added mobile check-in and checkout to 1,600 hotels, and are now offering mobile service at nearly 6,000 hotels worldwide. During the year, we rolled out guestVoice, our guest satisfaction system, across our entire portfolio, and launched Marriott Moments that allows guests to shop for and book unique experiences. And we formed a joint venture with Alibaba that we believe will drive engagement and loyalty of Chinese travelers. For company-operated hotels, worldwide house profit margins improved by 80 basis points on company-operated worldwide RevPAR growth of 3.8%. In addition to the RevPAR improvement, our higher margins reflect continued terrific productivity savings by our operating teams and integration-related cost savings in procurement, OTA commissions and loyalty programs. Our loyalty programs reached just shy of 110 million members at year end, and those members accounted for over half of our occupied rooms in 2017. We lowered our loyalty programs' charge-out rate to owners in 2017 and again in January 2018, and we expect to further reduce charge-out rates as we harmonize our loyalty programs later this year. As we expected, our recently renegotiated co-branded credit card agreements are allowing us to bring more value to our customers and hotel owners as well as our shareholders. We expect new cards will launch later this year. As part of the credit card agreements, hotel owners will also benefit from lower credit card processing fees beginning in 2018. Leeny will talk about our branding fees associated with these credit card agreements in a few moments. Our hotel owners can expect more cost savings in 2018. We recently announced a reduction in North America group intermediary commissions, and separately have introduced a new revenue management approach that seeks to book the most profitable business, not just the highest RevPAR business. We also expect to achieve additional synergies and procurement, loyalty and benchmarking in 2018. Let's talk about RevPAR. In the fourth quarter, Marriott's worldwide system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 4.6% on a constant dollar basis. In North America, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 3.9%, with roughly 1.5 percentage points of the improvement due to the shift in Jewish holidays and hurricane recovery demand. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR growth was stronger than we anticipated in North America, also related to lingering hurricane demand as well as better-than-expected leisure demand in Orlando, Miami, New Orleans and Los Angeles. For the full year 2018, we expect North America system-wide RevPAR will increase 1% to 2%, consistent with recent trends. While we are hopeful we will see a pickup in U.S. economic growth and we've narrowed the range of our North America RevPAR outlook a bit, we think it unwise to move expectations up broadly this early in the year. As a reminder, year-over-year comps are tough following 2017's inauguration and the strong 2017 fourth quarter. Booking pace at the end of January for system-wide full-service hotels is up 2% for 2018. While we haven't completed all special corporate rate negotiations, where negotiations are complete, price increases for the comparable special corporate customers are averaging at a low-single digit rate. RevPAR in the Caribbean & Latin America region increased 5.6% in the fourth quarter compared to last year, also better than our expectations. We saw strong demand in Argentina and signs of economic improvement in Brazil, while Mexico was weak following September's earthquake and the peso's appreciation. In the Caribbean alone, many hotels across the lodging industry remain out of service. This has created significant demand compression for our 45 open properties in the region, driving our comparable Caribbean RevPAR up 24% in the quarter. For the entire Caribbean and Latin America region, we expect RevPAR will increase at a low-single digit rate in the full year 2018. In the Middle East & Africa, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 5.7%. We saw strong performance in Saudi Arabia, while at the same time, continued sanctions on Qatar and oversupply in Dubai dampened RevPAR growth in those markets. In Africa, our hotels in Egypt experienced much stronger occupancy, particularly our Red Sea resorts, following that country's currency devaluation. With tougher comps in Africa and a continued challenging political climate in the Middle East, we expect RevPAR in the total region will be flattish for the full year 2018. In the Asia Pacific region, constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose more than 7% in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations with strong leisure demand in China, Thailand and Japan. Comparable hotel RevPAR in Greater China increased over 9%, driven by a robust growth in Hong Kong, Macau and in Shenzhen. For the full year of 2018, we expect RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region will grow at a mid-single digit rate, reflecting strength in China and India, but more modest growth in Indonesia due to the active volcano in Bali. In Europe, fourth quarter RevPAR rose more than 5% with impressive performance in Paris, Brussels and Istanbul. While RevPAR across most of Europe was strong, demand in Barcelona and London weakened. We expect RevPAR in Europe will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in the full year 2018. For the full year, we expect constant dollar RevPAR will increase 3% to 5% outside North America, and 1% to 3% worldwide. In a few minutes, Leeny will talk about the significant positive impact on 2018 earnings and cash flow from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The takeaway is that our effective tax rate should drop by approximately 8 points to roughly 22%, and hopefully, we will see a stronger economic climate in the United States. As we considered how we might leverage this good news, we considered our long-term cultural maxim that in the hospitality business, strong guest loyalty and economic results are derived from high associate satisfaction and engagement. To put it plainly, at Marriott, we try to take care of our associates, our associates take care of our guests, and our guests keep coming back. Attracting and keeping the best talent is critical for us, so we plan to invest roughly $140 million for 2018 in our most important asset, our people, with about $70 million of the cost funded by Marriott, and the remainder funded by the Avendra proceeds. We expect to do this by increasing our retirement savings match of associate contributions by up to $1,000 for eligible associates in the U.S. We also plan to invest in other associate support programs during the year. We are bullish about our future. No other hotel company offers our comprehensive range of destinations, no other company has loyalty programs of the breadth and depth that we do, and none offer the meaningful scale that drives both guest satisfaction and owner returns. But our most powerful advantage is our culture. It is a deep commitment to people, treating each other with dignity and respect, offering everyone opportunities for learning and growth, and working together as a team. Given the outstanding results demonstrated in 2017, I'd like to say thank you to all the Marriott associates who made it possible. To tell you more about the quarter, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny Oberg. Leeny? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you, Arne. Welcome, everyone. As Arne said, there are a lot of moving pieces to discuss, so starting with slide 9, let's review two adjustments we made to results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Aramark purchased Avendra for $1.35 billion in December of 2017. After deducting company debt, transaction costs and other expenses, net proceeds were $1.2 billion, of which Marriott's proceeds and gain were $659 million. This quarter's tax provision included $259 million on the gain. As we've explained in the past, the proceeds from the transaction will be reinvested in our system. Under GAAP, we've recognized the gain in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we plan to incur expenses as the funds are invested in the system and expect to similarly back out such expenses in calculating adjusted results. Our fourth quarter GAAP results also reflect the impact of U.S. tax reform passed in 2017. The fourth quarter included a $745 million provisional transition tax on Marriott's accumulated foreign earnings, $159 million favorable revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities and a favorable $19 million of other tax impact. In total, the Avendra transaction in 2017 tax legislation reduced our fourth quarter GAAP net income by $167 million, and diluted EPS by $0.45. On slide 10, you can see 2017 fourth quarter total fee revenue increased 12%. Fees increased due to unit growth, RevPAR growth and higher non-property fees, largely credit card branding fees. Non-property fees, including application fees, relicensing fees and fees from our timeshare credit card and residential businesses, together totaled $122 million in the quarter, 27% higher than the prior year. Incentive fees increased 14% in the quarter, largely due to strong results at full-service hotels in North America and the Asia Pacific regions. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $95 million in the 2017 quarter. We benefited from stronger results at a few North America owned and leased hotels with overall owned, leased results declined due to hotel dispositions. Since the beginning of the 2016 fourth quarter through 2017 year-end, we've sold four properties; in each case, retaining a long-term management agreement. These properties contributed $3 million in profits on the owned, leased line in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. General and administrative expenses totaled $259 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, $25 million worse than the prior year, reflecting $7 million of litigation reserves in the 2017 quarter, higher incentive compensation and an $8 million benefit from a favorable legal settlement in the prior year. Turning to slide 11. Our fourth quarter results were much better than we expected. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.12, roughly $0.13 ahead of the midpoint of our EPS guidance of $0.98 to $1. On the fee line, we picked up about $0.06 of outperformance due to stronger-than-expected RevPAR and margin growth, and better-than-expected branding fees. The owned, leased and other line gave us about $0.01 due to better-than-expected results at hotels in New York, Atlanta and Anaheim. G&A was about $0.03 worse due to unexpected litigation reserves and development expenses. Net interest and the equity in earnings line each contributed about $0.01 of outperformance. The provision for taxes helped by $0.07, including $0.03 of tax benefit related to stock compensation, $0.03 from a favorable mix of business, and $0.01 from discrete tax items. As you know, effective January 1, 2018, our results will reflect FASB's new revenue recognition rules. I want to emphasize that, while these changes will result in some geography and timing changes in our reported results, our cash flow won't be impacted. We discussed these changes in our third quarter 10-Q, and there'll be additional discussion in our 10-K. I'd like to bring your attention to the third point on slide 12 regarding incentive fees. Compared to our past practice, the new accounting standard may shift recognition of some incentive fees from one quarter to another quarter, with the most significant impact on seasonal resorts. The rule change only impacts quarterly timing. It will not change our incentive fee recognition for the full year, nor alter the quarterly cash receipt of incentive fees. We expect the overall impact of the first five changes shown in slide 12 will reduce 2018 adjusted EBITDA by roughly $60 million and operating profit by roughly $50 million, but will not change our annual or quarterly net cash flow. We will not adjust our results for these changes in non-GAAP reconciliations going forward. Moving to number six on slide 12. The new rules also impact the treatment of costs for centralized programs and services like sales and marketing, loyalty and reservations, the cost of which are reimbursed to us by owners. In 2017, we had roughly $18 billion of total annual reimbursed revenue and cost reimbursement expenses. Roughly 30% of these reimbursements are associated with centralized program and services. We operate these programs on a breakeven basis, although there can be cash differences in the timing of revenue and expenses. Prior to the new revenue recognition rules, such revenue and expenses netted to zero on our financial statements, and we reflected the cash impact of any timing difference on our balance sheet. However, under the new rules, timing differences of these owner payments and system expenses will flow through our GAAP reported net income, instead. We expect to adjust these timing differences of centralized programs and services in our calculation of adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA going forward, and do not expect to include such timing differences in our earnings guidance. Here again, this change in accounting does not change our annual or quarterly net cash flow. We appreciate your patience. Given the complicated impact of the new accounting rules on incentive fees for seasonal hotels, we don't yet have a detailed first quarter P&L forecast. Our budget spreads are also delayed as we transition to a unified financial reporting platform. We expect to provide investors with 2017 quarterly results under the new revenue standard in the second quarter. We remain committed to transparency and expect we will resume fulsome quarterly guidance on our next earnings call. I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere thanks to our finance and accounting team for expertly managing purchase accounting, new revenue recognition rules, and combining ledgers, all at the same time. Of course, there are a few observations we can make about the first quarter. With tough comparisons to last year's inauguration and Women's March, and the unfavorable timing of Easter, North America RevPAR is likely to be flat to up 2% in the 2018 first quarter. International RevPAR is likely to go 3% to 5%, with continued strength in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. And worldwide system-wide RevPAR should increase 1% to 3% in the first quarter. Unit growth should remain strong, and credit card branding fees should move higher. In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized about $20 million of earnings from owned hotels that have since been sold. For the full year of 2018, we can be more helpful. The table on page 13 of the press release and slide 14 in our slide deck show our 2018 full-year outlook. Our guidance is on the left column and reflects the new revenue standard. While we will be reporting 2018 results including the impact of the new revenue standard, for those of you who wish to compare our 2018 outlook with 2017 actuals, excluding the accounting change, we've provided the data for your use in the column on the right. With 1% to 3% global RevPAR growth and 5.5% to 6% net unit growth, we expect gross fee revenue will total $3.535 billion to $3.620 billion, and we expect incentive fees will increase at a low-single-digit rate in 2018. Contract cost amortization should total $55 million. Our fee revenue estimate includes meaningful improvement from credit card branding fees. Such fees increased from $173 million in 2016 to $242 million in 2017, as we harmonize terms of the Marriott and Starwood credit card programs, and realized higher card member spend. In 2018, with the renegotiation of our credit card agreements and the launch of new credit cards, credit card branding fees could total $360 million to $380 million. In 2018, owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, should total $285 million to $295 million, and do not reflect any additional asset sales. Earnings on this line from hotels that were sold in 2017 or early 2018, totaled $55 million in 2017. We estimate depreciation and amortization in 2018 will total roughly $230 million, reflecting the reclassification of $55 million of contract amortization to the fee revenue line due to the new revenue standard. We estimate G&A will total $935 million to $945 million, including the $70 million one-time investment in our associates in 2018. Excluding this amount, we would expect 2018 G&A to be lower than 2017, consistent with our targeted $250 million of long-term G&A savings from the Starwood acquisition. In January 2018, we completed the sale of the Buenos Aires Sheraton and Park Tower properties for approximately $105 million. We estimate the gain from this transaction will be roughly $45 million and will be recognized in the first quarter. Our outlook assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of roughly 22%. We expect the provisional transition tax that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2017, less any available tax credits, will be paid out in cash over eight years. We expect our cash tax rate in 2018 will be noticeably higher at roughly 36%, reflecting a negative 11 point impact from cash taxes associated with the sale of Avendra, and a negative 3 point impact from the 2018 installment of cash taxes associated with the transition tax. For the full year 2018, we expect fee revenue will total $3.54 billion to $3.62 billion, a 6% to 9% increase, despite the estimated $25 million negative impact of the new revenue standard. We expect adjusted diluted EPS will total $5.11 to $5.34, a 17% to 22% increase over adjusted diluted EPS in 2017, despite the estimated $0.11 negative impact of the new revenue standard and a roughly $0.15 one-time negative impact from our estimated investment in our associates. We expect 2018 adjusted EBITDA will total $3.32 billion to $3.42 billion, a 3% to 6% increase over 2017 adjusted EBITDA, despite the estimated $60 million negative impact of the new revenue standard, the $70 million one-time negative impact from our expected investment in our associates and the negative impact of $55 million of lower owned, leased profits due to sold hotels. There are a few things not reflected in our 2018 guidance. First, we expect to spend the net proceeds from the Avendra sale for the benefit of our owners, franchisees and our system over the next few years, including $70 million for the one-time additional profit-sharing contribution funded by Avendra proceeds. While Avendra reinvestment will be included as an expense in our GAAP results, we expect to adjust for any such expense in our calculation of adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, and do not expect to include such expenses in our earnings guidance. Similarly, our guidance does not include merger-related cost or the timing impact of centralized programs and services. Here again, we expect to adjust for such costs in our diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA. Investment spending, including contract costs and loan activity, totaled $612 million in 2017. We expect investment spending will total $600 million to $700 million in 2018, including $225 million in maintenance spending, as we expect to renovate several leased hotels in 2018. We have already recycled $1.3 billion of assets to-date since closing the Starwood acquisition. While we remain confident of our ability to reach our post-acquisition $1.5 billion target by year-end 2018, our 2018 earnings and cash flow guidance assumes no further asset sales. In 2017, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our success with asset recycling, the return of foreign cash, and strong operating cash flow during the year. Assuming no asset sales beyond those already completed, we could return roughly $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2018. Our balance sheet is in great shape. On December 31, our debt ratio was at the low end of our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.25 times adjusted debt to combined adjusted EBITDAR. There's a lot of excitement at Marriott today. We're embracing change as never before, while remaining true to our culture and commitment to excellence to the benefit of our guests, owners, associates and shareholders. Thank you for your interest and joining us on this journey. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible on today's call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : I wonder if you could give a little more color around the fee growth guidance. In that 7% to 10% range, just given that it looks like maybe 3 percentage points of that is from higher credit card branding fees. When you combine your unit growth and your RevPAR growth, it seems like all those pieces added should maybe get to a higher range than the 7% to 10%. So, I wonder if you could just give a little bit of color, if there are other moving pieces there. Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure, absolutely. So let's, first of all, talk a little bit about the other parts of fees that are part of the non-hotel related fees, and that is when you think about timeshare fees and residential branding fees and things like that, which make up a solid maybe 40% of those non-hotel related fees. They are actually when you consider what's going on with the rev rec, they are actually going down year-over-year. So, that takes your growth in the credit card fees, that is, obviously when you see our number, something like 50%. That brings that overall growth number of the non-hotel fees down meaningfully. And then, on top of that, you've got incentive fees, which as we've talked about before, are in the low-single digits. And that is really a function of the RevPAR guidance that we've given. There is a couple other oddballs like we actually recognized $6 million of deferred incentive fees in 2017, which obviously, we won't have again in 2018. And when you think about \u2013 we had great margin performance in 2017, but with, clearly, a bit stronger RevPAR than our current forecast for 2018 implies, and so when you put that together, that also is the reason for the overall fee growth to be lower. And then last but not least is the reality that, as we're adding hotels, there is some fee ramp. And when you think about the proportion of limited service hotels that we're adding, you have some drag as our hotels get up to stabilized fees. And this is something that, quite frankly, is something the whole industry experiences. And if you look at our 2016 to 2017 performance and you back out the growth that we had in these areas, you'll see the same trend there as well. I think the point I would emphasize is, these are all hotels that are coming on board, they're ramping up nicely, and the growth in the future for the fees is there. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe just as my follow-up, just on the incentive management fees, just looking at North America, the percent in 2017 was unchanged from 2016. It was the same 70% paying fees. But just given the RevPAR increase last year and then the increase in operating margins at those North American managed properties, is that \u2013 maybe it's the what you were mentioning that the limited-service hotels are being added, but \u2013 or did it surprise you that there wasn't an increase in the percent of properties paying incentive management fees? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, no, not at all. That's really \u2013 we have a number of limited-service managed hotels that are in large portfolios. And we actually were very pleased with the performance of our North American hotels. Margins were only up 40 basis points for the year in 2017 in North America, which is not going to move the needle that much in percentage of hotels achieving IMF. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel with Bernstein Research. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks a lot. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, David. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I'm curious, you mentioned from Q4 particular strength in leisure. Are you also seeing an acceleration at all in terms of corporate spending or corporate group booking activity? And to what extent, if you do, do you expect that to carry through to the remainder of the year? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: One of the things that was interesting in Q4 was the transient business. It was up about 4.1%. This is a U.S. figure. And transient, of course, includes corporate negotiated rates, it includes retail rates, includes leisure, it includes some contract rates, all of which are contributing to that. But the corporate RevPAR was 4.1% too. It was essentially right on with the average, which we take on balance to be a fairly encouraging sign. I think if you look back over the last year or so, you would see that the corporate traveler was a bit weaker than the leisure traveler in the sort of average performance of transient. I think the second thing, which we take a little comfort in is that group bookings, while \u2013 and undoubtedly, there'll be more questions about this, we can look at bookings for 2018 or bookings for all future periods, what have you. But groups, too, we broadly split between corporate, association and government. And corporate bookings in Q4 showed a bit of a sign of life, not overwhelmingly different than in prior periods, but stronger than in prior periods. So, all of that is at least a hint of something to be optimistic about. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. And as a quick follow-up, just from your conversations with the corporate leaders out there, they spend a lot traveling with your properties, what is the sense that you get of their willingness or desire to increase business travel spend? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: It is \u2013 I mean, I think that, on the positive side, I've been struck by how broad the optimism is among U.S. corporate CEOs, really dramatically improving post tax reform. But the tone, for example, in many of the conversations I've had with folks is really quite bullish. That doesn't sadly immediately translate into somebody saying, therefore, I'm going to have our team out there spending more money on hotels. I think in a sense, that's a detail, if you will, from at least most CEOs' perspectives. But I think if that optimism translates into better corporate profits, if it translates into more investing activity by companies, I think inevitably, we'll see that that is positive for corporate demand for our industry. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. You mentioned some delays in the construction delivery, which I think you talked about last quarter as well. But I wanted to ask you too, it looks like the Sheraton room system has come down about 2% since your acquisition. How do you think about that going forward in terms of the room counts? And is there any kind of update you can provide on how the RevPAR index is trending for that brand? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We're doing the early work with Sheraton. I think it's going quite well as we've talked about in prior quarters and in other contexts. It's a multiyear task, but huge part of the preparatory work is pulling in owners of existing Sheraton hotels, making sure they understand the standards that will be applied to those hotels, giving them the opportunity to meet those standards. And that you can't necessarily publish standards and say you've got only a week to do that. That's not fair to the kind of partnerships we have with these hotel owners. But that work is well underway. We're deeply engaged with the ownership community and I think making great progress on standard-setting. At the same time, the early ones to fix are the worst ones. And we have, even while we waited for the total development, if you will, of the standards, we know that there are a number of these hotels that are not going to meet those standards, whatever the details are. And so we've been accelerating our work with those to try and move as quickly as we can to get properties moving forward, hopefully, towards renovation to meet standards. But if not, to have them lose the system. And I think we have called, what, 5,000 rooms last year, I think, in the Sheraton portfolio. Our expectations is we will call a bit less than that in 2018. Obviously, we don't know for certain how that will go. But those are decisions that, on balance, we feel really good about, because it's the kind of work that needs to be done in order to get the brand where we want it to be. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And then, Leeny, I just wanted to ask you on the calculation of leverage as the ratings agencies look at it. I assume that they're going to use the new sort of definition of EBITDA as they think about that. And also \u2013 well, if you could confirm that. But also the tax liability that you mentioned related to repatriation of profits, do you think the agencies will look at that as \u2013 in their calculation of debt? I think it's like $700 million or something? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Smedes. Yes, I would expect that in debt-to-EBITDAR that they would assume that it's done based on the new rev rec standard. However, as you know, many of them actually look at two statistics. One is an FFO-to-debt, so a cash flow to debt ratio as well as the debt-to-EBITDAR. And obviously, from the cash flow one, that will not be impacted. And then, the other part is that, on the liability that's included in the debt, they actually use a discounted amount that is actually more like $450 million because they're using the true cash that we expect, which is not the full $745 million, because we've got some tax credits. So that comes down, and then it's paid over time. And so you get the benefit of being able to discount that. So, it's not the full $745 million that's going to go on to your debt calculation, but we would expect that that goes into the debt-to-EBITDAR. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So, just sort of net-net, it sounds like if you're running the company at like 3.1 times or 3.2 times debt-to-EBITDAR, that capacity comes down slightly on those new debt \u2013 new standards? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, it does. If you remember, for us, it's called \u2013 10 basis point is roughly $350 million, so that does take us down about a tick. But again, part of this is about working through with the rating agencies the issue that this is not affecting our cash flow, and that our \u2013 you would argue actually, with the tax reform, that our cash turnover is actually going to be higher. And so, as we look at what's there, it's part of what we've talked to you in our $2.5 billion capital return to shareholders today. And frankly, as you know, Smedes, we work in this range of 3 times to 3.25 times, so I don't expect it to have a meaningful impact. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Felicia. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. So first, Arne, I just wanted to commend management and the board on your decision to return cash to your employees. That was very refreshing to see. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And so, Leeny, on the credit card, I have a question there on the incremental fees. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, if you kind of take your guidance of the $360 million to $380 million this year, and then you back out the $240-ish million that you did last year, you get an incremental, call it, $118 million to $138 million of credit card fees this year. So, I was just wondering, how much of that is coming just from the underlying growth of the program versus the new contract? And I was just hoping that you could walk us through the various buckets of how the incremental fees got broken down between the program, the owners and then to corporate. I know you don't \u2013 you're not going to be specific, but just if you could kind of walk us through how the, call it, $120 million to $140-ish million kind of came to Marriott. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure, absolutely. So, let's talk about \u2013 let's kind of go first things first. Overwhelmingly, the growth that we've talked about in these fees to get to the $360 million to $380 million over the $242 million that we had in 2017, that is overwhelmingly reflecting the improved economics of the new deal. There is perhaps the normal amount of kind of new cards and credit card spend. But overwhelmingly, the increase is from the new terms. So, nothing kind of unusual besides that. So, kind of when you asked the broader question, we're clearly very pleased with the results of the credit card deal. And I would say that there again, the overwhelming amount clearly well more than half of the increased proceeds that we're getting from the credit card companies coming to the company is going to benefit the consumer and the owners and franchisees. And as an example, we reduced the loyalty charge-out rate to owners in 2017. And now, as we've got the new credit card deal, we've already reduced the charge-out rate to the owners by another 10 basis points starting January 1 in 2018. And we actually expect additional loyalty charge-out reductions for our owners later this year, as we harmonize the program. So, similarly, as we are excited about what we're going to do with the harmonization of the loyalty program, we've got a bunch of things that we're doing for the consumers that also will be valuable. So, kind of in the broadest context, I would say that, well over half of the increased benefit is going not to the company, not to our shareholders, but that we do believe the split is fair amongst all the constituencies. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, let me \u2013 I want to jump in on this, too. We threw out a couple of statistics in our prepared remarks with roughly 110 million loyalty members and in excess of half of our rooms revenue coming from those loyalty members, who are disproportionately booking direct with us. We believe that the loyalty program is the name of the game for the future. And we've been impressed by SPG from the moment we acquired Starwood about the passionate loyalty that they have in their program. A big part of that is the value that's been available to those travelers both through their credit card and through the elite benefits particularly that Starwood offered them. And we've got \u2013 we will be announcing these new cards as the year goes along. We will be announcing the plans with respect to harmonization of benefits for the two loyalty programs. And we're making great progress having virtually eliminated all of the restrictions to merging these programs towards a single unified program, hopefully, later this year. And when we roll that out, we will see that we've got extraordinary benefits to our cardholders and to our hotel guests. We will have a materially more cost-effective program for our hotel owners and we're going to do great, too. And of course, all we're giving this morning is our best guess on 2018. We haven't even launched these new cards yet, and we believe that in the years to come, we're going to see that this program continues to grow in terms of number of members, continues to grow in terms of contribution to our hotels and continues to grow in terms of the contribution of Marriott's own P&L. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And just to understand, is there an incremental step-up from the new terms in 2019 or is this kind of a one-time increase? I mean, obviously, I know it's going to grow as members grow, but is there another kind of leg-up? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So, of course, it's too soon to make any predictions about 2019. Couple of comments I would make. As you heard Arne talking about, we are really excited about what we see for the potential for our cardholders. And so we absolutely would like to think there will be more. But at this point, we don't know the exact timing of harmonization and exactly how it will all roll out with the cards. So, it's too early to give you any predictions, but I sure would like to think it'll be higher. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just a housekeeping on SG&A, so you came in about $55 million higher than our estimates. And in the release, you called out some of that, but not all of it. And what I'm just wondering is, is the delta just that it might be a little bit longer timing in terms of getting to your synergy or was there a synergy or is there something else in there? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You're talking about 2018? Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: For 2017, I'm sorry, for the fourth quarter results. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, for 20 \u2013 so, let me go back. For 2017, we would say we have not hit the $250 million in 2017. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: But getting close, over \u2013 I would call it over 80% achievement in 2017, if you're comparing back to the last time you had the two companies with full-throated G&A. If you remember last year in the fourth quarter, you had kind of \u2013 in 2016 compared to 2017, you had quite an unusual situation with lots of people leaving Starwood. And as we pointed out, you had one-timers in 2017 fourth quarter. But again, in 2018, when you take the midpoint of the $940 million that we've talked about, back out the $70 million one-time contribution from the company, you get to $870 million, which is 3% lower G&A than our printed number in 2017, and a clear demonstration of achievement of the $250 million. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Hi, good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Good morning. A quick question on asset sales. It seems like the \u2013 based on prior guidance, you're in the late innings. Yet, you still have a reasonable number of owned hotels yet to sell. And it'd be useful to get an update on what's left to sell and where you are in the process of selling. And I think you've mentioned that, there are no \u2013 in your $2.5 billion, there are no assumptions on asset sales. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: That's right. Sure, we've got 17 hotels left that we own, 10 of which are part of the original Starwood portfolio. Of the 10 that we've got of the original legacy Starwood portfolio, you got two in Canada, two in Asia Pacific, three in CALA, and three in the U.S. And as I talked about before, we continue to absolutely methodically work our way. And they have a variety of kind of situations, whether it's a ground lease, odd ground lease language with one. But as I said before, we are confident there will be additional asset sales this year that gets us to our $1.5 billion. As we've talked about before, Harry, you've always got a few, and frankly, in Marriott's portfolio too, you've got a couple that are in markets that the timing may just really not be right, whether it is Rio or a market that's got a certain pressure related to oil prices, et cetera. But again, we're really pleased with how it's marching along. The Buenos Aires sale that was done for over $100 million in January was terrific, great PIP that we're going to get out of that deal as well as the long-term management agreement. And we're excited about how they continue to move along. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Very good. And my second question is in reference to the mix of your direct bookings relative to your OTA mix. Can you give us a sense over the last several years of how those have moved in opposite directions? And in a softer demand environment, do you think that what you've done to increase the mix of your direct bookings that you're positioned to continue to outperform? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So, I'll start with a couple numbers, and then have Arne fill in on the strategy side. Just from the numbers standpoint, direct bookings continue to be around 70% for the company, with property really being where you see it being a little bit less, over time, coming down 1% or 2%. Digital is now a full 26% of total res as part of that 70%. The OTAs in 2017 were 12%, which was up 1 percentage point penetration over the year before. But again, we don't see it growing any more quickly than before. And as Arne talked about, with our revenue management system, we're excited about the things that we're doing that's allowing properties to choose more profitable business. So overall, the trends haven't changed dramatically. The mobile \u2013 obviously mobile, which is terrific for us, mobile is doing really well in terms of year-over-year increases in res. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Okay. And I'm sorry, Arne, you were going to give your thoughts on how these trends should play out? And should there be a softer demand environment maybe in the next three or four years? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, well, time will tell obviously on this. Leeny's description of this, I think, is quite good. We have obviously, within the direct bookings space, seen a massive shift towards online bookings and away from voice, as an example. That's been steady over the course of the last number of years, including in 2017 where voice has been down mid-single digits and our online bookings has been strengthened. Another observation is, obviously, this is driven, to some extent, by the kind of business in a hotel \u2013 it tends to be the more leisure a hotel's demand base, the higher the third-party contributions are to that hotel. That could be wholesalers or could be OTAs. In part because of that, the Starwood portfolio had a higher reliance on third-party bookings than the Marriott portfolio did. I think some of that we can address internally with sort of a different approach to some of those platforms. And I think as the loyalty program gets stronger, and as the clarity of the benefits to loyalty members becomes clearer, we feel really good about our ability to drive direct bookings throughout the cycle. Obviously, if you're positing a deep recessionary environment, which we don't anticipate any time soon, we'll fight our way through that. But it's interesting, we've seen great shift towards direct channels in the last few years, even with fairly anemic demand growth. And I think, if anything, our tools are going to get stronger here as we pull this loyalty program together and do what we're doing in the technology space. So, we feel pretty good about this. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Thanks very much, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Maybe to stick with that same theme, Arne, in the prepared remarks, and I think, Leeny, you just referred to this as well, but you talked about some tools or some things you may be doing to try and help owners focus on the most profitable business, not just the highest RevPAR business. Could you just elaborate a little bit on what specifically you're doing and maybe what's available today or what's coming with some of the property management system rollouts that you're doing? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, it's hard to give you much more than that general comment, in part, because the details are so many, and they're varied across the platform. But RevPAR has been, for better or worse, the principal measure that a hotel can look at to assess its performance against competing hotels in the market. It's the way you look at us compared to our competitors as brand platforms and companies. And everything seems to flow from that. And it's understandable because RevPAR is the simplest measure of all the measures that might be available from a hotel P&L. But it doesn't really tell the whole story. If you're driving RevPAR on the backs of enormously expensive third-party business that could be charging you, not just teens percentages of room revenues, but sometimes in the 20s or above, you're actually driving revenue at the expense of profitability of the hotels. And of course, our tools have continued to evolve. We have always been focused on profitable contribution. But we want to make sure that the technology tools that our teams can use make that simple to see, and the first measure they look at as opposed to the second measure they look at. And so, we've been essentially evolving our revenue management systems to look not just at RevPAR from various pieces of business, but to look really at the profit contribution that comes from it. And in a sense, there is a little bit of risk in that, because it's harder for us to come out and say, yeah, we might have given up a little bit in RevPAR but we gained in profitability. And necessarily have you say, okay, bravo to that because that RevPAR measure is still going to be the one, which is easiest to see. But long term, the name of the game here is to, obviously, continue to drive great associate satisfaction and guest satisfaction, but make sure we are delivering industry leading profitability to our hotel owning partners, which we are absolutely confident we're doing and we think we've got tools to drive it even further. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that. And then maybe to stay on the same line, just as the follow-up would be, I think that your next large OTA renegotiation is up some time maybe towards the latter part of this year. But could you just give us sort of an update or thought around that negotiation, and is this the first time \u2013 I think, you're able to move Starwood on to your rates, but is this the first time you're going to renegotiate completely as a combined entity or how does that work? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: As usual, you understand it very well. It is the first negotiation we will have had since closing the Starwood acquisition. We did put the Starwood portfolio on the Marriott terms roughly the first of 2017. It took about a quarter in order to get that done after we closed just because of systems issues and the like, and delivered good savings to those hotels as a result. You're right also that our first round of negotiations takes place \u2013 or the contract, I guess, expires \u2013 existing contract expires late in 2018. Negotiations won't start at that precise date, but obviously will precede it. And we'll see where we end up. You have every basis to know what our aims will be in that process and every basis to know what the OTAs' aims will be in that process, and we'll see if we can work it out. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just a question on group pace. I noted yesterday that Hilton \u2013 or that they stated on their earnings call, that booking pace in the fourth quarter was up in \u2013 for all future periods, up in the mid-teens. I'm wondering how you folks fared in the fourth quarter, higher or lower than the mid-teens. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. We saw that statistic too and, actually, in truth, wondered where it comes from. Let me give you a couple of numbers here which I think are interesting. Our group bookings for 2018 compared to the same time last year for 2017 for comp hotels are up about 2%. If you did a measure, which is looking at total number of hotels, including non-comp, it's about double than that but \u2013 double that at about 4% or mid-single digits. I don't think that's a fair measure in truth, because you're getting the benefit there in adding hotels, which really were not in the base a year ago. The second point that I think is pretty profound, in four years ago, when we looked at the group booking window, we saw that business booked in the year for the year or booked for the next year represented 71% of all group bookings. In 2017, that is down 21 full points. So, only 50% of the bookings that we are making now are for the next 24 months in effect. And what that shows you is obvious and that is that as group businesses come back, as we've come out of the recession, we've seen hotels that are fuller and fuller, and therefore, near-term bookings have tended to be growing at a lower rate and longer-term bookings have been growing at a faster rate. When we look at Q4, what we see is that bookings in Q4 for 2018 were down. Bookings in Q4 for 2019 and 2020 were up. And that's really consistent with that booking window pace. To be fair, our bookings for all future periods in Q4 are nothing like up mid \u2013 mid-teens, if that was a number that you heard, and would be, if anything, down modestly from a year-ago period, but we think driven by the fact that the hotels are full. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that. When we think about the mix of rate versus occupancy for 2018 on the group part of the business, is that almost entirely \u2013 any growth entirely rate-driven? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: It's primarily rate-driven, yeah. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Rate, yeah. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. That's all. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks. Two quick follow-ups to Robin and Felicia's earlier question. I guess, one, what is the sensitivity of incentive management fees to RevPAR and net house profits? And then on credit card fees, can you remind us how a new cardholder spends compare to the spend of a similar customer prior to joining, as we think about potential acceleration from these relaunched programs? Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, so a couple of things. On the incentive fees, broadly speaking, we traditionally think that you need RevPAR growth of solidly 3% to be able to maintain margins. Now, it's part of why \u2013 how we talked about that we were pleased with the performance in 2017 in particular, and clearly has some synergies related to the Starwood acquisition in that margin performance. We continue to expect additional non-RevPAR growth-related margin improvement in 2018 as well, as a result of the merger. So, as we've talked about these numbers of 1% to 2% in the U.S. in 2018, that clearly shows you that, from a margin standpoint, it's hard work to try to be able to get higher incentive fees in the U.S. Outside the U.S., however, especially where you don't have owners priority, and we are expecting higher RevPAR growth outside the U.S., you clearly would expect they will more than make up for what could be a tougher incentive fee growth here in the U.S. On the question about credit cards, it's really \u2013 it's not as direct as you described. So, there are a whole host of things going on related to the way the credit card companies pay us across a variety of different metrics. So, obviously, the more credit card holders there are and the more they spend. That is obviously clearly helpful. But there's not a direct relationship that you can look at that's going to be specific to that. As we talked about before, these are dollars that are coming into the company, and they support the loyalty program for consumers, for owners as well as for the shareholders. So, it's a bit more less direct than the way that you've described. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And I can maybe sneak a longer term question there. As we think about the cumulative cash flow investment \u2013 or cash flow for investment that you've guided to in 2019, I think it was $9.8 billion to $11 billion cumulative from the Analyst Day, what are the biggest puts/takes across cash from ops, capital recycling and leverage ratios to think about now that 2017 is in the rear view and you've guided to 2018? Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, sure. Thanks for the question. First and foremost, I'd say we're probably a little ahead of ourselves relative to how you first would look at that about timing from the standpoint of we had terrific asset recycling in 2017. So, it's a little bit like some of that share repurchase was fronted in that three-year plan. I think we clearly are in good shape relative to the metrics that we put out when you see that we repurchased $3 billion in 2017 and you would kind of look at the $2.5 billion that would kind of typically be broken up very broadly in roughly $2 billion for share repurchase and $500 million, in the broader sense, in cash dividend, which again shows you that we're well on our way. When you think about the EPS, it's a little bit more complicated, given that we've got rev rec to deal with. But \u2013 and RevPAR, I think, has broadly been, over the three years, we're talking about generally in line. One of the biggest differences is obviously credit card fees, which is different as well as tax reform. And the tax reform, obviously, adds another 8 points to our effective tax rate \u2013 lowers it. And that broadly adds $200 million of net income down at the bottom line. So, I think from an investment standpoint, the other comment I would make is that we are in very good shape relative to the kind of investment parameters that we laid out for you in that three-year plan. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's great. Thanks. Best of luck this year. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everybody. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Joe. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question is on the contribution from the credit card in 2018. I'm presuming, of the roughly $130 million of incremental fees this year versus last year, the majority of that is coming from the renegotiations of the two programs. Can you talk about the ramp of that throughout the course of 2018? And is it more second half weighted, just given the timing of when those new cards roll out? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. So, first of all, as we were talking about before, it is overwhelmingly from the credit card economics rather than from specifics about kind of an assumption about a big increase in either spend levels or numbers of cards. So, it is kind of the vast majority of it is related to the fact that we've got a stronger economic premise and contract that we're working with. So, it's not per se going to \u2013 there's not as much variability around the credit card spend amounts in the number that we've given you. Frankly, I would expect, Joe, with the introduction of the new cards, it's a little bit hard to predict both in terms of exact timing and behavior on the part of the cardholders. But broadly, I would expect that assuming that people are as attracted to these new cards as we think they will be, that you could expect it to see some ramp during the year. But I would not look for \u2013 I think it'll be fairly even with a tendency towards some ramp during the year, but not massively so. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just my second and final question. When I think about your assumptions for 2018 and your sources and uses of cash, and let's assume that you've returned $2.5 billion, where do you end up at the end of the year in terms of absolute leverage level? How much additional leverage do you put on the balance sheet? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, about $700 million to $800 million, because remember, we've got this year, Joe, we've got a big cash tax bill related to the sale of Avendra. So, kind of relative to what you're normally \u2013 I'll just kind of quickly run through it, and that's you've got roughly $1.9 billion, then you've also got the cash tax and the investment that we've talked about and that gets you down close to $1 billion. And then, you've got loyalty growth that you get from the program, that's, call it, $300 million to $400 million. You've got D&A of another, call it, $300 million. That gets you up close to $1.8 billion. And then you've got additional leverage, which if you think about it, our EBITDA is going up ever so roughly $200 million. You're able to lever that. That gets you another $700 million to $800 million of cash that gets us to our $2.5 billion. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Great. And just to clarify, the cash tax rate of 36% for this year, is that one-time? And what would be the cash tax rate then looking ahead? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes. So, if you see normally, kind of, put apart Avendra, as you heard us talk about, there's about a 3 point hit from the fact that we got to pay the cash repatriation. So again, in broad terms, if we're talking about a 22% book, you could see that that would be higher by 3 percentage points or 4 percentage points. As we pay off this liability over the next number of years, the way that liability breaks out is for the first five years you pay 8% of it back. And again, we're only paying back net of the available tax credits we have. So, that works out to be, call it, $60 million to $70 million a year that kind of is above what you normally would pay compared to your normal book tax. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Guys, thanks for taking the question here. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : I want to go back to a comment, I think, you made on the last earnings call where you said that, within the U.S. guidance for 2018, select-service hotels were more likely to outperform this year versus full-service. I wonder if that still holds, and if you could add a little more color to that? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You think I said which way, select-service would outperform or full-service would outperform? Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Select-service would outperform full-service. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I guess I still remember the opposite. I think the \u2013 or I don't know that I've got a schedule actually to look at or forecast by brand. You might pull those up. But the \u2013 as I recall, the \u2013 I think it's going to vary obviously a little bit by destination. I think as we go into 2018, we've got guidance, which is fundamentally forecasted on a bit more of the same. In other words, what we saw in 2017 with relatively weak corporate demand with stronger leisure demand. I think at the same time, we've got relatively greater supply growth in the select-service space. And my recollection, and again, we'd go back and take a look at the words, I may have misspoken here or maybe remembering wrong. But my recollection of what I said then, and I think our views today would be that given the relatively higher supply growth in select-service, we would expect full service, which probably also means some urban select-service to be stronger than select-service in 2018. Now, you do have some geographic issues here when you get to a market like Texas, for example. It probably has \u2013 it skews a bit more towards the select-service space than full-service space. Texas is, right now, very strong because of hurricane recovery. Before the hurricane, it was quite weak because of the economic issues in the oil patch. I think in \u2013 they will skew the numbers a little bit, but in the first part of 2018, we should continue to see some benefit from hurricane recovery. I suspect that will dissipate as we get further into the year, and that the fare comparison will favor full-service modestly in 2018. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : All right. There is a chance I have that precisely the opposite, so thanks for that. I will go back and... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: That makes two of us. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: We're also seeing some support in the resorts where because of some hotels in CALA, for example, that were closed, we're seeing really strong demand in our full-service resorts, for example, in Florida. That's going to again lead you towards Arne's comment about full-service. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thank you. And then I want to ask you a quick question just about the episode with the China website shutdown earlier this quarter. And I know it's a sensitive topic, but just what could you tell us about maybe the financial impact on the first quarter? And then, is there a lesson learned there that just in terms of doing business in China that you guys took away from that, that we should be aware of? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, let me take the financial part of this first. We don't expect there to be a measurable impact to our financial results. Now, to be fair, that depends on our not making more mistakes in this space, which we're doing everything in our power to avoid doing. But what we went through in January principally probably spilled into a little bit of the first few days of February was, we think not \u2013 didn't really cost us in terms of significant business impact to the hotels. It's a classic story. We relied on a third-party vendor to deliver a customer survey, online customer survey to us, which listed not just Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries but also Tibet, extraordinary sensitivity about issues like that in China. We should have caught it, even though it was provided by a third-party and we didn't catch it. And we moved quickly to fix that mistake. And of course, we're moving as quickly as we can to look at all of the stuff that we've got exposed out there online to customers in China and customers around the world to make sure that we are not making similar mistakes in the future. It is both \u2013 it is principally something that Chinese social media is looking at. It is not a geopolitical issue fundamentally, and we don't think anybody particularly wants to make it a geopolitical issue. But to state the obvious, we weren't intending in that customer survey to make comments about sovereignty issues in China. It's not our position to really take a political position. And we're going to do what we can in the future to avoid sort of entering into those sort of political conversations. What we want to do is run the hotels as best we can in China for our associates, our guests and our hotel owners, and we remain extraordinarily bullish on prospects for us in China. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thank you, Arne. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just one question for me. We're halfway through the first quarter. Can you give us any commentary about how trends have been? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, let me talk about \u2013 I'm surprised we're 45 minutes into the Q&A without a question really about the RevPAR guidance and whether it's conservative or aggressive. And this is as close as I guess we're getting to that. I'll say a couple of things here. The fourth quarter numbers, obviously, were better than we anticipated. Take note of the statistic we gave you in the prepared remarks, up 3.9%, but we think about 1.5 points of that was holiday and hurricane-driven, so it puts you at 2.5%. That is \u2013 or 2.4%, I guess if you do the math precisely. Even that was a bit better than we anticipated, and a principal reason for the really strong Q4 results, which we feel great about. But when you look under the national averages, you see some things which are pretty interesting. New York City was essentially flat in the fourth quarter plus a few tenths of a point. South Florida up almost 17 points, Houston up 25% in the fourth quarter. Both of those markets were driven by the hurricane recovery efforts, which are obviously driving demand there. Chicago was down a few points in Q4. But you've got markets like LA and San Francisco and D.C., which on average, between the three of them, were up about 4%, so up about the same average as the market. I dragged you through all of that, because it tells you something about the hazards of relying on the strong fourth quarter and saying, we know, therefore, that this is a sign of sort of a meaningful shift in generic demand across the United States. Now, we did better in Q4 than we anticipated. So there's more good news here than negative news, but it is still early in the year. I think we would describe January is off to a really good start and a bit better than we would have anticipated. But again, we're talking about one month, and we want to see how the rest of the year goes. I think at the moment we would think there's more upside possibility than downside risk. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Arne, this question stands from the investment announcement of the EDITION Hotel in Las Vegas. I'm just curious whether you're seeing more opportunities to invest directly in properties, whether there's more of a need for you to invest in properties and given maybe the Marriott valuation today, whether it might be more appealing to invest directly in opportunities. Can you just talk about your capital allocation decision at this point? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, this is a roughly 4,000-room hotel, principally JW Marriott, but also in EDITION Hotel. We're, obviously, thrilled to be on measure to be entering into Las Vegas with a big managed hotel platform with about 500,000 square feet of meeting space. So, this is going to be spectacular for us long-term. We're investing $50 million over time in the equity in this project, which we're also very pleased to do in the context of a transaction of this size. We think the equity investment is likely to yield good positive returns. But if, in theory, it delivered nothing, it would still be an excellent deal for us because of the strength of the fee stream and the strength of the contribution this hotel will have to our system. And so I wouldn't read our investment in the Las Vegas project as a predictor of more capital investing by us. I think there is still plenty of capital out there willing to invest in good projects. You see that from the 125,000 rooms that we signed last year. And I think we'll see that \u2013 we might see some interest rates move up a little bit this year, obviously, based on what's happened so far. But as long as that is being matched with more optimism about performance, I think we'll see that both we can continue good unit growth and relatively little need for capital. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. My follow-up question, Arne, is on international inbound travel and whether you're seeing any reversal of the loss of market share that we've experienced the last 12 or 18 months. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: No, I mean, one of the challenges here is that the data is really hard to get for the industry as a whole. Actually, I was having a conversation yesterday about a couple of government agencies that \u2013 U.S. government agencies that have data, which does not seem to be exactly the same. And so, it's really hard to get sort of current data as you look at it. I think a couple of things that we would say that a number of different data sources tell us that international arrivals to the U.S. in 2017 were down about 4% to 5%, while total international travel around the world was up about 7%. It doesn't take a genius to know that, that means we're losing share. When we look at our data in a market like New York, as an example, we think international arrivals in New York City last year were down, in our system, 7% to 8%. Fred Dixon, who runs NYC & Co., will have probably better industry data than we will. But I think generally, we're seeing that the United States is losing share. We don't believe, and I don't think there's any voice in the industry that believes, it is wrong to focus on security and protecting our borders and those sorts of things. But we do believe that we can do those things politically and still communicate a welcome to the rest of the world and have people come here both to do business and take our vacations. And that's the kind of encouragement we're trying to give to our government and trying to use Brand USA and other platforms to make sure we deliver that welcome or that invitation to the rest of the world to come here. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Michael. Michael Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I just wanted to kind of follow up on Bill's question on the capital allocation front, just as you think about buy backs stocks at 18 times EBITDA, has anything changed for you? And then, is there or will we ever get to a crossover point when maybe tuck-in deals or more investment in your portfolio make more sense than buying back stock at 18 times, 19 times, 20 times EBITDA? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, first and foremost, growth in our business of how we want to invest our money \u2013 growth in our business comes first. We will always be seeking opportunities to spend our money in value-added ways for our shareholders, for our system, for our customers first. The reality is we've got tons of owners and franchisees and contracts where they want to be part of our system and aren't looking for capital. And we still are in a position where the vast majority of the contracts that we sign require no capital on our part. However, we have been robust investors in projects, where they make sense and where there's good kind of return above our cost of capital for a long time, and we continue to do it. We talked about that we recycled close to $200 million worth of loans that we made last year. Those are terrific examples, two of which were related to our new Moxy brand in the U.S. So, there are great opportunities to invest, and we want to always make sure to be doing that first and foremost. However, the reality is we generate well more cash than we need to grow the system organically. We, of course, continue to \u2013 we would take a look at tuck-ins just like we have proven to do and execute on well before. From a share repurchase standpoint, you saw what we did so far in Q1. We continue to be purchasers of our stock. Clearly, the stock moved a lot after the tax reform was passed. And we will continue to be opportunistic. So, that means around the edges, we are definitely going to be keeping our eye out on what's going on and how the stock is performing. But when we get down to fundamentals of what we believe long term in the value that we are creating, as we said before, we would expect to return $2.5 billion to our shareholders this year through a combination of share repurchase and dividends. Michael Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Actually that's helpful, and just one follow-up. Could you maybe provide a percentage of deals you signed or opened last year that did include some sort of Marriott investment in them? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I can... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: A minority. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I was going to say we can get them for you. I mean, obviously, when you think about, I think we signed 750? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: 770 \u2013 757. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: 750 deals last year. Again, a vast majority of those would not have capital required. Certainly, on the kind of classic limited-service franchise side, you can get up to in the 90s percent not requiring any capital. So, we can work on a number, but it's going to be really a small percentage. Michael Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I just had one. As you reflect on 2017 and the merger, Leeny, are you able to quantify the revenue synergies from Starwood or at least kind of help us with the RPI gains? And then going forward, should we expect any revenue synergies to occur in 2018 or could those maybe be pushed back to 2019 after the loyalty points are merged? Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. So certainly from an RPI standpoint, we were pleased with the gain that we had worldwide system-wide across the portfolio and, clearly, do believe that we are gaining revenue benefits from the merger as well as from the great work that our teams are doing in the hotels and what we're offering to consumers. But yes, to your point, we do believe there is more to come. We think what's going on with the credit cards and the combination of the loyalty program will be critical pieces to kind of taking a leg up on our share of wallet. And so we would expect more of that in both 2018 and 2019 and, frankly, for what we hope is for some time to come. In terms of kind of specific timing, I think again, the harmonization and the unification of the program will fold out later this year and into 2019, so we look forward to excitement on the part of the customers to know that they'll be able to go have one program to spend their dollars at any of our 6,500 hotels. You've seen us be doing a lot in the way of innovation to try to make the process, your entire travel process seamless with us. So, whether it is our PlacePass investment, which will attract people to be able to do more than just choosing a hotel, to the Alibaba work that we have to make it easier for Chinese consumers to book our hotels worldwide, all of those things, we believe, are important additions to what we're doing to make that share of wallet happen. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I want to add something here, too, just on the strength of the integration so far, and give kudos to Leeny and team, but also all the operators out there. As we mentioned, we have been really focused on delivering economies of scale to our owners. Loyalty rates have been reduced already twice and they will be reduced a third time, while strengthening the benefits to guests and strengthening Marriott's own P&L contribution from the credit cards, and that's because of the bigger program. Because of that and other things that we've been doing, you can see that in Q4, for example, U.S. managed hotels, we drove margins up 100 basis points. We gave you the number in the prepared remarks for a global full year margin improvement. And I am absolutely convinced that our margin performance is leading, and it is leading because of a number of things that we've done around the integration. We had a specific 50 basis point incremental margin target in 2017 because of the integration, so over and above whatever the impact might normally be from RevPAR, we have another 50 basis point target in 2018. And through every tool we can imagine, procurement, OTA contracts, we mentioned in the prepared remarks something about credit card commission, transactional costs and all of that is, I think, moving very well. On the revenue side, the most exciting thing is yet to come, which is the merger of these loyalty programs into one loyalty program. And when you look at the enhanced benefits that the customers will achieve and you look at our portfolio of luxury and lifestyle hotels, particularly, which are the things which motivate people to earn points with you, we think we're going to drive increased share of wallet from our loyalty members, and the revenue lift will be something that hopefully, we start to see the latter part of this year, but certainly as we get into 2019 and beyond. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Berenberg. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Yeah. I have a couple of questions, please. First of all, on the leverage, could you tell us how the Avendra cash is being treated? Is that being treated as your cash until you spend it or is it being restricted cash? And how does that fit into your leverage target? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Right. It's not restricted cash because we will \u2013 we are likely to spend that over a number of years. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. And as a follow-up, could you share with us \u2013 obviously, you've given us some detail on the new credit card deal and what's coming to you. Could you give us a guide on the headline gross revenues that were incrementally added from the deal? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. It's not really a meaningful \u2013 because of the way it comes in, it's not a meaningful comparison because of a host of different ways that we are paid. We also have the reality that we are still operating under two different \u2013 we've got two different loyalty programs now, they'll ultimately be harmonized. So, frankly, it's not really that relevant a number, so we wouldn't be able to make that available. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. And thanks to all of you for your participation this morning. We'd love your interest in our story. Look forward to talking to you before long. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good morning. My name is Brandy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Marriott International First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on-mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, the CEO of Marriott International. You may begin your conference. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today May 9, 2018 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. This quarter, we have provided a set of slides to assist with today's discussion. You can find them on our website at www.marriott.com/investor or in our 8-K filing. In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger related costs, reimbursed revenues and related expenses, a net adjustment to the tax charge related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and an adjustment to the Avendra gain. GAAP results appear on Page A-1 of the earnings release, but our remarks today will largely refer to the adjusted results that appear on the non-GAAP reconciliation pages. Of course you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our website. So, let's get started. We were very pleased with our results in the first quarter. Worldwide, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR increased 3.6%, beating the top-end of our guidance by 60 basis points. Gross fee revenues rose 11% and adjusted earnings per share increased 40%. Let's talk about the regions. Systemwide constant dollar RevPAR in our Asia Pacific region increased 10%, which was much stronger than the mid single-digit growth we expected. Hotels in Greater China saw an increase in RevPAR of nearly 12% due to better than expected corporate and leisure demand. Travel during the Chinese New Year exceeded our expectations and outbound demand from Greater China helped drive double-digit RevPAR growth in Thailand and Singapore. Indonesia RevPAR increased 5% as many volcano-related travel advisories were lifted. For our comparable hotels RevPAR in India increased 6% in the first quarter on strong corporate and leisure demand. Just last month, I attended the grand opening of our 100th hotel in India, the Sheraton Grand Bengaluru Whitefield Hotel & Convention Center. The mood in India is very upbeat. The Asian Development Bank recently forecasted that in 2018, India will have the fastest growing economy in Asia, following recent financial reforms. With this rapid near-term growth and rising middle class, we are bullish about India. With over 20,000 open rooms, India is already our fourth largest market in the world, just behind the U.S., China and Canada, and has more than 11,000 rooms in our development pipeline. In the Middle East and Africa, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose over 3% year-over-year compared to flat results expected for the quarter. RevPAR in Egypt rose 30% on easy comparisons, while the UAE saw greater leisure demand from China and India helped by the opening of the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi. South Africa's RevPAR declined 2% due in part to the water crisis in Cape Town. In Europe, strong economic growth took systemwide constant dollar RevPAR up nearly 6% in the quarter year-over-year, consistent with the mid single-digit growth assumed in our first quarter guidance. We saw mid-teens RevPAR growth in Eastern Europe on strong corporate and leisure demand, while RevPAR in Turkey and France continued to rebound. London RevPAR was flat year-over-year, reflecting weak demand from the financial services industry likely Brexit related. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR increased nearly 9% in the quarter, which was stronger than the mid single-digit growth included in our guidance. RevPAR at our comparable Caribbean hotels increased over 20%, benefiting from lower industry supply as many hotels remain out of the service following last year's hurricanes. Mexico RevPAR declined 5% following the steep devaluation of the peso and continued travel warnings for some markets. RevPAR in our Central and South American markets increased at a high single-digit rate on average with significant and surprising demand strength in Argentina, Brazil and Costa Rica. Let's turn to North America. As you may recall last quarter, we were hopeful we would see a pickup in North America economic growth. Our hopes have been realized. It's time to take the numbers up a bit. Recall that in 2017, our North American RevPAR increased 2.1%. If adjusted for calendar and event anomalies such as the inauguration, shifting holidays and the 2017 hurricanes, we estimated 2017 RevPAR would have increased 1.7%. In the first quarter of 2018, North American RevPAR rose 2% at the high end of our guidance. Excluding the impact of the shifting Easter holiday, last year's presidential inauguration and the lingering impact of the hurricanes, we estimate RevPAR would have been up 2.7%, a full point higher than 2017's adjusted numbers. This acceleration is encouraging. Transient RevPAR increased roughly 2.5% in the first quarter, helped by reduced corporate discounting in the legacy Starwood portfolio, better leisure demand, improved international arrivals, and overall strengthening corporate demand, particularly in the oil and gas industry. Special corporate room rates at Legacy-Marriott Hotels increased nearly 3% in the quarter. Speaking of oil, we are encouraged by recent demand trends in energy markets. You may recall that it was the energy business where we first saw weaker RevPAR trends in the fourth quarter of 2015. More recently, Houston's RevPAR was significantly impacted by Hurricane Harvey in the 2017 fourth quarter and the difficult year-over-year Super Bowl comparison in the 2018 first quarter. Yet underlying oil and gas industry demand has been improving. We looked at the RevPAR performance of our hotels in 40 energy submarkets in the U.S. in places such as Oklahoma, North Dakota and Louisiana to name a few. Excluding Houston, we note that RevPAR for our hotels in these U.S. markets rose 6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 8% in the first quarter of 2018. Canadian energy markets were even stronger. We are also encouraged by recent group trends. We expected lower group business as we started the quarter due to the shift in the Easter holiday. Actual group RevPAR was stronger than expected, ending flat year-over-year for the first quarter. Outperformance was largely due to better than expected attendance at group meetings and stronger group business at our limited-service hotels. Food and beverage trends are improving too. Food and beverage revenue per group room night rose nearly 6% in the quarter. RevPAR at our luxury hotels in North America increased 4.3% in the first quarter. Luxury hotels in Miami benefited from Florida and Caribbean hotels still out of service from the 2017 hurricanes, while RevPAR at our luxury hotels in Hawaii benefited from renovations and greater air lift from the U.S. Mainland and Japan. RevPAR growth at Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis was stronger than expected. RevPAR at our North American upscale hotels increased 1% as the shifting holiday constrained group demand at large full-service hotels. We are encouraged that group revenue booking pace for our luxury and upper-upscale hotels is up more than 4% for the second quarter and up 1% to 2% for the second half of 2018 compared to prior-year periods. RevPAR at our North American limited-service hotels increased 2.5% in the quarter compared to the year-ago quarter despite a mid single-digit percentage increase in industry room supply in this tier. Limited-service hotels saw strong demand from the oil and gas industry, continued hurricane recovery demand, and both the Super Bowl in Minneapolis and the playoffs in Philadelphia. Group revenue at our limited-service hotels rose 4%. Our economic outlook has improved. At the same time, the labor market is tight, and wages are rising in many markets. This is pressuring hotel operating margins and lengthening new hotel construction timelines, particularly for non-prototype and urban hotels in North America and Europe. Leeny will speak in a few minutes about our terrific hotel operating margin performance in the face of these trends. We continued to make great progress in our integration of Starwood. Thus far in 2018, we have combined financial reporting systems, integrated our North American sales organization, and recycled approximately $170 million in capital from asset sales and loan repayments. By August, we expect guests will be able to see and book all of our inventory on each of our Marriott and Starwood websites and apps, and enjoy our unified loyalty programs. New cobranded credit cards from Chase and AmEx should enrich guest loyalty even further. We look forward to rolling our hotels onto a single reservation system in stages with the first group of hotels converting in the fall of 2018. And finally we expect owners will continue to see significant cost savings as the integration continues. But innovation is as important to us as integration. Our Moments platform continues to grow and enrich our loyalty programs. Currently, the platform includes more than 110,000 experiences in 1,000 destinations, ranging from destination tours and day trips like shark cage diving in South Africa to once in a lifetime events like sipping champagne trackside at next month's Belmont Stakes. Last summer, we formed a new joint venture with Alibaba to improve service and sales for Chinese guests. Just last month, the JV launched our redesigned storefront on Alibaba's travel site, Fliggy. It now features our global inventory of hotels with a localized, mobile enhanced and user friendly layout. During 2018, we are rolling out Alipay, Post Post Pay, an innovative hotel payment service to a 1,000 hotels worldwide. Alipay, Post Post Pay enables qualified Fliggy users to enjoy a comprehensive wallet-free experience during their stay. We entered into agreement to manage the first-ever Ritz-Carlton Luxury Yacht, bringing Ritz-Carlton's service and our asset-light business model to the luxury cruise business. The first Ritz-Carlton yacht with 149 luxury suites is scheduled to launch in 2020. Last month, we announced that we are testing home sharing in London with approximately 200 Tribute Portfolio Homes. While only a test, we are integrating our home sharing offerings into our loyalty programs. Curating for design, functionality, location and safety, and providing the commitment to service and quality that is not typical in this space. Behind the scenes, we recently launched a new customer recognition platform which will allow Marriott associates globally both on- and off-property to deliver better service. Integrated with our mobile app and chat functions, our associates will be able to access guest portfolios, preferences and history to ensure every guest anywhere in the world can receive truly personalized service. This is another use of technology to drive guest satisfaction. House profit margins declined 10 basis points for our North American upper-upscale hotels in the first quarter in the face of modest RevPAR growth and higher operating expenses, particularly labor costs. This kind of margin pressure caused us to reduce commission rates for most group intermediaries in North America from 10% to 7% for bookings made on or after April 1 of this year. This change will not have a material impact on Marriott International's results, but the commission change should make a meaningful difference to hotel owners, particularly those where group business is a significant share of their overall occupancy. The change in commission rates triggered a considerable number of new group bookings in the first quarter largely for meetings taking place in 2020 and beyond. On the development front, we opened nearly 15,000 rooms worldwide in the first quarter and our pipeline at quarter end approached 465,000 rooms. We signed just under 20,000 new rooms in the quarter, 10% more than in the first quarter of 2017. According to STR, we have the largest pipeline of guest rooms under development in the world. Let's look at a few of the details. Our development pipeline skews toward faster growing international markets. While one-third of our open rooms are in international markets, over half of the rooms in our pipeline are located outside North America, and of our international pipeline, nearly 60% of the rooms are in the Asia Pacific region. While we already have the largest luxury and upper-upscale portfolio in the world, our strong pipeline should extend that lead even further. In fact a number of our luxury and upper-upscale pipeline rooms exceed that of our next three largest global competitors combined. Full-service hotels drive significant fees per room and enhance the value of our loyalty program, which is strengthened by the aspirational destinations it offers. Given our scale, we are excited to think about what we can accomplish once integration is complete. Today as a much larger company, we are enhancing an already efficient cost structure and providing greater resources to drive high value demand. And even with these exciting changes, our core strategy is unchanged. We remain a manager and franchisor of the leading lodging brands in the world. We continue to work to make our brands even stronger. We embrace change perhaps now more than ever and we pride ourselves on our corporate culture, a culture of service to others. Marriott is a company with a more than 90-year history of creating value for its shareholders and we are committed to continuing to do so. Before turning the microphone over to Leeny, let me thank Marriott's associates around the world. They are shouldering the burden of integrating Marriott and Starwood even as they deliver excellent results for our business as usual. Their work inspires me. Thanks for all you do. Now for some more thoughts about first quarter performance and our outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you, Arne. For the first quarter of 2018, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.34 compared to $0.96 in the year-ago quarter. Both first quarter 2018 and first quarter 2017 reflect the new revenue recognition accounting standard. We expect to have the remaining 2017 quarters and the 2017 full year income statement reflecting the new rules available to you later this quarter. In the first quarter, gross fee revenues totaled $845 million, an 11% increase year-over-year largely from unit growth, RevPAR gains and higher incentives and branding fees. Credit card fees alone totaled $86 million, up 58% while other non-property fees including application and re-licensing fees, timeshare fees and residential branding fees increased 6% to $38 million. With a weaker U.S. dollar, first quarter fee revenue also benefited from a nearly $8 million favorable impact from foreign exchange net of hedges. Worldwide house profit margins for company-operated hotels improved 70 basis points on a 4.0% increase in managed hotel RevPAR. In North America, margins declined slightly on a 1.4% increase in company-operated hotel RevPAR. Despite the modest RevPAR growth and significant wage growth, we were able to hold on to our North America house profit margins due to procurement savings, productivity improvement and the roll-out of shared services to more hotels. We estimate efficiency improvements and synergies contributed an average of 50 basis points to worldwide property level margins in 2017 and our goal is to add another 50 basis points apart from the impact of RevPAR growth on average in 2018. Beginning in the third quarter, we expect to standardize loyalty charge-out rates by chain scale with most brands benefiting from even lower charge-out rate. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses totaled $70 million in the first quarter, a 3% decline from the prior year. The sale of four properties in 2017 and early 2018 reduced results in the quarter by $22 million year-over-year, while termination fees increased results by $21 million. General and administrative expenses increased by $35 million in the first quarter due to the additional profit sharing match for associates for 2018. Last quarter, we announced our plan to invest roughly $140 million during 2018 in our most important asset, our people with about $70 million of the cost funded by Marriott and the remainder funded by a portion of the Avendra proceeds. We are largely doing this by increasing our retirement savings match of associate contributions by up to $1,000 for the first $200 invested by eligible associates in the U.S. We also intend to invest in other associate support programs during the year. Of the $70 million of expected Marriott costs for this investment, $35 million was reflected in our G&A expenses in the first quarter. Given the five to one match feature for the first $200 invested, we expect the expenses associated with this plan to be frontend loaded in the first half of 2018. We estimate our second quarter G&A will include $25 million for this investment with the remaining $10 million expense to be reflected in G&A in the second half of the year. Unfavorable foreign exchange also increased G&A expense by $6 million, but was offset by synergy savings. First quarter gains largely reflect $53 million associated with the sale of the Buenos Aires Sheraton and Park Tower properties. First quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 8% to $770 million and reflected a roughly $20 million negative impact from sold hotels. Looking ahead, we expect worldwide constant dollar systemwide RevPAR will increase 3% to 4% in both the second quarter and the full year. In the Asia Pacific region, we expect second quarter and full year RevPAR will increase at a high single-digit rate reflecting continued strength in corporate and leisure demand. The Caribbean and Latin American region had a very strong first quarter, but RevPAR growth should slow a bit as many hurricane damaged hotels in the Caribbean reopened during the year creating tougher comparison. In Europe, we expect RevPAR will continue to grow at a mid single-digit rate in both the second quarter and the full year 2018. For the Middle East and Africa region, the timing of Ramadan should reduce RevPAR in the second quarter with offsetting stronger results expected in the third quarter. For the full year, the region's RevPAR is likely to be flat. All-in-all, we believe our international hotels could increase RevPAR by 5% to 6% for both the second quarter and the full year. For North America, we expect RevPAR will grow 3% to 4% in the second quarter as group business benefits from the timing of Easter. For the full year, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 3%. This outlook is more bullish than on our last call reflecting the stronger demand trends Arne discussed. We continue to expect 5.5% to 6% net worldwide rooms growth for the full year disproportionately skewed toward international markets. Slide 11 shows our guidance for the second quarter. Given our worldwide RevPAR and unit growth assumptions, we expect gross fee revenue for the second quarter will total $935 million to $945 million, an 11% increase over the prior year. Our fee revenue estimate assumes $90 million to $95 million in credit card branding fees in the second quarter and roughly $10 million in favorable foreign exchange impact. We expect owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total roughly $80 million in the second quarter. In the 2017 second quarter, we earned $14 million from assets that have since been sold. Our guidance assumes no further asset sales beyond those that have been completed. G&A should total roughly $250 million in the second quarter reflecting the roughly $25 million expense for our additional profit sharing contribution. These assumptions yield $1.34 to $1.36 diluted earnings per share for the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $880 million to $890 million, 7% to 9% over adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter 2017. We estimate our second quarter adjusted EBITDA reflects an $11 million negative impact from sold hotels. For the full year 2018, we believe gross fee revenue could increase 11%. This is a meaningful increase over our last guidance reflecting stronger RevPAR and margin growth, and about $25 million of favorable foreign exchange impact. We believe incentive fees will increase at a roughly 10% rate, which is faster than we previously modeled largely due to the stronger RevPAR and margin growth in the Asia Pacific region. We continue to expect our credit card branding fees will total $360 million to $380 million in 2018. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expense, should total roughly $300 million for the year, modestly higher than our last forecast largely due to higher termination fees in the first quarter. G&A should total $940 million to $950 million for 2018, which includes our $70 million additional contribution to profit sharing. Our full year estimate of gains has increased $20 million to $25 million, largely reflecting transactions that are already complete including the sale in April of a JV interest that resulted in proceeds of $46 million. Our full year outlook assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of roughly 23%. In our February earnings guidance, we assumed a 22% effective tax rate. The change is due to some discrete items and fine tuning. For 2018, we continue to expect our cash tax rate will total 36%. These assumptions yield $5.43 to $5.55 diluted earnings per share for 2018 and adjusted EBITDA of $3.445 billion to $3.5 billion, 10% to 12% over the 2017 adjusted EBITDA. Our full year adjusted EBITDA estimate reflects a roughly $45 million negative impact from sold hotels as well as the $70 million cost associated with the retirement match for our associates. As we discussed last quarter, our 2018 guidance excludes the adjustments to the Avendra gain, merger related costs, the timing impact of reimbursed revenues and expenses, and adjustments to the tax charge. Investment spending for the year could total $600 million to $700 million, including roughly $225 million of maintenance spending. The remainder includes capital expenditures, loan advances, equity investments and contract investment. While contract investment is included in our investment spending estimate, under the new revenue standard, contract investment will be included in our cash flow statement going forward under the heading cash from operating activities rather than in the investing activities section as in the past. We have already recycled over $1.3 billion of capital through asset sales and loan repayments to-date since the closing of the Starwood acquisition. We're on track to reach our post-acquisition $1.5 billion target by year end 2018, but our 2018 earnings and cash flow guidance assume no further asset sales. We repurchased nearly 8 million shares from January 1 through yesterday for approximately $1.1 billion. With the benefit of higher anticipated earnings and cash flow, we now expect to return over $3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2018. Last quarter, we estimated cash return to shareholders of approximately $2.5 billion for 2018. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As of March 31, our debt ratio was at the low end of our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.25 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR. We've modeled our 2018 income statement and cash flow forecast at a 3.2 times target. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask you, I guess specifically on your pipeline, it was up around 5,000 rooms sequentially. I realize it's still a big number, but it's a little lower in terms of growth than it has been. And I was just wondering if you could talk about, you mentioned the higher construction cost, if that's impacting your pipeline or if there's anything else in particular going on in the quarter. And along with that, your deletions seemed a little higher than usual as well. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, those are all perfectly fair questions. I think the best news around development pipeline we've put in the prepared remarks, which is the signing of about 10% more deals in Q1 than Q1 last year, which was gratifying to us. I mean, we have talked before about the fact that we think organic industry growth in the United States in terms of new signings probably peaked in 2015-2016 timeframe. Obviously, we've got some new brands. I would call out particularly Moxy and AC that are driving some of that signup as well as the sort of rebooting of Element and Aloft, which should give us the ability to compete better than the industry as a whole. But there is a lot of growth that's occurred in the United States and I think as a consequence, having some increase in the number of signings was again a gratifying thing for us to see. We did, as we do every quarter, look through the entire development portfolio. We culled some deals that we were less confident would ultimately get completed, and of course, in culling those deals, we bring down a little bit offset to the signings we've signed. So, we had a little bit less growth in the total pipeline in Q1. In terms of the deletions, each one is its own story. I think I've looked through every individual hotel that left the system in first quarter of 2018. It's never a surprise to see that many of those hotels are not contributing much in fees, in part because they are either at the end of their contract life and not necessarily competing as well or participating in markets that are under a bit more pressure or to some extent because they weren't contributing sort of their fair share, we were less interested in having them stay in the system. And all those things sort of go into this calculation. But I think all things considered, we still saw some modest growth in the pipeline. And we're sticking tight with the 5.5% to 6% net unit growth, which again this year we'll open more rooms than we did last year. Last year, we opened more than we opened the year before. And I suspect the odds are that next year we'll open more rooms than we open in 2018. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you on your Tribute portfolio. You mentioned you're testing it. I guess how long would you be testing before you sort of enter in a more formal way into this business? And I mean what kind of scope do you think this could reach over few years and just to be a more meaningful piece of earnings over time? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, we're going to take this a step at a time. I think within a few months, we should be able to learn considerable lessons from what we're doing in London. And if it goes well and we're quite optimistic, it will, we'll look at extending that to other cities. Our plan for timesharing \u2013 for home sharing, excuse me, is to learn as we go here a little bit. But we want to make sure we are delivering a high quality service experience and we want to make sure we're delivering whole homes. So that it is, if you will, the higher end of the market. It's a place where branding can make a difference. It's a place where we can deliver an experience both in terms of service and quality that we want our customers to have. And it's a place where we can feel really good about connecting it to the loyalty program. Now, by the way, in the whole home space, it's also meaningfully different from a standard hotel room, which makes it a more comfortable place for us to add. But I think we'll watch this as we go. We'll obviously keep you posted on the way this is developing, but we're off to a great start in the first few weeks that we've been engaged with this in London. We're getting great response from our customers, and we feel good about it. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : ...on two things. Good morning. First is on corporate negotiated rates. I wonder if you could talk about where you expect them to come in for the year in terms of a 1% increase. And also were a lot of those negotiations done before you saw the improvement in business travel that now you've seen in Q1. In other words, are those maybe at rates that wouldn't reflect where you'd want them to be for the year? And then I also had a question on margins, which was just that looking at your North American margin was basically flat with 2% RevPAR growth. And I wanted to ask how sustainable that is as you talked about some of the cost saves from the combination and kind of that 50 basis points that that would add hopefully this year as well. Is that enough to keep margins flat at 2% RevPAR growth? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Leeny will take the margin question here, but let me make a couple of comments on the special corporate rates. We had special corporate rate growth of about 3% in Q1, which all things considered is not bad. I think your second question is fair though. Obviously, we negotiate special corporate accounts typically in the fall. And to the extent that we are more optimistic about the economy collectively now than we were in the fall, we presumably could do a bit better in those negotiations if they were happening today than we did last fall. But that's hardly a stark difference. And let's take a reminder here. I think Marriott is performing extraordinarily well. Marriott's business model is performing extraordinarily well. We feel meaningfully better about our prospects today than we did a quarter ago. But we're still talking about 2% to 3% RevPAR growth in the U.S. for full year 2018. We're not changing numbers to sort of a mid to high single-digit number which obviously is something we've seen in some prior economic environments. And of course that 2% to 3% RevPAR growth that continues to put a premium on making sure we're driving rates and now for Leeny making sure what we can on the cost side. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So on the margin side Robin, you look at Q1 at 1.4% managed RevPAR growth. That was absolutely essentially entirely from rate which does help us to the extent of trying to hold on to as much margin as we can. However, we have typically thought about needing about 3% RevPAR growth to hold onto margin. And from that standpoint with the synergies that we're getting from the Starwood acquisition, I think that number is probably a little bit better. But I think to assume 2% and flat margins that would be a great goal to shoot for that we obviously would try to do. But it would be right at the edge of being able to hold onto margin including the synergy benefits to be able to do that. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Dariush P. Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning everyone. This is Dariush on for Shaun. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, how are you. Dariush P. Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good, thanks. How are you? So following up on Smedes' question on net unit growth, looking out to 2019, do you think net unit growth could actually reaccelerate as elevated deletions from Starwood subside? And to what extent do you see rising cost across the construction environment as an offset? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: This is the danger about speculating already in an answer to a question about maybe having more opening in 2019 than 2018. I think we will \u2013 we think that's possible because you just look at the pipeline and look at the years in which we signed the deals. We will have more hotels coming out of that development pipeline in 2019 than in 2018. So I think the gross openings globally could well be higher next year than they are this year. In terms of deletions, it's probably too much to ask for at the moment. I'll anticipate maybe a question talking about Sheraton for a second. We are making really good progress with the Sheraton brand. We've talked to you in the past few quarters about focusing first on the lowest 25 hotels and then the lowest 50 hotels in the U.S. If you look at the lowest 100 hotels in the U.S. which is really half of the Sheraton portfolio nearly three quarters of those are well on their way to being resolved. A handful of those leaving the system, most of them being renovated or will be renovated before long. Now, it will take a year or two to get those renovations done, but we feel really good about the way that is continuing to move. We'll have to give you as we get closer to 2019 a better sense for deletions next year. But I would think that the 1% to 1.5% deletion is the kind of number you should expect steady state not necessarily a material change from that. And then the last thing hinted at in your question was really about construction delays. We are seeing really tight construction markets. Obviously, that is about labor, but it's also about a lot of what is going on in the construction space. You've got both in Florida and Texas significant hurricane recovery work underway. You've got some infrastructure work that is happening across the United States. And you've got a fairly robust real estate business and all of that is putting pressure on construction resources which makes construction both bit more expensive and has it take a little bit longer. The other thing that we're seeing in our pipeline is we have \u2013 a few years ago, we would have skewed a bit more towards a prototypical suburban limited service hotel. I think today even in our limited service pipeline, we're seeing more of that be custom, more of that be urban and those projects obviously take longer to get completed than the prototypical suburban construction. The good news in all of this is the projects are moving forward. And so while they get stretched out a little bit we know they're coming and we know they'll open up into the system. Dariush P. Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks a lot for the color. And just as a quick follow-up probably for Leeny, looking at G&A and the expected $70 million of expense related to employee profit share matching in 2018, can G&A in 2019 actually be down in absolute dollars or does inflation put you closer to flat to up? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So we're getting ahead of ourselves as we think about 2019. But I think a more kind of classic steady state G&A by the time we get to 2019 is fair. So if you obviously think about a number that is when you're thinking about without the $70 million, you're looking at $875 million sort of number. That then you would argue that that could potentially be lower than the printed number of the $945 million in 2018. Dariush P. Ruch-Kamgar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein Research. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for the question. I just want to Arne ask you about conversations you've been having. Clearly the business environment is looking up. I'm wondering does that have more to do with actual cash in the coffers increasing because of the tax reform or more about expectations of forward economic growth improving? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think they are related to some extent. And the answer is both. Obviously we talk to a lot of our customers who participate in the economy in every industry. And I think from the time Tax Reform Act was passed you've seen a step up in optimism. And the query we often give to our customers is, is it just optimism or are you actually seeing improved business conditions? And it's a majority that say, no, no, no we're actually seeing improved business conditions. And we are actually making decisions which are the effect of our more bullish impact. It is not simply about attitude but it's about things that are actually happening. Now to be fair, you look at earnings growth across the industry, look at the first quarter results across the U.S. corporate sector and you see great earnings growth. A big chunk of that is tax and people are paying less in tax and therefore their earnings are moving. But you're seeing \u2013 more often than not you're also seeing companies report revenue growth. And that's something that has been missing from the last few years of our economic recovery. So you put all those things together and it does seem like we are in again a meaningfully better place in the economy than just three or six months ago. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thanks. And as a quick follow-up just on the home sharing agreement just to follow-up on the last question, what is it that ultimately got you over the hump? I feel like you've been analyzing that opportunity for quite a while, so I'd love to know what finally got you to decide to get your feet wet. And secondarily, it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about what you'll find. Is there any circumstance at which you decide not to move ahead with this arrangement? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, let's take the last one first. Of course until we complete this first task we're not going to make any definitive decisions. We wouldn't have made the test unless we felt like it was likely to lead to a positive outcome however. And so we are hopeful that we'll find stuff here that confirms our suspicion and we'll move forward. We've obviously watched this space for the last number of years. We've been asked by all of you about the impact of this space and what it means. There are a couple of general comments I'd make, see many of the folks who started in this business started with a business model, which fundamentally did not comply with law in most, in many I should say, cities and states and countries. And it's one thing for a start-up to engage in a business that really does not comply with law, it's another thing altogether for a 90-year old company like Marriott to step into a business, which is fundamentally illegal. And as a consequence, one of the reasons we didn't jump into this quickly is we thought this is a business that is not made for us. We have now figured out that we can run this business in a way that does fully comply with law. It will include payment of lodging taxes, so that it's a level playing field with the hotel business. It will very much include complying with local regulatory requirements on number of nights homes can be let in this way and make that work. I think the other thing that we've observed is that as some of these platforms have grown into millions and millions of units, there is almost a paralyzing array of choices and the lack of branding and the lack of real attributes of quality around service and product makes this a area where we think we can bring our brands, we can bring our service and product focus, and deliver something which is simply a better product and much of what is out there. And then, of course, lastly we think there's a strong loyalty connection, which obviously can be helpful here. The home sharing business skews overwhelmingly to leisure travel, not to business travel. The loyalty space obviously, particularly around redemptions, but it could be around point earning as well, is we think an advantage we've got that should bode us well in this space. David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Joe? Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...hotel? Hello. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Here we go. Better start again. Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Can you hear me? Sorry, this is Brandt on for Joe. So I just wanted to follow up on the managed hotels margin discussion. If you take it one step further. So looking forward you have group commission rates going lower right, you're rolling out a cohesive loyalty program later on in the year and then there's other costs that are lower for your owners given scale-related synergies. So to what extent are each of these factors embedded into your IMF forecast? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I would say generally they are. Obviously, we will always try to hope to do better. But as we also talked about, there's the reality of labor cost increases that are also a major element this year in our managed hotels, particularly in the U.S. So I would say that they are broadly included. The one thing I'll also say that's interesting is that for this year we're actually I would expect by the time we get for the full year that two-thirds, almost two-thirds of our IMFs will be from international hotels. And there again that \u2013 particularly in Asia Pacific, it's much more driven by what's going on with RevPAR since there aren't owner priority returns there. And that will be an interesting thing to watch. And I think you saw that clearly in Q1 with the outperformance in incentive fees with the very strong outperformance in Asia Pacific. And we similarly saw the one-third, two-third split in IMFs in Q1. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: The other point to keep in mind is the group commissions reduction took effect for bookings after April 1, 2018, 90-plus percent of all group bookings for 2018 are on the books prior to that, maybe close to 95% if you think of as of April 1. So the commission reduction is not likely to have much of an impact in 2018. That will build over the years ahead as more new bookings get made. Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. That's helpful color. Thanks. And then a follow-up or a second question, which corporate customer segments are growing the fastest for you guys besides what you mentioned on the oil pads? And can you differentiate between volume and price? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, in general we're pleased with the price overall, I will say. From a rate perspective we just generally feel good. I think when you're talking about fundamental business, we continue to see the oil and gas from a percentage increased basis right at the top. But then for very steady kind of above average professional services and technology, I would put at the top of the list. We still continue to see good numbers for financial services, but not like the professional services and the technology and the oil and gas. Brandt Montour - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Patrick? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Patrick, are you there? Operator : Patrick, your line is open. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Now we can. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. We can. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I apologize in advance, just a little bit of a devil's advocate question here. But as we think about your financial projections going forward, it seems that with the changes in the rewards program, a little bit of devaluation of the Starwood side of things, how do we think about customer attrition from the Starwood loyalty customers in that regard going forward? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, the response we've gotten from Marriott and Starwood customers has been overwhelmingly positive. And remember what goes into this calculation for every customer is starts with the value of the program. And the value of the program really is about both points earning and where can I use those points. We have with the new credit cards a powerful supercharged approach to collecting points. We have with the points earned for hotel stays maintained if not increased the value to the customers, including the SPG customers. And as a consequence we think that the value equation looks very good. There is a huge advantage to all of the customers in that now with one loyalty program it will be much easier to earn elite status and the breadth of choice for redemptions as well is simpler. And so think about the comparison to the airline industry, if you will. Depending on where you all live that is one of the significant factors that goes into which airline you tend to prefer, because if you're in Dallas, you're likely be an American person. If you're in Atlanta, you're likely to be Delta. If you're in Washington, you're probably more likely to be an United. We don't have that weakness in the sense that we are able to offer places to stay in 127 different countries around the world. We offer more choice than any other hotel loyalty program. And as a consequence, both on the earnings side and the redemption side, it is a pretty powerful flow. And lastly, and I hinted at this a bit in the prepared remarks, but when you look at, okay, do I want to earn all these points, one of the answers is, what can I use them for. And when you look at our distribution in the higher end of the market, luxury, lifestyle, resort destinations, the redemption options are dramatically better than any of our competitors. I think you roll all those things together and we are very optimistic that we will increase our share of wallet, not see any decrease in share of wallet of our loyalty customers. And we'll continue to grow that customer community from the 110 million or so that we're at today to a substantially bigger number. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, thank you. That's it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Jared. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Jared? Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Can you hear me? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Now we can. Go ahead. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Sorry. Phone issues. So we see the cost synergies in the SG&A line, but is there a way to quantify if you've captured any revenue synergies so far? And as we think about those revenue synergies pulling up following loyalty and reservation integration, where should we see evidence of that? Is it mostly just the RevPAR line? And if so, should we expect that you'll outperform on RevPAR in the following years just from those synergies? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, the RevPAR index which we actually I think as a lodging-focused investment community probably don't talk about as much as maybe we should. RevPAR index is the single measure that cuts through geographic distribution, cuts through reliance on group business, cuts through chain scale, and allows us to say, how are you competing against the market. And one of the reasons we don't talk about it as much is because it's not published in a way that allows you to see it quickly. You see the industry prognosticators reporting RevPAR. You see the companies reporting RevPAR. And we'll often talk about index, but we may not always talk about index. And if we talk about index, you can't necessarily pierce through what it is we're saying to have your own source of data for it. When we look at our performance from the time we closed the Starwood acquisition, so we're about 1.5 years in, we've been gratified to see that we have taken index steadily albeit modestly in those six quarters or so. And in some respects it's not surprising because we haven't yet merged those loyalty programs. And we're just completing the merging of the sales and revenue management teams. And those are the kinds of things that are most likely to drive the share of wallet. But it's been pretty positive nevertheless because you would also expect pulling two big companies like this together and two sales forces and the uncertainty that comes from that that there could be some distraction or some other things which would actually cause a dip in relative performance. And we haven't seen that. And we've seen good strength. As we get into the merging of these loyalty programs, which really is an August and later 2018 event, we are optimistic that we will see an increase of share of wallet and that should translate into index growth. And of course, we'll be talking about index growth as those numbers get put in the books. I think the other thing we look at, of course, is the strength of the credit card programs. We know already, based on the negotiations we've done with Chase and Amex that they are as excited as we are about the power of this platform. And we see that in the terms of the deals we've negotiated with them, but we also see that in the way we talk with them about the opportunities we have together to grow this program. And obviously, we'll be talking about the contribution to the system and to us from those credit card programs in the years ahead. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: And I just want to add onto that, which is from the standpoint of the credit cards that Arne's talking about, remember that the credit card fees is just one component of the growth that we've got. We were able, through the renegotiation of this combined company credit card arrangement, to also increase the benefits to the customers as well as increased benefits to the owners and also increased benefits to the shareholders. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just as my follow up, you talked about the strength in the Asia Pacific region. Is your relationship with Alibaba translating into that performance right now? Or is the strength you're seeing mostly just other factors, be it demand or other issues? And then are you seeing more willingness from Chinese consumers to move up the chain scale? Is that helping you at all? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, the data from the Chinese traveler is uniformly positive. And remember, we've got \u2013 I think about within China first maybe, in Shanghai we must have something like 40 hotels open. Shanghai is the most international city in China. Our hotels are skewed dramatically towards the high end. And the bulk of our business in our China hotels, even in Shanghai, is Chinese. Now that's business travel as well as leisure travel, but you're seeing that the Chinese are participating in the high end of the market within China, and you're seeing the same thing in the China outbound markets. We're seeing good growth year-over-year. It is double-digit growth Chinese volume to essentially every market around the world. Not surprisingly, the biggest markets for Chinese outbound travel are going to be near to China; Macau, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand to name a few, obvious \u2013 Australia, to name a few obvious choices, but it includes growth to Europe and growth to the United States as well. The Alibaba piece, we are certain it is contributing to us. It's hard for us to know exactly what percentage it's fueling. And that's something we will continue to watch with them as that JV platform gets more and more rolled out. We mentioned that some of these things are coming now, Alipay, but also the new storefront on Fliggy. And we did this for a reason. We think we can deliver real value to Alibaba's Chinese membership about 500 million strong, and we can drive great results for us and it should be successful for both of us. Still a little bit early, but I think it is clearly a positive. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon of Berenberg. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Yeah. Good morning. Just curious on your development pipeline and just on the chain scales. Would we be right in assuming that they're broadly similar as geographic splits or how about particularly the upper upscale and luxury? Is it askew there to any particular region? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: So let's \u2013 somebody can pull the... Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: ...chart for me as we talk. But we're right now, let's talk about our regions first. Right now, our existing hotels are about two-thirds in the United States and one-third outside the United States. And the pipeline is a bit more than half, not dramatically more than half, but a bit more than half outside the United States and about half in the United States. So we are in the pipeline skewing more than our existing distribution towards international markets. We mentioned in the prepared comments that our luxury and upper upscale share there is substantial, particularly when compared to the rest of the industry. But I think we are seeing globally the power of these Select brands. And so any market in the world, including the United States but also including Asia, we are seeing that the Courtyards and Fairfields and ACs and Moxys are becoming very attractive to our owning partners. And so I suspect that the pipeline is also skewing a bit more to Select-Service than our existing distribution in like-for-like markets. Remember though that as we're going to more international, the international markets in absolute terms are more full service in terms of the pipeline than the domestic ones. So that shift is probably not dramatic. Leeny, Laura, anything to add. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: No, correct. No. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up. I think in the prepared comments you mentioned that leverage is now at the lower end of your leverage range. And you've also said that you've a growing confidence in the economy. Should we be expecting that to migrate slightly up the way? Or are you more comfortable keeping it around about where it's just now through the next 12 months or so? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: We continue to be comfortable in the 3.25 times range. The reality is with our continued asset sales and the various \u2013 you can't always plan exactly when that cash is coming in. We have tended over the last four quarters to be down closer to the bottom end of the 3.0 times. And the numbers that we actually gave in our guidance today, the modeling that we've used is actually at a 3.20 times coverage. So I guess to your point, yes, I think we're comfortable as we think about managing it towards the higher part of the 3.0 times to 3.25 times, but still obviously in that range. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. I guess, kind of \u2013 good morning. Can you hear me? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. We can. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay, great. Yeah. So a longer-term question coming back to alternative accommodations. I think you mentioned some things changed regarding the legality as well as this kind of level playing field concept with regards to hotel tax, both of which raised your interest today versus a couple of years ago. But those changes aside, I was just curious for your perspective on where do you think consumer demand is at for alternative accommodations as well as the ability to browse for those stays, hotel and accommodation side-by-side. So I guess directly if the sharing program in London were to go well, could we at some point see hotel product and home sharing products side by side on marriott.com? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. I mean already in the London pilot essentially that is the case. If you search London, you can find a link up to Tribute Homes and be able to do both. And the notion, of course, here is driven by \u2013 it's our view. I think it's probably fairly undebatable that giving folks more choice is a positive thing. It is what has driven us to not just acquire Starwood but to try and compete with 30 different brands and have the kind of choice within the hotel space. And here we can offer a bit more choice, but again, choice that has the kind of quality we want to have connected to our system. And we think by having that loyalty program and that breadth of choice, we drive strength of all elements within that portfolio and think we can do more of that in the years ahead. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great, thanks. And then a second question on the fee guide. Impressive going to, I think it's 11% or 12-ish, up about 300 bps, 400 bps from the prior. I was curious you mentioned RevPAR might be part of that move higher, units is relatively unchanged as is the credit card. Is it 1 point or 2 tailwind from FX? And then what type of headwind is there from non-hotel fees that you're kind of overcoming because when you add up the credit card, the FX, the RevPAR, and units, it almost seems to point to something in the teens. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So let's kind of run through those. First of all you're right. FX is \u2013 we're kind of go back to the broad view of 1 point of RevPAR typically for us in the broadest sense is typically about $35 million. So if you say, okay, we got about 1.5 point increase that takes you up to over $50 million increase in fees. Then we've talked about an additional $25 million from FX. So roughly these are always hard because it depends on what happens with which currency. But just most broadly one percentage point change in the value of the dollar assuming it happens evenly gets you to about $11 million. And we've told you that our fee guidance has gone up $25 million relative to where we were before. So you've got the RevPAR, you've got the FX component. And then when you look at the non credit card related fees, the delta that we've talked about really overwhelmingly reflects the increase in the credit card fees. So if you remember now app fees and timeshare fees are largely fixed. Application relicensing fees now have to be amortized over time, so they don't jump up and down the way they used to when you were able to take them in from cash, so they're going to be pretty steady. And then residential branding fees are really a relatively smaller component. And while they may go up or down $5 million or $10 million, it's really the credit card, the $360 million to $380 million that overwhelmingly drives the growth in that section. And then the last point I'll make is that, when we think of our classic rule of the $35 million for 1 point of RevPAR, when you see that the outperformance in RevPAR is in Asia Pacific, that's obviously going to skew a little bit higher towards the IMF side of things given there's no owner priority. So I think that's part of what you're seeing is that we've increased our expected growth rate from IMFs fairly meaningfully as a result of the strong RevPAR performance, particularly in Asia Pacific. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, two questions. I guess the first will be a follow-up on the credit card fees. Just to be clear, I guess, did you recognize, I guess, an equal contribution in the first quarter relative to what you'd expect over the course of the year? Or should it be steady over each quarter? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: You mean from a growth perspective year-over-year? Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I guess, you can define it either as a contribution to growth or just absolute dollars? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: In absolute, what did we talk about? $87 million? Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.: $86 million in the first quarter. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, $86 million and we've talked about $370 million for the whole year. So that would give you that it would actually, which would make sense as you would expect it would grow a bit as you continue to see new cardholders and increased spend from consumers over time. But as we talked about before, again the increase year-over-year is overwhelmingly driven by the increased terms in the agreement. But yes, you would expect it to grow during the year. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Makes sense that's helpful. And then an unrelated follow-up. We've seen some changes in kind of search results through Google and other OTAs. I'm curious, if you've seen any changes there that impacted your direct booking trends and any color you can provide on that campaign? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: No, I think we're seeing a good stickiness with our efforts to drive direct bookings. We're seeing good growth on our digital platforms and trying to move that forward. And obviously those are the bag of features that we've talked about over the last few years, member only rates, some features that are available to loyalty members and not others. And I think as the loyalty program gets stickier and stronger with the credit card program, we should continue to see that those customers grow and those customers are much more inclined to book directly. And that's the case almost no matter what happens with the search algorithms or approach that some of these platforms are taking. If the customers know that it is clearly in their interest to book direct, they're going to find a way to book direct. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And have you provided the percentage that's booked through your app specifically and how that's growing? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I don't know that we have, and I'm not sure we will this morning. But it won't surprise you that digital growth and the mobile growth as well as the app growth is very robust. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Overall digital reservations are just a hair over 26% for the year 2017 anyway. Total direct would be 72% through a combination of digital and on property including group bookings done at property and through the telephone. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Just Leeny, on the credit card branding fees, I was just wondering is there any way to grow that? For example, is there a language in the contracts that would allow you to benefit from upside if spending is greater than expected? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Absolutely. Absolutely. But again, time will tell. We're introducing new cards. We just introduced the new Chase card. The new Amex card will come out in August. And from that perspective, we've looked forward to lots of folks signing up and using the card. But what's in this year's expectations of the $360 million to $380 million is a bit of a steady-as-she-goes cardholder usage and numbers of cardholders. And overwhelmingly the increase related to 2017 is because of the new terms. But yes, there's increased usage absolutely over time. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But so far just the $360 million to $380 million is representing that \u2013 so there could be upside to that? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Again it all depends... Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Right. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: ...on behavior of consumers. It's kind of this I would call completely normal not out of the ordinary sort of spend this year. But some normal growth because that's what we've seen over the past few years is some normal growth. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then Arne just a little bit earlier you were talking about the international part of your pipeline and how your exposure to international is better than your existing distribution. But just wondering how we should think about that going forward. Do you think you could get that percentage to something even higher like in the 60s or even higher? And then also you discussed the construction headwinds in the U.S. I'm just wondering if there's any headwinds in any of your international regions to talk about. I know we've talked about China in the past so maybe that and anything else. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I think it's a good question. I think this is a sort of a longer-term question. But I suspect over time we'll continue to see that international mix continuing to rise. It's a big world out there. Obviously, our distribution outside the U. S. is much lower in terms of percentage of the total industry than it is in the United States. And much of the rest of the world has got economic growth numbers and growth in the middle class numbers, which are more robust than the much more developed that exist in the United States. Obviously, though at the same time we're big in the United States and we're gratified to see that we're continuing to grow in the United States. And we don't want to turn off our focus on seizing the opportunities that are available to us in this market. So you won't find us basically shutting down, if you will, our willingness to continue to grow in the United States. In terms of construction delays and the like in other parts of the world, nothing probably as dramatic as the United States. It tends to depend on the robustness of the economy around the world and whether any of those economies have, if you will, more demand for construction materials or construction labor than they have supply. And I think generally that is much less the case in the rest of the world than it is here, certainly in terms of the material numbers. Now there are other factors that go into development in other parts of the world, it can take a long time to get permits. There may be much less \u2013 many more permits that are required in some markets. Sometimes that development process is not very transparent and we obviously got to make sure that we and our partners are navigating that in a way which meets our standards. And so sometimes that takes longer for us than it would in the United States. But generally we're not seeing a deterioration, if you will, in the speed of the development process in the rest of the world. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great, helpful. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Speaking of development, it seems like your development partners in the United States have to be taking a haircut on expected returns given the construction cost, the labor cost increases, higher financing costs et cetera. I'm just wondering, are they coming to you for relief from a contract help with financing? What are you hearing from the folks in the U.S.? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. It's a pretty astute question, Bill. I think you're right. I think we've seen the cost of land increase. We've seen the cost of construction increase. We've seen the development period which also drives cost obviously during the development process, cost of capital particularly increase. And I suppose we're now on the front edge of seeing the cost of debt increase with interest rates starting to move up. Debt still seems to be reasonably well available certainly for experienced developers. And as a consequence I think they can find the money to pursue this. I think at the same time there is a strong sense that even though the returns maybe have gotten a little bit less, the returns are still fairly healthy compared to returns available in other real estate classes, and maybe to some extent in other investment opportunities. And when you're looking at the Select-Service brands particularly there's less volatility in the performance of those hotels. There's increased proof that those hotels can last and be competitive for a number of decades. You've got obviously lots of private platforms that are participating in this development process. And with the miracle of compounding, these are still pretty attractive deals. And I think as a consequence that's why we're continuing to see the development pace be as strong as it is. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. That's helpful. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: The only last factor I'd put in there Bill is while RevPAR growth at 2% or 3%, not to use our numbers in the U.S. is not as \u2013 I mean we'd love to see it be 2 or 3 times that size, but it's not that robust. But nevertheless the hotels in absolute terms are trading at really pretty good numbers. Good occupancies, good performance and with the predictability that I talked about before I think these are still investments which are attractive to folks. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: No, that's fair. My follow up Arne is whether there's any benefit to Marriott from the Marriott Vacation Club acquisition of ILG? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Generally it will simplify things and as a consequence I think we're supportive of it. We've got good relationships with MVW and ILG. Leeny and team had already completed negotiations with both of those companies so that we were free to proceed with the merger of the loyalty programs and the websites and all the rest of it. So those restrictions were behind us. Nevertheless I think to be able to deal with one company and not have either one of them necessarily looking behind the curtains to see, always there are possibly something you've given to one that you haven't given to us, will simplify things a little bit. I don't think it'll be dramatic. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, everyone. Can we go back to the international IMFs? Can you talk about what the main drivers are that's driving that growth? Is it more rooms in the system? Is it a higher percentage of the rooms paying fees? Is it the operating profit growth? And then when you look at how much RevPAR growth you need for margin expansion? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So you got a bunch of things there. So obviously, when you've got RevPAR for example in China that gets close to 12% you're going to get pretty spectacular margin improvement there. And with every dollar of increased profits, we get a share because in Asia Pacific there's no owner's priority. So from that perspective I would say that the biggest chunk of the growth in IMFs is coming from Asia Pacific and their very strong performance. When you look at the overall kind of percentage you are seeing that kind of year-over-year compared to a year ago the percentage of hotels earning incentive fees internationally did go up 3 percentage points, went up from 68% to 71%. Overall for the company, actually down a little bit, because in the U.S. we had a couple of large limited service portfolios that with relatively speaking lower managed RevPAR growth they paid a lower percentage of incentive fees. But again, it was two-thirds, one-third and that is two-thirds of our IMFs coming from international, you're clearly seeing the benefit of the fact that most of those contracts do not have owner's priority. And I'd say from a unit growth perspective for ramping up hotels, you're getting a nice amount of IMFs but I would say that the RevPAR growth is the biggest driver. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then when we look at that two-thirds or just the international component of the IMF, how much is the Asia Pacific region of that bucket? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: We can get it for you. I don't have it. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.: This is Laura. Give me a call after the call and I'll get that for you. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: I will say in general that our fees overall tend to be fairly well distributed relative to the room count, but you are going to find obviously particularly this time that Asia Pacific on the IMF side is going to be higher proportionately. Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Arne Sorenson for any closing comments. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: All right. Thank you all very much for your participation and your attention today. It's great as always to talk with you. Get out there and travel, we'd love to welcome you to our hotels. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Marriott International's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director of Investor Relations. First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, August 7, 2018 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find slides for today's discussion on our website at www.marriott.com/investor or in our 8-K filing. In our discussion today about the income statement, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs, reimbursed revenues and related expenses, the year-to-date net adjustment to the tax charge related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the year-to-date adjustment to the Avendra gain. Of course you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our website. So let's get started. Our second quarter was terrific. Adjusted earnings per share rose 56% to $1.73 with better than expected fee revenue, owned, leased results and G&A expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% and cash returned to shareholders totaled nearly $1 billion. As an encore to our first quarter strength worldwide system wide RevPAR rose 3.8% in the quarter at the high end of our guidance. In North America we continue to see strength in leisure and corporate demand, particularly in the energy, retail and professional services sectors. System-wide RevPAR in North America increased 3.1% in the second quarter with RevPAR at luxury hotels up nearly 4%. Transient RevPAR rose 2.5% in the quarter with higher room rates associated with group compression. Group RevPAR rose 4.5% reflecting the shift in Easter holiday. Group attendance trends improved while food and beverage revenue rose nearly 5%. Group pace for comp and non-comp hotels for 2018 is up at a mid-single digit rate. For comp hotels alone pace is up at a low single digit rate. Given today's very high occupancy rates, we expect transient RevPAR will grow faster than group in the near-term. At the same time year-to-date, our group revenue bookings for all future periods is up over 17%. RevPAR growth exceeded 5% in the quarter in New Orleans, Orlando, South Florida, San Francisco and Houston and increased at a double-digit rate in Toronto and Vancouver. RevPAR in New York rose nearly 4% with higher retail and special corporate demand, particularly from tech companies and higher international arrivals. We expect 2018 RevPAR for North America system-wide comparable hotels will increase 2% to 3%. For the first half of 2018, we reported RevPAR growth of 2.7%. We believe RevPAR growth in the first half of 2018 would have been a bit slower, roughly 2.5% if we adjust for last year's inauguration and the lingering impact of the 2017 hurricanes. For the second half of 2018, we expect reported North American system-wide comparable RevPAR will grow 1.5% to 2%. If we similarly adjust our second half RevPAR growth estimate for the midweek Independence Day and the tough comparison to last year's hurricanes, we believe RevPAR growth would again be roughly 2.5%. In other words, our top line forecast is steady as she goes. On the international front, the growth in demand continues to be impressive with price gains as well as occupancy improvements. System-wide constant dollar RevPAR in our Asia Pacific region increased 9% in the second quarter while RevPAR in Greater China rose 10% on very strong retail demand. The 2018 Beijing Motor Show increased occupancies in that city, while Hong Kong and Macau benefited from strong leisure demand, particularly from Mainland China. RevPAR in Indonesia increased 17% as demand returned to Bali. RevPAR in Japan increased 7% on strong retail demand, while in India greater group business in gateway cities also increased RevPAR by 7%. For the second half, we expect RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region to continue to grow at a high single-digit rate, albeit at bit more modestly than in the first half. In the Middle East and Africa region, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR declined 4% in the second quarter due to the earlier timing of Ramadan and continued political tension in parts of the region. RevPAR in Africa rose nearly 9% with strength in Algeria, Nigeria and Egypt. By the way I just returned from the visit to our properties in Egypt and Algeria, there is a lot of enthusiasm for Marriott there and a lot of room for future growth. In the third quarter, we expect RevPAR in the MEA region will increase at a mid-single-digit rate, benefiting from the timing of Ramadan, while fourth quarter RevPAR is likely to be flat to modestly lower. In Europe, the World Cup was played in Russia for the first time and we saw considerable last minute demand. Congratulations to the French team on winning their second World Cup title. Across Europe, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 5% in the second quarter, driven by strong results in Russia, France and Turkey. UK RevPAR was flattish, likely due to lingering concerns about Brexit. RevPAR growth in Spain and Italy was weaker as many Europeans shifted their spring holiday stays to other venues. For the second half of the year, we believe, RevPAR in Europe will continue to increase at a mid-single-digit rate. While Italy is likely to remain weak, Spain will benefit from easier comparisons. Paris should be strong and we expect Turkey will continue to improve. In the Caribbean and Latin American region, RevPAR rose 8% in the quarter. RevPAR for hotels in the Caribbean increased at a low double-digit rate as they continue to benefit from lower industry supply following last year's hurricanes. RevPAR in Mexico declined modestly, reflecting traveler concerns about security. In the third quarter, we expect, RevPAR in the region will increase at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by stronger results in Mexico on an easy comparison to last year's earthquake. In the fourth quarter RevPAR should moderate as hurricane damaged hotels reopen and comparisons become tougher. Worldwide, we expect third and fourth quarter RevPAR will increase 2.5% to 3% and 2018 RevPAR will improve roughly 3% to 4%. While we're encouraged by 2018 results, we are even more excited about our longer term prospects. From a competitive viewpoint, we've never been better positioned. We lead the industry in number of rooms and distribution, geographically and across chain scales. Our brands are powerful. Our already premium RevPAR index increased 120 basis points in the last 12 months and is likely to continue to climb. Our three loyalty programs lead the industry and are getting better. We expect to unify our loyalty programs on August 18. While we will retain all three loyalty program brand names until next year, customers will experience them as one great program. Guests will earn points faster, achieve elite status sooner and redeem points more easily and without blackout dates. Also on August 18, we will introduce full portfolio inventory on Marriott's direct channels, including our websites and mobile apps, which will enable guests to conveniently search for any of our hotels on all of our websites and apps based on brand, tiers, distance, price, amenities, transportation, nearby attractions and points of interest. With over 6,700 properties, we are positioned to take care of guests, whether they are on a Midwest road trip, making a sales call in Johannesburg or enjoying a luxury resort getaway in the South Pacific. This growing breadth of product and a growing number of earning and redemption opportunities increases the value of our loyalty program as guests don't need to look further than our properties virtually anywhere they may travel. In addition to earning and redeeming points at our hotels, Marriott Moments offers guests local activities and experiences from sporting events and concerts to cooking and tennis lessons. In the second quarter, Marriott Moments revenue nearly tripled from first quarter levels, enhancing returns to owners and increasing guest engagement and loyalty. Loyalty programs make lodging demand sticky. The loyalty program with significant luxury destinations and experiences is magnetic. Dreams about luxury Hawaiian holidays are motivating, particularly for travelers who spend a meaningful part of their lives on the road. In 2017, the 477 properties in our seven luxury brands represented just 9% of our rooms worldwide, but 17% of our loyalty point redemptions. Our luxury brands also contribute 19% of our property based gross fee revenue which could equate to nearly $600 million in 2018. Like loyalty and luxury, our booking engines are also a significant competitive advantage. Guests can book our hotels directly through our websites, apps, call centers, group sales offices or on property. In 2017, two-thirds of our transient business was booked through one of our direct channels with more than half of these direct bookings on our websites or apps. We have been encouraging direct digital bookings using special loyalty member pricing and our next-generation yield management system focused on nights when occupancy rates are high. Because of our efforts revenue booked on our branded websites and mobile apps increased materially faster than our revenue booked through the OTAs in the second quarter. For hotel owners, we continue to improve productivity as well as recognize synergy savings from the Starwood acquisition. We recently reduced commission rates for intermediary group business which should improve house profit margins for our best-in-class convention and resorts network hotels. In the third quarter, most owners should see additional savings as we make further reductions in loyalty charge-out rates. For hotels hosting loyalty redemptions, we have announced a new sliding scale reimbursement approach. We believe this will reduce incentives for hotels to cut room rates at the last minute. Finally beginning in 2019, we plan on implementing a program services fee to bundle above property charges, including reservations, sales and marketing, revenue management and mobile guest services. The program services fee should be simpler, more flexible and more predictable for owners and we believe it will further reduce costs to most of our hotels. And this leads to development. According to STR, we continue to have the largest pipeline of rooms under development in the world, including more luxury and upper upscale rooms than our next three competitors combined. We opened a record 23,000 rooms during the second quarter and our inventory of rooms under construction worldwide advanced to more than 213,000 rooms. We added nearly 40,000 signed or approved rooms to the development pipeline in the second quarter. At the same time, we also removed 14,000 rooms for the pipeline that had not made enough progress towards construction starts. At quarter-end, our pipeline stood at roughly 466,000 rooms, a few thousand rooms higher than last quarter and roughly 25,000 rooms higher than at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Worldwide, our pipeline emphasizes the higher value lodging tiers as we begin at mid-scale and extend to luxury. Our luxury brands alone represent 11% of our pipeline. Of the tiers in which we play, our brands represent 30% of industry rooms under construction worldwide and nearly 45% of industry rooms under construction in North America. To ensure we are driving real value, our development team's success is measured both on meeting targets for net present value as well as number of rooms signed. When we announced our intention to acquire Starwood in late 2015, we noted the driving force behind the transaction was growth. The acquisition would provide an opportunity to create value by combining the distribution and strengths of Marriott and Starwood enhancing our competitiveness in a quickly evolving marketplace. With the significant accomplishments at Marriott since that announcement, we believe we are on our way to realizing that promise. These accomplishments are due to the efforts of many people at Marriott. With the upcoming launch of our combined loyalty program, I want to express our gratitude to the entire loyalty organization, our information technology team, our marketing group and everyone on property throughout the system who have been working toward this day. Thank you. So for more about the quarter, let's turn the call over to Leeny. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you, Arne. For the second quarter of 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.73, 56% over the prior year quarter and $0.38 over the midpoint of our guidance. Roughly $0.02 of the outperformance came from better than expected gross fee revenue; $0.02 came from better than expected performance on the owned, leased line, largely termination fees; $0. 07 came from better than expected general and administrative expenses, including lower than expected profit-sharing contribution and favorable timing; $0.24 came from gains on the sale of assets, including the sale of a hotel in a joint venture; and $0.03 came from favorable discrete tax items. In the second quarter, gross fee revenues totaled $951 million, a 12% increase year-over-year, largely from unit growth, RevPAR gains and higher incentives and branding fees. Credit card fees alone totaled $93 million compared to $59 million in the prior year while other non-property fees, including timeshare fees and residential branding fees declined 3% to $38 million. With a weaker U.S. dollar, second quarter fee revenue benefited from $7 million favorable impact from foreign exchange net of hedges. Compared to our expectations, fee revenue outperformed by $11 million at the midpoint, largely due to better than expected performance of franchise hotels and stronger than expected incentive fees in North America and Europe. Worldwide house profit margins for company operated hotels improved 60 basis points in the second quarter on a 4.1% increase in managed hotel RevPAR. Our teams around the world have done a fantastic job as we continue to recognize property level cost savings from procurement, productivity and other merger synergies. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $89 million in the second quarter, a 9% decline from the prior year. Property dispositions reduced owned, leased results in the quarter by $21 million year-over-year, somewhat offset by higher termination fees and higher profits from owned and leased full service hotels in North America and Europe. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses was $9 million higher than expectations largely due to higher termination fees. General and administrative expenses declined 7% in the second quarter, largely due to synergies associated with the Starwood acquisition. Second quarter G&A was $33 million better than guidance. We expected our profit-sharing match would total $25 million in the second quarter following $35 million recognized in the first quarter. The actual amount of second quarter profit-sharing match was $2 million as enrollments lagged expectation. We expect the impact of additional profit-sharing enrollments and related expenditures will total $18 million in the second half of 2018 as we shift some of the previously anticipated spending to the back half of the year. As a reminder, we currently estimate the total cost of this program is $110 million. One-half of it is being funded by our gain on the sale of Avendra with $55 million impacting our G&A line in the full year 2018. This expense will not recur in 2019. Dispositions exceeded $400 million in the quarter and gains on asset sales totaled $119 million. We sold the Sheraton and Westin Hotels in Fiji, the Sheraton Montreal, the Chicago Tremont, our interest in a joint venture which owns the Royal Orchid in Thailand and the W Mexico City and our interest in a joint venture which owns land parcels in Italy. Another of our joint venture sold The Ritz-Carlton, Toronto and we recorded our share of the gain on the equities and earnings line on that transaction. You may recall that in late 2016, we outlined a target of $1.5 billion of asset recycling by year end 2018. With the completion of these asset sales this quarter along with the sales of other hotels, joint venture interests and loan repayments in earlier periods, our asset recycling has surpassed this two-year target, already reaching nearly $1.8 billion. We've secured both long-term management agreements and where needed commitments for significant renovations for 9 of the 10 hotels sold since late 2016. Equity and earnings totaled $21 million in the quarter and included a $10 million gain on the sale of The Ritz-Carlton, Toronto Hotel. This transaction also included a commitment for renovation of the property. Net interest expense increased $14 million in the second quarter due to higher interest rates on our commercial paper balances, higher debt levels and lower interest income. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 15% to $939 million, despite a $17 million negative impact from sold assets. Looking ahead, we expect worldwide constant dollar system-wide RevPAR will increase 2.5% to 3% in each of the third and fourth quarters, yielding 3% to 4% RevPAR growth for the full year. Nearly half of our 466,000 rooms' pipeline is under construction. Over half is outside North America and 41% is in the upper upscale or luxury tiers. While not shown on slide 10, 45% of the rooms' pipeline is company managed, but less than 10% of the pipeline is subject to an owner priority return. For the full year, we continue to expect gross openings to yield about 7% growth. Our new signings remain robust and the number of rooms under construction has increased more than 20% since the second quarter of 2017 and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any competitor. For 2018, deletions are running close to 2%, a bit higher than typical. While there are different stories for every hotel, we are completing workouts of Legacy-Starwood properties and are being more aggressive in addressing product quality issues. We expect the pace of deletions will slow in 2019. On a net basis this yields roughly 5% net worldwide rooms growth in 2018. Given our worldwide RevPAR and unit growth assumptions, we expect gross fee revenue for the third quarter will total $915 million to $935 million, an 11% to 13% increase over the prior year. Our fee revenue estimates assumes nearly $5 million in favorable foreign exchange impact in the third quarter. We expect owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total roughly $65 million in the third quarter, which reflects stronger hotel results and higher termination fees, as well as a $23 million negative impact from sold hotels. Our guidance assumes no further asset sales beyond those that have been completed. G&A should total $235 million to $240 million in the third quarter, including roughly $10 million for our additional contribution for profit-sharing. These assumptions yield $1.27 to $1.32 adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter, 21% to 26% higher than our 2017 third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.05. For the fourth quarter, we expect gross fee revenue will total $929 million to $944 million, including a roughly $10 million benefit from foreign exchange. Results from owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses should total roughly $91 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger hotel results, higher termination fees and a roughly $5 million benefit from our purchase of the Sheraton Grand Phoenix, offset by a $13 million negative impact from sold hotels. G&A should total $236 million to $241 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued synergies associated with the merger, as well as an $8 million profit-sharing match. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter will benefit from some discrete items which should lower the tax rate for that quarter to roughly 20%. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share should total $1.47 to $1.52, a 35% to 39% increase over 2017 fourth quarter adjusted EPS. For the full year 2018, we believe gross fee revenue could total $3.64 billion to $3.675 billion, a 10% to 12% increase. Incentive fees could increase at roughly 10% rate and credit card branding fees could total $360 million to $380 million for the year. Our estimate of full year owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses includes stronger hotel results, higher termination fees and an $80 million negative impact from the sale of assets. Our estimate for adjusted EBITDA assumes a $67 million negative impact from the sale of assets. Full year 2018 G&A should total $935 million to $945 million for 2018. Compared to our prior guidance, our G&A has decreased modestly for 2018, reflecting lower estimated profit-sharing contribution somewhat offset by higher workload and costs associated with changes through accounting rules and higher compensation expense. These assumptions yield $5.81 to $5.91 adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2018, a 38% to 40% increase over adjusted EPS of $4.21 in 2017. We expect adjusted EBITDA will total $3.45 billion to $3.495 billion, a 10% to 12% increase over the 2017 adjusted EBITDA. Investment spending for 2018 could total $800 million to $900 million, an increase of $200 million from our last forecast due to the $255 million purchase of the Sheraton Grand Phoenix, offset by reductions in other spending. Maintenance spending in 2018 should total $225 million. Year-to-date we've recycled more than $500 million of capital through asset sales and loan repayments. We repurchased over 14 million shares from January 1, through yesterday, for approximately $1.9 billion. With the benefit of higher anticipated earnings and cash flow, we now expect to return over $3.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in 2018. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At June 30, our debt levels were consistent with our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.25 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR. We appreciate your interest in Marriott. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take your questions now. Operator : Your first question is from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Most of the questions we've been getting surround the reduced NUG growth estimate. And I wonder if you could give us more detail on a couple of things, which include, first of all, is this do you think kind of a one-time surge in deletions, how long might this last? It sounds to me like you feel that the deletion rate normalizes next year, but to what degree do you have confidence in that? How much visibility have you got there? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thanks, Harry and good morning. Let me maybe first say NUG I think you're referring to net unit growth as opposed to another brand. We have a few brands, but NUG is, I think, not one of them. But you're right to raise the question, obviously, from our guidance a quarter ago we have assumed a higher level of deletions this quarter than we did then. And it's important, I think, that we all try and understand what's driving that. I think the place I would start is not about deletions, but is about development, because I think the core question which should be addressed here is, what does it say, if anything, about our owning partners' appetite to grow with us and to affiliate their hotels with us. And what we're seeing on the development side is a much more powerful indication of the strength of our brands than anything that the deletion data would tell you. In Q2, for example, we added 40,000 new rooms to the pipeline, in newly approved deals or newly signed deals that had not been counted before, 241 hotels. If you do the math that's adding a hotel a little more frequently than once every nine hours. And that shows you that around the world our owners are saying these are brands that we want to affiliate with and we're prepared to put substantial capital behind that desire. What's happened though in the last quarter or so is, we've continued to make progress on a number of things which ultimately impact deletions. And, of course, each hotel has its own story. The deletions in the second quarter were only about 18 hotels, but they are the most recent ones that left our system. And what we see is about 20% of them, by definition older assets, are contract expirations. And while contracts, when they expire, can often be renewed, the core issue there is usually, does it make sense for additional capital to be invested in those hotels to bring them up to current standards, or are they, sort of, beyond that point from an economic perspective. And typically at expiration, obviously, it's a meaningful question and so we lost some hotels from that perspective. About 30% of the rooms that came out in the second quarter came out because of hurricanes or earthquakes. And while they may come back into our system at some point in time, we looked at the circumstances of those hotels and thought it could be years before they reenter our system. And rather than keep them in our unit count, let's take them out. And the balance in the quarter and I think in many respects the increase in the deletion estimate for the year is driven by a mix of product quality issues. They can be quite unique sometimes that, but it's driven by the economics of each individual hotel. And while we would like to keep hotels in the system if they could be brought up to standards, if they can't get the capital that's necessary in order for them to stay in the system, we'd just assume that they left. Sometimes, obviously, we have a different point of view with our owners about the position of these assets and we work through that and see if we can come to a resolution that makes the most sense. I think the last thing I'd say here, Harry, and suggested in your question too, we do not think this is a new deletion rate that we're going to experience for years to come in the future. I think this is a mix of pushing product quality issues. I think it is a mix to some extent of dealing with some unresolved legacy workout issues that were within the Starwood portfolio when we closed the transaction. Some of those deals have not been resolved and we're working our way through them towards resolution. And hopefully, we'll get back more to the 1% to 1.5% kind of deletion range that we talked about the last couple of years for the years to come. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : That's helpful. Maybe just a little bit more history here, when you acquired Starwood the brand that seemed to be the most in need of attention was the Sheraton brand. Perhaps you could help us by giving your perspective on a scale of 1 to 10 where do you believe the Sheraton brand is relative to where you want it to be within the next year or so? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We're making great progress on Sheraton. And we obviously have lots of dialogue with our Sheraton owners around the world. About a year ago, we settled on a sort of prototype for the regular guest room in the Sheraton brand. In June of this year we rolled out a new idea for the public space for the Sheraton brand, which we did at the Lodging Conference in New York, 1st of June and have had tremendous response from our owners and franchisees to what we're doing with the brand. When we look at the portfolio around the world what we see is about 75% of the Sheraton portfolio is on its way towards meeting those brand standards. Now that includes those that are already there as well as hotels which are scheduled for renovation or maybe even under renovation leaving about a quarter, which we're in discussions with most of those owners to see if we can get to a place where the renovation is going to be done to bring it up to brand standards. And obviously it's in that bucket that we have some deletions from the system which we're certainly happy to take because long-term we think we're going to strengthen the brand. RevPAR index for the brand is now above fair share which it's moved a bit since we closed. I think it's got a significant movement ahead of it if we can deliver the kind of capital and reinvention of the brand that's necessary. So I think we feel really good about the momentum we've got for plans for the hotels. I think in terms of the customer experience we've got to get more of these renovations actually completed and available to customers before they will start to see the average experience of the Sheraton's move materially. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Very helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from David Beckel with Bernstein Research. David James Beckel - Bernstein Research : Hey. Thanks for the question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, David. David James Beckel - Bernstein Research : Hey. Thanks. I'll just ask a high level question about RevPAR expectations this time relative to last quarter. Obviously, a lot has happened geopolitically. Are you hearing anything from executives that would cause you to be more concerned about the back half relative to last time we spoke? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So good question and we were very deliberate about using the phrase, steady as she goes, in the prepared remarks. I think we could probably describe good news and bad news here. So for the optimists who are showing up this call and saying okay we had a 4% GDP print in the United States in Q2 that should drive faster RevPAR growth maybe even in Q2. Maybe you should build that into your Q3 or Q4 numbers. We have not seen that higher GDP growth show up in higher demand either in our system or in the industry. In fact you look at Smith Travel data, rooms sold in the United States, which is obviously demand, in Q1 demand was up 3, in Q2 demand was up 3.1%. So essentially identical. And in many respects our system very much shows the same thing. When you adjust for the calendar anomalies, I think, our first two quarters, one was 2.3% and one was 2.5% RevPAR growth, so essentially identical numbers. Similarly, and this is repeating what we said in the prepared remarks, but when we look at Q3 and Q4, if you're worried that the 1.5% to 2% U.S. system-wide number is concerning, don't. It is not a sign of softening. It is very much an impact of the calendar or comparison anomalies. July 4th mid-week, obviously, you've already heard about from other companies in this space, we've got some shifting holidays, but probably the most significant pain in the back half of the year is the RevPAR comparisons get tougher because of the strength of the hurricane recovery efforts in Houston and Florida, particularly last year. And when you adjust for those things, what we're seeing in our guidance built-in is about a 2.5% RevPAR growth for the balance of the year. And so, it's very much steady as she goes. We see under that, probably still somewhat greater strength in the leisure segment. In the group space, the corporate group is stronger than the associate group. And the corporate transient is probably right in the middle. David James Beckel - Bernstein Research : That's very helpful. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up to that, the group booking strength that you've seen and called out in your prepared remarks, how much of that relates to the reduction in commissions and folks wanting to try to book group activity in advance of that change? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. That's a really important point to raise. Our group bookings in the first quarter for all future periods were very, very strong. One of the reasons, perhaps the most significant reason for that was our reduced commission rates took effect April 1. And so, with the number of group intermediaries, they were accelerating their efforts to make sure they were booking before lower commission rates impacted them. I think similarly when you look across the industry you've had a number of other companies decide that they would reduce group commissions too, none of those lower group commission levels are in place yet, and I think they will be rolling in for some other companies effective in the fall or the first of the year. And so that will have a little bit of a dynamic to the way group business is booked. Having said that, I think, many of the end consumers for group business are maybe not ambivalent about what the group commission levels are, but they're going to be much more interested in where they should hold their meeting, both in terms of services and facilities and we think we'll continue to compete very well in that space. David James Beckel - Bernstein Research : Thanks so much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey Smedes. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. I just wanted to ask you with the loyalty program now on a path to be more fully integrated from the consumer perspective, it seems like the next phase of the Starwood acquisition maybe it's going to be measured by what happens on the revenue side versus on the expense side, which I guess is kind of largely behind you now. So how can you \u2013 will you think about kind of communicating to the Street your gains presumably in market share or RevPAR index? Or is that something that you can sort of provide now as a baseline so that we can measure or you can talk about a year from now kind of where that is? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. We love the optimism in your question and we have the same optimism. We think going to one set of channel platform, so that's the websites and the apps and the rest of it as well as one loyalty program, all of which happens August 18, will be a powerful positive for the system. As we mentioned, we won't get to one name for the loyalty program until sometime early in 2019 but we will have one program as of the 18th of August. That means of course that loyalty members can get credit for elite status or stays in the Marriott and Starwood Hotels. Previously, you had to earn your status in one platform or the other. It also means that points being earned and points being redeemed don't need to be transferred between accounts. And maybe most powerfully, it means that customers will show up on our website and they will see the whole portfolio instead of having to toggle back and forth between two different portfolios. We think all of those should drive increased share of wallet greater strength in the loyalty program. We'll be looking at measures like size of the loyalty program, number of members. We'll be looking at contribution of the loyalty program to hotels and we'll of course be looking at RevPAR index. It is a very hard thing to predict what the upside is going to be, but we're optimistic that we will see a greater strength from this stronger loyalty program and we'll do our best to communicate with you about the actual results we achieve. One other thing I'd mention. We don't think we're done on the cost side. Leeny mentioned the 60 basis points margin growth in both international markets and the U.S. market in Q2. That is we think very strong performance given the relatively modest RevPAR levels. We've also got some further cost synergies which we'll be rolling out to the hotels in the balance of 2018 and we know that we're going to deliver efficiencies into 2019 and 2020. So we want very much to drive both top line and margin improvement for the portfolio of hotels in the next couple of years. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask one question. Some owners, the REITs have talked about core sales bookings at formerly managed Starwood Hotels transitions around the sales force. And I'm just wondering is that process largely finished now? Or is there any kind of additional detail that you can add maybe from your guys' perspective versus what we've heard from owners? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So we've seen a few of those comments and seen a couple of references to this in some of the early notes that were published. And I'll try not to go on too long here, but I want to make sure that we talk about this a little bit. The best indication obviously about the way the hotels are performing is RevPAR index numbers. And as we've talked about for the last few years RevPAR index is a rollup of each hotel's performance against typically the five or six hotels that are most relevant in their competitive set. Typically those are going to be similarly positioned in the chain scales in the same geographic market. Sometimes, if they're in the luxury space, or they're in the group space the geography could be a little bit broader in order to get hotels that are similar. But they're the hotels that have been picked by Marriott and by the owners to say, okay, this is the group that is most germane to assessing the relative performance of this hotel. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we have increased index about 120 basis points over the last 12 months, which, with a portfolio of this size and the kind of work that's been underway on integration and all the other things that is underway here at Marriott is fabulously strong results. And again, the loyalty program has not been merged yet, so we think we've got upside ahead of us. I think, also, you can look at a little less precise data, but you can look at RevPAR growth for the Legacy-Marriott Hotels and the Legacy-Starwood Hotels, because interesting to note that the Legacy-Starwood Hotels are posting RevPAR growth numbers that are comparable, if not, even a little bit higher than the Legacy-Marriott Hotels. One last thing before getting to the comments that have been made by some other companies. We have a portfolio of hotels, about 70 hotels, if memory serves, that we describe as our convention resort network. And they tend to be the big hotels. They are the ones most reliant on the sales force, because they are most reliant on group. And when we look at the performance of those hotels, both Legacy-Marriott and Legacy-Starwood Hotels, we see RevPAR index up a full point in the last three months and a bit more than a full point in the last 12 months. So all of that would say there is nothing systemically that we see that would suggest the integration is sort of negatively impacting the system. Now, we've seen the comments made. I won't go through each one of them and I'm not going to name which hotel even I'm talking about, but I thought it was interesting that one of the companies talked about a specific hotel and its relatively soft performance in Q2. We know by looking backwards that that hotel had weak group bookings on the books well before Marriott acquired Starwood for these periods in 2018. And in fact in the second quarter of 2018 that hotel had an increase in bookings for future periods of 38% compared to prior times. And that's the first quarter when they had the new integrated sales force working for it. And so, again, each hotel is going to have a different story. We're not saying for a second that there couldn't be circumstances in which there has been staffing implications to the integration that's been done or there have been distractions or there have been other issues. But what we see generally across the system is not an integration impact to the performance that we've had, but just the reverse, a remarkable strength in the midst of all the change which is underway. Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot for that detail. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Felicia. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Felicia. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, just kind of along those lines, just in terms of the puts and takes of the RevPAR results in the second quarter, to what extent were they impacted? What would have you RevPAR looked like if you wanted to kind of smooth out for the sales force transition? And then also, as you're thinking about your guidance for the third quarter, how much have you accounted for in that or maybe for just the second half? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. So I won't repeat everything I just said Felicia but... Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No I don't want you to. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We do not think there was any impact... Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: ...I mean we do not think there is any impact in Q3 or Q4. So to the extent anybody's thinking the Q3 or Q4 guidance numbers we've put out there are somehow lower than they would be because of integration concerns, that is not the case. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. You're talking about \u2013 I heard you talk about index and I heard all of that. I just didn't know if there was a different way to translate it. Okay. Let's move on then. Just I wanted to get just again on the net unit growth, because I was just \u2013 in the quarter there seemed to \u2013 you gave guidance in April, so something happened in the quarter right. So just wondering how much of the greater than expected deletions was due to the Dubai hotels and then also looking to 2019, can we expect that you get back to that net unit growth of closer to 5.5% to 6%? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So a few questions in there. But interestingly and maybe a little bit ironically, the deletions we actually experienced in Q2 were half as many rooms as we experienced in Q1. And so as much as we would \u2013 it might be more concrete to be able to look at the higher deletion number and what actually happened in Q2, the higher deletion guidance, we've given you is really based on what we anticipate in Q3 and Q4. The Dubai hotels that you referenced are not in the Q2 numbers because they actually were not de-flagged until July 1, if I remember right or July 31. Actually we're at August 8 \u2013 we're in August now right. So yeah, end of July, so that will be a Q3 number. What we're anticipating in Q3 and Q4 and it's based on discussions underway as much as some decisions that have already been made and implemented is that for a mix of reasons we're going to see a bit higher deletions. The two \u2013 we've tried to call out and I maybe babbled on too long a little bit and clouded this, but product quality is certainly a piece of it and we are being tougher on that. I think another \u2013 a point that we have called out is there were a number of workout discussions that Starwood had not resolved, I think in part simply because of the pendency of our deal or the sale of that company. And our teams have been working with owners to try and get those resolved. And those discussions sometimes lead to hotels leaving the system as opposed to staying in. The only last thing I'd say, I think and I don't want to be Pollyannaish about this, but when you look at something like what happened in Dubai, we are confident that each of the three brands we had represented there will be replaced with product that we can be very proud of in that market in the fairly near-term. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. But as we just for modeling purposes are you more comfortable in 2019 with that 5% number or with where you've been more recently? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We don't have a 2019 number for you right now. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We obviously haven't built our 2019 budget. I do think that the deletions at 2% are likely to go back down into that 1% to 1.5% range and you should not view 2% as being the sort of new expectation. Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, David. David Katz - Jefferies LLC : So I think we've covered the unit growth discussion fairly well. But one of the issues I wanted to address is we've always looked at the Marriott brand and where it sits in the hierarchy with Sheraton and Westin and the degree to which those are either overlapping or bumping up against each other in the development community. Can you just give us a little color around how that is progressing? I know there was some repositioning around Marriott early on \u2013 rather Sheraton early on? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. I hope I understand your question, Dave. And I mean, we've got, obviously, Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, we've also got JW Marriott and Delta all in the upper upscale full service space. Obviously, those brands come from two different legacy portfolios and they were often competing head-to-head. Now each of those brands would have said that they were better than the competitors' brands in the same space. They're all now part of ours and if what you're getting at is, how do we essentially target each of those brands to minimize both customer confusion and, I guess, the overlap, that's what our brand teams are hard at work at. And they're hard at work at it with our owners and franchise partners. Sheraton is the one we've talked about the most, because Sheraton has needed it the most. And I think what we're seeing is good buy-in from our owners and franchisees to move the average quality of the Sheraton portfolio up meaningfully from what it was when we closed on the acquisition of Starwood. It probably, on average, will be a fraction lower than where the core Marriott brand is. But that \u2013 stress the words on average, because depending on the market we will have one that's positioned a little bit differently than another. That's the \u2013 obviously, by definition, full service hotels have been opened and developed over many decades and location will still feel quite important to this. And that's a comment that could easily be applied to the brands that have got a bit more of a lifestyle flavor too. We've got Renaissance and M\u00e9ridien that are both, also, in this full service space and they are each being positioned true to the heritage that they've had. And again, I think we're making really good progress on it. And you can look at this and say it's a monumental task to get these brands with some distinctions between them. But we can also look at them and say, it's an extraordinary opportunity to have this kind of distribution in an economically significant space and a space which is really important for our loyalty members and our group customers to have some choice and to have the kind of product and services that we can deliver across this portfolio. So we wouldn't want to be without any single one of these brands. David Katz - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just a quick question. On the previous earnings call you had noted that your group revenue booking pace for luxury and upper upscales was up 1% to 2% for the second half of this year. What does that comparable figure stand at today? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: It's about the same. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Unchanged? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi Robin. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Two questions. One is just \u2013 hi. On the effacement (54:45) unit growth, just looking at in the slides where you show conversions as a percent of your pipeline, it shows about 2%. And one of your other large competitors is talking about conversions being about 20% of their pipeline. I don't know if you and they are sort of measuring it in different ways, but that's such a big difference. I don't know if you have any thoughts on why your conversion \u2013 are you not capturing conversions or something or you're just measuring it differently in these two metrics? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. I think certainly definitionally I'm not going to pretend to know how they're included. As you know conversions can wander into your pipeline and stay there for a year-and-a-half, if there's a meaningful amount of work that needs to be done before it opens or it can literally flip overnight. So we're still in the land where we think a 15% to 20% of our room openings come from conversions, which has been consistent over time that that's the way it's been, when you think about our Autograph brand as a terrific example and our other soft brands are just terrific pipeline for us. But again in those situations they very often don't enter into the pipeline. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then my other question was just when you look at guidance for the second half adjusting for what you've previously quantified as the impact of holiday shifts and the impact of the hurricane driven demand, it looks like even though you're giving the same RevPAR guidance for Q3 and Q4 if you back out the comps from the prior year that you're maybe expecting an acceleration in underlying demand in Q4. I don't know if you can just give any color around what gives you that or what do you think would be driving that? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I wouldn't interpret what we've said as expecting an acceleration. What we're expecting is very much steady as she goes. Adjusted for calendar and comparison issues we see RevPAR for the first two quarters and the last two quarters of 2018 as essentially equivalent at about 2.5%. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : And I guess I'm just thinking Q4 versus Q3. So I definitely understand what you're saying about second half versus first half. But I guess the impact of hurricane driven demand and holiday shifts were greater in Q4. So if we back that out, for Q4 to be at the same rate as Q3? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, we've got the July 4th timing in Q3 and there may be some \u2013 can't remember where the Jewish holidays are hitting and exactly how they're hitting. I know our pinpoint calculation for Q3 and Q4 are 0.2 apart which to be fair is a smaller gap than our accuracy. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. That's good. That's helpful. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: And believe it or not, there can also be quarter-to-quarter a day of week shift just in terms of how many Tuesday nights there are versus how many Sunday nights there are and that also is a little bit of a factor between Q3 and Q4. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Sure. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Bill. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Arne, I think you mentioned in the formal remarks that part of the pipeline issue was or something that weighed on the pipeline was taking hotels out of the pipeline that had yet to commence construction in a timely matter. And I'm just \u2013 I recall back to the days when a lot of Starwood's peers were suspicious about the actual strength of their pipeline. I'm just wondering whether you've called \u2013 fully called the Starwood portfolio and pulled out any of the maybe phantom deals that were in there. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. And I wouldn't attribute that mostly to a Legacy-Starwood portfolio. I think that the \u2013 what 14,000 rooms we deleted I think in the quarter? I think we should pull that out. 13,000 or 14,000 that we pulled out of the pipeline and our team calls through that. I won't say necessarily that every quarter is as intense as the last one. But we were pretty aggressive in this quarter in going through and found in both the Legacy-Starwood brands and Legacy-Marriott brands that there were projects that had not moved fast enough. And so, we pulled them out of the portfolio. And it does a few \u2013 in some respects this is not \u2013 it's a little bit bigger number than a typical quarter would be, maybe meaningfully bigger. But it's not a totally unusual thing to discover that, the best laid plans maybe are not coming to fruition with an owner someplace. And I think in the environment that we're in today, we've got still plenty of available capital to invest in new projects. Availability of debt probably is still plentiful, but equity requirements are maybe a little bit higher than they were before. And construction costs are a little bit higher than they were before. And so you end up with some folks who maybe signed that deal a-year-or-two ago and they haven't moved forward and ultimately they tell us they're not planning to move forward on it. We just assume, call it out so that we've got that market to pursue with somebody else. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. And then the follow up, I guess, NH Hotels appears to be in play. I'm not going to ask you specifically about that, but just your thought now that you've made such progress on the integration of Starwood, are you ready to get back into the consolidation theme or do you think Marriott's set for a while? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: We will continue to look at opportunities that are available. I think as it relates to NH in particular, what \u2013 looks like Hyatt discovered is Bill Heinecke has that company reasonably well tied up. So I don't think there's much point in talking about that one, as if we would anyway. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sure. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: But we'll see. We're, obviously, appreciative of the way the Starwood deal has gone so far. We're also very appreciative of the way the organic growth story is going. But as we sit here today, our share of the global hotel business is still not particularly huge. And so, I think there's plenty of opportunity to continue to grow. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Two questions for you, on the room deletions commentary. Relative to a quarter ago what is the amount of forgone fees relative to that incremental deletion amount and if you could break that out between the workout category and say the other category? I would imagine the incremental fees or lost fees, forgone fees is relatively low, but that could be perspective, couldn't it? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Leeny may have something specific on this, but let me just say, on the short term a hotel leaving the system, we may lose management or franchise fees, we may gain in the short-term termination fees. And so, when you look at it, for example, in 2018 I'm not sure there's much impact. You look at it longer term, obviously, there is impact because those fees have left the system. I don't know, Leeny, if you've got the numbers. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So a couple of numbers for you, Joe. And we're certainly \u2013 kind of diving down into how much is from workouts versus product, we don't have that level of detail. And as you know, there are a whole host of different reasons. But let's just kind of talk broadly. Termination fees have generally run, call it, $15 million to $20 million a year. I think this year we are likely to be as much as double that, maybe even a little bit more based on the numbers that you heard us talk about today. So from that perspective you're clearly getting the extra kick. In the back half of the year, we did reduce our fees by close to $5 million as a result of the terminations that we expect to have this year. So that is impacting this year's earnings. When you then think about full year 2019 just to give you a broad sense of what the full year terminations could impact. If you're talking about again call it very roughly 2% then you could imagine that it could impact hotel fees next year by a bit less than that because some of these hotels aren't necessarily giving a lot of fees, so somewhere between 1% to 2% of hotel fees that will be lost as a result of 2% terminations this year. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. And then on the group pace for this year, is there a huge difference or meaningful difference between Starwood legacy properties and Marriott legacy properties? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: No. The numbers are very close. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Two questions for me. First on G&A, you highlighted the Starwood synergies a couple of times. How is that tracking versus your $250 million guidance? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. So if you kind of take the 2015 full year combined company adjusted for inflation and then using our current expectation for the full year of 2018 and adjust out for the $55 million, it's pretty much close to on the button in terms of hitting the $250 million. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks Leeny. I guess follow-up to that is do we think there could be incremental G&A synergies? And then my second question just to throw it now, you touched on how you've outperformed your asset sale goal. You still own some Legacy-Starwood Hotels. How should we think about the plans with what's left? Thank you. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Sure. All right. Let me do the second one first and then I'll talk about the synergies. Today, we own 14 hotels. They're split half and half between Legacy MI and Legacy-Starwood. We are as you know still completely devoted to our asset-light model and continue to be engaged in selling those hotels. They are as you might imagine not predictable in terms of the timing of those. So that's why as usual we leave those out of any guidance going forward, but we certainly are still going at it. On the G&A synergy side, I think the low hanging fruit has definitely been taken. When we look forward if you look at a global economy continuing to stay strong, clearly around the world you've got some wage pressure that you have to take into consideration when you look at kind of how it might go in 2019. Certainly, as I talked about on the last quarter's call when you take out the $55 million \u2013 when you include the $55 million this year you can imagine that next year G&A is lower than this year's printed number. But you also kind of finding other big chunks of synergies I think is probably not realistic, but I think continuing to be more and more efficient is. So we will continue to go after that. Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, guys. I think a lot of everything has been covered here. So just one high level one, but I do think it's something that's come up some. So there's been a lot of press reports recently going into the August 18, kind of, combination on the loyalty program side. So Arne, could you just talk at maybe a high level of, kind of, what you're doing to I think keep the highest level SPG members, kind of, pleased and happy through this whole process? I mean, I know, that it's a very difficult balancing act, but I would say that from the consumer side and obviously you have to think about multiple constituents here, but from the consumer side that was a kind of a core asset of Starwood when you acquired them. So just, kind of, what are you doing to keep that kind of customer happy throughout the program throughout the transition? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So it's a good question. It's obviously something we've been focused on, not just since we closed the deal, but since we announced the deal. And at the moment we announced in the fall of 2015, we heard loud and clear from the SPG loyalists, we love this program and make sure you protect it for us. And it has been a steady set of decisions and conversations since then, which have been aimed very much at doing that. Even before we closed on Starwood, we did a couple of things to the Marriott Rewards Program to send the message to the SPG loyalists that we were going to protect some of their benefits. And they included things like late checkout, which had not existed on the Marriott Rewards side before, but we said rather than simply say it to the SPG folks that we're going to do it, they would believe it more if we actually did it on the Marriott Rewards side. And there were other similar decisions that we made in that sort of timeframe. I think when we got to the day of closing we also did a number of things. I think one of the most important was the 3 :1 points conversion ratio between SPG and Marriott Rewards, which I think the SPG members looked at and said, you know that's a very fair conversion and it does well for us and so we appreciate that. And then I think in the last, what, nine months or so probably most intensively, we have focused on the economics of the program, which very much depend also on the economics of the credit cards. And with better credit card deals we have found that we can deliver great value to the elite members and the basic members of both loyalty programs. We can deliver it at reduced expense to the hotels, therefore benefiting the hotel owners and franchisees. And Marriott obviously can experience an increase in the credit card contribution to its own P&L. And while it would be too much to say that every single Marriott Rewards or SPG member has stood up and applauded, I think what we've heard from the bulk of that community is you've made a collection of decisions that caused us to feel very good about that program. And that's what we've intended and I think we'll prove it in the way that ultimately it is used by our well over 100 million members and growing. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And maybe just to stay on kind of the same idea like, at the very highest kind of level, the Ambassador program for Starwood, take that for instance, is the value of that guest as \u2013 like when you guys think about it from your side as high as maybe some of these kind of the super frequent people? Like is there some \u2013 I guess is it \u2013 it's hard to articulate, but is there some exceptional value to that guest or is everything sort of long and extreme because they also cost more to service and other things? So how are you kind of balancing just that ultimate kind of elite member? Because I think when we read some of the reviews and the blogs and some of the things like this and some of the articles they've been written that's where probably the most discussion about the program comes up. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, no. We love those elite folks and the Ambassador program we've expanded into the Marriott side of the equation too because we think it is exactly the right kind of step for these most valuable customers. And so we're doing that. And again, you take this a day at a time in some ways and we won't really have proven it until we get to one program and have it working. But I think the decisions that have been made are exactly the right ones. And I think the community as a whole is responding extraordinarily well to it. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So I want to ask you, you called out the $67 million impact for the asset sales in 2018, but can you give us what the number would look like for 2019 just based on the sales you've done so far this year? And I'm assuming that's a net number that includes the Sheraton and Phoenix purchase, is that right? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: So first of all, I'll say we haven't done our budgets yet for 2019, so it would be interesting to give you an expectation for the actual \u2013 the lost revenue overall for owned, leased. But on the hotels that we're selling this year, we can get you that number. I don't have a total here. We'll work on it and get it to you. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. And that is, net number does include the Sheraton and Phoenix? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, no. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then I just want to ask switching gears on China. I think your Asia-Pacific RevPAR guidance is still pretty strong. But maybe you can just comment on if you're seeing anything in China. I know you're talking about steady as she goes throughout the entire business. But maybe you can just comment on what you're seeing especially in light of all the trade talk right now. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes obviously, we're all listening to the trade talk, I think and it is anxiety producing in many respects. I think what we've seen in terms of trading conditions for open hotels in China has been very comforting, performing well. There's no sign that the trade conversation is impacting performance. And what we've seen on the development side has equally been reassuring, in that in part undoubtedly because of strong hotel performance for existing and open hotels, there continues to be a development appetite for Chinese real-estate investors. Remember our business is substantially Chinese in that of the hotels we have opened in China, I can think of one that's not owned by a Chinese company. And so the book of the economics are very much driven for the benefit of Chinese investors, real-estate investors. They are often government affiliated companies but not always. And as a consequence, we may be in a somewhat different place in a trade kind of conversation than the typical industry. I think personally my larger fear about the trade war potential is what it could do to GDP growth in the United States and to some extent what it could do to the cost for construction materials in the United States and in other markets around the world. And that certainly has not seemed to manifest itself yet in U.S. GDP numbers. It probably is starting to manifest itself in terms of some materials that are used for construction, but it's early on in that process, we'll have to see how it evolves. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : We've covered a lot of ground, obviously. So thanks for taking the question here. So I want to hit back on the Starwood sales force integration issues from the last quarter. We've heard from, at least, a handful of owners, so not really just one or two, but at least a handful and we have yet to hear from your largest owner of course so that's... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : ...granted that. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: That's tomorrow presumably, right? Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Exactly. So at the same time, I mean, everybody's got their own version of sort of what may have led to weakness of the individual hotels during the second quarter or whichever period we're talking about. I guess, if you had to fairly articulate the view of those owners with respect to this issue, what do you think a fair representation really is, just so we kind of get clarity on this point? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I mean, you've heard from them directly, obviously, and I'd be \u2013 be inappropriate for me to speak for all of them, because I think their views are not monolithic. Interesting to note that one of the companies we heard talk about this in their public call had never raised the performance of the hotel that they raised in the call with us. So as a consequence, our team hadn't really had a chance to engage in the dialogue with them. I think generally, though, and even what we've seen in the conversations over the last week or two, generally you see, even in those comments that the impact is viewed as transitory. They remain supportive of the transaction. They remain supportive of the notion that this transaction is going to deliver a significant value to them from top line and bottom line synergies. And even, I think, more of this concern has been raised with respect to Legacy-Starwood Hotels and I think a number of those folks have said, we still believe that the Legacy-Starwood Hotels may benefit disproportionately from Marriott and Starwood coming together. And so, we don't hear this as \u2013 obviously, we hear something. We hear the words that are being used and we don't want to say that there can't be instances in which there is some impact or there shouldn't be conversations to make sure we understand this as well as we possibly can understand it. But when you look at the system as a whole, we do not see it showing up in our data. We don't see it in the RevPAR index numbers. We don't see it in the RevPAR year-over-year growth numbers. We don't see it in what the customers are telling us about the way they're booking. And we'll do everything within our power to make sure that that continues to be the case. And then in the meantime we'll deal with the owners who called out concerns with respect to particular hotels and say, let's make sure we understand them and make whatever decision needs to be made in order to have those hotels perform as well as they can perform. Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI : Got it. Thanks for that color. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thank you. I just have one quick one. As it pertains to the deletions that you talked about, if you go back to your March of 2017 Analyst Day and kind of frame maybe the change in the magnitude of the deletions from what your expectations were at that point relative to kind of what you're currently seeing, is that possible? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not sure it is. I think we can say that we've been talking about 1% to 1.5% deletions for a while. I think actually last year we were closer to 1% than 1.5%. And so in a sense, we were positively surprised and maybe this is a little bit of a reversion to the mean in 2018. But I'm not sure, we can say much more than what we've already said. I think 1% to 1.5% for now and again we will get to a point where we share a multiyear plan with you all again at some point here. But until we get to next year's budget or until we get to a analyst conference, I think 1% to 1.5% still should be your expectation for the foreseeable future. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up on the group pace for all future periods that you stated plus 17% that's the comparable number is that right the 17%? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: No, no, no that is group bookings year-to-date for all future periods. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: For all future. Got it. Thanks very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: But that booking is done in 2018 for the first six months, that's not pace for all bookings from all time for future periods. Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on something; I don't know if it's come up today, but the Tribute Portfolio for booking homes in London I think as of the last call, you're only a few weeks in. Just curious now that you have a few more months, what are your early learnings there? And then would it surprise you to have other cities outside of London on that platform maybe by this time next year? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So thanks for raising it. Just as a reminder for everybody we launched about 90 to 120 days ago maybe a pilot in London under the name Tribute Homes. It is a relatively small pilot in a sense that there are about 200 homes that are connected to our system. And they are bigger than studio apartments. They're bigger than hotel rooms, they're whole home products. So it's a product which feels different to us from both what we have in the traditional hotel space and what the typical product is that a number of the home-sharing companies are focused on. And we wanted to provide loyalty linkage and we wanted to provide a set of services that would make it more predictable and more consistent with sort of a brand promise if you will. So, not just key delivery services, but housekeeping services and designing the core services which are delivered by our partner in London. And it we think allows us to distinguish a little bit both in terms of size and in quality from sort of the average home sharing thing, small pilot though. So far it's going great. Our loyalty customers seem to like it. Not surprisingly, it is predominantly a leisure buy. Not surprisingly, because it's a leisure buy, it's only London obviously it is a bit longer stay than we anticipated. So the stay we're experiencing is closer to five nights on average which is a little bit longer than we anticipated. And the customer feedback has generally been quite good. So we don't have anything to announce yet in terms of other markets, but it's certainly something we'll take a look at. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. And then second what percentage of the bookings are currently made through marriott.com, SPG.com and the apps combined when you roll it all up? And as you move to one platform, are you expecting that that percent which I think is growing each year to accelerate in growth? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: When you look at \u2013 if you add property to it, it's about three-quarters of our business. It's coming through our channels. Maybe 70% would be our channel. So that would be calling the hotel, calling our call centers and our digital platforms whether they'd be the dotcom sites or the apps. I think what we've seen over the last number of years is that the digital channels have grown substantially. The voice channels including our own voice channels have declined, we're likely to see those trends continue and we do think for the reasons we discussed earlier about share of wallet having all the hotels show up in one platform that we should be able to drive enhanced growth in the digital platforms because everything will be there. We don't have a forecast for you on where those numbers are going. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : And your final question is from Stuart Gordon with Berenberg. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Good morning. Net unit growth obviously there's two sides of the equation and everybody's been focused on the deletions. But I was wondering on the gross side you've materially increased both the number of proportion of rooms and construction. So is there an opportunity for you to do better than the 285,000 to 300,000 gross addition number you gave at the Capital Markets Day? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, there's a few questions in there. I would say, first, that we've been positively surprised by how strong the development pipeline is. I think when \u2013 there's a conversation we've been having for a few years, but we would have thought that U.S. signings and approvals probably would not be as strong as they are today. We thought that 2016 was sort of the peak organic growth and probably still is the peak organic growth. I don't think necessarily we're going to see the numbers move up from there, but our partners in the United States continue to want to do more deals with us and that's been really quite good. The world obviously is a big place. Some markets continue to perform quite robustly. Some are essentially moribund in the development space either for economic reasons or for geopolitical reasons. I think you look at all those averages and compare it to what we shared at the Analyst Conference, we would say that deletions might be just a little bit higher than we had before, but we'd have to go back and look at those three years. And openings have shifted back by a quarter or two and that's because of life of the construction cycle. And I think that latter factor is more likely to cause us to miss that 285,000 to 300,000 room number we used a year-and-a-half ago, when was that conference? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: March of 2017. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: March of 2017. More likely to miss it than we are to exceed it. Stuart J. Gordon - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up, you've given some color before on the number of credit card customers you've got. Could you give us an update in how that has improved with the better terms and also the cross-selling opportunities that you have as a larger group? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, it's still new in the process. JPMorgan Chase has rolled out the new Visa Card and the customer response has been great. They're in market. Amex will not roll out its new product until later this month. I think roughly the end of August. I don't remember precisely the date. And so, we don't have the customer reaction there yet. But all things considered we feel quite good about the strength of the program and the likelihood that it's going to grow in the future. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: All right. Well, thank you very much. Thank you everybody for your time and attention on the call. We appreciate your interest in Marriott and look forward to welcoming you into our hotels wherever your travel takes you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead, sir. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. I should note that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today, November 6, 2018 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion today about the income statement, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs, reimbursed revenues, and related expenses, the year-to-date net adjustment to the tax charge related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the year-to-date adjustment to the Avendra gain. Of course, you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks at www.marriott.com/investor. So, let's get started. We are now past the second anniversary of our acquisition of Starwood and just last week, we met with our North American owners at a largely upbeat Full-Service Owners Conference. When we announced our intention to acquire Starwood in 2015, our hotel owners were supportive and upon completion of the deal remain so. They have provided great feedback throughout the process as we set our priorities for the integration. Today they are now reaping the benefits from improved cost efficiencies, higher guest satisfaction, and the upcoming impact of a more powerful loyalty program. Over those last two years we have integrated our operations, sales, marketing, hotel development, and finance organizations and systems. We are halfway through moving legacy Starwood hotels on to our Marriott reservations platform and the process is going very well. We've enhanced guest satisfaction by applying Marriott's deep operational know-how and made solid progress on product scores. Costs for both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood hotels have been reduced as we captured synergy cost savings at properties, reduced loyalty program charge-out rates across the system, and realized procurement savings. We also lowered corporate, general, and administrative expenses meaningfully. After two years of planning, we integrated our loyalty programs on August 18, creating one powerful unified program allowing our members to earn, book, and redeem across more than 6,700 hotels. This was an extremely complicated systems challenge as we essentially created a new loyalty platform. While there are always unanticipated challenges with complex systems integrations, our loyalty and IT teams were driven to make this integration go as smoothly as possible. In the days following cutover, many loyalty members checked their online statements and some discovered errors. Telephone volume to our loyalty lines increased running up 35% at the peak. Our team immediately identified the problems and our loyalty telephone agents were quickly trained to help customers with these issues. To be sure, wait times were sometimes too high. Today call volume to our loyalty lines is running roughly 2% to 3% over seasonal norms and wait times are back to normal. While we have solved the most significant problems, we are still addressing issues for some customers. For those loyalty members who were affected we appreciate your patience. One powerful learning from this aspect of the integration, we discovered just how passionate our members are about our loyalty program. We are already seeing the positive results from the loyalty integration. Our total loyalty membership is now 120 million members. Post-program integration data reveals accelerated bookings from loyalty members, higher luxury redemptions and a growing proportion of bookings from our direct digital channels. Notwithstanding our focus on integration over the last two years, we have not stood still. We entered into a joint venture with Alibaba in Asia, introduced a pilot of Tribute Portfolio homes in Europe, introduced new loyalty credit cards with JPMorgan Chase and American Express, expanded our mobile offerings to include food and beverage at hotels and began taking cruise reservations for the first Ritz-Carlton yacht. Beginning in 2019, we are implementing a new program services fee structure for owners that will allow us to manage cost for programs and services in a manner that is simple and predictable. Under this new structure, we expect over three-quarters of hotels will see costs for these programs and services decline. Our new Enhanced Reservation System which we call ERS has been rolled out to over 500 hotels. ERS allows guests to select rooms based on a greater variety of room characteristics such as bed type, view, high or low floor, corner room balcony, and so on with more photography and hotel descriptions allowing greater customer choice and more effective marketing. Earlier this year, we reduced intermediary commissions for group business from 10% to 7%. Our largest competitors have followed albeit months after us which may have permitted them to temporarily benefit from some customer shift. While not all group business is intermediated, these commissions have been a significant and growing cost for large group hotels. Group meeting customers choose our hotels because of our high-quality service, outstanding rooms and meeting space, and reasonable cost. Over the last 12 months our group RevPAR index is steady. And in the third quarter RevPAR at our largest group hotels in North America rose 3%. In revenue management, we are focused on profitability as well as RevPAR. As a measure RevPAR is easy to understand readily available in weekly STR reports, but is a blunt instrument for measuring success. Some distribution channels are just too expensive for the value of the business they deliver. In North America, our revenue management systems now consider these distribution costs when deciding which channels to open on any particular night. This has resulted in a decline in OTA business during peak occupancy nights and an increase in direct bookings. On a worldwide basis OTA share of our room nights was flat year-over-year in the third quarter and declined in North America. We believe this likely had a few tenths negative impact on RevPAR growth, but a favorable impact on hotel profits. Global RevPAR rose roughly 2% in the third quarter with a modest increase in North America and continued robust trends in most international markets. We expect global RevPAR will increase roughly 2% in the fourth quarter and based on our early budget work 2% to 3% for the full year 2019. For North America third quarter RevPAR increased 0.6%. Group RevPAR increased over 1% with good attendance at meetings and fewer cancellations. While we anticipated a negative comparison to last year's hurricanes, the decline in U.S. industry transient demand in September was more significant than we anticipated. October looked better than September with stronger transient demand and considerable group business on the books. We are nevertheless taking a slightly more conservative view as we enter the seasonally slow holiday periods, so we are forecasting North American RevPAR growth of 1% for the fourth quarter. For 2019 estimates for U.S. GDP growth point to a slightly slower pace of growth than in 2019 \u2013 excuse me, 2018, which benefited from the tax cut earlier in the year. U.S. lodging supply growth is expected to moderate slightly next year largely due to shortages of skilled sub-contractors, higher construction costs and higher interest rates despite the continued favorable economic climate. As we consider our 2019 outlook, we note that Group revenues on the books in North America for comp hotels in both 2018 and 2019 are modestly higher consistent with constrained meeting space capacity. Our sales organization is doing a great job. We are negotiating 2019 special corporate rates with our largest corporate clients right now. And while only a few negotiations are complete, we expect 2019 special corporate rates for comparable accounts in North America to rise at a low single-digit rate. Given all this, we expect RevPAR in North America will increase 1% to 3% in 2019, which reflects our continued steady-as-she-goes view of lodging demand. Let me take a moment to address the strikes that are occurring at 21 of our hotels in six North American cities. This is out of a portfolio of 6,700 hotels. We have been negotiating in good faith for many months and we are making progress. We have already reached tentative agreement on national issues, and we have reached a number of local settlements. Just this weekend, we welcomed our associates back to work after contract settlements in Oakland and Detroit. We hope to welcome more of our associates back to work soon. We don't expect the strikes to have a material impact on our earnings in the fourth quarter. We are humbled by the determination and grace of the associates working today at these 21 hotels, who have been steadfast in their commitment to our guests. And we are grateful to the associates across Marriott who have stepped up to work at hotels impacted by strikes including thousands of people who have traveled from other cities to help. Due to their efforts our hotels have continued to operate in many cases with full occupancy. I couldn't be prouder of the extraordinary dedication of our people. Turning to our international regions. In the Asia Pacific region, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased 6% in the third quarter while RevPAR in Greater China rose 5%, constrained by the timing of the mid-Autumn Festival and Golden Week holidays as well as the Typhoon Mangkhut that struck Hong Kong, Macau and South China. We expect our fourth quarter RevPAR in the region will increase at a mid-single-digit growth rate. Our hotels in Indonesia should benefit from a World Bank event and easy comparisons to last year's volcanic eruption in the fourth quarter. For 2019, we expect Asia Pacific RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate reflecting somewhat more modest economic growth assumptions. In Europe, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 6% in the third quarter driven by strong results in France, Turkey and Russia as well as greater U.S. travel to the entire region. The 2018 World Cup doubled our RevPAR in Russia. We expect fourth quarter RevPAR in Europe will continue to grow at a mid-single-digit rate with easier comps in Spain and stronger demand in Munich, Vienna and Rome. For next year the World Cup will be a tough comparison, but we expect Europe RevPAR will grow at a mid-single-digit rate in 2019. In the Middle East and Africa region system-wide constant dollar RevPAR was flat in the third quarter due to the timing of holidays, continued political tensions in parts of the region and considerable new supply ahead of Expo 2020 in Dubai. RevPAR in Africa alone rose over 7% reflecting strength in Egypt. We expect RevPAR in the fourth quarter will decline at a low single-digit rate largely due to the new supply in the UAE and a tough comparison to last year's results of The Ritz-Carlton Riyadh. For 2019 we expect EMEA RevPAR will be flat year-over-year. In CALA our Caribbean and Latin American region RevPAR rose 6% in the quarter with RevPAR at our hotels in the Caribbean up 13% as they continue to benefit from strong transient demand, as well as lower industry supply following last year's hurricanes. We expect fourth quarter RevPAR in CALA will increase at a mid-single-digit rate benefiting from the upcoming G20 summit in Buenos Aires and favorable comps to last year's earthquakes in Mexico. For 2019 we expect RevPAR in the region will increase at a low-single digit rate. Our brands are strong and continue to be preferred by developers and lenders alike. As of the end of the quarter our development pipeline totaled roughly 471,000 rooms including more than 212,000 rooms under construction. According to STR we continue to have the largest pipeline of rooms under development in the world including more high-value luxury and upper-upscale rooms than our next three competitors combined. Based on third quarter STR industry pipeline data, worldwide one in five hotels under construction will open under one of our brands. In the U.S. alone one in three hotels under construction will fly one of our flags. And in the valuable upscale and above tiers in the U.S. 50% of hotels under construction will be under a Marriott International brand. With this pipeline in 2018 we expect our rooms will grow by nearly 7% gross. Deletions in 2018 should total nearly 2% of our existing portfolio. Our brand improvement efforts and owner workouts account for the unusually high level of deletions of legacy Starwood product in 2018. In total we continue to expect net rooms growth to be roughly 5% in 2018. For 2019, we expect gross room growth will be similar to this year while room deletions should moderate to 1% to 1.5%. Net unit growth should total roughly 5.5%. We do not see an economic downturn on the horizon, but given recent stock market volatility there is clearly uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy. Regardless of the economy's performance, given long construction cycles our strong unit growth should continue for some time. In fact looking back at the last downturn our gross room additions totaled 6% in 2008 and 7% in 2009. Our unit growth bottomed at 3% in 2012, but was back to 5% just two years later. We are committed to our asset-light business model by managing or franchising hotels rather than owning them. Our unit growth is faster. Significant economies of scale benefit our owners and customers, our return on investment is higher and we generate considerable excess cash flow to invest or return to our shareholders. For more about our business model and the third quarter here's Leeny. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Thanks Arne. Our third quarter financial performance was solid. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.70, 62% over the prior year quarter and $0.41 over the midpoint of our guidance. Our gross fee revenue line yielded about $0.01 of the outperformance, largely due to strong branding fees. $0.04 came from better-than-expected performance on the owned and leased line largely related to termination fees, $0.03 came from better-than-expected general and administrative expenses reflecting continued synergies and favorable timing, $0.15 came from gains on the sale of assets including the sale of a hotel in a joint venture, $0.14 came from favorable discrete tax items and the tax impact of asset sales with the balance of the outperformance from depreciation, amortization and net interest expense. Gross fee revenues totaled $932 million, a 13% increase year-over-year largely from unit growth, RevPAR gains and higher incentive fees and branding fees. Credit card branding fees alone totaled $101 million, including $6 million associated with the true-up of fees earned in prior periods. Credit card branding fees totaled $59 million in the year-ago quarter. For our company-operated hotels, house profit margins increased 20 basis points worldwide on continued property synergy savings despite accelerating wage increases. Incentive fees increased 9% in the third quarter driven by strength in Asia Pacific and Europe. Owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $82 million in the third quarter flat with the prior year. Property dispositions reduced owned/leased results in the quarter by $23 million year-over-year. Termination fees totaled $23 million in the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior year. For owned or leased hotels that were opened in the third quarter of both years, profits increased nearly 5% in the quarter. General and administrative expenses totaled $221 million, 8% higher than the prior year. The 2018 quarter included the company-funded supplemental retirement savings plan contribution totaling $7 million, while in the year ago quarter we recognized a $6 million tax incentive benefit. Gains and other income totaled $18 million, including a $12 million favorable adjustment associated with the sale of two hotels in Fiji made earlier in the year and a $4 million gain on the sale of our interest in a joint venture. We also reported a $55 million gain on the equity and earnings line as one of our joint ventures sold the JW Marriott hotel in Mexico City. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 12% to $900 million, despite a $19 million negative impact from sold assets. Looking ahead given our worldwide RevPAR and unit growth assumptions, we expect gross fee revenue for the fourth quarter will total $900 million to $910 million, a 4% to 6% increase over the prior year. Year-over-year, we don't expect foreign exchange to have a material impact on our fourth quarter gross fees. Fourth quarter fee revenue is about $30 million lower than the midpoint of our prior guidance. Unfavorable foreign exchange accounts for about $10 million of that decline. Our modestly lower RevPAR estimate accounts for about $15 million with the timing of residential branding fees covering the balance. We expect owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total roughly $90 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to last year, results should reflect stronger hotel results and higher termination fees, as well as a $13 million negative impact from sold hotels. Our guidance assumes no further asset sales beyond those that have been completed. G&A should total $245 million to $250 million in the fourth quarter, including roughly $6 million for our contribution to the company-funded supplemental retirement savings plan and associate support programs. The increase compared to our prior fourth quarter guidance is largely related to timing. We expect net interest expense will total $90 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to our prior forecast, this reflects higher fixed-rate borrowings, higher interest rates and lower interest income. These assumptions yield $1.37 to $1.41 adjusted diluted earnings per share and 7% to 9% growth in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2018, we expect adjusted earnings per share will total $6.15 to $6.18, and adjusted EBITDA should increase 10% to 11%. We aren't prepared to provide guidance for 2019 as we've not yet finished our budget process. But as you consider your models for 2019, we want to note that our 2018 full-year forecast for owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, includes roughly $70 million of termination fees largely associated with the rooms deleted in 2018. A more normal run rate for termination fees is $20 million to $30 million annually. Year-to-date, we've recycled nearly $630 million of capital through asset sales and loan repayments, and recycled more than $1.8 billion of capital since our acquisition of Starwood. Compared to our last view of 2018, cash flow has improved due to lower cash taxes, lower investment spending and higher asset sales. We repurchased nearly 21 million shares from January 1 through yesterday for approximately $2.7 billion, already exceeding our guidance for the full year 2018. As a result, we now expect to return roughly $3.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2018. Our asset-light business model is attractive because of its low-risk profile with most of our cash flow coming from hotel base and franchise fees, typically earned as a percentage of the hotel's top line. Of course, incentive fees are sensitive to demand trends. This was particularly true for management agreements that include a priority return to the owner, which in a significant downturn can drive a property's incentive fee down meaningfully. Marriott has limited exposure to this risk. Our incentive fees represent less than 20% of our total fees, and of those nearly two-thirds come from international markets, which frequently have no owner priority, and therefore hold up better in a weak economy. Over the last 10 years, Marriott fee revenue has become relatively less risky as we have increased our proportion of both franchise and international business. You may recall that we spun off our timeshare business in 2011. In 2007, our timeshare segment alone accounted for roughly one quarter of our operating income. Today we only earn a largely fixed franchise fee from our timeshare business. Overall while our business has been asset-light for many years, we have also meaningfully improved our risk profile with our growth strategy and expect to continue to do so. Now, I'll turn it back over to Arne, who has a few more comments before we go to Q&A. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thanks, Leeny. Before opening it up for questions, let me pause for one more moment to thank the Marriott associates around the world, who have worked so extraordinarily effectively on our integration journey. We have had thousands of associates working around-the-clock to pull these two technology platforms together. And based on their work and the work that precedes it by every measure, we can now say we are one company and we are very bullish about the long-term opportunities we can pursue. We are excited about our future and plan to talk to you, the investors, more about it at our Analyst Day in New York, scheduled for Monday, March 18, at the New York Marquis. Please save the date. Now, let's turn to your questions. So that we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Christie, we'll take questions now. Operator : Thank you. And your first question is from Robin Farley of UBS. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Robin. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about the deal with Host Hotels that they talked about in their release last week, where you'll be sort of guaranteeing some profits for \u2013 during disruption of renovations. And I guess, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about why you're doing that. It seems unusual. I don't recall you having done that before. And would that be like a reduction in your fee revenue, or somehow capital spend for you? Or just how we should think about that? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Robin. It's a great question. Let me start just by saying that the relationship between Marriott and Host today is as strong as I've seen it in many, many years. The companies are working together extraordinarily well with high transparency between the two companies and a strong sense of collaboration about what we can accomplish together. I think the deal that Host described in their call is just the most recent example of that, and an exciting one for us and for them, I think both. Obviously, there it is focused on 17 very prominent hotels in our system, including the New York Marriott Marquis, the San Francisco Marquis, the Orlando World Center, just to name a few. And I think what Host and we saw together was that, by increasing the renovation capital that went into those hotels, we could drive better returns for Host as an owner, and if models are right for Marriott International as manager of those hotels. Because it was a substantial amount of incremental capital that Host was preparing to commit into these hotels and in light of numerous aspects of these deals, including our incentive fee formulas and base management fees, it was very much in our interest to participate financially in incenting that program. We'll have roughly $80 million of key money which will be provided over four years, which is a partial incentive to Host to get that done. There will be a \u2013 adjustments in the incentive fee formulas which is quite typical in many respects, when new capital, in other words, capital over and above FF&E reserve gets put into hotels, typically an owner will get incremental owner's priority for that. At the same time, we believe that if the hotels perform the way we anticipate them to perform, we will see an incentive fee formula that maybe gives them a higher priority, but actually produces more dollars for us as well as more returns for them. So, we're really excited about it and just can't wait to see the way these hotels will be transformed. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : That's great. Thank you. And maybe just as my follow-up. Just looking at your RevPAR guidance for 2019, it looks like the first time in many years that your range has only been 100 basis points and typically over the years you've given a 200 basis point range. So I'm just wondering given the \u2013 if anything, sort of, maybe increased uncertainty about next year, why the tighter range? Or what was the thought there? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Maybe we just want to prove that old dogs can learn new tricks. The \u2013 it is \u2013 we obviously go through this carefully and probably we should start by restating the obvious here which is we have not done the full budgeting process so we're not completed. We have looked carefully at the preliminary things that we've got coming in and using the tools that we have. And what we see is something that we think looks a fair bit like 2018. And as we did the math, we thought two to three was a more relevant one point range to give you than to give you a two-point range that could be either below or above that. But neither of those seem to be as accurate as we wanted to be at this point in time. And so two to three is what we came up with obviously with a bit broader range in the U.S. guidance. Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from David Katz of Jefferies. David Katz - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hi, David. David Katz - Jefferies LLC : If I can go back in the prepared remarks. Arne, I think, you mentioned some uncertainty around the economy, but that your unit growth should continue. Can we just sort of pick that a little bit deeper from the perspective that if the economy were and I'm not asserting that it will, but if it were to turn in a less positive direction wouldn't the implication be harder that getting projects open and on the board, et cetera, would become more challenging as well? Why are you comfortable with that? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I think, the biggest reason \u2013 it's a good question David, but I think the biggest reason for that is that the near-term openings and I would think about those as being not just 2019 actually, but probably 2019 and 2020, are well underway. Overwhelmingly they are under construction today. And while it is not necessarily the case that they will proceed with that above \u2013 no matter what the economic environment, what we've seen in prior economic cycles is projects like that proceed towards completion and opening. And the intake of new deals into the development pipeline will for certain be impacted by a materially weaker economic environment, but probably will not impact openings until we get a few years out. David Katz - Jefferies LLC : Got it. And if I can just ask on the heels of the impressive integration that you've gone through and talked about, and I apologize if you commented on this, but with respect to SPG members in particular there's been a focus on retaining and enhancing that relationship. What measurements or what are you looking at to feel comfortable that those people, those members are still on board? And is there any sort of data to support that? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, good questions. And obviously this is something that we will continue to be watching like a hawk. And ultimately we will have access to quite granular data which allows us to look at the spending patterns of SPG members and look at whether we see any signs that those spending patterns have increased or decreased in the wake of the merger of the loyalty programs. As a reminder, it was August 18 so we are a couple of months into it now, but it's still quite recent. We know and we put this in the prepared remarks, we know already that we are seeing a substantial increase in digital bookings \u2013 somebody's not got us on mute, I think. Sorry about that. I don't know where the laughing is coming from. We are seeing the substantial increase in digital volume. We are seeing more and more eyeballs look at hotels in the combined set. And so our preliminary data gives us considerable comfort that what is logically obvious will turn out to be reality and what is logically obvious is that by offering our customers more choice with more places both to earn and redeem points, and more of our customers going to one single site to see all of our portfolio that we will increase share of wallet from the customers as well as grow the loyalty program. But stay tuned for that. We'll have data over the next number of quarters, it will be particularly the most important thing we're looking at. David Katz - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for taking my questions. And sorry about the background noise it was on my side. No one is laughing at you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from David Beckel of Bernstein. Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hello. This is Apple on behalf of Dave. Thank you for taking my questions. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Can you please give us an update on your home sharing trial? And do you think that will become a official project? And what feasibility needs proving out? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So we've been very pleased with the pilot so far. We started in London, I would say four, five months ago. Though I maybe a bit imprecise on the precise start date. And the plan in London was to work with a partner who essentially curates the units that would be available on our site. Those units would obviously have a linkage to our loyalty program. And we looked for units which were, A, big enough to be distinct from a traditional hotel room; and B, of a kind of quality that we felt good about having our loyalty program and brands associated with. The first wave of that pilot was really about assessing what happened in London. And we saw really good results. For example, I think 85% of the folks that booked were our loyalty members. It looked like mostly leisure business which was not surprising to us. And it looked like it was accretive to our total business in the market, with by the way good synergy with hotel bookings too. So we saw people that would look at our home sharing units and ultimately many would book with those, but many would come book with hotel rooms too because they were looking at essentially both portfolios. In any event, it went well enough that we have now expanded that to Phase 2 which includes Paris, Lisbon and Rome. So, we're in four markets in Europe, and we are very encouraged by what we've seen so far. So, stay tuned, we'll see where it goes. Apple Li - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : So your net room guidance implies that the exits may have stabilized. Are you guys feeling more confident that the uptick in your guidance from last quarter, which I think was largely involuntary exits, but are you feeling more confident that that was more of a one-off? And I guess what sort of gives you that confidence going into 2019? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. So I'll let Leeny talk about 2019, but let me just make a comment about 2018 and what we saw in terms of deletions. Obviously, there was a lot of Q&A about this a quarter ago. I think, we brought up the numbers by roughly half a point in terms of number of units that would leave our system in 2018 compared to what we have talked about the quarter before. And not entirely involuntary, I'll quibble with you a little bit on that. It's not as if every hotel leaving our system is something that we want to leave, but many are. And actually when you look at Q3 numbers, we deleted about 6,000 rooms in Q3 just a bit over that. There was a big portfolio of Gen 2, Generation 2 Fairfield Inns, maybe about 1,300 rooms, that we worked with our franchisee and hotel owner to have exit the system. And they \u2013 that was the right answer because those hotels did not justify the kind of capital they needed to remain competitive. And we think from a product quality perspective and an ability to replace probably in a number of those markets that was a no-brainer for us. There was a story in Dubai, which I think is familiar to everybody, but an owner who really wanted to operate it under franchise contract and we decided to part ways with them. And we don't really have much more to say to that, but that was another 1,700 or 1,800 rooms. And then there was another 1,700 or 1,800 rooms, which were in Las Vegas and that was a negotiation with the owner of those projects, but there's a significant quality aspect of those conversations. And I think, we are quite satisfied with the way all of those discussions came out. The challenge, of course, when you have a few big ones like that whether they'd be a portfolio of Fairfields or a couple of individual projects is they can have an impact to what happens in the quarter. I think we would have loved to have been able to say; I think you probably would have loved to hear from us that it was only about repositioning Sheraton, for example, which we are doing and making great progress on that. That would be a bit of an oversimplification. It is a mix of things but they do include in the fullness of the year, some about repositioning the Sheraton brand, significantly about product quality, and to some extent about discussions with owners that had been left unresolved for too long and we're now getting around to getting those resolved. But as we've looked early into 2019 and Leeny can talk about this, I'm \u2013 we're optimistic that we're going to sort of return a bit more towards normal levels. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Just to follow-on Arne's comments, we continue to do a scrub as we do all the time about hotels that are either coming to the end of their contract or discussions that we're having on ongoing product improvements, et cetera. And as we look through in each and every continent both legacy Marriott portfolio as well as legacy Starwood we do feel good about the 1% to 1.5% that we've described today. If you remember what we talked about a quarter ago we talked about the more normal rate for the legacy Marriott portfolio of 1% to 1.5% in 2018 for deletions while a number of that would be well over 2% for the legacy Starwood portfolio. And as we again described for a host of reasons to some extent kind of some issues that may have been hanging around since before the merger. While as we've worked through them and now look forward we see the number for the legacy Marriott portfolio in 2019, continuing to be the stereotypical 1% to 1.5% and the legacy Starwood moving down much closer to a more normal level as we look at the termination. So, overall looking at 1% to 1.5%. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And I just want to go back to the comments about a weaker transient environment in September. Do you think you just underestimated the calendar and the holiday impacts? Or do you think there was more to it than that? And I guess even though, October it seems like that was better, but it seems like you may be taking more conservative approach to November and December, if I'm hearing you right. So to what extent is that cautiousness towards the latter months of this year also extrapolated into your 2% to 3% RevPAR guidance for next year? Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: It's exactly the right question I think. The surprise, the disappointment to us in Q3 was purely about U.S. RevPAR performance in September. And it had an impact obviously in the Q3 RevPAR number. And it does impact in a way I'll describe a little bit more fully in a second, our expectations for Q4. By and large it is not impacting our early guidance or early ranges for 2019. When you look at September RevPAR, let's start with Smith Travel, interestingly you see, luxury performing reasonably well at 1.8%. These are Smith Travel numbers for the month. Not surprising, because luxury often has got a bit more skew towards resort hotels than other segments of the market. And when you end up with some holiday performance for example, you end up with relatively better performance in the leisure space. Upper-upscale was only 0.3% so barely better than flat. And all other segments, again these are Smith Travel numbers, were down 1%. Those are the RevPAR numbers. Our system-wide number in September was down 1% roughly. So, it was a disappointing month. Now to let it all hang out there, our performance was better than two points worse than what we thought internally heading into September. And that's what gave us cause. And of course, when you see that, you say, okay, let's figure out everything that can happen. The most obvious explanations and we think are still probably the most relevant explanations are the tough comparisons in the hurricane markets in Houston and Florida and the mid-week Jewish holidays that occur in September. So we had both the holidays shifting into September, but because they were mid-week they probably had a more significant impact on business transient travel. But when you miss by over two points, that's a little bit sobering. And so we've done everything we can to tease and test and sweat that data to see if we can figure out what happened. And there is a bit of September's numbers which were cautionary to us. It was a little bit slower transient pickup than we had seen in prior months. And so we went into October with again some concern, not overwhelming because of the hurricane and holiday pieces of this, but some concern. The best news here is that October was by and large reassuring. We don't have that data in enough depth yet to be able to tease it and test it in the way that we've done for September, but the headline RevPAR number we think will be sort of back towards the prior trend line. There still is though enough concern I suppose for us that as we head into November and December, which are weaker months of the year, less group business, more dependent on transient, obviously, you get into sort of quieter part of the year. We want to be thoughtful about that short \u2013 very short-term transient pickup and our assumptions are to be sure more conservative for Q4 than they would have been had we not had the experience we had in September, probably by about a point of RevPAR in Q4. Again, it does not impact our expectations for 2019, in part, because we return to a stronger, more normal traveling months, in part, because when we look into Q1, we see fairly good group bookings on the books and all of this tells us that we should expect sort of a steady-as-she-goes for the whole year kind of numbers from 2018 as we head into 2019. So, that's a long-winded answer, but I think it's an important question and it's one that I would say the sky is not falling, notwithstanding the weak September. We do think September was more an industry story than it was a Marriott story. In fact, when we look at our RevPAR index for the month of September, we held our own, which was very gratifying and so stay tuned. Let's watch it. We're a bit more cautious simply because September happened, but we're not particularly fearful. Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC : That's very helpful. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on that line of questioning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning Harry. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Good morning. Year-over-year in November, December, do you find that you're up against some tough comps? I'm wondering if that might be part of the reason for conservatism. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, we have tough comps, of course, because of the hurricanes in Houston and Florida. Our expectation is that the hurricane comps hurt us by about a point year-over-year. And so while none of us loves putting a kind of 1%-ish number on the table as a guidance for a quarter, which is our expectation for U.S. system-wide, that number based on hurricane comps alone would be about two points, if it weren't for that. And that's not far off of the kind of run rate we have seen. Again it does include a more conservative assumption about short-term transient pickup than we've had in place for the first three quarters of the year. And whether that turns out to be more conservative than needed or not, we'll have to see as the quarter comes to a close. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Okay very good. And then similarly in your sales departments conversations with your corporate customers, is there anything that they're seeing with respect to the fourth quarter and next year that would indicate that demand is at risk of softening? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: No. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Okay. That's good to hear. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Great. Is that enough? Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : I think no is a good answer. And just a similar line of thoughts, my last question is if corporate profits are still expected to grow roughly 10% in 2019 and your occupancy levels are pretty close if not at or above historic high, why not get your property managers to push the rate a bit more? Yeah, I'll stop there. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I'm entirely with you on that too, Harry. I think, the relative lack in rate given where we are in occupancy is obviously something, we have talked about in prior quarters. We are trading at essentially historic peaks in occupancy. We would have expected and probably still do expect more rate growth than occupancy growth going forward and are optimistic that we will see some occupancy growth particularly if we see the economy continuing to perform strongly. Having said that, it is not just a question of the instructions we give to the hotels that we manage, but it is a question about the decisions that are made by thousands of franchised hotels in our system who are setting their own pricing. And obviously, we compete in a highly competitive industry. And so we've got \u2013 we would love to ignore the way hotels are priced by both independents and some of our competitors, but you can't really do that. And so we are doing the best we can to drive rates. I think, we're making some progress in that, but we hope to see more progress in the months ahead. Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC : Okay. Good luck with it. Thank you. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Joe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning, Joe. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Arne, am I wrong in interpreting your North American 3Q results as indicating that maybe you lost a little bit of RevPAR index? I know you're reporting same-store North America and we tend to look at U.S. STR data, which isn't same-store. Maybe if you when answering the question, if you could sort of discuss the difference between limited-service and the North American full-service results? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, obviously you can see that in our press release. You've got our luxury system-wide numbers at about 3% RevPAR, upper-upscale at about 1.5% a little bit less. And then the limited-service at minus 0.5%. And that is obviously in a way looking at the relative strength of the segments. I think part of that is also a function of the kind of customers that essentially are most predominant in those hotels. So the limited-service hotels are often particularly during the week dependent on the individual business traveler. The upper-upscale hotels are going to be dependent on that traveler, but also on group. And the luxury hotels as I mentioned before are going to have a bit of a skew toward resort and therefore are going to be a little bit more leisure-dependent. And in the sense you can look at that stack and see the relative strength during the quarter. And that is that leisure probably strongest, group next and the business \u2013 individual business transient traveler next. And that plays through reasonably well. Now vis-\u00e0-vis Smith Travel, don't forget we've got different geographic areas of concentration compared to the industry. Because of our 91-year history in Washington, we are very strong in Washington. If you look at the Smith Travel RevPAR numbers by city, you'll see that Washington was the weakest big market out there for a mix of reasons. Obviously, today is mid-term election day. In the months before mid-term election you got a lot of politicians who are out in the hustings and there's not that much happening in Washington that drives business. We also had during Q3 a hurricane warning that included Washington D. C., and a emergency I think was called here even though the hurricane never showed up. But it was called with enough advance warning that it had an impact on business. And in Houston, we've got strong select-service distribution and that's a tough year-over-year comparison. So long-winded way of getting to your question which is, did we lose share in the quarter? Our share in the quarter actually I mentioned September, September we held our own and in the quarter we held our own. So this is not fundamentally about Marriott lagging the market. This is fundamentally about how the market performed by geography and by segment in both September and in the quarter? Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And I don't know if you gave \u2013 thank you for the answer. I don't know if you gave any specifics about October in the U.S. other than \u2013 you're saying it was better than September. But when we look at your 4Q, 1% U.S. RevPAR growth guidance does that assume in the next two months of this quarter basically flat? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I will say this October will be the strongest month of the quarter, based on our present expectations. And that's a bit about \u2013 it's a more normal travel time, it's a more normal group business time and to some extent, we knew it would rebound from September because some of the things that happened in September worked to the benefit of October. So October we think will be stronger than November and December. Obviously, we don't have again really final numbers yet for October. We have some preliminary views, but it's not \u2013 we don't have final enough numbers to hang them out for you this morning. Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning everyone. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Slower transient demand during holidays seems to be the systemic trend this year. Is there anything Marriott can do from revenue management or marketing standpoint to help \u2013 to make some better demand during these holiday periods? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, we \u2013 what we've talked about internally is whether or not we could lobby the government to force that all holidays happen on weekends. Obviously, we can't do that. But we have had kind of a funny year which is July 4, on a Wednesday if I remember right and the... Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Jewish holidays. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: ...Jewish holidays midweek. And it's no surprise that when it's right in the middle of the week you end up with a temptation particularly around July 4th time to maybe take weekends on both sides, but maybe not to do any business travel during that entire week. I think with the Jewish holidays, it's probably the impact on business travel not so much people taking 10-day vacations. We are doing what we can do around leisure promotion, where there are real leisure opportunities. But in some markets, I won't pick on any particular city, but it won't surprise you that in some suburban markets you're not going to find a lot of leisure to replace the business travel that has disappeared. And you're going to end up with \u2013 you're going to do the best you can obviously but you end up with lower occupancy and that has some impact on rate too. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And on buybacks and leverage, does the increase in interest rates and some volatility around RevPAR growth change your approach to buyback as you look to the next year, or is it steady as you go? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Steady as she goes. Just remember one thing and that is that you got to take into consideration asset recycling. And as you know this year, we've had over $600 million of assets recycled. And you can net that against the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Phoenix, but there is call it a net roughly $400 million that we would \u2013 going into the year for 2019 we would not put in any forecast for the numbers. But otherwise I would definitely say steady-as-she-goes. We talked on our last call about how in our conversations with the rating agencies as we looked at the combined business models both as we've moved away from owning the timeshare business as well as with the combination with Starwood that we've got a stronger more sustainable, more cash-rich operating model and with the discussions with the rating agencies talked about broadening our leverage target range. So instead of 3 to 3.25, it's now 3 to 3.5. So I would expect from that standpoint relative to maybe a year ago that we may dance a little bit higher within that range. But it will all still be comfortably in the range that we discussed. And again with the same sort of process that it is before, which is to first make sure that we invest in the growth of our business and do that with great value-added projects, but then with the remainder, return it to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase. Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Hey, Patrick. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Are you seeing any changes to Chinese demand? And also your Chinese \u2013 your pipeline in China from trade wars? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Not yet is the answer. Obviously, it's a question we have been talking about and watching carefully with our Asia team over the last number of months. Obviously the GDP numbers that China have posted \u2013 has posted are modestly lower than what we saw in prior quarters. And you would expect all other things being equal to see that have some impact on hotel demand. But the numbers for Q3 were really very strong in China. Obviously we had some impact from the hurricane that really bore down on Hong Kong most centrally. But what we're seeing is a good steady performance both in terms of intake on new deals on the development pipeline, openings as well as performance of existing hotels. We'll obviously watch this into next year. And we talked about mid-single-digit RevPAR expectations for next year. I don't \u2013 we don't want to get too granular yet because the budgets haven't been done. But I think our expectation is one point or so lower maybe in RevPAR, a point, 1.5 points lower than we're likely to experience in 2018. But still in absolute terms, good year-over-year growth and stronger optimism in China. Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up to one of Anthony's questions earlier. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning. I guess what would be the run rate free cash flow generation this year excluding some of the one-time puts and takes? And are there any kind of other one-time items to think about for next year that may dictate how much free cash flow you will generate relative to EBITDA? Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, with the one I mentioned before Stephen is kind of the most obvious one, which is the asset recycling less \u2013 less what we did on the Phoenix Sheraton. And I think that's really the main one. The one \u2013 the other one that we just continue to keep in mind is that as you know we have committed to spend some of the Avendra dollars that we had in a gain on sale, which we've taken the benefit out from our cash position. And obviously, as we look forward we would continue to expect to invest some of that in our hotel system. I think, we gave guidance this year that expected something like maybe $100 million of Avendra investing this year which is essentially a use of cash within the cash flow. And I would expect something somewhat similar to that in that ballpark next year. But otherwise, cash taxes, I would expect that this year we had a meaningfully higher cash tax bill because of the Avendra gain, which so the cash was received at the end of 2017 and we had higher cash uses for that, because of that and that will obviously be done in 2019, so you will not have that carry forward in 2019. And again, a decent run rate to use for taxes apart from any other oddballs will be the roughly 22% that we've talked about before. We are in the process of doing our budget. So from a standpoint of investment spending we don't have a range yet for you, but obviously when we get to the beginning of the year we will. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for the color. And then, I guess, one unrelated follow-up. You mentioned I think in the remarks a decline in OTA bookings and the strength of direct bookings in North America, but I believe you mentioned that overall you were still flat. Can you just elaborate on what you're seeing in the international markets that may make the effectiveness of some of your direct booking efforts more or less effective? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it's a big world out there obviously and the OTAs from an American lens we think really of Expedia and booking, you look around the world and you see additional OTAs that have sometimes business models that are quite similar to those two and sometimes they're different, but our regional focus and regional strength which is different. And I don't know that I've got any deep insights on your question. There are parts of the world which are more leisure dependent. That's just where OTAs are probably the strongest for obvious reasons. And so look at a market like Thailand for example or Indonesia with Bali. These are markets in which OTAs, whether they be Asian-based or global OTAs are going to tend to deliver business which is more incremental because it is more leisure than elsewhere. I think to some extent there's probably also a difference in the familiarity of our brand names and distribution. Obviously, we've been in the hotel business in the United States the longest with the deepest distribution with really high penetration of our loyalty programs. All of those give us tools to use here in terms of yielding away from these platforms \u2013 expensive platforms on high occupancy with midweek nights which are probably a bit more powerful than they would be in the rest of the world where our presence has been relatively shorter, and our market share is probably a little bit lower. Those will be the things that come to mind, but I don't think they're dramatically different from place-to-place. Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Best of luck in the yearend. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Arne, just following up on the OTA comment from just a moment ago. I think in the prepared remarks you also called out that on the distribution cost front you were \u2013 you saw maybe some changes in mix that could have actually impacted RevPAR growth. Could you elaborate on those comments a little bit? I think you said a few tenths on RevPAR. Was that for the quarter for the year? And just maybe \u2013 again maybe elaborate a little bit on what exactly the initiative is and what may be having that impact? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, we called out two initiatives in the prepared remarks. One is our commission reduction for group intermediaries, which is essentially a United States issue. And the second was our use of a new revenue management platform that really allows us to factor in cost of business as we're making decisions about what business to take. And that piece has really caused us to meaningfully reduce the mid-week contribution that we're taking from OTAs because we are using our revenue management system basically to say, we can fill our hotel with business which is less expensive to us. And it is in the latter context that we said, yeah, it could be a couple of tenths may be of RevPAR impact from yielding that business. We think even though we might be giving up a little bit in the top line, we're if anything growing the bottom line because we are replacing some of the business we would have taken with lower-cost business. And, obviously, if you do that enough, you can afford to give up certainly a modest amount of net business that might have come to us if we hadn't used that revenue management tool. And so that's maybe a couple of tenths in the quarter is what we meant to communicate. I'm not sure if we were clear in the timeframe in that paragraph of the remarks. Still clearly to us it's the right call. And again, I don't \u2013 we're not offering that as a explanation for sort of our macro numbers in the quarter. In the quarter we held our own in RevPAR index, notwithstanding the merger of these loyalty programs and the noise around it, notwithstanding what we've done with group intermediaries, notwithstanding the yielding we're doing with the OTAs. And we're actually very gratified that we continue to post good index numbers even with lots of change that we are very deliberately pursuing across the company. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for that. And then, as my follow-up, maybe just to touch on kind of unit growth side, as you look out to 2019 and beyond. This is not to take anything away from all of the initiatives that you've got and how much work everybody has done in the integration, but I'm curious in the past, you have actually done some smaller kind of tuck-in brand M&A here and there. Is that something that's still on the radar screen for you and how do you kind of think about that as you think about gross unit growth and capital allocation? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, no, we will continue to look at whatever is available in the M&A side. Obviously, it's hard to predict whether anything would happen and we do have our hands full in many respects. But we believe that as an industry, we love and we believe we're just getting started. Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: One of the main motives of your acquisition of Starwood was I believe around kind of their lifestyle brands, which from a room standpoint came with I think Westin, the biggest one and then WN, some smaller ones. And now it seems like lifestyle demand has moved more towards like wellness or wellness features. So do you think you have the right properties for these guests, particularly your platinum members with respect to like wellness and kind of the new lifestyle image? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, I mean, it's good question. I think it's a really interesting place. Obviously lifestyle and luxury and resort all of, we would say, are important growth areas for us, and important features for us to have in our loyalty portfolio. So I don't think we want to say it's only about lifestyle. But we do think that one of the things that motivates regular business travelers who are the folks for whom the loyalty program is most relevant is where can I go when I take my free vacation, if I've earned enough points to get a free vacation. And they are interested in resorts. They're interested in luxury. They're interested in lifestyle. They're interested in breadth of distribution, all of those sorts of things. And by acquiring Starwood we think we meaningfully increased our attractiveness in all of those places. And so I think that reason for pursuing the deal is very much alive and is working very strong. Lifestyle includes \u2013 it means different things to different people. You've just suggested one thing which is maybe a wellness piece of it. I actually think the Westin brand itself. I probably include Element not far behind, but those two are in our view the most meaningful broadly distributed brands that have got a lifestyle focus. And so I think in fact we are quite strong in that space. But I think there are other aspects of lifestyle too which have to do with maybe you'd look at W and say the \u2013 what the liveliness of bar and club and restaurant scene is something that is very strong in that brand and I think is still very attractive to many lifestyle travelers. So while I think the portfolio is great, I think we believe we're in many respects leading in the lifestyle and luxury and resort space and believe it's one of the strengths of our loyalty program. We're certainly not satisfied and will continue to seek more distribution in those spaces. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then unrelated, I don't think there were many companies that announced retirement savings match plans like you guys did at the beginning of the year. And I'm wondering if you're seeing, I guess, lower attrition because of the program, anything that could be quantified going forward in terms of either fewer training fees or better Net Promoter Scores. I know it's early, but just anything that you're seeing as a result of that initiative? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: I love you asking that question. Thank you for that. We do a couple of things. One regularly, I mean, every year we are surveying our associates around the world to try and understand how they feel about their work and our associate satisfaction is at an all-time high, up from last year. We're asking a lot of our people because there's a lot of extra work to pull these two companies together. But I think our people around the world are very motivated to be part of the team. I think they're proud to be working for Marriott. I think they feel good about their careers and that comes through in that survey loud and clear. The second thing we look at and it gets more focused on the supplemental $1,000 401(k) match that we did in the United States is we look at participation among our associates in our retirement plans and that number is about 80% of all eligible associates which is an extraordinarily high number. And tells you that they \u2013 there's always been good participation. It has gone up. I think it's gone up in substantial part, because of what we did with the supplemental 401(k) match. And so, notwithstanding the strike noise we've got in a few markets, we think actually the overwhelming bit of data that we've got about our relationship with our people around the world is very encouraging. Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just one more on the merger integration front. Want to focus, not on the consumer side, but more kind of what are you hearing and seeing from the corporate accounts and then the group travel planners, with respect to their views of the merger? Maybe any concerns they're having about it? And how that may be impacting their booking decisions? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, it's a big community out there and so it's hardly monolithic in its voice. But we have regular dialogue with our big corporate customers as it relates to both group and their transient travelers. We have regular sessions with group planners. Sometimes those are folks in intermediary platforms and often those are folks internally at corporate or association customers. I think overwhelmingly their response has been, not just positive, but enthusiastically positive. They appreciate the breadth of choice. They appreciate the execution that we're bringing to the portfolio of both group boxes of which we are far and away the biggest in the industry. And I think we're hearing from our association and corporate group customers that they love the breadth of choice that we offer within our portfolio. And similarly, I think, we hear from the business transient traveler that they like very much the breadth of choice that we're offering. And so when we see our share of the total travel book of some of our biggest corporate clients, we see that share generally growing and the relationship's generally very robust. Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Good morning. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks a lot. So you mentioned you're seeing \u2013 just a question on loyalty. You mentioned you're seeing an uptick on direct online booking since the unification. Can you give us any sense of where you are on direct online as a percentage of total post-unification? How you see that trending over the next year? Thanks. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. We will continue to see direct digital grow in the next year for certain. I should be careful about saying the words for certain ever. But we have a number of things happening that include a continued organic shift towards all things digital. And so, that's a tailwind which should continue to help us. I think our direct digital \u2013 don't hold me to the precise number, but is nearing 30% of our total business which is coming in through our direct digital channels, which is good healthy year-over-year growth. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up on that and to follow-up on your previous comments on OTAs in the mix. Can you talk about how you see OTAs trending in the fourth quarter, given it's a more transient-heavy quarter? And any update you can give us on your new contract negotiations at the large U.S. OTA? Thanks a lot. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah. I can't give you any particular insight into the fourth quarter. I \u2013 maybe you should know that, but you've stumped me on this. And we'll have to wait and see how the fourth quarter comes in. Maybe you can work on Laura Paugh and she could see whether she has any of this later. We are in negotiations with Expedia. Our contract with Expedia expires I think November 18. Other than to say those two things, there's nothing we can report. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks so much Arne. Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.: Your comment on the overall share of OTAs, I think generally you've seen that their share of overall room nights on the OTAs has gone up about 1% a year over the last several years. And I think the interesting comment that Arne talked about is that in Q3 that share remained flat year-over-year worldwide. So obviously, the work that we're doing in revenue management, we're hopeful that this is helping to encourage all the work we're doing on loyalty, et cetera is encouraging our consumers to book direct. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Hey. I had a big picture question on North America. It seems like 2% has kind of been the number for a few years now and your best guess, the midpoint of next year's range is also 2%. So just curious, there's been narratives of acceleration and deceleration along the way. What do you think you've actually seen in terms of the core trend in the last few years? And then, what would it take to get to the upper end of your 1% to 3% North America next year? What are the pieces that would have to fall in place to actually see domestic accelerate? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean it's a good question. That's why we continue to use this phrase steady-as-she-goes. When you look at all of 2017 and now we've got three quarters of the books \u2013 three quarters of 2018 in the books and one quarter which we've talked about in terms of guidance, there's been pretty little variation over those eight quarters. I think to be fair, if we look at each of those quarters and adjust out holidays and hurricane comps and all those sorts of things, we were in the high 1s, 1.6%, 1.7%, 1.8% in the first three quarters of last year. I think we crested over 2% in the fourth quarter of last year and the first couple of quarters of this year. And it looks like implicit now in a true apples-to-apples comparison, it's probably just a hair under 2% in Q3 and what's implicit in Q4. And so over eight quarters maybe you see the variation of three-tenths or four-tenths, but really that's not very much over an eight-quarter period of time. And you're right, our 2019 sort of view at the moment is kind of more of the same, a midpoint number that feels pretty much like what we've seen over the last eight quarters. What will get it better, I mean, obviously, the better GDP does, the better we will be. That is still the right single correlating measure to look at. I also think we'll see a little bit less supply growth next year. That could be helpful. We could see even within the supply growth some shifting in what markets it shows up in. I suspect we'll see supply growth weaken a bit more in New York than we do in some other markets. And so that could be helpful for New York numbers and maybe to some extent New York is an important market for the industry and for Marriott, so that could be a little bit helpful. I think when we look at the Marriott story as opposed to the industry story, we are really optimistic about the single loyalty program and the way that that can drive us. And the sort of fully stabilized one company that we'll be managing as we get into 2019. So those things should be helpful to us as well. Kathleen Kelly Oberg - Marriott International, Inc.: The only comment I'll add is that, as you look at GDP forecast out there, generally for 2019 versus 2018, they are slightly down. So we're not assuming in these numbers a meaningful acceleration in the U.S. economy, which may or may not be true. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then one other thing, in years past sometimes you've commented on the quarterly cadence growth and I know that I think the Easter shift turns out to be favorable for the first quarter of next year. But maybe just helping investors with the trend line going into the next year domestically, 4Q, you're thinking approximately 1%. Is it just as simple as the hurricane compares get a little bit easier going into next year and that helps get you towards the midpoint of that range? Or how should we think about kind of the... Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yeah, we should be \u2013 it's a good question. We should be careful about saying too much by quarter next year given we haven't done the budget. I did mention that, and part is because of the Easter comparison. But Q1 looks like a good quarter and I think you've got \u2013 we'll have less impact from the hurricane comparable although there'll be some because I think the first quarter of 2018 in Houston, for example, was still quite strong because of relief work and that sort of thing. But group business looks good. The calendar looks good, so I think Q3 should be probably better than average for the quarters next year. But again let's wait until we get the detailed work done before we talk too much about individual quarters for next year. Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your final question is coming from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey good morning. Thanks for staying late, I appreciate it. Arne my first question is on Sheraton. Other than selling assets trying to drive quality through consistency, anything you can point to that shows success and kind of reviving the brand that Starwood spent more than a decade trying to get going? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Well, we're about fair share. The brand is about fair share for the first time in memory as far as I know. We've moved it a few full points since the deal was done. Guest satisfaction figures have moved globally we think by about three points, maybe three to four points. And that is as far as guest data is concerned a massive shift to positive. We're not done with that. We think there's still upside associated with it. I think when we look around the world and see developer partner interest in the brand, we see that strengthening. And we know that we can look at the renovation commitments and schedules for the portfolio as a whole, but particularly on the weaker hotels which we've talked about a bit in the past. And we feel we're making really good progress. I think the last point I'd raise which is a little harder to prove because it's a little bit more about tenor of the conversation, but I mentioned during our prepared remarks we had our U.S. full-service owners together last week here in Washington for our Annual MINA Meeting. And we feel really good alignment with them about where we're taking the Sheraton brand. So all of those things \u2013 this is a multiyear progress challenge to be sure. And we're a long way from being completed, but I think we are proving that we're making steady progress. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. The follow-up and unrelated is on the special corporate negotiated rates, I think you said you were up low single-digits. I don't know if you could put a finer point on that, but I'm sure every year you get pushbacks from the companies you're dealing with. Is the pushback this year any different than it has been in past years? And is special corporate negotiated rates as important as it used to be given that a lot of the economic growth has come from smaller companies? Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: Yes, I think that's a good reminder actually. Laura might be able to tell us or Leeny maybe you know. I think special corporate is more important in the U.S. than any other market, any other big market. There may be some cities in various parts of the world where special corporate is important. And I believe the total special corporate as a percentage of our total business in the U.S. is only about 12% or 13%, something like that. What have we got here Laura? Laura E. Paugh - Marriott International, Inc.: Here's North America. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: 16% in full-service and closer to 20% in limited-service. And so it's relevant, but it's not massive. I think it gets the attention it does because it's negotiated. So it gives us a little bit more predictability on pricing than other transient business that's coming in. I think when you look at the way we've approached this, Starwood was higher with special corporate kind of as a percentage of total business than Marriott was. And that was because they had more special corporate accounts. They went to smaller companies. We've reduced actually compared to what Starwood had some of those special corporate accounts. We'd obviously just as soon have as much of the business traveling public show up and pay in effect rack rate or a non-discounted rate as possible. And so we're not necessarily always looking to expand the special corporate book. Having said that, we've got great corporate customers who expect to have special arrangements and for the right customer we're certainly doing that. Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: You bet. Arne M. Sorenson - Marriott International, Inc.: All right. Thank you all very much for your attention this morning. Get out there and travel. Get out there and vote I suppose first, but then come stay with us. Thanks. Operator : Thank you.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Arne Sorenson, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday, along with our comments today, are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion, we will talk about 2018 results compared to 2017 results, adjusted for merger-related costs and charges, cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses. In addition, the 2017 fourth quarter excludes the Avendra gain and the provisional tax charge resulting from recent tax reform, while the fourth quarter of 2018 excludes adjustments to the provisional tax charge resulting from recent tax reform. Of course, comparisons to our prior year reported GAAP results are in the press release, which you can find along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures on our website. We've accomplished a lot since the acquisition of Starwood in late 2016. We recently unified all 3 loyalty programs into our newly branded program, Marriott Bonvoy. Our operations and disciplined teams are fully in place. We've created significant value through combining sales organizations, improving cost efficiencies and negotiating new co-branded credit card agreements. And we've realized more than $250 million of corporate G&A savings. Today, we truly feel like one company. These integration efforts required extraordinary planning and execution by our team, and I couldn't be prouder of their work. In a transformation this large and all-encompassing, it would be surprising not to encounter some challenges. In late November, we disclosed a data security incident involving the Legacy-Starwood reservation database. Beginning with our public announcement regarding the incident on November 30, we rolled out a broad guest outreach effort. As we address customer issues, the number of calls through our dedicated call centers declined from over 40,000 in December to fewer than 6,000 calls in January and less than 3,000 calls in February. It was encouraging to hear on their earnings call in January, Stephen Squeri, CEO of American Express, note that his firm has seen no appreciable spike in credit card fraud resulting from this incident. Our forensic review of the incident is now complete, and as we said in January, the number of guest records involved is lower than we originally estimated.  We are no longer using the Legacy-Starwood reservation system, and we have implemented additional security measures on the Marriott network. We do not believe there has been any material RevPAR impact from this incident. Our Board of Directors has been very engaged in this matter. All of us remain committed to learn from this experience, work to improve our information security systems and increase our ability to respond quickly to threats. So let's talk about 2018. Membership in Marriott Bonvoy reached nearly 125 million members at year-end 2018, and it remains the largest and most valuable travel program in the hotel business. We have been adding, on average, 1.5 million members per month. Members are highly engaged. In 2018, reward redemptions increased 8% year-over-year and room nights sold to members increased 6%, both reaching record levels. Marriott Bonvoy members contributed roughly half of our room nights in 2018. Our hotels continued to deliver the great service our guests expect. We now offer keyless entry at over 1,400 hotels, and today, mobile check-in and checkout is available at nearly all hotels. Our new Enhanced Reservation System or ERS was rolled out to over 800 hotels as of year-end and should be available at over 2,000 hotels by year-end 2019. ERS allows guests to select rooms based on a variety of room characteristics such as bed type, view, high or low floor and so on, with more photographs and hotel descriptions. Worldwide 2018 full-service RevPAR rose 2.6%, and property-level house profit margins for our company-operated hotels increased 40 basis points despite labor costs rising roughly 4%. We captured cost savings at properties, realized procurement benefits and improved productivity. We reduced the amount of discounting at Legacy-Starwood hotels, and across our system, increased the proportion of bookings coming from our digital channels. In fact, in 2018, our direct digital room nights worldwide increased 11%, reaching 28% of all bookings while OTA share of bookings remained flat. We believe the cost of our loyalty program is the lowest among our competitors in the hotel business while delivering the highest value to guests. While charge-out rate savings from our loyalty program differ by brand, on average, since the Starwood acquisition, the charge-out rate of our overall loyalty program has declined by roughly 50 to 60 basis points, benefiting from integration synergies as well as the new co-brand credit card agreements. Lower loyalty costs should also benefit hotel margins in 2019 since the charge-out rates declined most meaningfully late in 2018. Just over 100 hotels left the Marriott system in 2018, which strengthened our overall system quality. The deletion rate for Legacy-Marriott product totaled 1.3% of total rooms while the rate for Legacy-Starwood product totaled 2.5%. Despite this, we grew our overall rooms distribution by nearly 5% net. By the way, RevPAR index and fees per room of the deleted hotels were, on average, meaningfully lower than the rest of our comparably branded hotels. We expect overall deletions to return to the more normal level of 1% to 1.5% of rooms in 2019, resulting in net system growth of roughly 5.5%. On the development front, we signed agreements for a record 125,000 rooms in 2018, equivalent to nearly 10% of our existing portfolio. Even more important, the net present value of the signed deals also reached record levels. Our pipeline increased for the 26th quarter in a row to reach a record 478,000 rooms, with 214,000 of those rooms already under construction. At year-end, our market share of worldwide open rooms was 7%. Our market share of STR's worldwide under construction pipeline was a leading 20%. In North America, alone, our market share was open room -- of open rooms was 15%, while our market share of STRs under construction pipeline was 36%. We migrated Starwood Hotels to Marriott systems late in the year. In 5 waves from September to December, we shifted 11 brands encompassing roughly 1,500 managed and franchised Starwood Hotels on to Marriott's platforms, including systems for reservations, revenue management and sales and catering. This was a highly complex undertaking involving many people, processes and technology. While further fine-tuning and training is underway, this is a massive step to have behind us. So let's talk about fourth quarter. Marriott's worldwide system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 1.3% on a constant dollar basis and North America RevPAR rose 0.2%. North America system-wide RevPAR growth was impacted by a more robust industry demand environment and by labor strikes. Looking ahead, for the first quarter of 2019, we expect system-wide North America RevPAR will increase 1% to 2%, with the favorable timing of Easter group business is expected to be stronger in March. Encouragingly, North America RevPAR increased 50 basis points in January despite the government shutdown and some lingering impact from the strikes, particularly in Hawaii. For full year 2019, we continue to expect North America system-wide RevPAR will increase 1% to 3%. We expect group business will increase at a low single-digit rate during the year. Special corporate rate negotiations are nearly complete, and rates for comparable customers are also increasing at a low single-digit rate. In 2018, our North America region accounted for 68% of our hotel-based fees. In the Asia Pacific region, constant dollar system-wide RevPAR rose more than 5% in the fourth quarter, consistent with our expectations. RevPAR growth in India and the larger cities in China remained strong, while new supply constrained RevPAR growth on Hainan Island in China and moderating manufacturing demand slowed RevPAR growth in Southern China markets. Food and beverage sales in China were weak, reflecting more cautious corporate spending. On the other hand, outbound China leisure demand remained robust, resulting in strong demand in leisure markets across the Pacific Rim. For the first quarter and full year 2019, we expect RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region will increase at a mid-single-digit rate, with continued strength in India and most major markets in China. Hotels in Japan should benefit from higher attendance for the 35th anniversary of Tokyo Disneyland. In 2018, our Asia Pacific region accounted for 15% of our hotel-based fees. In Europe, fourth quarter RevPAR rose more than 5%, with strong demand from U.S. travelers in London. Centre City Paris hotel demand moderated due to yellow vest political demonstrations and the resulting closed tourist attractions. Barcelona demand was strong, benefiting from easy comparisons to last year's Catalonian political issue. Looking ahead, assuming no business disruption from Brexit, we expect RevPAR in Europe will grow at a mid-single-digit rate, both in the first quarter and full year 2019. Last year, our Europe region represented 9% of our hotel-based fees. RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America region increased nearly 7% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Strong RevPAR growth at resort hotels in the Caribbean, particularly Aruba and Grand Cayman, was helped by the lack of new supply in the region and strong holiday demand. In South America, RevPAR was aided by the G20 meeting and currency devaluations in Argentina and Brazil. We expect first quarter and full year 2019 RevPAR in the region will increase at a low single-digit rate as Caribbean hotels continue to reopen after the 2017 hurricanes. Our CALA region accounted for 4% of our hotel-based fees in 2018. In the Middle East and Africa, fourth quarter RevPAR declined over 5%. RevPAR in Egypt increased sharply in the quarter on strong tourist demand. However, continued sanctions on Qatar and oversupply and the higher VAT in the UAE and Saudi Arabia continued to reduce RevPAR growth for the region, overall. With the challenging political climate in the Middle East, we expect RevPAR in the region will decline at a low single-digit rate in the first quarter and will be flattish for full year 2019. In 2018, MEA accounted for 4% of our hotel-based fees. Beyond things I've already discussed, our 2018 successes on other fronts also give us greater confidence in the future. We'll talk more about these at the analyst meeting later this month. Our Homesharing Pilot in Europe attracted great interest from our loyalty program members and yielded significant learnings. We've made meaningful progress on transforming the Sheraton brand with new designs, higher guest satisfaction and better margins. We rolled out new co-branded credit cards and generated record branding fees. And we exceeded our expected bookings on our new Ritz-Carlton yacht. We believe that all of this, built on a foundation of industry-leading brands and the most powerful loyalty program in travel as well as our long commitment to service excellence, will continue to propel Marriott's success.  With a highly efficient cost structure, we should deliver leading profitability for our owners and franchisees. For all of this, I'd like to thank the Marriott Associates, whose hard work made all of these possible and, of course, to our many guests who have remained loyal and patient through the transition. To tell you more about the quarter, I'd love to turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny? Kathleen Oberg : Thank you, Arne. For the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.44, roughly $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $1.37 to $1.41. On the fee line, we picked up about $0.01 of outperformance, largely due to better-than-expected credit card branding fees and fees from new units. G&A was $0.01 better-than-expected and the tax line yield about $0.03 of outperformance, partially due to discrete tax items. Compared to the prior year, base fees increased 1%. The favorable impact of unit additions and RevPAR growth was largely offset by the impact of properties that converted to franchise as well as hotel deletions during the year. Franchise fees increased 13% in the quarter, reflecting unit growth, including properties converting to franchise, growth in credit card branding fees and higher RevPAR. Nonproperty franchise fees, including application fees, relicensing fees and fees from our timeshare credit card and residential businesses, together, totaled over $140 million in the quarter, 24% higher than the prior year. Credit card branding fees alone increased 44% in the quarter to reach over $100 million for the quarter and $380 million for full year 2018. Incentive fees declined 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, largely due to a $7 million impact from the labor strikes, as well as difficult comparisons in the Middle East and unfavorable foreign exchange. Incentive fees were helped by new unit growth and higher net house profit at most hotels. Owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, totaled $88 million in the fourth quarter compared to $89 million in the year-ago quarter. Since the beginning of 2017 fourth quarter, we've sold 7 owned hotels in nearly all cases retaining long-term management agreements. Compared to the prior year, these asset sales reduced our fourth quarter 2018 owned, leased results by $14 million. Termination fees are also included on the owned, leased line. These fees totaled $15 million in the quarter compared to $4 million in the year-ago quarter. Depreciation and amortization increased to $62 million in the quarter compared to $53 million in the prior year. The increase was largely due to a $7 million favorable adjustment related to Legacy-Starwood IT systems in the 2017 quarter. General and administrative expenses totaled $242 million in the fourth quarter, a 10% decline from the year-ago quarter, largely reflecting continued cost reductions due to the Starwood integration. Partially offsetting these cost savings was a $7 million expense associated with our supplemental investment in the workforce. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 10% over adjusted EBITDA in the prior year. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $12 million from sold hotels. Fourth quarter expenses associated with the data security incident that we disclosed on November 30 totaled $28 million pretax, offset by approximately $25 million of insurance recoveries as of year-end. The net of these amounts is either in reimbursed expenses line or the merger-related costs and charges line. Therefore, these expenses did not impact adjusted EPS or adjusted EBITDA results. The timing of the expenses associated with the data security incident may differ from the timing of the recognition of insurance recoveries. In the fourth quarter, we identified certain immaterial errors related to our accounting for our loyalty program, which resulted in the understatement of cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses, in the first 3 quarters of 2018. Our 10-K, which should be filed later today, will include revised GAAP quarterly amounts, reflecting the corrections of these errors, the impact of which is a $99 million increase to previously reported net income for the first 3 quarters of 2018 combined.  In our 10-K, we will report a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to loyalty program accounting. We remain committed to maintaining effective internal controls or in the process of instituting a remediation plan. These accounting adjustments were limited to the cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses lines on our P&L and the related tax impact. The adjustments are noncash and do not impact our previously reported adjusted EPS or adjusted EBITDA amounts. For full year 2019, we expect fee revenue will increase 5% to 7% to reach $3.83 billion to $3.91 billion. We expect to achieve this despite $15 million to $20 million of unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds, low single-digit growth in incentive fees and lost fees from terminated properties in 2018. We expect credit card branding fees alone will total $410 million to $420 million as a result of continued growth in the number of new cardholders and higher average spend. In 2019, owned, leased and other revenue, net of direct expenses, should total $280 million to $290 million compared to $329 million in 2018. We expect termination fees will be roughly $20 million or $45 million to $50 million lower than 2018. During the first quarter of 2019, we closed on the purchase of the remaining 40% joint venture interest in AC Hotels, resulting in the company owning all of this highly successful and fast-growing global brand.  We entered into our original AC joint venture agreement in 2011. Since then, we've almost tripled the distribution to 265 AC Hotels opened or under development around the world. As a result of our purchase of the remaining interest, our joint venture earnings will be a bit lower in 2019, while fees and G&A will reflect our 100% ownership of the brand. We estimate general and administrative expenses will total $910 million to $920 million in 2019, a 1% to 2% decline from 2018 levels. Recall that full year 2018 G&A included a $51 million expense for our supplemental workforce investment. Because of our outstanding capital recycling in 2018, our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS included $0.65 per share of after-tax gains on the sale of owned and joint venture assets. 2018 results also reflected an effective tax rate of 19%, reflecting the benefit from windfall tax and some discrete items. For full year 2019, we expect adjusted diluted EPS will total $5.87 to $6.10, a 2% to 5% decline from the 2018 adjusted diluted EPS of $6.21, reflecting a more typical effective tax rate of 23% for the year and no further asset sales. To summarize, compared to our adjusted EPS for 2018, our EPS estimate for 2019 assumes higher fees and lower G&A, offset by lower year-over-year termination fees, lower gains, a higher tax rate and higher foreign exchange headwinds. We expect adjusted EBITDA will total roughly $3.62 billion to $3.72 billion, or 4% to 7% over 2018 levels. Our 2019 adjusted EBITDA will also face the headwinds from lower termination fees and foreign exchange. While we are hopeful we will sell additional assets in 2019, our guidance assumes no asset sales and no net expense from the data security incident. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital investment and share repurchase. We returned nearly $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through year-end 2018. This reflected the company's strong operating cash flow, the benefit of $650 million of asset recycling, including joint venture sales of 2 hotels as well as loyalty program cash inflows. Our recent share repurchases have been modestly lower than we expected as we suspended share repurchases for a time while we worked through the data security incident and the loyalty accounting matter. Speaking of the loyalty program, it generated several hundred million dollars of cash in 2018, more than is typical in most years. This was in part due to a large onetime cash payment received from the credit card companies upon signing of our co-branded credit card agreements. In 2019, we expect the loyalty program will likely be closer to cash flow neutral due to the timing of marketing and related costs associated with the launch of Marriott Bonvoy and higher redemptions. 2019 investment spending can total $500 million to $700 million, including about $225 million in maintenance CapEx spending. We've already recycled nearly $1.9 billion of assets since closing the Starwood acquisition, including $650 million in 2018. Thus far in 2019, we have repurchased 2.4 million shares for $300 million. For the full year, assuming no asset sales, we expect we will return at least $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our debt ratio on December 31 was within our targeted credit standard of 3 to 3.5 adjusted debt to combined adjusted EBITDAR. You will recall that our capital allocation strategy is built around our commitment to maintain a solid investment-grade credit rating. We've targeted this rating in recognition of the value of financial flexibility in a cyclical business.  We also strive to maintain the right balance between minimizing our cost of debt and having sufficient leverage to enhance returns. We know you're always eager for more information. We hope you can join us on March 18, 2019, at the New York Marriott Marquis for our Security Analyst Meeting, where we will spend more time looking to our future opportunities. Please be sure to register for the conference with Investor Relations if you'll be coming. [Operator Instructions]. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : I'd like to maybe start with the core SG&A. Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces between everything you're working on in the integration, the new launch of Marriott Bonvoy and some of the other investments that you're making. I think when we do our math and we try and strip out the employee investment, we get something like roughly a 4%, maybe 4% to 4.5% growth rate in SG&A. And just wondering if you could kind of give us some -- a little bit of longer-term view. Is that sort of the right level for the business going forward? Or is that a little bit elevated based on some of these other things you're dealing with, just as we think about the model, long term? Kathleen Oberg : Yes, no, it's a good question and thanks. I think it's one of the reasons we wanted to make sure to mention about the purchase of the AC joint venture. If you think about that going from being our equity line to now being fully consolidated, we're going to be adding between $5 million to $10 million of G&A that comes from moving the geography of that line item into our G&A. So actually, you need to remove a full point of the growth that comes from just that change in and of itself. But certainly, as we think about the long-term growth in G&A, we do continue to think that we will see additional operating leverage in the business as we move forward. And we look forward to talking to you more about it when we talk about our longer-term horizon at the Security Analyst Day. Shaun Kelley : Maybe just a kind of follow-up, more as a clarification then. With the -- are there any sort of onetime expenses or anything that you guys are contemplating from, let's call it, some of the -- whether it's integration carryover and putting some additional property salespeople in to help Starwood owners or anything from the data breach? Just anything investors should be aware of as it relates to the, I guess, the number itself in 2019. Arne Sorenson : Shaun, I'd jump in here for a second. The specific hypotheticals you raised are really not in that number in the sense that the cyber event, which obviously will continue to cost us some dollars, we think, will go mostly in the transaction cost, integration cost and reimbursed expenses buckets and will not be in that core G&A number. And, obviously, what we do with respect to sales force and the like would likely be treated very much the same way. But to be fair, while we are focused very much on making sure we continue to drive efficiencies in the business, we are continuing to invest for the future. And we've got exciting growth taking place across many aspects of the business, and, that does require some investments. I think we will continue to be able to grow our G&A expenses at a meaningfully lower pace than we can grow our top line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : So Arne, can you just talk broadly about the demand environment and what you're seeing right now? I think the last call, you called out some demand softness in September quarter on RevPAR. Obviously, it came in a little bit lighter for various reasons. Can you talk about that, how that's progressed and really so far year-to-date now that we're through, I think, a lot of the government shutdown and some of the onetime things that we experienced in January, maybe you can just talk a little bit about how that's trended. Arne Sorenson : Yes. So there's a lot I could unpack in that, and let me give you at least a superficial run through both fourth quarter and kind of the way we think about 2019. And then, obviously, over the balance of the call, we can probe any of this in more depth to the extent any of you would like us to. Fourth quarter, obviously, think particularly about North America, which is where my comments will focus, unless I sort of specify otherwise. But fourth quarter was lighter than we anticipated, without a doubt. And we have system-wide RevPAR growth of 0.2%. Obviously, we have coped and prodded at those numbers in every way we possibly can to try and glean as much learning out of them as we can. There are a couple of places where it's pretty clear what the impacts are. The first would be on strikes, which we called out in both the script and the release itself. Obviously, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we had strikes in 6 or 8 cities across the United States, including very significant hotels in markets like Boston and San Francisco and Honolulu, but also in a few other markets. And we can very easily zero in on that and see that those hotels alone caused us to lose 0.5 point of RevPAR index in Q4. So it's a pretty significant kind of impact. Obviously, that is, by and large, behind us. It's pretty clearly a onetime event. There's a little bit of lingering impact, particularly in Hawaii, because you do have some impact while the strikes are still pending on the bookings that are coming in for futures stays. But now that they're behind us, that should rebound fairly quickly. On the other side, one thing we think we've reasonably well excluded, we also put in the script, which is the impact of the cyber announcement on November 30. That, too, is a relatively easy thing to look at because you can look at customer behavior after a date certain when an event was announced. And we really did not see any move by customers in response to that. Now beyond that, we've looked at a number of other things, some of them logically seemed to us to probably, perhaps, have had some impact to the fourth quarter. Some -- it's a little hard to sort of separate them out in a way. But we've got -- we talked before about this over 2018. We have been a bit more aggressive in yielding our inventory off of some channels, which are less preferred. And during the fourth quarter, it's quite conceivable that, that could have had some impact, the way it has had in prior quarters. Group intermediation fees, group commission fees, we had moved first, and while many of our principal competitors have moved similarly, we were exposed to having lower commissions for much of 2018. And we think probably in the year, for the year group bookings would have been most pronounced impact in Q4. And lastly, of course, as we mentioned, we had big integration movements in Q4, moving the Starwood Hotels onto Marriott's revenue systems, think about reservations and catering and revenue management. That is a big suite of systems that hotel teams and above-property teams have got to get used to using, which is about training and it's about calibrating the systems and some of those sorts of things, and we can talk about any of that. But it's quite logical that, that could have had some impact there, too. I go through all that in part because I think when we look into 2019, which is, in many respects, the most important question. Ironically, we're maybe as optimistic or maybe even a little bit more optimistic than we were a quarter ago.  A quarter ago, we had not done our budget. A quarter ago, we didn't have the weaker Q4 that we were looking at. And notwithstanding that, we see, really, in the U.S. a sort of steady-state set of expectations for 2019. In fact, if -- we've talked in a few quarters, I don't think last quarter, but a few in the last couple of years. When we look at quarter by quarter, North American RevPAR performance and we adjust for holidays shifting from one quarter to another or hurricanes or inaugurals or the like, what we see is a sort of typical quarterly RevPAR growth in the high 1s, nearly 2%, in 2017 and 2018. And you can see in our midpoint for 2019, we're really looking at 2%. And so we feel pretty good and feel, again, probably just a touch more optimistic than we did a quarter ago. Jared Shojaian : That's really helpful. And then, I guess, just shifting to unit growth. As we look at units beyond 2019, I imagine you'll dig more into this at the Analyst Day. But what's the right way to think about this over the longer term? I guess, really, 2 components, you've got the growth side and you've got the exits. On the growth side, how are you thinking about that 7%? And the pipeline showed another nice sequential increase this quarter. So is it possible that you could go beyond the 7%? And then, I guess, on the exit side, is 1% to 1.5% the right way to think about that over the longer term? Or do you think you have some room to improve on that? Arne Sorenson : So we'll take you through a model of this at the analyst conference and give you a considerable level of detail about it. I think a couple of things are reasonably obvious here. One is, we'll continue to see some deletion behavior. We have obviously been in the business for a long time, and we want to see some number of hotels leave our system every year because of the importance of product quality. We think 1% to 1.5% is probably the right sort of steady-state assumption for now. But again, we'll take you through why that makes sense when we're together in March. In terms of future years' gross new openings, I think the most comforting thing here, I'm not going to give you another percentage other than what we've talked about this morning, is that 478,000-room pipeline is, as of the end of the year, net of all activity, all activity to include the incoming new deals, the openings that have opened into the system in 2018, but also the deals that we have called because they look less likely to open. And all of that, we still have, whatever it was, our 25th straight quarter, I can't remember precisely the number... Kathleen Oberg : 26th. Arne Sorenson : 26th straight quarter of pipeline growth. And we have a high level of predictability that those hotels are going to open into our system over the next number of years. And so I think that, that kind of superficial look tells you there's some good news in that number. But again, we'll take you through the model when we're together in March. Kathleen Oberg : I think the only other thing I'd add is one of the things, I think, we've been particularly gratified by is that as we see these rooms coming on to the pipeline, is the NPV point that Arne mentioned earlier, which is that the value of the deals that we're adding and the strength of the contracts continues to be what we want to see for the long-term growth of cash flow for the company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays. Anthony Powell : You started the call with some very positive data points on customer engagement with the loyalty program. Could you maybe focus that commentary on Legacy-Starwood loyalty members and Legacy-Starwood properties? Are those customers as engaged with the new program as your Legacy-Marriott customers? And are your Starwood properties seeing a similar increase in redemptions? Arne Sorenson : Yes, so that's all a good -- very good question. The -- and again, here too, we'll take you through some of this, and considerably more detail when we're together in March and hope we'll be able to see you there. The level of change, obviously, for the legacy SPG member in the latter part of 2018 was meaningfully higher than for the Legacy-Marriott rewards members. The -- so, obviously, we transferred -- internally, we call it something LD1 and RD1. LD1 is loyalty day 1 and that was really in the latter part of August where we transferred, I don't know, 4 billion, if I remember right, customer records from the Legacy-Starwood system and Legacy-Marriott system. And while it went pretty well, there were some areas where the data did not translate accurately, and we ended up with call volume moving up and some wait time issues that were frustrating and probably disproportionately impacting the SPG members whose data was transferred. And so we've been working through that as we go along. I think the great news in this is even when we hear complaints from SPG customers, and we have some since the amount of change that they've seen, is that they remain extraordinarily passionate about the program, taking almost a co-ownership state to it. Why? Well, partly, it's their tradition and their history, but significantly, it's because of the portfolio of luxury lifestyle and resort properties, which Starwood had and which now we have on a combined basis at a dramatically improved level. And so when we see redemption behavior, when we see engagement behavior with those customers, they continue to see the strength of this portfolio. And again, for those that are frustrated, we're going to work through this and make sure we'd do well by then. But we're still quite optimistic that this is going to work the way we planned it. Anthony Powell : Got it. Do you see any negative RevPAR index impact in the fourth quarter due to some of those changes you mentioned for the Starwood brands? Arne Sorenson : Yes. And again, this is -- these are the efforts we've really done that sort of teased through those numbers. The strike commentary that I made, with 50 basis points impact on the entire portfolio, the Starwood and Marriott combined in North America in the fourth quarter. That disproportionately is driven by Starwood Hotels. They were -- they tended to be much more unionized. And so if you look in Boston and San Francisco and Hawaii and these other markets, you'll see that a meaningful majority of the hotels which were impacted were Starwood Hotels. And so that's one of the things that we start with. We have, on the other hand, looked carefully -- and it's hard to get some of this data, but we've looked at some share of wallet data to the extent we can get it. We've looked out some behavior patterns of SPG members. And while that data is not crystal clear, it is not sending alarm bells off. It does not look like we are sort of bleeding volume from the Legacy SPG member, even if we've got a bit of frustration that we've been working our way through. By the way, it's not all behind us, but much of that is behind us. Call wait times are back to normal levels, they have been for some time. The data issues are getting knocked off one by one and, by and large, are behind us. And so we think we're making good progress there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Bennett Rose : I wanted to follow up just a little bit on your commentary on lifestyle and luxury hotels. You're -- obviously, you're growing at a very fast pace, and folks are going to look to redeem their points. I'm just wondering, in your CapEx guidance and thoughts about adding properties, maybe even more in the soft brand collections, are you more focused on resorts now than you may have otherwise been? Do you feel like that's something you need to improve in your overall portfolio? Or is the balance right where is it now? Arne Sorenson : Well... Kathleen Oberg : I was just going to say -- I'll talk about one thing first and then Arne can talk more broadly. Just from a CapEx standpoint, the numbers that we talked about, $500 million to $700 million, that does not assume any particular single asset purchases or built on balance sheet. Now it does include the CapEx PIP that we're doing for the Sheraton in Phoenix, which as we've talked before, let's call it, in the ballpark of $40 million and that is in our CapEx numbers. But in terms of including a fundamental asset purchase, those are not in our numbers. Arne Sorenson : Yes, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think our pipeline includes something like 400 luxury hotels across the globe. And it is, far and away, the biggest pipeline in the luxury space in the industry. And so we know we've got exciting openings, which are coming down the pike and which will further strengthen our leadership in this space. We obviously want to see those units continue to come into the system. We are overwhelmingly going to depend on our organic growth and organic partners to drive those deals. But we've got a lot of good news, which is baked into the pipeline and coming down the pike. Bennett Rose : And I just wanted to ask you on the international side, you brought down your RevPAR outlook a little bit from your -- from the last quarter. I mean, are you actually seeing slightly weaker numbers? Or are you just sort of being more cautious on the international front, given what we've seen since the last time you reported? Arne Sorenson : I think it's maybe a little bit of both, to be fair. China, as we looked at it over the course of the year in 2018, got weaker with each quarter. That's really not that surprising. I think though as we speak and maybe a part of this is that the China and U.S. seem to have stepped away from the brink recently on the trade -- looming trade war. But the emanations that come out of our team in China and, to some extent, come out of our customers in China feels a bit more optimistic today than it did 30 days ago. And when you look at individual markets in China, you see a story, which is -- has got some hopefulness to it. Hainan, we called out, I think in Hainan, which is Sanya, China, it's sort of China's Florida, if you will, where we must have a couple of dozen, I would guess, full-service and luxury hotels. That is partly supply and partly other factors, which have caused RevPAR to be pretty disappointing, I suppose, in that market. But you look at Beijing and Shanghai and some other key China destinations and they continue to perform pretty well. So while we're a bit more cautious than we would have been at the beginning of 2018, I think we remain pretty optimistic that China will be a positive market for us and continue to present exciting growth opportunities. You go to Europe and we continue to all watch the developments of Brexit. We called out the yellow vest demonstrations in Paris. I think Paris started fourth quarter, and France, as a whole, started fourth quarter very strong. By the time we got into December with the demonstrations and the rest, certainly, it's had an impact on leisure travel. So all of that goes into it, and I think we see some places where we've kind of had specific things that have caused us to be a little bit more modest in our expectations. And to be fair, we've also done the budgeting process over the course of the fourth quarter. So it's not a massive shift as we see it, but it's a bit more conservative. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Charles Scholes : I'm wondering how you think about the mix in growth rates or declines for ADR versus occupancy for North America for this year. Just looking at Smith Travel sort of back of the envelope, it would appear through January and February for you folks, you're negative 1% to maybe negative 1.5% in occupancy. How do you see the rest of the year shaping up in the ADR occupancy mix? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I would guess that it should be nearly 100% rate-driven in -- I'm trying to look and see if I can lay my fingers on our January numbers, which I don't see here. But the -- I think when you look at -- just take our midpoint of 2% for North America, I would guess that, that will be nearly entirely rate-driven. You've got supply continue to grow in the United States at nearly 2%. It might be 1.8% or 1.9%, something like that, but obviously, it means you've got to have demand grow in that range in order to have flat occupancy. And I think that's kind of what we've seen a bit in the last few quarters and probably what we'll see this year. Charles Scholes : Okay. And then a follow-up question. I'd be interested to hear about where you currently stand with your IMF contribution from Asia Pacific and Europe as it relates to overall IMFs, kind of percentage-wise? Kathleen Oberg : Yes, so we typically talk about this as international and North America. So just broadly, as you know, over time, we switched meaningfully from being heavier in North America to being heavier in international. So now actually, you see that we are almost not quite 2/3 from international IMFs. And obviously, Asia Pacific, with its typical contract format, is going to have a big share of those international IMFs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : My question relates to the North American limited-service segment, I guess, for the second quarter in a row, you posted a RevPAR decline. Can you talk about what you think has been going on there? And then as you think about 2019, how that segment performs? Would you expect it to perform outside or below the lower end of your full year '19 range? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I think it's a really good question, Joe. Thank you for that. And if you look at the quarterly RevPAR numbers by brand, which are in our press release, I think it's a way of illustrating your question. Take a look at Courtyard, for example, managed Q4 Courtyard RevPAR was minus 1% RevPAR. And the system-wide Courtyard number was minus 0.2%, which we don't give you the numbers here but obviously implies that the franchise portfolio was probably a bit positive. And the average of those 2 things ends up being just a bit negative. What's driving that? What's happening there? There are probably a couple of different factors. One, to the extent there is supply growth in the United States, that 1.9% or so in the industry, it tends to be concentrated either in this segment or the segment below it. Some of that obviously is our supply growth, but our competitors are attempting to grow in upscale and upper mid-scale as well. So you've got a bit more of a supply dynamic there. And depending on the market, that can be significant that it is in the same segment. I think the second thing that's happening there is -- use those Courtyard's numbers as an example.  The managed Courtyard portfolio of -- it's a couple hundred hotels and change tend to be our gen 1 Courtyards. And so these were mostly opened in the mid- to late '80s. They are rocksolid in terms of the construction and their performance still in absolute terms extraordinarily well. But increasingly, they're finding themselves competing against the hotels, which could be 1/4 of a century younger or so. And we're doing what we can to work with our partners to make sure that those hotels get the kind of capital they need to have in order to compete well against brand-new product or if in that market, it doesn't make sense to do that, that they get, ultimately, that they leave the system. And so we'll continue to work through that. But I think both those factors are driving that. It varies a little bit by brand. Obviously, Courtyard Residence Inn, we've had the longest and would have some of that dynamic. When you look at some of the newer brands like AC and Aloft and the like, we don't have that factor working its way through the system. Joseph Greff : Great. And then Leeny, can you talk about your anticipated recycling plans for this year? Kathleen Oberg : Sure. We're certainly hopeful that we're going to have additional asset sales. As you know, we don't actually have any predictions in the model. As a reminder, we've got 14 hotels that we still own. Seven of them are Legacy-Starwood, including the Sheraton Grand Phoenix. They're generally in the Americas, three down in CALA [indiscernible] North America. And then we've obviously got seven Legacy-Marriott hotels. So the environment for the transaction -- for transactions for hotels continues to be strong. As we've told you before, as we worked our way through the Starwood assets, there were some that were very straightforward in terms of these simple situations. And then we moved into ones that are -- have more complexities, whether it is on the labor front, whether it is from a ground lease, et cetera, or frankly, being in Rio [indiscernible], whether it's economy or actually Mother Nature's events can make for challenging times. So from that perspective, we're hopeful for asset sales this year. Don't have anything in particular to report at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Robin Farley : I wanted to ask about credit card fees, which drove some nice upside. Just thinking about what the long-term growth rate is. I guess, your guidance is for about 10% this year. Is that driven more by spend or by new sign-ups? Just thinking about how much that growth rate would be sustainable once you have the rebranded credit card out there for a while. Kathleen Oberg : So we will talk more about this at the security analyst conference, so I'm only going to talk a little bit about it today, but we will be talking about that then. Generally, it is a combination of both. Obviously, the credit card spend has to do with what's going on in the economy and general consumer appetite for spending on the cobrand cards. And when you have new cardholders sign up, there's a bit of a ramp-up if you think about it as they get up to having a normal amount of cardholder spend. So a little bit similar to a hotel opening. So it really is a combination of both. Robin Farley : Okay. And then I have a follow-up question to the pipeline issue, and I know you'll be talking about that more at the Analyst Day, too. But just looking at your pipeline continues to grow but the absolute numbers of new signings, I think, peaked in 2016, it looks like, from what's in your releases. So I guess, just thinking about the acceleration and unit growth in 2019 that you're guiding to, is that just going to be from comping the higher deletions last year? Is that also helped by -- were there maybe some property openings that just didn't make it by December 31 that kind of end up driving a little bit higher in 2019 opening than what you would think but just kind of thinking about what's the -- again, the sort of the longer-term unit growth there? Kathleen Oberg : So a couple of things going on is remember, in 2016, you were looking at the combination of kind of pre- and post-merger signings. So as you remember, we ended up needing to take a number of those deals out of the pipeline as we moved through '17 and '18 to make sure that we had the right numbers of what we really thought were going to be opening hotels. So from that standpoint, it's not necessarily a perfect comparison. But we definitely do see room openings continue to grow as we move into '19 and '20 with the fact that we've got, as you've heard us talk before, about delays in construction occurring rather than actually those hotels falling out of the pipeline. So I think we do feel good about seeing continued accelerated growth of our gross room openings as we move into '19. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : So I enjoyed watching all the Bonvoy commercials during the Oscars. Can you just -- can you talk a little bit about the strategy behind that campaign and any success metrics you've seen? Arne Sorenson : Yes, that's a good question. I don't know that we've got metrics to give you yet except for eyeballs. And I'm actually less interested in eyeballs than I am in what it does to drive business. Obviously, the name is just out there. I think actually technically, it leaked before we announced it, and you could find some chatter about the Bonvoy name even before the year ended. And we then did announce it, but the sort of public launch, if you will, really coincided with the Oscars last weekend, which is something we've been working to get ready for, for some time. And it's obvious that what's happening here, we've got, most substantively, we are bringing these 2 powerful loyalty programs into one. And no longer will customers have to go through the step of having to transfer points from one program to another in order to redeem in the other program. No longer will they have to think about whether they're meeting their Elite night requirements by getting enough nights concentrated in one program or another. It's now much simpler. It's one number and the breadth of choice for earning and the breadth of choice for redeeming is simple for them to grab. And that's the singularly most powerful piece of what is happening in this space. Now to do that, we've got to make sure that people have a brand handle to call this program by something.  And we, for obvious reasons, decided not to just make it Marriott Rewards and we've decided not to just make it SPG, but we wanted to come up with something which sort of set us up to explore something new and a bit more powerful. And Bonvoy is what came out of that. We had a great deal of fun internally and with a few smart external advisers coming up with that name. And one of the funnest parts of our business, whether it's a new name for a brand, for a hotel chain or a new brand for a loyalty program is just getting together and feeling those words and trying to think about how they inspire and connect with folks. And while there will always be some folks who say, \"Why did you pick that name?,\" I think generally, the response so far has been quite positive, albeit I think a big part of that is just we're glad we're finally at one program and we're really looking forward to using them. We will spend a significant amount of money this year. I can't tell you what it is in dollar terms, but compared to certainly what we've done in years past, we'll spend a significant amount of money promoting the program, getting it out there, making sure people know what it is called and know the value that's associated with it. And of course, that is set up and underway, so excited about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario of Baird. Michael Bellisario : Just back to the topic of market share. I think last year, you mentioned loyalty was over 50% of business. And if I heard you correctly, I think you just said just shy of 50% in '18. Could you maybe help us reconcile that difference in what you're seeing with customer behavior and booking patterns? Arne Sorenson : Yes, we said about 50%. I don't know that I've got exactly the right number in front of me. But the program is doing great, absolutely great in so many respects. By the way, one thing I didn't mention in my earlier remarks, we talked a bit about our loss of share in Q4, the strikes being the most significant reason for that. We're really gratified to see that January, our share was up meaningfully across the combined Marriott and Starwood portfolio. And it's a bit of a caution to all of us that RevPAR index is something that we really ought to look at in a longer-term frame. I think when you look at 2018 as a whole for us, we were up modestly in RevPAR index across both portfolios combined. And we -- if the loyalty program continues to perform the way we anticipate it will perform, we'll see that index number should continue to move and we'll also see that program continues to grow with the system. There are complexities in calculating the percentage of room nights that the program distributes. One of the obvious ones is when you get into a big group house, and we are obviously much more group focused than the industry as a whole, some groups have fairly little penetration in the loyalty space, and that's going to have some impact in those numbers. There are also some technical things about when you have a guest that signs up for a program on their first night stay, do you count that as a program stay or do you not count it as a program stay? But what we're seeing is we're growing the system -- the loyalty system at, at least the same pace that we're growing our room system, if not a bit more. And as a consequence, we think we'll continue to see, at an apples-to-apples basis, increased contribution from the loyalty program to our hotels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Arne, you had mentioned previously some interesting stats about a much more significant number of loyalty point redemptions through a smaller portion of higher-end properties. I guess, how has that played into how you think about driving the loyalty program and positioning the portfolio in the future? And would you see any -- see or sense any kind of capacity constraints if you don't grow in those higher-end properties? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I mean, I think you can almost think of this as a bit of a barbell. You think of this almost as a bit of a barbell. The program is big, obviously, with 125 million members, and think about at 50% of all room nights, how many room nights that is being delivered by members of our loyalty program across the system of over 1.3 million hotel rooms. It is a big program, and not every one of those members is identical. They are, however, all advantaged by greater opportunities through a bigger portfolio to earn points, and they are all advantaged by a bigger portfolio from which to select their redemption options. And for the prototypical road warriors who are collecting significant amounts of points, who may be staying in higher-end hotels where they collect those points, the luxury resort lifestyle portfolio is hugely attractive. But for many, the ability to stay free in a Courtyard hotel in a Midwestern market, which is near family where they're going to spend a week in the summer or where they're going for the holidays and to be able to do that for free is also a huge and really important benefit. And so we saw in 2018 a significant increase, I think, 8% increase in total redemption behavior across both portfolios. And there were meaningful growth rates at both the high end and, if you will, in the select-service hotels as well. Because I think you see that play out. Generally, I think again, the breadth of choice on both earning points and redeeming points is a huge advantage, and we want to make sure we continue to drive that breadth of choice. Stephen Grambling : Great. And one quick follow-up. Are you seeing any difference in sign-ups in the U.S. versus overseas or seeing any kind of change in response to the new program by customer segments? Arne Sorenson : No. I mean, the -- Laura's reminding me that Analyst Day, we will spend a good chunk of time talking about this. Laura Paugh : Otherwise, no one's going to have to come. Arne Sorenson : And we'll have the loyalty team there to give you a bit more granular detail. The -- I don't think so. The Asia, of course, membership is growing quickly as our distribution and prominence in markets like China and India grow substantially. And our partnership with Alibaba is one that we're incredibly grateful for. And we've got strong synergies between their best customers and our best customers and we're doing things together, which are good to drive sign-ups. We are, at the same time, while we're doing about 1.5 million new members a month, we are very much focused on signing up people who think will deliver business to us. It's not simply about how many people can you sign up, because if you're signing up folks who are really not likely to be customers in a way that's even measurable, it's probably not worth a lot of focus in terms of signing them up. So we're running through both those things. I think generally, we were grateful that the pace has actually continued pretty healthy. Obviously, the quarter was noisy with the strikes and with the cyber event, and to continue the growth through that is something we're pretty grateful for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein. David Beckel : Had a -- just wanted to follow up about on your previous comment about how you're feeling more optimistic. You gave some good color there. But more specifically, I guess, from your conversations with corporate partners or corporate travel planners, do you get the sense that there is sort of like a degree of pent-up demand that's just waiting to be unleashed once some of the uncertainty in the marketplace starts to clear up? Arne Sorenson : Remember, I said we're a bit more optimistic than we were a quarter ago, not necessarily that there's a pent-up demand that's about to be released out of the starting gate that dramatically changes things. I do think, and this is, I think, it's probably obvious to all of you. As we approach the end of the year, partly because of trade conversations, partly because of the way the market itself was performing, I think you could feel sort of rising anxiety or maybe even a little bit of pessimism. We've now seen in January and February the market strengthen. We've seen backing away a little bit from some of the trade dynamic. I think we've seen our corporate clients particularly get a little less fearful, a little less anxious. And therefore, in comparison to where we were before, it feels again a bit better. Don't overexaggerate this, but it feels a bit better than it did a quarter ago. And that's what's built into our model. It's -- it is not a wholly different stronger demand environment that we're anticipating but one that we think is steady because we hear from our customers they intend to be on the road and doing the business that they need to do. And we're, of course, happy to have them come and stay with us when they travel. David Beckel : Great, I appreciate that extra color. And my follow-up, just wanted to get a sense for your ongoing negotiation with Expedia. Is there anything you can or want to comment on? Or more specifically, I guess, any deal points beyond just the commission rate structure that have prolonged this negotiation? Arne Sorenson : No, nothing really to say. The teams continue to work and, as far as I can tell, make good progress. So we'll bring you up to speed when the time is right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Wesley Golladay : Just have a quick one on the marketing spend for Bonvoy. Will this be a big increase for the owners? Or will the new credit card agreement fund the majority of the increase? Arne Sorenson : No and yes. I mean, it's -- that second question is a little bit of an oversimplification, but the -- as we mentioned, the charge-out rate for the owners, which is where they contribute to this program, has declined by 50 to 60 basis points, on average, for brands. And that's about 10% roughly, a little bit more than 10% actually of what the total cost of the program was to them. And those dollars plus dollars coming from credit card companies and timeshare companies and others who are partners of the program support the cost of the program, so we end up with the resources to market this new program and promote this new program and actually charge the owners less at the same time. Kathleen Oberg : And we also got integration synergies from putting 2 loyalty programs together. So you've got, in addition to getting more funds from the credit cards, you've also got a more streamlined organizational structure there. And you put that together and as you remember, we were able to increase the benefits for the consumers, for the owners and also for the shareholders. Wesley Golladay : Okay. And then one more quick one. For the Sheraton Grand Phoenix, when will that be completed? Kathleen Oberg : It's underway. I think it's hard to predict exactly when it is. But like most normal PIPs, you could expect that it could take the balance of this year and into next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Just had a follow-up on OTAs. They were stable in the mix in 2018 after increasing in prior years. Given this dynamic has changed, how do you see OTAs trending in the mix now for 2019 going forward? Kathleen Oberg : Well, we'll also talk about that at the security analyst conference, so we won't -- no need to get too far ahead of ourselves. I think again, as you've heard us talk about all the work that we're doing on the loyalty program through Bonvoy, which brings people through us to direct channels as well as the OTA-yielding work that we've been doing, I think it's the first time in several years where that percentage has actually not increased by at least 1 full point. So from that perspective, I think it's indicative of the relationship with our customers that we have. And we'll obviously look forward to continuing to do as much as we can to have our consumers book directly with us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research Company. Vince Ciepiel : Hearing some mixed things from owners out there. Some would point to integration issues related to this deal. You have others call out margin benefits from reduced travel agency commissions. So when you roll it all up, I mean, what are you hearing from owners today? And how has that feedback evolved in the last 12 months? And I guess, what are you hoping to hear a year from now as they look back on this deal? Arne Sorenson : That's a really good question. It's obviously a really important area of focus for us. And as you all know, in many respects, our business model has 2 sets of customers, the customers we think of first obviously are the folks who check into our hotels or who hold their meetings there or who come and take advantage of our food and beverage facilities. But the other customer is very much our owners. They are folks who are investing capital in our system or have invested substantial amounts of capital in our system. And they are keenly interested in how the top line and bottom line performance of their hotels is driven by our behavior. And obviously, one of those recent events is how does the bringing together of Marriott and Starwood impact that. I think generally, our community would say that we have steadily been delivering cost synergies to them. We've talked this morning about the cost of the rewards program and how that's been improved. But there are other areas in procurement and systems and shared services and other things we're doing that, some of which we could do right out of the gate and some of which take a little bit longer, but they have been steadily implemented since we closed the transaction in the fall of 2016. They also, however, want to make sure we're delivering top line growth because if we can do both things, it is a huge advantage for them and ultimately for us because we're that much more attractive to compete for their capital in the years ahead. And I think to be fair, we have -- and again, this is another thing that we will look at when we look at the RevPAR performance of the Legacy-Starwood hotels when we're together in March. And there's some news there already, but the biggest news is really driven by the final merging of these loyalty programs now into Marriott Bonvoy. That, we think, is the tool that is going to drive most powerful results with our frequent travelers. And we want to be able to prove to them that we are driving the top line through that vehicle. And again, if we can do both those things, it's going to be a home run. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the fee guide. If I just do a simple linear addition of the 5.5 units on the 1% to 3% RevPAR guide, and then when you consider that the credit card bump sounds like it should more than offset FX, what is -- is there conservatism in the 5% to 7%? Or is there anything going on with non-hotel fees that offsets that, that addition? Or is it just where we are in the cycle and where incentive fees grows? Just trying to better understand the 5% to 7%. Kathleen Oberg : Sure. So a couple of things. One, I would definitely say I would look at IMFs. We've talked about IMFs as being low single digits in 2019, and that is a function of, as you've mentioned, part of it's FX but part of it is the reality that we've got little bit lower growth expectations in Asia Pacific than we had a year ago and when you think about RevPAR year-over-year between those 2 years in that continent. And then also, you've got the reality of the strikes. And that is as you move into January, while we're seeing recovery, you still had a bunch of wholesale bookings that when they were looking at booking into Q1, it was difficult to know. And so we're going to pay a little bit of a price in 2019 from that as well. So that's part of it. Then you've also got the impact of terminated hotels. If you remember, we actually ended up with a little bit below 5% growth rate in '18, and much of that then falls into '19 in terms of the growth. And then last but not least, we've talked about the reality that with higher labor costs, that's going to have a bit of an impact on your margins for your IMF-earning hotels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Instinet. Kathleen Oberg : I'm sorry. I've got one more to add to the last point and that is that residential branding fees, we do expect they're a little bit lumpy, and we actually do expect them to go down a bit next year, which is just a function of the timing of the sales of the units. Sorry, I interrupted. Harry Curtis : Can you hear me? Kathleen Oberg : Yes. Harry Curtis : Very good, okay. Just a quick question on the restoration of the Sheraton brand. It would appear that you have roughly 90,000 Sheraton rooms. And what will that number probably contract to once you're done purging the system and how long will that take? And then the second question is looking ahead, what's the brand -- is the brand going to be an engine for growth? And how will you change the image? And what segment will it fit in as well as is it going to be more of an international brand, a U.S. brand or both? Arne Sorenson : All right, all good questions, Harry. The -- we are making great progress with this. I don't have it by rooms but I have it by hotels. I don't -- I would guess that these -- there's no reason these hotel sizes shouldn't be about average. But -- so they should be translatable into rooms. We have done -- basically, we figure about 150 of the Sheratons, we have either fixed or the fixes are underway in terms of renovation behavior. And fixed includes getting rid of about 25 Sheraton hotels. So of the 150, about 25 left and about 125 are renovation is underway or about to be underway very quickly. When we look at sort of the portfolio, we've got -- I'm looking at a -- let's see, what is this, I'm trying to do the math in my head here, it's about 450 hotels in total. A little less than 200 in the U.S. or North America and about 250 internationally. About 75% of the rooms product and public space product when looked at separately are on track to meet standards. Now that includes hotels where renovation is not underway yet but where renovation has been committed to or where the work has already been done.  So that -- it's leaving about 1/4 of the portfolio, which we're still working on out of 450 hotels, that's 100-ish or 110, something like that. And so we're -- we've got these numbers on the run, and I think we're going to find that when we're looking back at this a few years from now, we'll see that there was massive capital that went into this and the average product quality of the Sheraton portfolio is meaningfully better than when we took it on. We are continuing to grow the brand even as we speak. Your question hints at this a little bit. It is probably stronger in Asia, and therefore, the pipeline's a bit stronger in Asia than it is in the rest of the world. But as we strengthen the product -- average product quality and guest service scores, which is already happening too in a material way, we'll see that the demand from our development partners for Sheraton increases as well. So we're feeling really quite good about it. Harry Curtis : So following up on that, the Sheraton brand identification is very high with customers. So do you go on a campaign to reintroduce this? Are you gaining traction with developers? Arne Sorenson : Well, the answer to both of those questions, I think, is yes. I mean, I think in different markets of the world, the need to prove progress is a little bit more important in terms of the development pipeline. But I think as customers see and experience improved quality in the portfolio, and as we get to a place where we've got more of it actually delivered, we will ramp up the sort of PR relaunch of the brand. A little bit dangerous to do it simply based on committed renovations as opposed to renovations that are completed and can't be seen by the customers. Laura Paugh : Yes, and we'll talk more about it at the analyst meeting undoubtedly. Operator : Your final question today will come from the line of David Katz of Jefferies. David Katz : What we've learned over the years is that every cycle is different. What we have seen in other cycles, and it doesn't necessarily play out this way, is a sort of a plethora of brands entering the system or entering the mix. You obviously have a lot and we've seen others launching quite a few brands. What are you seeing? Or are there any concerns that you would help us alleviate or highlight for us in terms of just the population of brands, which seems to be growing quite quickly? Arne Sorenson : Yes, it's a good question. The -- I think I would focus -- I'd encourage you to focus maybe less on the number of brands being launched than on the supply growth itself. And we have talked about this before. But I don't know of a turndown in the lodging business, which has been caused by supply. They may be exacerbated, to some extent, by supply and a bit depending on what that supply dynamic is. But in every instance in my 22 years, it has been driven by a demand -- a weakening in the demand side of the equation. And that is really about GDP broadly. You can look at other measures, which correlate with GDP but it really is about how is the economy doing. And that's the principle thing, I think, I would be focused on to the extent you think about the cycle here. The number of brands is less important than supply growth. Supply growth, we've talked about before, is at average levels. We've not seen the kind of peak supply that we did in the last two growth cycles, which maybe means that to the extent we get a weakening demand environment, it might not be as bad. I suppose it's what we've seen before. But again, I would still be focused on demand. The only last thing I'd say about brands as opposed to supply in terms of rooms or hotels, and of course, you'll recognize that we've got a bias in here being an owner of 30 brands that are competing in this space. But the brand that is most important is Marriott Bonvoy because that's what binds our relationship with our customers across the entire portfolio. Now each brand hopefully says something. It's got a product definition, it's got a service definition and it schools expectations of our customers in a way that obviously, hopefully, we meet but lets them sort of understand something about what they're booking within our portfolio. But it's that Bonvoy umbrella branding, which is the most important thing. And I actually think if we had 35 as opposed to 30, it wouldn't be a meaningfully different story. By the way, we're not announcing the launch of 5 new brands this morning or even inviting you to think that, that's coming down the pike. But again, the portfolio branding is clearly the most important thing, and the more we've got choice within that or from a geographic price point and design sensibility, the better off we are. Thank you, everybody, for your time and interest this morning. We appreciate very much your hanging with us. And of course, we look forward to welcoming you to our hotels as you travel. See you in March. Operator : Thank you for participating in the Marriott International Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to Marriott International's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in the listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Arne Sorenson : Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. First let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued earlier today, along with our comments are effective only today May 10, 2019, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs and reimbursement revenues and related expenses. GAAP results appear on Page A1 of the earnings release, but our remarks today will largely refer to the adjusted results that appear on the non-GAAP reconciliation pages. Of course, you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our Web site. Before proceeding to talk about our results, let me take a minute to talk about the announcement we made last week about my cancer diagnosis. As we mentioned, I have Stage 2 pancreatic cancer. Thankfully, the medical team at Johns Hopkins has seen this many times before. They believe we have caught it early, that it is operable, and that the course of treatment is proven. I'm grateful for all the messages of support from the investment community as well as from Marriott's community of associates and business partners around the world. With the support of an extraordinary strong team of Marriott executives, we are going to soldier on. Now, last month, we opened our 7000 property, the 27 storey St. Regis Hong Kong. After opening this landmark hotel, our development pipeline at quarter-end totaled roughly 475,000 rooms compared to 463,000 rooms at the end of the first quarter 2018. Gross room openings totaled nearly 19,000 rooms in the first quarter compared to 15,000 rooms in the year-ago quarter. Net room openings were almost double from the number from the prior year. Almost 216,000 rooms in our pipeline or 45% are already under construction, the largest number of under construction rooms in our industry. At our current pace of openings, our under construction pipeline represents the equivalent of 2.5 years of embedded gross rooms growth. The remainder of our pipeline represents another 2.5 years of growth. Our legacy Starwood brands account for roughly 30% of our development pipeline. Among our 17 luxury and upper upscale brands, the rooms pipeline for the Sheraton brand is second only in size to the Marriott brand. In the first quarter of 2019, we opened four new Sheraton Hotels and signed three new Sheraton deals, including the new built 250-room Sheraton Hotel in Bradenton, Florida. More than a quarter of Sheraton's existing portfolio is under or has committed to renovation. Our limited service brands are growing rapidly. Globally, our limited service pipeline, largely upscale brands, includes more than 285,000 rooms, nearly 2.5 times the number of pipeline rooms in those brands five years ago. Outside North America, our limited-service pipeline is now nearly 3.5 times its size in 2014. We are growing these brands in markets around the world with a variety of approaches from modular construction to urban high rises to multi-brand hotel complexes. We are developing new prototype designs for Fairfield Inn and TownePlace suites to better suit smaller markets, and we continue to add development talent to make these deals happen, because the growth opportunity is meaningful. We see evidence that owners and franchisees prefer our brands. According to STR, more than one in three rooms that are under construction in the U.S. today will fly one of our flags. And while our existing distribution globally is more modest, still one in five hotels under construction globally will be flagged with the Marriott Brand. We continue to expect to see net rooms growth total approximately 5.5% in 2019 with rooms deletions of about 1% to 1.5%. We deleted 3000 rooms in the first quarter of 2019. I visited several markets in China in late March. The big news there is Marriott Bonvoy and Alibaba. Less than two years ago, we formed a new joint venture with Alibaba to improve service and sales for Chinese guests. In the first quarter of 2019, property revenue from our newly designed Alibaba channel more than tripled year-over-year, while the level of new Marriott Bonvoy enrollments in China doubled over the prior year quarter. We are excited to welcome these new members to our hotels around the world. Marriott Bonvoy offers guests the largest and most compelling collection of hotels and experiences. At the end of the first quarter, membership in Marriott Bonvoy reached nearly 130 million worldwide, up roughly 5 million from year-end 2018. Approximately 40% of the new sign-ups came from China. Worldwide, loyalty redemption revenue at our hotels rose at a double-digit rate in the first quarter. We recently announced our home rental initiative. In a survey we conducted in 2018, we found that over one quarter of our loyalty program members who responded had used home rentals in the prior 12 months. During our home rental pilot in 2018, which was available in a few European cities, nearly 90% of our guests were Marriott Bonvoy members, and over 80% were traveling for leisure. The average length of stay in our pilot was more than triple that for the typical hotel guest. With a successful European pilot, we decided to launch homes and villas by Marriott International, offering guests access to a growing number of premium and luxury homes and villas in over 100 destinations across the U.S., Europe, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Our commitment to providing travelers with full residencies, including kitchens and other amenities guided our selection of homes. Our desire to complement our core hotel offerings similarly influenced our selection of markets. We will work with select property management companies who are already managing these homes, and estimate roughly 40% of these markets we are launching in are new to Marriott. We believe our highly curated home rental product fully integrated into our loyalty program for earning and redeeming points will enhance Marriott Bonvoy member travel experiences and increase the value of our loyalty program. Home rental should enable our loyalty members to stay with Marriott throughout any travel experience, allow us to leverage our strong brands and expertise in an evolving competitive landscape, and ultimately drive a greater share of wallet for our portfolio. In April, we signed a new multi-year agreement with Expedia, which should enhance our leisure packaging platform Vacations by Marriott, and leverage Expedia's technology for a new business opportunity to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the changes in the agreement, we expect our owners and franchisees will see improved overall economics from the relationship. In the first quarter, worldwide house profit for comparable company-operated hotels increased an impressive 1.6%. While the integration is largely complete, our hotels continue to benefit from synergies associated with the Starwood merger. On the revenue side, we reduced discounting at Legacy Starwood Hotels in the first quarter and across our system increased the proportion of bookings coming from our digital channels. Direct digital revenue bookings at our hotels globally increased over 20% in the quarter, and now represent over 30% of room nights. Revenues booked on our mobile app increased more than 70% year-over-year. While our revenues booked on OTS worldwide declined 4% yielding OTA business helped hotel profitability, even as it likely depressed our first quarter by RevPAR growth by a few tenths of a percentage points. Our global RevPAR index rose 100 basis points in the quarter. Let's talk briefly about the region's, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR in our Asia Pacific region increased 3% in the quarter. RevPAR growth was strong in India, Japan, Indonesia, and in the major markets in Greater China, but was somewhat offset by weaker results in South Korea, Thailand, and the Hainan Island market in China. In the second quarter, we expect mid-single digit RevPAR growth in the region with fewer headwinds from South Korea and Hainan Island. Future RevPAR performance will depend somewhat on the economic impact of ongoing U.S., China trade negotiations, particularly in markets that rely on manufacturing. While we await the outcome of those negotiations, our forecast assumes Asia Pacific RevPAR will increase at a mid-single digit rate for the full-year 2019. In the Middle Eastern Africa, systemwide constant dollar RevPAR declined 4% year-over-year. RevPAR growth in the UAE declined 8% on flat demand and supply growth in Dubai increased by 11%. At the same time, RevPAR in Cairo and the Red Sea resorts rose sharply on strong Eastern European demand. For the second quarter, we expect EMEA RevPAR will again decline albeit less significantly than in the first quarter. Significant supply growth in Dubai is likely to persist, but we should see stronger demand in the holy cities in Saudi Arabia. Ramadan started May 6th, 10 days earlier than last year, which should push some business travel in the region from second quarter to later in the year. For the full-year, we expect RevPAR will decline at a low single digit rate in the EMEA region. In Europe systemwide constant dollar RevPAR rose 2% in the first quarter, U.S. traveled to many markets in Europe with strong with considerable numbers of loyalty redemptions, RevPAR in London increased by 4% year-over-year. At the same time, Brexit uncertainty kept many U.K. travelers at home constraining growth in many warm weather European destinations. Travelers avoided Central City Paris, due to the continued yellow vest demonstrations with a Ben Ali in Venice beginning this month and strong U.S. demand expected to continue in most markets. We believe RevPAR in Europe will increase at a mid-single digit rate in the second quarter, and for the full-year. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased nearly 4% in the quarter. In the Caribbean RevPAR rose 8% on strong demand, as several U.S. Airlines increased lift the islands. RevPAR growth in Brazil was very strong on record demand during Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. While continued travel warnings took RevPAR and Mexico down 3%. Looking ahead, we expect RevPAR growth and Kayla will moderate a bit increasing at a low single digit rate in the second quarter and full-year as competitor hotels reopen in the Caribbean. System-wide RevPAR in North America rose nearly 1% in the first quarter. RevPAR was constrained by the partial federal government shutdown in January. Tough comparisons to hurricane recovery in Florida and Houston and the lingering impact from the fourth quarter labor strike NOI. Excluding these factors, we estimate our system-wide RevPAR growth would have been roughly 70 basis points better than the reported number, our RevPAR index in the U.S. increased nearly a 100 basis points in the first quarter. Group RevPAR across North America increased 3% on strong city-wide demand in Atlanta and San Francisco and the favorable impact of the timing of Easter. While Easter timing will present a headwind for group business in the second quarter, the negative hurricane and government shutdown impact should be behind us. Our group revenue booking pays for the full-year 2019 is flat. New bookings for 2019 increased in the first quarter and surged in April. So we expect Group RevPAR will be higher for the year. First Quarter Transient RevPAR from our largest 300 corporate accounts in North America, Rose 3% but overall transit RevPAR was flattish in the first quarter, largely due to weak demand in March. Given as we expect North American RevPAR will increase by 1% to 2% in the second quarter and 1% to 3% for the full-year. Marriott is a dynamic company. We created a powerful lodging portfolio, managing and franchising across the highest value tiers. With the Starwood acquisition, we recognized that we are in a unique position truly sophisticated frequent travelers with an unparalleled loyalty program and a wide range of travel experiences. The more our guests are engaged in our loyalty program, the more profitable business opportunities we can pursue even outside the traditional lodging space such as credit card and residential branding. This year we expect to earn $440 million to $450 million in credit card and residential branding fees. Incidentally credit card sign ups rose 20% in the first quarter year-over-year. In addition, unit additions and RevPAR growth such opportunities should drive higher returns to our shareholders, even as we retain our asset light approach to business. Before turning the call over to Leeny Oberg, let me take a moment to recognize our extraordinary Investor Relations leader, Laura Paugh. We announced this morning that Laura will retire from Marriott at year-end. Laura Paugh in nearly 40 years at Marriott have literally included our entire history of modern day Investor Relations. When she began Marriott like many other companies did not even do quarterly earnings calls, such as this one. She has not only built this discipline for us, she has been recognized by you as one of the best investor relations professionals in the entire public company universe. Not just the hospitality space. She has been a partner, a mentor, and a friend to me for over 20 years of involvement in Investor Relations. All of us are grateful for her service and expertise. Thank you, Laura. Now, for some more thoughts about first quarter performance and our outlook, let me turn things over to Leeny. Kathleen Oberg : Thank you, Arne. I too would like to express my deep appreciation for Laura's countless contributions and dedication to our Company. Her strategic insights and determination to get the right answers have no doubt contributed meaningfully to our shareholder value over the years. Well, I will personally miss her a great deal. I know you will all join me in wishing her very happy retirement and celebrating her accomplishments during the rest of this year. Now, onto the results, for the first quarter of 2019, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled a $1.41 compared to $1.34 in the year ago quarter. This was $0.08 over the midpoint of our guidance of $1.30 to $1.35 largely due to better than expected windfall tax benefits and other favorable discrete items on the tax line. Recall that in the prior year quarter adjusted EPS included $0.11 from gains on hotel sales. Gross fee revenues totaled $895 million or 6% increase year-over-year, largely due to unit growth and higher incentive fees and credit card branding fees. Incentive fees increased 5% with good margin performance and strength at our Florida and California resorts during their strong season. Credit card fees alone totaled $93 million, up 8% while other non-property fees totaled $39 million. With the stronger US dollar, first quarter fee revenue reflected nearly $7 million of year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange net of hedges. Owned leased and other revenue, net of expenses totaled $15 million in the first quarter, a $20 million decline from the prior year due to $21 million of lower termination fees. General and administrative expenses totaled $222 million compared to $247 million in the prior year quarter. G&A in the first quarter of 2018 included a $35 million expense for supplementary retirement savings plan contribution. First quarter adjusted EBITDA rose 7% year-over-year to $821 million, consistent with our 6% to 10% growth guidance, while not included in adjusted EBITDA, expenses associated with last year's data security incident totaled $44 million in the first quarter netted against $46 million of insurance recoveries. We expect gross fee revenue for the second quarter will total $990 million to $1.01 billion, a 4% to 6% increase over the prior year. Our second quarter fee revenue estimate assumes higher credit card branding fees but modestly lower incentive fees due to property renovations and unfavorable foreign exchange. We expect owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total roughly $80 million in the second quarter while G&A should be $225 million to $230 million. Our guidance assumes no further asset sales in 2019 beyond those that have already been completed. These assumptions yield a $1.50 to $1.58 diluted earnings per share for the second quarter. Recall that the second quarter last year included $0.26 in gains from the sale of hotels. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter should total $940 million to $965 million flat to up 3% over the prior year. For the full-year 2019, we believe gross fee revenue could increase 6% to 8% over the prior year with about $15 million over our last guidance due to stronger expected incentive fees. We believe incentive fees will increase at a mid-single digit rate for the year and continue to expect our credit card and residential branding fees will total $440 million to 450 million in 2019. Last year our gross fees were constrained by strikes in several markets in the fourth quarter. Owned leased and other revenue, net of direct expense, should total roughly $285 million to $295 million for the year, roughly $40 million decline year-over-year. Termination fees totaled $69 million in 2018 and we expect such fees will $25 million to $30 million in 2019 a bit improved from our prior forecast for this year. Results from our Marriott homes and villas business will be included in the owned leased and other line, and are expected to be immaterial. G&A should total $920 million to $930 million for 2019, about $10 million higher than our last estimate due to higher bad debt expense in admin spending. These assumptions yield $5.97 to $6.19 diluted earnings per share for 2019. Recall that the prior year included $0.65 in gains from the sale of owned and joint venture assets. Adjusted EBITDA should totaled $3.615 billion to $3.715 billion 47% over 2018, adjusted EBITDA and estimate that is unchanged from last quarter. As we discussed last quarter, our 2019 guidance does not include merger related costs and the timing impact of reimbursed revenues and expenses. Investment spending for the year could total $600 million to $800 million including roughly $225 million of maintenance spending. The remainder includes capital expenditures, loan advances, equity investments and contract investments. Roughly a quarter of our total investment spending relates to systems initiatives that should be reimbursed over time. We repurchased nearly 8 million shares from January 1 through May 8 for nearly $1.2 billion and continue to expect to return at least $3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2019. This assumes no further asset sales during the year. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At March 31, our debt ratio was within our targeted credit standard of 3 to 3.5 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR. We have modeled our 2019 income statement and cash flow forecast at a 3.3 times target. Now, Laura, would like to add a few remarks. Laura Paugh : Thanks, Leeny, and thanks for all the kind things both you and Arne have said. I have to say that the best part of my job at Investor Relations at Marriott is working with some very talented colleagues. IR is a team effort not only including the gifted [indiscernible] but many, many people throughout the organization, including the broad senior management team. When we talk about the collaborative nature of Marriott culture it is not a story. We have a very good time in IR. As I think you can tell we laugh a lot. We love working with Arne and Leeny they are just the smart forthcoming and engaged as they seen. The other best part of my job in IR is working with all of you. I'm always happiest when the phone rings and you want to talk about Marriott, our competitors the OTAs the economy or your summer vacations and many years I've done IR. I've seen the market move from unreasonable exuberance to irrational despair and back, I know you face meaningful pressure to deliver result, and I hope I have helped as you have evaluated the company. I will be here through the end of the year and look forward to seeing many of you in person at conferences and meetings in the next few months. So let's answer your questions. So we can speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one followup if that's possible. We will take your questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Katz of Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, afternoon, everyone. Arne Sorenson : Hey, David. Kathleen Oberg : Good afternoon. David Katz : I have to admit I had probably four or five questions in my head, and I am struggling to remember any of them. I just wanted to wish all of you the best, but what I did want to talk about is we have started get into a range where just industry wide some of the metrics have started to be a bit choppy. And yet, the cash generation remains powerfully strong. If we were to paint a scenario, and I don't think you got quite this draconian at your analyst meeting, but if we were just start to talk about RevPAR that was down, call it 2% to 5%, have you sort of penciled out what the cash would like, and how your decision process would be altered under those kinds of circumstances? And I am again not calling or wishing for it, just thinking out loud. Arne Sorenson : Yes, I think \u2013 Lenny can jump in here. I think the best place for you to refer in terms of the financial model is to what we shared with you at the investor relations meeting, and you can do some of your own calibration of that and make some assumptions and probably be fairly close. We don't have a model other than that one that we shared with you then. And I guess I would just say thematically that while March was a disappointing month in many respects, it is to us not a harbinger of a predictably different environment than the one that we have been going through the last few quarters. So, thematically today, I think we would say it's steady as she goes for the next few quarters. We continue to see that when adjust for hurricanes and strikes and holidays and the like that we are poking along broadly between -- broadly around 1.5% sort of RevPAR growth. We might have been a tenth or two shy of that in first quarter 2019. But there is some good news too. We talked about good April bookings for example in group, a very strong performance for us for the month. And so, while you should do whatever modeling you think is appropriate and make whatever forecast you think is appropriate, I think our caution to all of us would be let's just expect for now that we are going to keep going at sort of the pace we have been going over the last few quarters. Kathleen Oberg : The only thing I'll add David is -- and we did do a model that actually did assume a 5% decline in RevPAR as part of what we talked about at the security analyst meeting. And I'll point out a couple of things, one, we are obviously far less dependent on your classic North American incentive fees when you look at both our growth internationally as well as the credit card fees. And then second of all, I\u2019ll talk that even in the great recession, we ended up with the lowest year being 3% growth in net rooms. And so, when you continue to see that sturdy strong rooms growth and a clearly less volatile franchise and management fee stream, I think it bodes well for really strong cash generation if we were looking at a recession. David Katz : Great. And my one follow-up literally is you made reference to bad debt expense, which I just looking back quickly I am not sure that we have seen that in some of the prior quarters. What's in there? Kathleen Oberg : For sure. That's part of G&A, and that's obviously when you end up with let's say a terminated hotel that is part of what happens. You end up not getting all of your reimbursed costs back. It is in the G&A line. It can be a little bit lumpy. It's a really small number. But then obviously as we have said this year for our G&A as part of the increase in the overall G&A that we forecast for the company, about $5 million of that is from bad debt. That's related to a few international hotel situations in Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. That's I think is the easiest way to describe is one-off situations. But as you might imagine, the bad debt number for the company overall is way immaterial. David Katz : Understood. Thank you, and again, all the best. Arne Sorenson : Thank you. Kathleen Oberg : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I would like to yes, say my best wishes to you Arne on a speedy recovery, and congratulations to Laura on what's been an incredible career. So my question will be just going over to the RevPAR performance that you saw on the quarter, I think as we look through the metrics that you provide, the numbers that standout to us were -- we look through the legacy Starwood brands. I think most of those at least on the full-service side seem to under-perform some of the chain scale averages and some of the performances that we saw in the Marriott legacy brands. I know these numbers bounce around, and we always want to pick at little patterns. But, could you just elaborate a little bit on that? And I think, Arne, in your prepared remarks you may have mentioned something about a reduction of discounting, so did that drive some of that RevPAR performance, or what should we expect going forward as you continue your integration path? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I think there are a few different factors that are going into this. But it\u2019s a perfectly fair question. And one of the things, I think, we start with here is geographic distribution. So if you look at Smith Travel industry wide numbers for Q1, you see a 4 point difference in RevPAR performance between the top 25 markets and all others. Top 25 markets in the U.S. according to Smith Travel were down roughly 1% -- one full percent in RevPAR. The other markets were up 3%. So you've got a 4 point difference in RevPAR performance between those markets. Obviously, that's industry as a whole. That's not Marriott's portfolio uniquely. And I think when you look at Marriott in its entirety compared to some others in the industry or when you look at some of the Starwood brands compared to some of the Marriott brands, I think you will find that we are much more concentrated in the top 25 markets, and that is inevitably part of this. When we look at Marriott brand's legacy versus Starwood brand's legacy, we can see a couple of other things that are happening. One is the strike carryover in Hawaii, particularly where our bookings are a little bit longer window. First quarter was continued -- they had some strike impact even though strikes were done that is disproportionately impacting the Starwood Hotels. I think the second would be around OTAs, and we called out in the prepared remarks that OTA business is down 4% for the combined portfolio in Q1. Interestingly, the Starwood Hotels were about 10 points more reliant on OTA's list than the Marriott Hotels were. And as we have gone to one reservation system and once our unified revenue management strategy, the shift if you will from reliance on those third party OTA is to international digital channels probably cost a little bit. We thought it's maybe few tens of a point for the portfolio as a whole. The impacts are is probably a bit more disproportionate on the Starwood Hotels. And there are some changes on other discounting. Starwood had some deeper discount packaging that Marriott did not have. That's probably had an impact in it. But you roll all those things together, those are probably the principle drivers of the difference in the averages beneath of course the portfolio as a whole you will individual stories with individual assets. Shaun Kelley : And I guess my quick follow-up would then be just any changes you guys think about the broader integration process? And I know when the deal was originally contemplated I think there was some down the road revenue synergy opportunities that you were probably envisioning just to kind of how you think about those in the context of what you are actually able to deliver right now? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I think the time is ripe for that. I mean we have got the combined loyalty program launched. It is in market and being marketed. We have got strong credit card sign ups. We have got strong share wallet growth. I think there is a lot we can look at now to be optimistic about the future. And I think it's time to deliver the revenue upside. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Arne Sorenson : Hey, Jared. Jared Shojaian : Just to stick with the same line questioning here. I mean called out RevPAR index being up a 100 basis points. And, we saw pretty sizeable increases from your peers as well. So I guess it's the conclusion that the independence are just meaningfully losing RevPAR share right now. And then on that idea, how do you think about the value proposition of branding today versus in the past? Because presumably, there's more value for owners today than there's really ever been? And does that give you the ability to push royalty rates a little bit harder? Arne Sorenson : Wouldn't that be nice? You obviously won't hear us be unbiased about the value of branding, we think we deliver extraordinary value to our owner and franchisee partners by plugging them into a system with a loyalty program and a very efficient reservation system that delivers substantial business to them at meaningfully, less cost, then would be the case otherwise, but I don't think you need to take our word for it, if you look at what's happening with the development pipeline. And we've talked about some of those statistics, but we're about 7% of the global industry today with, something like 20% of the hotels under construction heading towards our brand. So you can see investors, owners of real-estate, moving with their feet, because I think they see the strength of them. I think the other thing to remind everybody, and we don't want to get defensive sounding and we don't want to get too technical on RevPAR index. Our RevPAR index is a really important tool, particularly when you're looking at an individual hotel and how it's performing in its competitive set, but it is not the only measure that is out there to assess how portfolios are performing. In the wake of acquiring Starwood, we have found that many of our competitive sets include many of our own hotels, because there will be concentration, particularly in some of these urban markets, where we've got a significant number of full-service hotels. And so, we're measuring our performance against our own hotels, not exclusively, because we've got to have some others that are in there. And similarly, we are seeing to some extent, others who are competing in markets that we don't exist in. And so, if you think about the secondary, or some of the tertiary markets, our brands are not broadly distributed in those markets. And as a consequence, we don't have the impact maybe of newly ramping hotels in those markets, or of competition, maybe against some of the relatively weaker brands. All things put together, we are actually gratified in the midst of a massive integration, that in the midst of all of that, we still managed to take about 100 basis points index growth, both in the United States and globally in the first quarter of '19. Jared Shojaian : Great, thank you. And just on the pipeline, it was down quarter-over-quarter for the first time in several years. I know we shouldn't read too much into one quarter it's worth the pipeline data but I think the pipeline last year, and so far, this year is growing quite a slower than your 7% gross unit growth. So can you talk about that? And maybe what you're hearing from developers right now? Arne Sorenson : I don't think the very modest. I think we calculated 0.8% decline in the pipeline from quarter and Q4 is a trend. We opened well in the first quarter. Always at the end of the year, we probably have a little bit more coming on the pipeline than we do it other times and typically Q1 will be the slowest signings quarter part of that is because you've got to go through a reauthorization of the franchise circulars in most states, all those things combined, led to that modest negative in Q1. And we don't think we're necessarily see that in the quarters ahead, but having said that, we've said now for least a couple of years that sort of steady state or organic growth, particularly in the United States, United States is flattish. We are I think continuing to take share, maybe even building a little bit momentum of momentum, but in the 9th or 10th year of recovery with cost increases in construction and labor and length of the construction cycle. Even though financing is high and the absolute returns are quite good. I don't expect we'll see a meaningful ramp up for example, in development in the U.S., I think instead will be sort of poking along at flat levels, substantial bit flat levels, and growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year is going to depend a lot more on what happens in the rest of the world. Jared Shojaian : All right, thank you, and Laura, congratulations to you, well deserved, and Arne, my best wishes to you for a quick recovery. Arne Sorenson : Thank you. Laura Paugh : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JP Morgan. Joe Greff : I was going to say good morning, but those are old conference calls. Good afternoon. Kathleen Oberg : Thank you\u2026 Joe Greff : I guess 1 PM is better than 4.30 PM on a Friday. More seriously, Arne we wish you the best heartfelt, and Laura congratulations, we will definitely miss you. Laura Paugh : Thank you. Joe Greff : My question, most of my questions have been answered, but one question I have is regarding the development pipeline, what percentage of the pipeline is North America or U.S. top 25 markets, full service? And what percentage of that would be financed or under construction? Arne Sorenson : We will have to go back to you on this. I think about 40% of the global pipeline is luxury enough [technical difficulty] so it's a pretty healthy mix, which is in the higher segment. I am certain that the percentage in the U.S. only, which is luxury and upper upscale is meaningfully lower than that, and that U.S. lean towards for us upscale principally not upper mid scale, we don't really have upper mid scale space. Am I close? Laura Paugh : In the pipeline when we're looking [technical difficulty] it's about 10% of overall 475,000 - global pipeline of the North America pipeline, it's about 20%. Joe Greff : Thank you so much. Arne Sorenson : And I don't think we can give you the top 25 versus other markets, but with the information we've got here. Laura Paugh : Obviously, full service\u2026 Joe Greff : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Beckel of Bernstein. David Beckel : Thanks a lot for the question. I'd also like to echo the sentiments or well-wishes Arne and congrats Laura on a tremendous career. My question, my first question has to do with RevPAR cadence given Q1 results Q2 guidance. Of course there's some timing issues, but back half implies, sort of a pretty healthy acceleration, particularly in the U.S., you talked a little bit about group strength giving you some confidence that will materialize, but there -- are there any other one-time items to be aware of there with respect to the calendar. And more generally, what gives you the confidence that demand and RevPAR will sort of seemingly reaccelerate through the back half of the year? Arne Sorenson : Yes, there is, I mean I think is one thing we can be probably annually blamed for, I suppose. And that is we often keep our range of full two points. And so obviously we started the year one to three. We're still at one to 3 after the first quarter. And if we were actually comparably precise in each quarter as the year went along, we would narrow that range more and more, because the more quarters put in the book, the less likely, it is that you're either going to hit the bottom or the top end of that. And I think that could be said here too, but maybe they get to the opposite fundamental point, our internal, I guess, if you were to take it sort of single point RevPAR forecast is essentially right in the middle of that range.  And so, that tells you that basically when we're looking at trends in bookings and group bookings and year-over-year comparability issues. The most obvious in the fourth quarter, of course being the strikes, which we've had to struggle through in the fourth quarter 2018, but hopefully will not be in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of those things get us to a place where we think it is sort of the midpoint of that one to three years about the best prediction that we can make. It does suggest that in part, because of comparability issues and because of bookings maybe were a bit better in the second, in last two quarters than in the first two quarters, but not a dramatically different scenario. And it's not are sitting here saying we're going to have a different kind of economic environment and we have to today. David Beckel : Great. Thanks for the color there. And just a quick follow-up, I know it's a CapEx increased by about $100 million. Can you give a little color as to why the increase? Kathleen Oberg : Sure. Basically, we're up in the midpoint, about $100 million and it is a combination of little bit higher systems initiatives tool, which will actually be reimbursed over time from our owners, as well as, a loan for a particularly valuable management agreement. That's going to result in a meaningful property improvement program that will bring a hotel up to really fantastic brand standard for that brand. David Beckel : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Thanks. Arne, Glad to hear that here in good hands and Laura is not going to be the same without - we look forward to catching up offline with you. I wanted to ask -- just you mentioned your opening remarks and new design for TownePlace and Fairfield ends. I think targeted at smaller markets. I'm just wondering is that answering some sort of unfilled demand that your developers are asking you to do. Are you trying to be more competitive with products that are already targeting the smaller markets or kind of maybe what's what does it mean for those that I guess for the pipeline for those two products. Arne Sorenson : I think it's actually both. But there, and I sense there the same issue, we have heard from a number of our franchisees that they want to expand in secondary into some even tertiary markets where a Fairfield or a place at either 90 rooms instead of at 125, 130 rooms is the better positioning for those markets and while we've had, we've had the ability of course to shrink the number of rooms in the hotel. If you're not shrinking the public space in a way that's commensurate with that you're probably putting a product that's a little bit over built in that market. And so we want to do something with those partners who want to grow in those markets to make sure that we've got something, which is true to the brand, but cost effective for them and competitive with competing product that might be there, and obviously you can see we've got a lot of different companies that participate in the select service space, particularly. And if you look at the tertiary markets, you'll see that we are probably less distributed there than many other companies in the United States. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks. And then just listening to all the hotels -- Expedia the new Expedia contractors come up some. It sounds like more than just, it's a little more nuance than just sort of lowering the commissions and it's more about more control over, maybe the way the rooms are put into the OTA systems, can you just provide maybe some just broad strokes that maybe just kind of the changes in the contract. How is\u2026 Arne Sorenson : I mean that's, that obviously we are now, I don't even know what round of new contract is with Expedia, but we've been renegotiated contracts for nearly 20 years I suppose I that and there is a similarity to some extent with each of them, but I think on some level we continue to look for cost effectiveness. We look for data transfer ability, the ability to understand who the customer is and have the systems understand the customer is. We look at inventory control, which is can we yield our inventory, can we make sure we're pricing our inventory on our own platform in a way that doesn't necessarily have to be offered up in every other platform. And those things were on the table here too and of course you would expect Expedia or another OTA to one-off in the opposite of what we want certainly, as it relates to the level of the commission. That's probably the clearest to see, but I think we are grateful for where we got with Expedia, we do think it will deliver economic benefits to our owners. We also think we are we don't have much to say about this today. You'll have to stay tuned, but we do have an idea with them with Expedia, that we think is attractive to both of us maybe a incremental place for them to make some economics in our space, but also space in which they can actually deliver more cost effective solution to us than some of the solutions that are available to us today. And so we're pleased with the outcome that we've got and look forward to seeing what we can accomplish with it. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi happy Friday, everyone and Anthony well-wishes, well-wishes to you Laura thanks for your help and openness over the years. So that the house profit margin increase in North America on pretty modest RevPAR was positive in the quarter. I think you've targeted 50 basis points of hotel level margin growth from the merger are you believe that currently do you think that could lead to upside to your incentive fee growth projection of 6% to 10% over the next few years. Kathleen Oberg : So, couple of things, we basically have achieved in every year since we've acquired Starwood, 50 basis points of at least 50 basis points of margin improvement of apart from RevPAR and '17, '18. And it's our goal to do that again in '19 and quite frankly, Anthony, if our goal to do it again in '20. So I think whether it is from purchasing or from what we've seen in the loyalty program to productivity synergies to above property synergies through the PSF we've been thrilled with what we've been able to do and quite frankly with the hard work that the properties have put in to making that a reality. So we do continue to see the benefit. And I think you're seeing that come forth the incentive fees and in the process of the hotel. Anthony Powell : Got it. So I think in your, in the Investor Day, you said 6% to 10% of growth over the next few years. Is that still the target or there may be upside to that. Kathleen Oberg : Yeah, I think for now using what you've got in the Security Analyst Meeting is just right. Anthony Powell : Got it. Okay, just one more. Kathleen Oberg : We, one more certainly hope to beat it. Anthony Powell : Got it. And just on the home rental business, this is more of an offering or amenity for core customer or do you think, this really scale to something that's meaningful in terms for over the next few years. Arne Sorenson : Well times going to tell. I mean I, we're taking a different strategy obviously then number have , we are not, we want to, we know that what we offer in this space. Our brand must stand behind that nobody is going to excuse us from a bad experience a home and villa rental kind of experience. You're not going to blame the host, they're going to say Marriott you put me in a product that was not cleaner or something else, happened in that space. And so that's one thing that we'll make we'll have an impact on the size of business long term. The second thing we're doing is we're really looking at the whole home market, we're not looking at a studio apartment we're not looking at extra bedrooms, we're looking at something which is meaningfully different from a traditional hotel room for obvious reasons. We think it makes them more complementary to the hotel space that we're in, we also think yet it helps skill on a gap if you will. One of the gaps that arguably we've had is that win larger families whether that's a single nuclear family or an extended family are traveling together hotels are not necessarily always the easiest place to because there may not be places for them together. Outside of the public spaces of the hotel and the more we can do something that solves both of those, the better off. We think we are I think though even define that way. It is a big market and a market that we can grow in; we obviously don't expect that there will be a material financial impact in 2019. We wouldn't tell you to build anything in this model till we get smarter about it in the years ahead. But we're really excited about it and we are really eager to learn what we can learn in this space. Anthony Powell : Great, thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James. Bill Crow : Good afternoon folks. And obviously share the sentiment that's already been said, or a 20 years of trying to me better I appreciate your efforts. I'm not sure they work, but I appreciate them - Arne, my question is really on the select service limited service space whether you think the consumer today is more discerning and what they're looking for and whether that's put older properties at a significant disadvantage to newly opened properties. Arne Sorenson : It's a good question. Good question, for lots of reasons, I mean I think the full service hotels have got it they very meaningful advantage. They've got function space they've got presence that a typical select service hotel can offer often food and beverage range that select service hotel can offer, and they can continue to be I think quite competitive, particularly in the right kinds of markets. I think at the same time you see select brands and we've got a number of these I think about Moxy and AC and Aloft and Element just to name a few. That come right to mind that are interesting, they can be lively they can be with energized by bar space or lobby space or maybe even flex Food & Beverage space and if they're in urban locations they give a better alternative I think in some respects, then the relatively lower rated hotels that might have been in the same market in a past generation. If they existed there in the first place. And so, we'll watch this altogether obviously one reason these brands are growing so well as I think our franchise partners see them and say, this is a pretty, pretty interesting new mouse trap and we want to be part of experimenting to see how this works. I think ultimately all these hotels can be successful and if they're positioned right and if there truly their brands. I think some of the newer select brands have the ability to punch above their weight in terms of rate per square footage, which I think will make them stronger over time. And ultimately where the growth settles is going to depend a little bit on that return and that return is both about current cash return for development costs, but it's also about capital preservation and what assets are going to hold their value the longest and that's still often going to be urban main and main kinds of locations that may deliver a little less percentage cash flow return but are going to hold their value extraordinarily well. Bill Crow : Okay, I'll leave it there. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Patrick Scholes : Good afternoon. Let me just also reiterate Arne for a quick recovery and Laura, congratulations. Well deserved. Laura Paugh : Thank you. Patrick Scholes : A question, you had talked about occupancy taking a bit of a hit in the quarter. I guess, less use of third-party OTAS. Is this something that we would expect to continue throughout the year and then is it also fair to think that's on the flip side, it certainly benefits owned hotels including yours, as well as IMS? Arne Sorenson : I mean I think we have seen, probably some of this the last few quarters. We certainly in the Marriott -- Legacy Marriott portfolio even before the integration of the reservations platforms, we have started to do some yielding of our inventory off of third-party sites when we predicted we didn't need that business. And so I suspect as we get further into the year, we will see some lapping of what we did in the past. I think what is accelerated, probably a bit is with going to one reservations platform is we brought the Starwood Hotels in sort of one fell swoop onto a little bit more aggressive approach that way and so we think we'll probably see some impact of that, we're going to watch this. I mean obviously we don't want to turn away business, if it's incremental to us. What we want to do, though, is make sure we're set up to maximize profitability of hotels and long-term and well you we've talked about this before. Well, RevPAR is the single measure, which is most available in the industry. It is not the measure, which is the most important, which is what kind of profits are you driving from the performance -- hotel as you compete for owner Capital. And as we've said before, we're quite compared to sacrifice a few tenths on the top line if it makes sense to drive enhanced profitability on the bottom line. Kathleen Oberg : The only additional add to that is that I would not expect it to the second part of your question, I would not expect to materially impact only profit. Patrick Scholes : Thank you for the clear definition. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thank you. I want to add my best wishes for Arne and Laura quite obviously I'm -- that Laura leaving the as many years of I've been doing this. I always learn something when I talk to Laura. So I think for all of us are understanding of the industries can be diminished by her going, but so let that stop you well deserved. So my question is incentive management fees. I wonder if you could give us sometimes you give color on kind of what percent was hotels are paying versus the previous kind of in North America, and then -- just with the guidance for management -- incentive metrics declines in Q2, you mentioned that's renovations, it seems like something that I'll the renovation disruption might be more than one quarter phenomenon, but your full-year guidance is still for that up mid single-digit for the incentive management fee. So I wonder if you could just talk to us about how, like, what's the sort of specific to Q2, but not necessarily an issue in later quarters about that. So, thank you. Kathleen Oberg : Sure, absolutely. So let's first talk about percentage ownership on incentive fees. And in Q1, in '19, versus '18, it was up 300 basis points. So, 56% versus 53% a year ago, first quarter, so fits nicely with the discussion that we've been having, relative to margins, and also International Hotel growth. Relative to the full-year, last year '18 was up about a point over '17. It's too soon for us to kind of get into percentages for all of '19 but I think clearly the trend is moving in the right direction. So a couple things I mentioned on incentive fees in Q2, one of the things that's going on in Q2 and incentive fees is FX, we have expected that FX, albeit it's a little bit less bad than we expected a quarter ago, a quarter ago we said 15 to 20. Now we've got closer to 10. We do expect that FX impact negative FX impact, which clearly hits incentive fees to be largely in the first-half. So we are expecting a chunk of that to be in Q2. And then, you add on to that the reality that in Q1 we had a bunch of resorts that were getting this extra strong incentive fees, and then layer on top of it the renovations and Easter and that's where you get this overall change in the direction of the incentive fees in Q2. Robin Farley : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hey, good afternoon and best wishes on a speedy recovery, Arne and Laura good luck in your retirement. Laura Paugh : Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Thank you. Thomas Allen : So at the beginning in your prepared remarks, you talked about two and a half years of embedded growth, just in the hotels in construction, and then another two and a half years in the pipeline. Is that saying for that for the current 5.5% to 6% growth, you're guiding it? Is that what you're implying? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I guess so. Yes, I don't know that we exactly. went back and tested the net unit growth number. And obviously, the 5.5% is net of deletions. We're not updating the deletions forecasts, but really simply looking at -- you look at the volume of rooms in that pipeline, and it looks about five years' worth of growth. Thomas Allen : And just assuming, just a steady pace of opening, so, it -- just the today's pace, you got a lot of stuff in the pipeline. Kathleen Oberg : It's consistent with what we talked about in the security analyst meeting, which obviously you'd expect higher room openings in 21 than you would expect in '19, but it is all consistent with this pipeline be it 478 or 475. Thomas Allen : Okay, perfect. And then just since you announced homes and villas, what have you heard from owners? Arne Sorenson : They're curious, of course, they're deeply interested in where we're going with this, obviously 2000 homes and villas is a substantial increase from what we were doing last year. But it is not a significant number by itself when you compare it to the either the size of the hotel system we have today, or even the number of hotels we open every week. And so, it's less a question really about what are we doing today, than what might we be doing in the future? And I think as we go forward, we're going to make sure we're communicating with them and taking on board their interest, I think our owners are not monolithic. So it would be wrong to say that every one of them has exactly the same point of view. I do think there are many of them that acknowledge that this is a rational step for us to take. And if they were in our shoes, they'd be doing exactly the same thing. I think broadly, they appreciate the value of the loyalty program and know that this can enhance the loyalty program, which is to benefit not just of the homes and villas of business, but it's also to the benefit of the hotel business. And I think owners generally have a point of view, which is they'd like to grow with us, but maybe have nobody else grow with us, so that they can make sure that they capture as much of our customer base as they possibly can. I think they understand philosophically that that's not a world that they can necessarily have. But you put all that through the grinder and I think we've got a, very constructive set of conversations with our owners and I'm sure we'll be able to navigate this too with them well. Thomas Allen : Helpful, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Michael Bellisario of Baird. Michael Bellisario : Good afternoon. Arne Sorenson : Hi, there. Michael Bellisario : All the best to both of you, Arne, and Laura. Laura Paugh : Thank you. Michael Bellisario : You gave us a 3% number. I think it's on the transient side for your largest accounts. I mean, did you see any different trend with some of your smaller accounts and any difference is between kind of larger and smaller customers in terms of the booking behavior that you saw? Kathleen Oberg : Yes, I wouldn't say anything. Kind of notable, happily, some of our biggest customers like the professional services, areas, things like that. They were good. They were up meaningfully. So, some of the areas that you would expect, so I don't think there any particular trends of the larger versus the smaller, but certainly, professional services and example was up very strong. Michael Bellisario : And then you mentioned, I think you called it a surgeon group bookings in April, what was kind of the profile of that customer that was being more aggressive with their forward-looking bookings? Kathleen Oberg : Well, they're actually that was group that we were talking about. That was group bookings, which obviously can cover a range everything from associations to government to corporations. And it was quite strong in the corporates. What I think one of the things that we were very pleased to see is that it was the surge was both in the year for the year as well as for all future periods, which was always very encouraging. Michael Bellisario : That's helpful. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from on this Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Hi, thanks a lot. And first of all, best wishes to you, Arne, and congrats to Laura. Arne Sorenson : Thanks Kevin. Laura Paugh : Thanks, Kevin. Kevin Kopelman : I just had a quick one. Can you talk about free cash flow trends that you're seeing and that kind of one-time payment that you had in the first quarter and how you're expecting free cash flow trend for the year? Thanks. Kathleen Oberg : The one-time payment, you're referencing. Laura Paugh : You just talk about insurance costs related to profit sharing last year? Kathleen Oberg : Yes, profit. That was profit sharing within a year ago, first quarter. So in that respect, we were talking about kind of year-over-year trend in G&A because obviously last year was weighted down by the $35 million. You could be talking about the profit sharing from our working capital changes. Kevin Kopelman : Sorry, I'm talking about the outflow for accrued payroll and benefits. Kathleen Oberg : Yes, yes. Kevin Kopelman : You're aware. Yes. Kathleen Oberg : Yes. And that is just a function of the fact that as you remember, we accrued for this supplemental benefit last year, but we actually paid it out in first quarter into our associate's accounts. And then second of all, we also moved up our profit-sharing timing from Q3 to Q1. So when you look at the working capital, use of cash in Q1 relative to normal, it looks particularly heavy, and that's because of about $200 million worth of timing differences in the cash flow. Kevin Kopelman : Got it? And then just a follow-up on typically, your loyalty program has been a source of cash and you talked about how it might be different this year and you did have strong I think, redemptions in the first quarter. So any change to the outlook there for this year? Kathleen Oberg : Yes, so good question. And again, to your kind of to finish off the rest of your earlier question, otherwise, in terms of the overall flow of cash, it's really the same as we expressed in the first quarter, so no fundamental change, we obviously haven't assumed any asset sales. So it's pretty similar. Yes, I would say loyalty might be between $50 million and $100 million, negative use of cash this year as compared to more neutral where we were a quarter ago. But that's also offset by a little bit higher net income. So you put that all together with maybe ever so slightly higher debt borrowings, and we end up in exactly the same place. And all of those I would say are in the $60 million to $75 million, so really kind of fine-tuning more than being any fundamental change. Kevin Kopelman : Okay, got it. Thanks so much. Kathleen Oberg : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Hello, everyone. I just got a quick question on conversions. Now that bond boy has been launched. The programs have been integrating. Are you seeing an increase in interest promoters to convert to Marriott brands? Arne Sorenson : I think it's certainly at least steady, if not up a bit. Yes, I think the demand both for new build and for conversions is comparable. I think the feedback we're getting from our owners is very positive. I think they're have been questions already, obviously, about margin, which we've talked about, I think there is not maybe not unanimous but broad recognition that we're delivering the incremental margin performance because of what we've built here. And I think there's broad understanding that the revenue lift should come behind it. And not only an absolute revenue lift, but a mix of revenue sources, which is more cost effective. And so, the level of conversations we're having with our current and prospective partners are very robust. Kathleen Oberg : And in certain markets that are more RevPAR challenge, like Middle East for sample, we're very encouraged with some of the conversion activity we see going on there where the benefits of the strong revenue pipeline of our brands is viewed as very attractive, as well as the margin. Wes Golladay : Hey, can I get one more question? I want to -- looking at the limited service, the underperformance this quarter is a little bit more pronounced. And I assume some of that was related to their -- the relief efforts last year. Is that true? And how do you expect the gap between full service to trend throughout the year? Arne Sorenson : Yes, it's a good question. The -- I think the limited services, partly geographic distribution, maybe a little bit for us, partly age of product, I suppose maybe for courtyard, which we're working on, but I don't see a dramatic difference in performance between the segments as the year goes on. Wes Golladay : Thank you very much, and best wishes and thanks for everything. Arne Sorenson : Thank you. Kathleen Oberg : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. And best wishes to both Arne and Laura. I had two questions. And they're both related to share of wallet, one pretending to start with Marriott deal and the second on home sharing. So first on Starwood, Marriott, obviously had this base of legacy Marriott loyalty members, Starwood loyalty members, and I'm curious kind of what inning you think we're in of increasing share of wallet within those bases of legacy members? What type of overlap you're seeing of the legacy Marriott staying now at Starwood properties, and vice versa? I guess maybe a simple way of capturing it is, I think you've noted loyalty is 50% of the business now. How high do you think that could get? Arne Sorenson : Well, I'm not sure we actually know the answer. The second one, a couple of comments on absolute penetration of loyalty, and then maybe finish with what anywhere in. It was interesting to us that when we acquired Starwood and looked at the way the calculation was done for loyalty contribution of hotels, Starwood was seven or eight points higher than Marriott was, principally because the calculation was done differently. And we have synthesized those calculations now, so that they're the same. And actually, the loyalty contribution to the Starwood Hotels looks a whole lot more like what it does for the Marriott Hotels. And there's some arcane things in there about whether you count for example, a point in the eligible room that came in through an OTA channel but has a loyalty number attached to it, where maybe they can earn points from food and beverage, or you don't, and we don't so there are a bunch of things that go into their calculation. As we said, we're at about 50% of all of our rooms are coming from our loyalty programs. We think that number will grow. We are -- I think, in a very early inning, well, our customers were both Starwood and Marriott customers, I think we're pleased when we allowed linkage of the loyalty programs on the day of close to now have one single program means they don't have to go to two separate sites, if you will, to see what the options are in the other legacy portfolio. And that means the customers are just in the last few months now for the first time going on and looking at whatever destination they may be going to end seen a meaningfully broader selection to choose from than they did before. And it means that we are seeing folks who might have driven farther for that SPG hotel or driven farther for that Marriott Rewards hotel before now having options that are a little bit closer to them. And there'll be some in there'll be some trading sort of back and forth and in both directions, which I think net should drive share of wallet and maybe not disproportionately impact either one. We did put in our prepared remarks that redemption volume has gone up significantly. I think that is a powerful sign that people are seeing that the value of the choices that are available. And so, I tried to put an ending on it, but I would say it's very early in the game in terms of the revenue lift and the lift available from the bandwidth program. Okay, I guess the operator told us you were last. Thank you very much for being so patient with us. We obviously try and do these things in the morning for obvious reasons. We had our board meeting and shareholders meeting this morning and we're trying to fit an awful lot in the same day. And so, thanks for waiting until Friday afternoon. For us, we appreciate your interest in us. Congratulations, Laura. Once again, we'll have you for another few quarters here but\u2026 Laura Paugh : Thank you, happy Mother's Day to everybody. Arne Sorenson : Happy Mother's Day, everybody, make sure you take your mothers or your spouses or whoever is mother-like to you to one of our hotels and celebrate. Have a good weekend. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Samantha and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Marriott International\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead. Arne Sorenson : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. First, let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued earlier today along with our comments are effective only today August 6, 2019, and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion today, we will talk about results excluding merger-related costs and reimbursed revenue and related expenses. GAAP results appear on Page A1 of the earnings release, but our remarks today will largely refer to the adjusted results that appear on the non-GAAP reconciliation pages. Of course, you could find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our website. Before we move to specifics about the quarter, let me make a few observations about our results. Global economic growth is clearly slower than we anticipated when the year began. Demand growth for the U.S. lodging industry as reported by STR reflected the weaker U.S. economy with lodging demand in the quarter up less than 2% year-over-year, about 50 basis points lower than the past couple of quarters. Combined with a relatively higher supply growth in the largest 25 U.S. markets, STR\u2019s RevPAR growth in these markets increased only 0.2% in the quarter compared to plus 1.6% in secondary and tertiary markets. Marriott\u2019s North American systemwide RevPAR rose 0.7% in the quarter and our systemwide RevPAR index in North America increased 100 basis points with improvement across all luxury premium and select service portfolios. Despite the business climate, our North American sales team had a solid quarter. Gross group booking \u2013 gross group revenue bookings made in the second quarter for all future periods increased 6% and booking pace for the next 12 months is up at a low single digit rate largely related to strong corporate demand. New group bookings at our legacy Starwood Hotels were particularly strong in the quarter as these hotels benefited from the completed integration of our sales organizations that occurred in early 2018. North American group sales were even stronger in July. On the transient side, we have seen meaningful and steady improvement in legacy Starwood Hotel performance since the cut over to Marriott revenue management systems in the fourth quarter of 2018. We believe there is additional RevPAR growth upside as we further fine tune performance of these brands. With continuing trade disputes, RevPAR in Greater China rose 2.6% in the quarter, reflecting moderating RevPAR growth in manufacturing markets like Shenzhen and Tianjin and incorporate destinations like Shanghai. Political demonstrations in Hong Kong also constrained RevPAR growth. At the same time, our RevPAR index in Greater China rose sharply again in the quarter. Elsewhere in Asia, demand for our hotels in Japan and India continued to show robust trends with RevPAR up nearly 7% in the quarter. In Europe, transient room nights booked by U.S. travelers rose 8% as tourists enjoyed the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and the Biennale in Venice. By the way, congratulations to Megan Rapinoe and the entire U.S. women\u2019s national team on an impressive tournament. Europe also attracted a greater share of the strong outbound business from China, as our Chinese guests are enjoying more personalized hospitality through our Li Yu service programs. Room nights sold to Chinese guests traveling to Europe increased 34% in the quarter. Our hotels in Malaysia, Egypt, and Mexico also saw significant increases in Chinese demand.  Globally, comparable hotel RevPAR on a constant dollar basis increased 1.2% in the second quarter and global RevPAR index increased by more than 100 basis points, our strongest performance since our acquisition of Starwood. We remain focused on delivering leading profitability for owners and franchisees. Labor and benefit costs are rising in many markets, even as RevPAR growth moderates. Despite this, in a second quarter, we maintained flattish house profit margins across our company operated system as we leveraged our scale and increased productivity. In addition to significant savings and procurement and lower loyalty charges, our hotels benefited from lower commission rates on group intermediaries and a growing proportion of lower-cost direct transient bookings. Systemwide direct digital hotel revenue increased over 20% in the second quarter and now represent nearly one third of property revenue globally, 38% of transient revenue alone. In China, our successful Alibaba joint venture helped to increase our direct digital revenue bookings in that market by 36% in the second quarter. Property revenues booked on OTAs worldwide declined 2% in the second quarter. Our new programs and services fund structure is also improving margins at our hotels, launched at the beginning of this year, owners and franchisees are now paying a single amount that covers roughly 20 programs and services including reservations, sales and marketing and technology support. The simplified pricing is easier to understand and forecast and we expect it will generate savings for the vast majority of our owners. This focus on owner returns and transparency is helping drive our share of new hotel development. Our global system totaled roughly 1.35 million rooms at the end of the second quarter and our worldwide pipeline reached a record 487,000 rooms, nearly 5% higher than a year ago and 3% higher than last quarter. Owners and franchisees are continuing to sign new deals at a rapid clip. In the second quarter, we added 29,000 rooms to our pipeline and open more than 16,000 rooms. Over 20% of room openings in the quarter were conversions from competitor brands. At our expected pace of openings, our under-construction pipeline represents the equivalent of 2.5 years of embedded gross rooms growth. The remainder of our pipeline represents another 3.5 years of growth. In 2019, we expect our worldwide rooms\u2019 distribution will increase by roughly 5% to 5.5%, net of 1% to 1.5% room deletions, a bit more modest than our prior guidance, reflecting opening delays in North America and the Middle East. We have not seen project cancellations for 2019 openings. Over the past few years, lengthened construction periods reflect labor shortages, a larger proportion of room and properties and increasing number of new projects using multiple brands. While construction delays have moderated our near term rooms growth in 2019, our under construction pipeline totaled 213,000 rooms in quarter end. Given the significant depth of our under construction pipeline, we expect openings in 2020 will accelerate meaningfully. We continue to expand our lead in luxury lodging. We have over 700 luxury properties with 175,000 luxury rooms opened or under development, nearly double the luxury portfolio of our next leading competitor. A 60% of our 200 luxury pipeline properties are already under construction. As far in 2019, we have opened 15 luxury properties around the world and expect to open another 15 luxury projects by end of the year. Worldwide leisure transient demand was solid in the second quarter and we believe leisure offers a meaningful and incremental growth opportunity. Today, Marriott Bonvoy tours and activities offer 200,000 leisure experiences in 1,000 global destinations and our homes and villas by Marriott International, which launched in May now has nearly 2,500 homes in the Americas and Europe. In early 2020, we expect our Ritz-Carlton Yacht will set sail on its first cruise from Fort Lauderdale to Barbados. Cruise bookings are running ahead of expectations. And in addition, yesterday, we announced our intention to grow in the all-inclusive space. After signing new management agreements for five new build, all-inclusive resorts located in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. These projects will be added to our first all-inclusive project in Costa Rica, which joined our portfolio when we acquired Starwood. The all-inclusive market is growing rapidly and our Marriott Bonvoy members would like to see us in this space. We expect to expand our all-inclusive portfolio in popular, leisure destinations in the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia with both newbuild projects and property conversions, leveraging our well-established full service and luxury brands. Marriott Bonvoy has a key element of our leisure strategy. Marriott Bonvoy membership totaled roughly $133 million at quarter end with strong signups in the Asia Pacific region in the quarter. Year-to-date, member occupancy penetration increased 160 basis points and in the second quarter alone bookings on the new Marriott Bonvoy app rose 70%. We are bullish about Marriott\u2019s future. We continue to leverage our scale for the benefit of our guests, owners, franchisees and shareholders. Our strong brands are getting better. Owners and franchisees continue to add hotels to our already broad distribution and most important our culture focused on people remains front and center. Before I turn the call over to Leeny to talk about our second quarter performance and outlook, let me give you a quick health update. I have almost completed chemo treatments and they have gone well. The doctors are pleased with my progress so far. I still have radiation and surgery ahead, but so far everything is unscheduled. I appreciate all the kind words and support from so many of you. Now Leeny for the second quarter. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Arne. For the second quarter of 2019, adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.56 compared to a $1.73 in the year ago quarter. This was slightly over the midpoint of our guidance of a $1.52 to a $1.58 despite global RevPAR growth below the midpoint of our guidance. Recall that in the 2018 second quarter, adjusted EPS included $0.26 from gains on asset sales. Gross fee revenues totaled nearly $1 billion in the quarter, up 5% over the prior year, largely due to RevPAR growth, unit growth and higher branding fees. Credit card fees totaled $104 million up 12% driven by new credit card signups and higher spend. With a stronger U.S. dollar, second quarter fee revenue reflected $7 million of year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange net of hedges. Owned, leased, and other revenue net of expenses totaled $87 million in the second quarter, a $2 million decline from the prior year, largely due to the net impact of sold hotels and renovations. Termination fees totaled $11 million in the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior year. Owned, leased and other profits were stronger than expected in the quarter due to timing of non-operating expenses. The second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $952 million consistent with our guidance. Our year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA was constrained by $6 million and lower profits from hotels under renovation and $8 million in unfavorable foreign exchange impact net of hedges. While not included in adjusted EBITDA, we recorded a $126 million non-tax deductible accrual in the second quarter for the fine proposed by the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office related to the data security incident we disclosed last year. We have the right to respond before the amount of the fine is finally determined and as we have said, we intend to respond and vigorously defend our position. Looking ahead, we expect our North American RevPAR will increase 1% to 2% in both the third and fourth quarters, albeit at the lower end of that range in the fourth quarter. The third quarter should be helped by the impact of the shifting Jewish holidays and strong group business on the books, while the fourth quarter should be helped by easier comparisons to last year strikes. In the Asia Pacific region, we expect low single digit RevPAR growth in the second half reflecting cautious corporate demand in China and continued political demonstrations in Hong Kong. At the same time, we also believe there could be demand upside in India and Japan where we have significant distribution. We expect RevPAR growth in the Middle East and Africa region will be flattish in the third quarter, helped by the timing of Ramadan and modestly lower in the fourth quarter. For Europe, we expect U.S. travel to the region will remain strong in the second half, but tough comps to last year\u2019s World Cup in Russia will likely hold Europe RevPAR growth to a low to mid single digit rate in the second half. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, we expect RevPAR will grow at a low single digit rate in the second half on easier comparisons in Mexico and strong ongoing leisure demand in the Caribbean. In summary, we expect worldwide systemwide RevPAR will increase 1% to 2% in both the third and fourth quarters yielding 1% to 2% RevPAR growth for the full year. For the full year 2019, we believe gross fee revenue will total $3.82 billion to 3.85 billion, up 5% to 6% over the prior year. This is $50 million lower than our last guidance at the midpoint due to a modestly more conservative RevPAR outlook, negative foreign exchange impact and fine tuning of our credit card branding fee estimate. We believe credit card fees could total $400 million to $410 million for the year. Incentive fees could be flattish for the full year, reflecting the impact of hotel renovations, modest RevPAR growth at full service hotels in the U.S. and China and unfavorable foreign exchange. Owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expense could total roughly $295 million for the year, reflecting roughly $35 million in lower termination fees compared to 2018. G&A should total $920 million to $930 million for 2019 consistent with our prior guidance. These assumptions yield $5.97 to $6.06 diluted earnings per share for 2019. Recall that the full year 2018 included $0.65 in gains from the sale of owned and joint venture assets. Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 should total roughly $3.586 billion to 3.626 billion, 3% to 4% increase over 2018 adjusted EBITDA. Our year-over-year growth rate and adjusted EBITDA reflects unit growth, modest growth in RevPAR and higher branding fees. At the same time, we estimate lower termination fees and negative foreign exchange impact combined create more than $50 million of headwinds, depressing our full year adjusted EBITDA growth rate by more than a 100 basis points. Our press release outlines our earnings expectations for the third and fourth quarters. Third quarter incentive fees will likely decline due to a tough comparison to last year\u2019s World Cup and continued modest RevPAR growth in the largest U.S. markets. We also expect a decline in residential branding fees in the third quarter. In contrast, fourth quarter incentive fee should increase benefiting from easy comparisons to last year\u2019s strikes in North America and international unit growth and branding fee should move higher. As always, are 2019 guidance does not include merger-related costs or reimbursed revenues and expenses.  Total investment spending for the year could total $650 million to $750 million including roughly $225 million of maintenance spending and $200 million to 250 million that should be reimbursed or recycled over time. Our renovation of the Phoenix Sheraton Downtown is well underway and includes new designs for the hotels, public space and rooms and should be completed by early 2020. We have already begun marketing the hotel subject to a long-term management agreement. Marriott Bonvoy point redemptions are running ahead of expectations in 2019 as members explore the new locations and experiences offered by the significantly improved program. As a result, we expect the net cash impact of the loyalty program will be a few $100 million more negative in 2019 than we expected at the beginning of the year, but should improve significantly in 2020. We repurchased more than 12 million shares from January 1 through August the second for 1.6 billion and we expect cash return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends will approach $3 billion in 2019. This assumes no asset sales in 2019 beyond those already completed and reflects our current EBITDA guidance. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At June 30, our debt ratio was within our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3.5 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR. So let\u2019s answer your questions. So that we can speak with as many of you as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We\u2019ll take your questions now. Arne Sorenson : Operator, are you there? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Thank you. Hi, good morning, everyone. Arne, glad to hear a positive update on your health. Maybe we could just get started with the unit growth side and a little bit more color there. I think last year, towards the end of last year in Q4, ran into a similar issue on some of these contraction delays that you guys described at the Analyst Day. Can you just give us a little bit more color on confidence levels around both your sort of longer-term three-year outlook for overall net unit growth? And then why specifically should we be super comfortable in an acceleration for next year? What are you guys seeing in that data that should allow this to improve materially? Arne Sorenson : Well, obviously notwithstanding the fact that we're bringing the growth assumptions for the year down a little bit, 25 basis points essentially to the midpoint from a quarter ago, makes it feel like we don't have much predictability here. We actually do have a fair amount of predictability because we can see what the pipeline looks like. And based on hotels under construction and projected earnings data, we can see that the openings in 2020 and in the couple of years beyond should accelerate meaningfully from what we're experiencing in 2019. That doesn't mean that we can be exactly precise about that when these hotels open. And I think in many respects, what we've experienced this quarter is an indication of that. We do have obviously very tight construction markets, tight labor markets. And I think when you look at our U.S. portfolio, what we see is even in the limited-service segments, a bulk of what we're doing or at least a bit over half of what we're doing is non-prototypical work. So we're not talking about a suburban Courtyard that looks the same from market to market to market. But we're tending to talk about an urban Courtyard or an urban AC or an urban Aloft or an urban Moxy that is very much a custom job. And in the tight labor and tight construction cross-markets, probably exacerbated a little bit by the modest RevPAR market, we're seeing that the construction time lines continue to increase. I think the other bit of good news in this, which, of course, we put in our prepared remarks, is when we look at our quarterly adds and deletions from our pipeline, we don't see a change in the cancellation portfolio that \u2013 from prior quarters. Middle East is obviously something that also we've called out here. I think the two primary areas are North America and the Middle East. Middle East is a big market, highly diverse. You've got some markets like Saudi and Cairo performing extraordinarily well. The Emirates have a lot of supply growth and very modest, in fact negative RevPAR growth in the market now. And I suspect that the combination of negative RevPAR growth is further extending the construction time line in those markets. Shaun Kelley : Thanks, Arne. And then just as a follow-up, just to be a little bit more precise, have you factored like a longer construction time line into the 2020 forecast? But still even with that, can you see some sort of acceleration, just assuming this is kind of the new normal? Arne Sorenson : Yes and yes. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Hey, good morning to everyone. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Hi. Wes Golladay : Looking at the results \u2013 hi, looking at the results in China, you definitely have some strength versus competitors. How much of that is due to the Bonvoy marketing versus the partnership with Alibaba, the Fliggy? Arne Sorenson : Well, that's \u2013 that is \u2013 probably as much of that is \u2013 will be coming in the future as opposed to delivered already. I think the Alibaba partnership is off to a great start. We're about a year into it. And if anything, we're seeing ramping performance and we're very optimistic about the future. And I think it probably has had some impacts so far. But I actually don't think that is as profound as the portfolio that we've got in China. When you look at we're 50 hotels roughly open in Shanghai, very much a great strength in the luxury and full-service spaces. The business is principally Chinese business, even in a market like Shanghai, which we've talked about before. And I think when you look across the markets, you see that we have a really powerful luxury and full-service portfolio. We are expanding in the select service space, but that has been much more recent for us. And I think with the portfolio we've got, we've got strong brand familiarity, strong loyalty program and strong Chinese customer preference so that we continue to take really quarter-after-quarter for the last number of years strong increases in our RevPAR index performance in China. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then quickly looking at that loyalty program, you mentioned the cash usage this quarter \u2013 or this year, but it will grow next year to a benefit to you. What is going to drive that? Leeny Oberg : So if we \u2013 look, typically our loyalty program generates cash on an annual basis. Because the cash that we take in as folks earn points is more than needs to go out the door for either redemptions or the cost of the loyalty program. This year, we had several things that were a bit unusual. First of all, you had some integration expenses timing that fell into 2019 versus 2018. Second of all, you had \u2013 if you remember the introduction of Bonvoy, of the combined program. We did a pretty meaningful marketing spend in the first half of the year that was unusual relative to typical timing.  And then third and certainly not last is \u2013 and certainly not least is that redemptions have been higher this year as we've seen folks introduced to the new combined program trying out hotels from the various portfolios. And we do expect over time that, that starts to calm down and not have some of these unusual items next year. Wes Golladay : Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s all from me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is just on the credit card fees lower than the previous guidance. Is that fewer sign-ups or less usage or just lower fee rate negotiations? And then just as a follow-up. just following up on the comment about the redemptions being higher than you'd expected and your expectation that it will come down over time. Will you raise the cost of award nights? Or what will you do to kind of maybe get the redemptions in line with where you want them ideally? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Thanks, Robin. So first of all on the credit cards, we've actually surprised with the growth in new card sign-ups this year. They've been higher than our expectations across the cards. We've been particularly pleased with the no fee card that we just introduced. And from that standpoint, the business that has gone really well. This is really just fine-tuning of the money that's coming in the door relative to the credit cards and the overall \u2013 the combination of the overall spend in the sign-ups, so really nothing in the fundamental trends in that business. And then as you look on the redemptions side, I think if you remember, we've got the combination of the two business \u2013 of the two programs into one and a huge systems integration of the loyalty platforms. And as we move into 2020, we can already see that there is a bit more of folks kind of settling out into a more normal pattern. But we did see some trends of not only higher numbers of redemptions but at more expensive properties at high-occupancy periods. And that obviously means that the cash going out the door is a bit higher than expectations. But we are confident that the balance of that will even out over time. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Jared Shojaian : Can you just \u2013 good morning. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the magnitude of the full year incent management fee reduction? I think you cited some renovation impact. But maybe relative to your last thinking, what changed? And then as we think about next year and sort of a low RevPAR growth environment, is it realistic that the IMF line can still grow at, call it, a unit growth plus RevPAR growth plus RevPAR growth kind of rate? Or are you close to hitting some of the hurdle rates on the owners' priority? Leeny Oberg : So, let me first talk the percentage of owners \u2013 of hotels earning incentive fees because I think that's helpful to your question. And that \u2013 this year is in Q2 was 61% versus 65% a year ago. So you can see that the impact of environment is meaning that fewer hotels are hitting that threshold. I think for the full year, we would expect that in the U.S., given our RevPAR guidance, that you would actually see margins slightly but slightly down for the year in 2019, which will impact that percentage a bit.  Internationally, we've got both great new rooms growth as well as stronger RevPAR growth on a relative basis. So I think there you'll actually see continued strong numbers on the penetration side for IMF. And I think next year, it's too soon to say where we are on RevPAR. And that obviously will have a bearing. As we get into the budget process, we will be able to talk more about that. When you think about from a guidance standpoint on the IMF, the reality is that you've got FX being more of an impact than we had expected on the back half of the year as well as lower RevPAR overall. And when you put those two together, that's where you get the change from the incentive fee guidance that we gave a quarter ago. Arne Sorenson : I think the other thing to keep in mind, I'd just add one thing here, is we talked about the difference in Smith Travel industry RevPAR numbers for the top 25 markets and then the rest of the United States, top 25 being down 0.2 and the rest of the U.S. being up 1.6 points, which is a number of factors going into it. But significant one is higher supply growth in the top 25 markets than we're seeing in the rest. It shouldn't surprise you to know that a big chunk of our incentive fees come out of those top 25 markets. That's where we tend to have disproportionate distribution of the managed portfolio as opposed to the franchised portfolio, is where many of the convention center hotels are. And when you look at more modest RevPAR growth and margin performance in those markets, you get the kind of impact on incentive fees that Leeny talked about. Jared Shojaian : Okay, great. Thank you. And then Arne, you noted you haven't really seen any incremental project cancellations. What's a normal level of attrition for your pipeline, specifically a percentage that never actually comes online? And maybe how has that evolved over time? And can you talk about how that attrition compares to what you saw in 2008 and 2009 and how that \u2013 how we might expect that to look in the next recession? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I mean it's a small percentage, which attrits. And in some respects, you can't \u2013 you've got to be careful about limiting the time frame you look at this. Because we would see, for example, in a deep recessionary environment, more projects cancel out of our pipeline than we would in stronger times. But gratifyingly, many of those projects come back when the economy comes back. Because you've got partners of ours, who have control over the land, and they may have decided not to proceed with the project during the recession. But if you hang around the hoop long enough, suddenly they're taking a shot again and moving forward with it. I would think in the fullness of time, you're probably in the 10%, 15% range of projects that will cancel or indefinitely sort of defer. And of course, every quarter, we go through our pipeline and we are signing new deals and approving new deals, which are adds, but we're also culling deals. So the comments we made are not to suggest that there are zero cancellations, but we are not seeing a change in the cancellation pace from prior periods of time, including the last many number of years. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you very much. Arne Sorenson : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Good morning, everybody. Arne Sorenson : Hi. Leeny Oberg : Hi, Joe. Joe Greff : Two questions. One is on the development pipeline, nice to see that sequential increase there. Can you talk about what brand and what geographies are driving that beyond the new all-inclusive deals announced this morning? Arne Sorenson : It's very global. The \u2013 I think essentially every region and every segment are up. I'm just sort of double-checking the notes here to make sure I'm not overstating this. But by and large, we are seeing very strong appetite for development across the segments and across the globe. That's not necessarily to say that every country is seeing that because you've got some countries which are obviously experiencing either tougher economic times or tougher industry times, if you will. But you look across most markets and you see pretty darn healthy growth. Joe Greff : Great. And then back to, Arne, your comments on the construction delays. How many projects are you talking about with those delays? And how does it break out between North America, the Middle East and Africa regions? Arne Sorenson : Well, we're monitoring about 3,000 projects in that development pipeline. And if you look at where they're spread, obviously the U.S. is still the biggest market for us and probably is nearly 50% of those projects. So you're talking about 1,500 projects roughly in the United States. I'm doing the math a little bit as we talk here, but they are disproportionately select service hotels. And that is where we're seeing probably two thirds of the impact, if you will, in the United States and maybe one third in the Middle East and Africa. Joe Greff : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Anthony Powell : You talked a lot about how the top 25 markets that have been slower in the U.S. We've seen a strong growth in international outbound travel from the U.S. over the past few years. Do you think travel is just substituting Europe and other destinations for the top 25 markets? And could that have a negative impact going forward? Arne Sorenson : It's possible on the margin that, that is an impact that maybe in the summertime. I do think it's probably the biggest impact. I think more of this is just the industry data. We look at top 25 supply growth versus rest of the U.S. and you see about an 800 basis points difference. These are Smith Travel numbers. Rooms available, in other words, supply growth were up 2.5% in the top 25 markets and they were up 1.7% in the rest of the markets. And interestingly, rooms sold in both top 25 and the rest of the U.S. were up 1.9%. So you look at the relative difference between those. And I think that probably explains the bulk of it. I think it's possible during peak leisure times that you've got a little bit of movement of the American traveler abroad, maybe that we've lost a little bit of share to the U.S. of the international travel coming here, too. But I don't think that's very clear. And I would think that the supply dynamic is probably more significant than anything else. Leeny Oberg : Anthony, the share of international visitors coming from outside to the U.S. had stayed really stable between 4% and 4.5% over the last year. So although we're still seeing tremendous growth from places like China, that's still down well under 0.5% of the travelers. And then Europe as an example, close to two thirds of those visitors in Europe come from Europe. So while at the margin, there's maybe a little movement here and there, the numbers are fairly steady. Anthony Powell : Got it. Thanks. And you've highlighted improvement in RevPAR growth at the legacy Starwood brands. Do you think all the various integration issues are behind you and just the new brands actually start to outperform over the next few quarters? Arne Sorenson : Generally, yes. I think the integration has very much stabilized. And obviously, we look at this week-by-week. We've been gratified to see that the SPG \u2013 legacy SPG portfolio has grown index 10 of the last 11 weeks. And it's a good sign that the system has stabilized, the hotel teams are increasingly getting comfortable with those systems. Whether they're operated, managed hotels or franchised hotels, sales force has stabilized. And so we're quite optimistic about the future. Anthony Powell : Great. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, good morning. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask you a little more about your expansion into all inclusive space. Now that you have this kind of a multiyear project underway, we will tuck-in resort. Would you anticipate that other independent owners in that space will come to you with conversion opportunities? Is this kind of a platform that Marriott will look to support and grow as you\u2019ve done more, with some of your new brand initiatives? And how do you see that unfolding over the next couple of years? Arne Sorenson : Yes, we don\u2019t have a forecast for you today about how bit this business will get over time. But we do know that it is increasingly popular among leisure traveler. Broadly Caribbean Basin is the biggest market in the world for it, but you\u2019ve got growing markets in the Mediterranean area, as well as Asia-Pacific. And obviously our brands are well-known in those markets as well. I think as we talk to our development team we should see both conversions of comparator branded hotels, we should see new builds that join our system. And I suspect we\u2019ll see a few hotels in these markets that, where all-inclusive is popular, convert if the physical setting allows from a European point of hotel, so all inclusive hotels. And so I think we\u2019ll see that this is organic growth. We have over the last number of years looked at a few M&A opportunities in this space have not managed to score them really at this point in time and have decided to proceed with their organic growth with some very strong partners that we\u2019re excited about proceeding there. And I think we\u2019ll have good performance in this space in the years to come. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then I wanted to ask you if there\u2019s few months of home sharing on to your belt may be you could just talk about what you are seeing in terms of the overall additions to the platform? And anything you are hearing from owners on their positive, negative, or may be not or just neutral? Arne Sorenson : Well let\u2019s start by recognizing how recently we\u2019ve got into this business and how small it still is. We said 2,500 homes in our prepared remarks that is tiny compared to many of the other platforms that are out there. Although interestingly, when you look at various portfolios of home rentals folks have tried to slice them into higher end portfolios, and those higher end portfolios tend to be meaningfully smaller than the gross numbers that are out there.  I think what we\u2019ve discovered so far has by and large confirmed our thesis. And it is firstly that our leisure customers are already experimenting in the home sharing space and they are very appreciative of having a loyalty linkage, firstly. And secondly, they're very appreciative of having brand and quality service behind it. And too often we've heard from those customers that when they are traveling with groups or a larger family or in circumstances in which a home rental makes sense it's far too often just a crap shoot about whether the experience will be a good one or not. And what they're telling us is we really want you to have more choice, for us because, we think you can deliver and are delivering something which is got a quality associated with it that makes it not a crapshoot, but something we count on. And we're seeing the overwhelming majority of bookings. Again, they're relatively small so far, but coming out of the Marriott Bonvoy program and with the loyalty linkage, I think, our owners, particularly in the United States are interested in how this will grow and whether this sort of ends up being competing supply if you will. And we're working our way through that. I think at the moment, 95% of our units are two bedrooms and above and which are obviously quite distinct from a hotel room. But we'll be transparent with them about this and make sure they understand how we're growing. And we're optimistic about the future, but we don't really have any forecast for you yet. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, good morning everyone. Arne Sorenson : Good morning David. David Katz : Arne good to hear your voice. Arne Sorenson : Thank you. David Katz : I wanted to maybe ask a bit more of a general question about the quarter. We are all trying to sort of process what exactly is sort of happening in the economy. In your case there is an integration in a broad range of initiatives underway. And I just wonder if any of that second category is having any impact whatsoever on some of the adjustments that you've made in the guidance today and whether that's something you could talk about? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I mean, Leeny jump in here and tell me whether you think differently. I think the Q2 numbers for obviously the quarter we've reported, came in a bit light compared to what we anticipated certainly for a midpoint a quarter ago. But I would attribute, 100% of that or very, very, very heavy majority of that to economic conditions, demand conditions, particularly not to anything that's integration related. And similarly, when we look at Q3 and Q4, we've obviously never given anybody guidance on Q3 or Q4 specifically until this quarter where because we've only got two quarters left, basically both quarters come out with specific guidance. But I think the adjustments that we've made in EBITDA and EPS for the balance of the year are very much driven by the economic environment, lower RevPAR expectations being by far the most significant piece of that. It does have, an IMF flavor in some markets because of the U.S. RevPAR coming down a little bit. And it's got an FX piece that is a little bit worse too. But I think they are not in any material respects related to our continuing integration efforts or sort of internal story. Leeny you disagree? Leeny Oberg : Yes, no agreed. David Katz : And if I can ask one other short question more and more we hear, read and actually hear you talk about sort of the notion of alternative accommodations. And just trying to think through where the boundaries are in this opportunity, are we \u2013 we\u2019re looking at home rentals, right and more and more we're hearing about hybrid models. How big a opportunity is this really? Or are we just engaging in it in more of a temporary faddish way? Arne Sorenson : I mean, I think the reason we're in it is we've concluded it is not a temporary fad. If you look at Expedia booking in Airbnb to name three obvious players in the home rental space, the way these got millions of units on their platform and some are making quite decent economics from these platforms. Yes, I think this is a space in the broader travel sector that we and other lodging companies, as well as other participants in the sector have been watching for the last number of years. And it's become painfully clear, crystal clear to us that this is not some fad that's going to disappear tomorrow, but this is something that is here to stay. I think we are seeing at the same time the evolution of a number of these platforms, either from home sharing to other spaces if they've started at home sharing or broadening into other aspects of the travel sector because of the usefulness of technology across different elements of that travel sector. And for us, particularly the value of the Marriott Bonvoy and loyalty program, to sort of provide an umbrella, if you will, across a number of different areas of travel. And we said this a quarter ago and we probably said it last year actually when we started our pilot in the home sharing space, when we look at Marriott Bonvoy members, we see probably approaching 30% that had already experimented with home sharing. And were giving us feedback about the value we could bring to this space and we thought this was a good space to get in. So we got into it not as a fad and not simply as a test, but we got into it because we think it's a place where we can have a presence, we can provide more solutions to our loyalty members when they travel for different purposes. And we think we can make good economics over time. David Katz : Thank you very much. Good luck. Arne Sorenson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Just following up on the economic environment, you highlighted that demand was a bit softer than expected in the quarter. But you also had really strong group bookings for future periods, I think, you said up 6% in 2Q. Can you explain why those two things are happening at the same time, they don't totally logically make sense to me. Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Yes, I mean I think that's a fair question. And here is something which is, I think, probably at least in part internal and by the portfolio we've built, I mean, obviously if you look back over the last three or four years, you see a Starwood which was put up for sale with a auction process in early 2015, ultimately culminating in our signing of acquisition agreement in November of 2015, if memory serves. Not closed until almost a year later. And as a consequence you end up with some distraction inevitably. And then some post-closing change to their way the salesforce works in which is particularly relevant to group. And that distraction and disruption if you will, is well behind us. We've got a sales team which has been integrated and stabilized and they're lapping in some respects. The organization has been put in place because it was more than a year ago. And then the second thing, I think, as you look at the portfolio, we've got a group space in the United States and we've got the ability that our customers increasingly see to offer not just a handful, but a couple of handfuls of alternatives within our system that give them some price variability and location variability, brand variability and the like. And I think all of those things roll together our propelling, if you will, the group bookings that we are beginning to experience. I think when you look at year-over-year performance we've also got to factor in that there has been a shift in group commission payments from roughly 10% to roughly 7%. So we look when we're measuring this, not just at what the comparison was to 2018, because depending on the month you're looking at, that can be helped or hurt in year-over-year comparisons. But we're also looking at the comparison of 2017, which will sort of stabilize here in some respects. And we see good healthy growth against both of those baselines. So, we're encouraged by it. I don't think \u2013 I think it's probably more our story than it is industry dynamic because of the two factors I've talked about. But it's something that we were gratified by. Thomas Allen : That makes a lot of sense. Thanks Arne. And then just as my follow-up, when we look at the pipelines you had approximately 40,000 rooms approved, but not yet signed. Last quarter you had 25,000 rooms. So I have about 60% we\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s a big addition I assume from the all-inclusive, but anything else going on there that's worth highlighting? Leeny Oberg : Yes, as you know, Thomas, they kind of bounce back and forth. If you look last year at the second quarter, for example, that same statistic was 41,000 rooms. So in terms of approved but not yet signed. So they kind of go up and down depending on exactly the timing of the final signing of the contract. Thomas Allen : Makes a lot of sense. So on the closing that kind of the beginning in it at the end of the year and beginning versus the middle of the year. Leeny Oberg : Exactly, yes. Thomas Allen : Okay, thank you. Arne Sorenson : Because of timing of the franchise certainly you often sign fewer deals in the first quarter than you did at the second. Thomas Allen : Totally makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Suntrust. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning everyone. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : Just taking a look at the property level RevPAR results, especially for the company operate in North America, it looks like Sheraton was a bit of an underperformer. I'm just curious how much of that can be explained by any property improvement plans that you folks are pushing on those hotels? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Yes, it's a good question. I would encourage you first to look at the Sheraton system wide numbers not the Sheraton managed numbers, particularly in North America. The Sheraton managed portfolio is quite small as a percentage. And so you're going to get numbers there which are significantly impacted by the precise location of that portfolio, which is the risk in any smaller portfolio. But to be fair, I think, if you look at North American and Sheraton performance, I think, we reported 0.8% negative for the quarter. You've got a number of things going into that. I think it's probably worth mentioning that globally the Sheraton brand is performing quite well with index about flat in the quarter. And that's probably a better sign of the strength of the brand than the North American numbers. I think in North America you've got some shifting we've jettisoned some probably more hotels in the U.S. proportionally than outside. And we do have some renovation activity which is underway, which may or may not be substantial enough to pull those hotels out of the comp set. And then of course, we've got a single loyalty program. And so we've got customers now that have got more choice across more brands and they're experimenting a bit with that. And I think we will see over time that these brand numbers probably revert a bit more towards the mean. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. Then just a quick lighthearted follow-up question. There's been a little bit of a media tension about tipping housekeepers. Arnie, I'm wondering, do you a tip your housekeepers? Arne Sorenson : I absolutely tip housekeepers, business and leisure travel and have for many, many years. And I can't imagine that. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Steven Grambling : Hi, thanks. Two quick follow-ups. Arne Sorenson : Great. Steven Grambling : Good. First on owned assets, as international markets such as Europe and South America been holding in a bit better, I think you had previously kind of put on hold some of the asset sales, particularly in South America. How are you thinking about the additional owned assets and potentially selling? Leeny Oberg : So thanks Steven. We certainly do expect additional assets sales in the future. As you know they're impossible to predict in terms of timing. We talked about the fact that we've got Phoenix on the market and we've got several others that we continue to work very hard on. I think the reality is there are still probably some markets where even though there may be some improvement, it's still probably not ripe in terms of not just the RevPAR environment, but just as importantly the transaction environment, what the buyer and financing environment looks like. And I think you'll probably still find that several of the ones in South America fit that category. And the other thing I'll point out, Steven, is we've got a couple of these assets that have interesting characteristics to them, like unusual ground leases, et cetera, that aren't as much based on geography of the asset. But something in the structural part of the asset that makes it a bit more challenging to sell. Not to say we don't think that we ultimately can't, but that we just got to work through some of those issues. Steven Grambling : Fair enough. And maybe changing gears a little bit, you had called out India Today and had referenced it on some other calls, bit more it seems like in the past. Can you give us a bit more detail on that market as we think about how significant it could become? And perhaps talk to how contracts and owner base there is similar or different to other markets? Arne Sorenson : Yes, we're about \u2013 we can check this maybe if they've got the details. I think we're probably about 115 or 120 hotels open and operating in India today. And probably another few dozen that are in the development pipeline. We have got a good stable of owners, many of which have got multiple hotels with us. They tend to often to have a power within a particular region or city of India as opposed to across the country as a whole. It's obviously a very big and very diverse country, and the economy and culture. And so you end up with somewhat different partners from place to place. I think the bulk of what's happening in India is the growth of their economy, which obviously is a fairly small, at least in per capita terms, quite small, compared to China and the United States, but it's growing meaningfully year-over-year. The lodging business is still small. I mean, I think one of the stats I love to talk about when I'm with our friends from India is that there are maybe 175,000 hotel rooms in the country of India. The Indian expatriate community in the United States owns over two million hotel rooms in the U.S. And it just gives you a sense of how much growth is yet to come from India. So we are very bullish on it. We think we are getting a leading market share both in terms of hotels open but also hotels coming in the development pipeline, brands are strong and we think that the prospects for that economy are quite strong in the years ahead. Steven Grambling : Great, thanks so much. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Hi. I wanted to come back to group versus transient. I think last quarter group was up three and transient was flattish. And maybe I missed those, but I was curious what they worked for 2Q. And then as you think about this full year, how do you think group and transient checkout within their 1% to 2% targeted domestic range? Arne Sorenson : Yes, for Q2 group that is a North American number not a global number. Obviously these dynamics vary very much from part of the world to the part of the world. But in Q2 group was modestly negative, call it minus 1%. And so the transient both the business, and leisure transient and group would make up the difference between that and the RevPAR numbers we posted. Vince Ciepiel : Great, thanks. And then maybe getting a little bit more into the second half outlook it implies a pick up. Just curious how much of that's related to easier compares and have you already started to see that come through in July? Arne Sorenson : So the most significant thing in terms of comparisons year-over-year would be the strikes that we experienced in the United States, which was by and large and Q4 phenomenon. I can't tell you that there was no strike activity at the tail end of Q3, but if there was, it was extraordinarily modest. We do have some shifting holidays. Q3 has helped a bit by timing of Jewish holidays. Fourth quarter is hurt a little bit by the timing of those holidays. And of course we called out the Russian World Cup, which is relevant to the European numbers that we will post this year. I think those are the principle comparisons. But by and large, none of those factors are yet at play in the third quarter. Leeny Oberg : Believe it or not in Q3 you've also got a bit of a day of week shifting. Arne Sorenson : Okay. Leeny Oberg : Not only holidays, but you've got a day of week shifting in Q3 that is also helpful. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill Crow : Good morning, Arne and Leeny. Leeny Oberg : Is it \u2013 good morning. Bill Crow : Is it unreasonable to ask if the increased redemptions on the leisure front points redemptions is a leading indicator of weakness on the consumers\u2019 part? Leeny Oberg : I don't think so. I think if anything we've continued to see the leisure business be robust. And in general worldwide for our properties. I think, again, you see this in general economic trends as well, which is that although, for example, in the U.S. you've got lower GDP growth and expected, you are also seeing very strong consumer spend and low unemployment. So from that perspective, people are taking vacations, they're feeling good about their prospects. I'm told that recently the stock market was doing pretty well. And we are seeing people go and stay in our hotels on their vacations. And I think when you had the merger of the programs, you had a tremendous opportunity for SPG members to try out great new legacy Marriott hotels and vice versa. And we have seen that in the data that that is exactly what's happening. So I also think, given their staying at expensive hotels, I think, there was a view that there was an opportunity to get in and make some bookings for your vacation early using your points and make sure you've got those great hotels. So we don't see it as a sign in particular of a weakness. Bill Crow : Sounds like my summer vacation. Arne Sorenson : Thank you Bill. Bill Crow : Arne, I think making any predictions is a crapshoot today clearly. But is there anything out there that you could see today that would tell you that the industry should be anything different than a 0% to 2% RevPAR environment as we look into 2020? Arne Sorenson : No. I mean it is our best \u2013 it's our best set of estimates obviously or we wouldn't put them out there. Now we haven't obviously said anything other than in our analyst conference about 2020 and 2021. We'll get to that probably a quarter from now. I think the thing that's interesting and one of the internal debates that we have is we have not had a long period of time in which we've had really low single-digit RevPAR growth quarter-after-quarter. And on some basis, we're in a little bit uncharted territory. And it's going to be interesting to see whether or not we can continue to the sort of run that balance, which is if you look at the industry numbers or you look at individual hotel company numbers in Q2, we've got in the U.S. a modest increase in ADR and a modest decrease in occupancy. And that requires a fair amount of balance, and we've got lots of folks who are involved in pricing hotels in the industry and aggressively competing on a day-to-day basis. And whether that precise balance stays or not is going to be something we watch and learn together. I do think that the strength of GDP is still the single most important thing for us to look at. And obviously, obviously, 2% GDP growth is not as good as 3% or 3.5% GDP growth. But the question we all got to ask ourselves for 2020 and beyond is, \"Where's GDP going? Is it going to stabilize at 2%? Or are trade wars or something else going to bring it down? Or are we going to get some clarification around these things that we get back to a more normalized sort of 3%-ish environment?\" Bill Crow : Alright, thanks for your thoughts. I appreciate it. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Brian Dobson with Nomura. Please go ahead. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Brian Dobson : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Some of your competitors have called out weakness in China as well. Do you think you could elaborate on what you're hearing from your people on the ground there regarding trends heading into next year? Arne Sorenson : We don't have anything that's terribly insightful, I think. Obviously, our RevPAR numbers in China were meaningfully better than the industry as a whole. And I think that's a sign of our strength. But the RevPAR numbers in China were not as good as they were a quarter ago and they were not as good as they were last year. And so I think that's a sign that when you look at the averages rolling up across that very big country, you're seeing somewhat more modest economic growth.  We\u2019ve got very topical things right now, trade war with China being one and Hong Kong, I think, being another example. Hong Kong performed fairly well in the second quarter, but obviously what's happening on the streets in Hong Kong today is not a positive sign for travel into that market. And so I suspect we'll see that Hong Kong weakens. And I think when you get to the trade war, the biggest question there is what does it mean for Chinese GDP growth? Not what does it mean for exports and imports, but what does it mean for Chinese GDP growth? And that has to be evaluated in the context of a shift by China towards more of a consumer-driven economy than they have experienced in years past. And I think that makes our industry perform a bit better in China and for China outbound markets than other industries in China. But I think all of those things put together and you've got some obvious risks in China, but you've also got some good albeit more modest, but you've got still continuing GDP growth. And China has got levers to pull to make sure that they continue to try and stimulate their economy. Leeny Oberg : The only thing I'll add to that is that our rooms growth there continues to be really robust. So as we look at the general pace of these rooms openings and our signings, again continues to be strong demand on the part of owners for new hotels of ours. Brian Dobson : Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then in terms of your balance sheet, would you consider getting a little bit more aggressive to retire shares? Leeny Oberg : You probably noticed in our comments that the quarter we made a slight moderation in our comments from at least $3 billion to approaching $3 billion. And that's really a reflection of not a fundamental difference in our point of view on capital return but more just the reality that our loyalty program is going to use a bit more cash than we had expected. And as you know, we dropped EBITDA a little bit. But we continue to refine our working capital numbers. We also refined our investment spending numbers a little bit. So generally I would say that our approach is quite similar to where we were a quarter and we\u2019re comfortably in our 3 to 3.5 leverage range, which is where we want to be. Brian Dobson : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario : Good morning everyone. Arne Sorenson : Hey, good morning. Michael Bellisario : Just to follow-up first on a prior question, is there any Marriott investment in the all inclusive deal? Arne Sorenson : There might be some modest key money, I don't remember in the context of that, not material, certainly. Michael Bellisario : Okay. Got it. And then just kind of along the same lines and maybe how you're thinking about using your balance sheet, any change in thinking about jump-starting growth or needing to invest dollars to get projects across the finish line? Arne Sorenson : No. In terms of the organic pipeline, no. We continue to work with our partners. And I think the majority of our deals come in with essentially no financial participation with us \u2013 from us, excuse me. I think there are a couple of places where we would like to do some things to reposition brands. I mean the Phoenix Sheraton obviously is the most recent one that we've done. I think we could see taking a calculated bet or two, albeit quite modest in terms of the size of our balance sheet, to prove some proof points that we would like to prove on some of the brands that we are trying to reposition and strengthen. But nothing that I think would be material in any long-term sense. Michael Bellisario : Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Great, thanks for taking my question. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Kevin Kopelman : Just a couple of follow-ups. On online travel agents, they were down 2% globally for you, how did that look in terms of North America versus international? And how are you thinking about the OTA channel in the back half as you the roll out of your kind of more advanced yielding programs? Arne Sorenson : I suspect it was down more in the U.S. than the rest of the world but somebody should test me on whether or not I've got that exactly right. But it is very much about what the factor you've talked about, which is yielding. And we are working with our OTA partners to make sure that we are getting business from them when we most need it and not necessarily taking it when we don't. And generally, I think that's working well. Kevin Kopelman : Do you think you'll keep yielding down even as you kind of even as you kind of lap over that? Arne Sorenson : Yes I don't know. I mean we'll have to watch that as we go forward. We did talk about the growth in our direct digital channels, we've talked about the growth in our Marriott Bonvoy penetration. I think both of those things over time if those trend lines continue the way that we think they should continue should make us less dependent on third party platforms. I think at the same time that you've got an underlying economic story here, which we'll have to watch and sort of evaluate. But I think we are trying to do the best we can in order to take business from these partners when it is particularly valuable to us, but essentially not take it when we don't need it. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks. And then just a, just a quick follow-up on the pipeline. Can you talk about trends or gross new approvals and signings? Last couple of years, you're about 125,000, I believe. First half of this year, strong but down a little bit. Can you just give us kind of an update on the environment for approvals and signings and outlook for the year? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I think generally we've been pleased by how robust the incoming in the pipeline is globally. And I think there is a continued shift towards us, maybe not towards us alone, but certainly Marriott has got a portfolio of quality brands. And I think we are seeing folks, particularly in more moderate economic climate, saying we've got to make sure we've got the right quality. I think also the brand lineup has been really powerful in the last few years. When you look at AC by Marriott, you look at Moxy Hotels, you look at Aloft and Element and what\u2019s happened with those brands since we closed on the Starwood acquisition, they are relatively underrepresented or unrepresented the end many markets around the world, including in North America. And I think we're seeing a number of our partners who say, that's a pretty interesting brand for me. It's now in the Marriott portfolio. So I get the benefit of the loyalty program and the reservation system and the like. And I want to be the one to take that brand in a given market. They are good brands for urban. There's obviously more value in selective element in urban markets as opposed to suburban markets. And so I think that's one of the reasons that the pipeline demand has stayed as robust as it has. Kevin Kopelman : Fantastic. Thanks Arne. Thanks Leeny. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Leeny Oberg : Take care. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquaire. Chad Beynon : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk broadly about trends domestically with your booking window on leisure and transient? We've heard from many of your competitors that this continues to compress and it's making it harder to forecast RevPAR and really maximize gross profit margin. Any major changes that you've seen in the past couple of months there? Leeny Oberg : Certainly not major, I mean it does at the margin on the transient side narrow a little bit. But I would really say not enough to be noticeable. Arne Sorenson : And I think you've got \u2013 if anything, you've got a little bit of probably lengthening of the group window, I think, the group bookings as we've talked about have been good. One of the frustrations for us over the years is we don't have that much forward-looking data because transient business, particularly business transient business is very near term in its booking. It always has been. Leisure transient can be quite a bit longer and group even longer still. And by and large, when we put together our set of expectations for Q3 and Q4, we're looking at the data that we have, which obviously is more relevant to Q3, for example, than it is to Q4. But we don't have that much that gives us certainty about what's to come. Chad Beynon : Great. Thanks. And then on China there's a couple of things. There's the trade war and then there's the economic declines that are going on. You've talked a lot about the RevPAR. What about food and beverage sales? What are you seeing there? And do you think that's more closely tied to what's going on with the GDP picture? Or could that reverse after a trade war resolution is finalized? Thank you. Arne Sorenson : Yes, we're seeing F&B probably grow at modestly higher rates than rooms revenue in China. I think the food and beverage is going to skew even a bit more towards the Chinese consumer. And again, that's a sign of the probably shift towards a consumer economy and the importance of that from a local population, particularly in the key cities, has got resources to do some of these things and they didn't in years past. So I don't think there's incremental risk in the food and beverage space compared to the rest of the hotel, maybe just the opposite. Chad Beynon : Thank you very much. Arne Sorenson : Alright thank you everybody for your time and patience this morning. We appreciate your interest in Marriott and look forward to welcoming you on your travel. Come stay with us. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your question, following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Arne Sorenson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead sir. Arne Sorenson : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Paugh, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Senior Director, Investor Relations. I should note that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued last night along with our comments today are effective only today November 5, 2019 and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks at www.marriott.com/investor. So let's get started. We were pleased with our results in the third quarter. Our global system-wide RevPAR rose 1.5% consistent with our guidance. Our global RevPAR index increased 210 basis points in the quarter with strength in the U.S., Asia Pacific and the Caribbean and Latin America. In the U.S. alone RevPAR index increased nearly 200 basis points in the quarter with U.S. transient index up 250 basis points. Marriott Bonvoy is on a roll. Global room revenue for Marriott Bonvoy members is up 12% year-to-date over the last nine months members contributed 52% of system-wide room nights, a 320 basis point increase year-over-year. In the U.S. alone members represented 58% of booked room nights in the nine months. Year-to-date loyalty point redemptions are up over 20%, driving better results at resorts and leisure destinations around the world. Social media feedback about the program has become decidedly favorable. In a recent survey of Bonvoy members by an eight to one margin. Respondent said, they preferred the new Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program over either Marriott Rewards or SPG. Over the last nine months, Marriott Bonvoy membership increased by 12 million members to reach 137 million members with nearly 40% of that increase coming from China including the meaningful contribution from our Alibaba joint venture. Earlier this year, we launched Homes and Villas by Marriott International, our home rental business with a growing number of premium homes and villas. Today we offer 5,000 homes in 190 markets across the U.S., Europe and the Caribbean and Latin America. In the third quarter over 95% of our home rentals were booked by Marriott Bonvoy members and nearly 30% of the home rentals were paid for with point redemptions. In another move popular with Bonvoy members, we recently announced our entry into the all-inclusive hotel business. After signing new management agreements for five new build, all-inclusive resorts located in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Last month we announced our offer to acquire Elegant Hotels, which owns and operates seven hotels in Barbados, which would jump-start our all-inclusive offering. We expect this acquisition will be completed by year-end 2019, subject to approval by Elegant's shareholders and satisfaction of other conditions. Our guests are increasingly booking online. Our direct digital channels leveraged the popularity of Marriott Bonvoy and offered the lowest cost per reservation. Those channels marriott.com and Marriott Mobile accounted for 32% of our room nights booked in the third quarter over 400 basis points higher year-over-year. Also in the quarter, the percentage of room nights booked through OTAs declined nearly 100 basis points. Incidentally earlier this year, we signed new agreements with Booking.com and Expedia, which we expect will result in better economics for our owners and give us enhanced control over how our products are presented by third-party sites. Our sales organization had a great quarter. For North America, new group business booked in the quarter for comparable hotels in all future periods increased 6% year-over-year. New revenue bookings made in the third quarter for 2020 increased 6% and new revenue bookings for 2021 rose 10%. We have opened many of our group sales offices during evenings and weekends to serve our customers at their convenience and to take advantage of the strong demand for our products. While our booking pace is down modestly for the fourth quarter 2019 due to the timing of holidays, booking pace for comparable hotels for 2020 is up at a mid-single-digit rate year-over-year. About two-thirds of the group business expected for the year is already booked. In the third quarter, we opened nearly 18,000 rooms more than any competitor worldwide. Our development pipeline increased to a record 495,000 rooms, 5% higher than the year-ago quarter, including 214,000 rooms under construction. Nearly 40% of the rooms in our pipeline are high value upper upscale and luxury rooms in high RevPAR markets. In 2019, we expect our room count will increase 5% to 5.25% net, reflecting increasing construction delays, offset by lower-than-expected room deletions. For 2020, we expect similar net rooms' growth. We continue to experience construction delays in North America, particularly in the top 25 markets as well as in the Middle East and Europe. Permitting issues are also contributing to groundbreaking delays, which impact openings for 2020, but signings are strong. In fact, 2019 room signings are approaching record 2018 levels. The vast majority of 2020 openings are already under construction. So, let's talk about 2020 RevPAR growth. Estimates for U.S. GDP growth point to a slower pace of economic growth in 2020 with lodging supply growth continuing at about 2%. This implies continuing, moderating RevPAR growth for the U.S. industry. At the same time, as I mentioned, our group revenue on the books in North America is quite strong, with booking pace up at a mid-single-digit rate. We are negotiating 2020 special corporate rates right now. And while only a few negotiations are complete, we expect 2020 special corporate rates will rise at a low single-digit rate. Recently announced U.S. government per diems, weighted by our market distribution are set to rise 1.4% for the government's upcoming fiscal year. Today, we are seeing good demand from both business and leisure transient customers, reflecting preference for our brands and our loyalty program. But given the meaningful unknowns in the economy, we are estimating North America RevPAR growth in 2020 will increase around the midpoint of our 0% to 2% global RevPAR guide. For our Asia Pacific region, we are modeling 2020 RevPAR growth at a low single-digit rate, reflecting strong growth in Beijing, South China Markets, India and Japan. Double-digit growth in room supply in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Maldives may constrain RevPAR growth in those countries next year. Recent events in Hong Kong make that market quite difficult to forecast. Our Hong Kong RevPAR declined 27% in the third quarter, albeit with a meaningful improvement in RevPAR Index as we outperformed the industry. We expect RevPAR at our Hong Kong hotels will decline roughly 40% in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2020, we are assuming a mid-single-digit RevPAR decline in the city. Obviously, any estimate for Hong Kong RevPAR performance is somewhat speculative. So, while we hope comparisons will ease in the second half of 2020, we are only making a modeling assumption. For next year, we expect Europe RevPAR will grow at a low single-digit rate, constrained by new supply in Germany and the U.K. RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa should be flat to up slightly in 2020 with continued supply growth in the Middle East and improving demand in Africa. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, RevPAR should increase at a low single-digit rate next year, reflecting more modest economic growth and political uncertainty in some markets. At the same time, the region will benefit from newly comp luxury hotels in Panama and Costa Rica. As you know, our business model is focused on managing and franchising the finest lodging brands. Our past results have demonstrated how this allowed us to perform well throughout economic cycles. Investors favor our business model because of this stability, but we are much more than this. We have the deepest hotel brand offering and broadest property distribution in the world, which contributes to our most valuable loyalty program. Worldwide loyalty penetration has been increasing all year and we believe there is further upside. Owners benefit from our strong RevPAR premiums and great economies of scale, particularly since our acquisition of Starwood. In North America, we have faced slowing industry RevPAR growth and rising wages for some time. Yet savings from our greater scale and implementation of best practices since 2016 have contributed 220 basis points of house profit margin lift at our managed hotels in North America. Today, the house profit margins for the Marriott Hotels brand in North America, for example is 150 basis points higher than at the last cyclical peak in 2007. Strong economic results for owners contribute to owner preference for our brands, increasing market share and our growing pipeline. While we have a 7% share of worldwide open rooms, we have a nearly 20% share of worldwide rooms under construction. We look for investment opportunities to leverage our distribution and our loyalty program, enhance our brands and drive shareholder value. We've announced two such opportunities just recently. Our acquisition of Elegant Hotels once complete will firmly establish our all-inclusive presence; and our purchase and reinvention of the W Hotel Union Square should enhance the value of the W Hotel brand. Our successful sale of the St. Regis New York and the 10 other hotels we have sold over the past three years demonstrates strong owner demand for our brands and our commitment to our management and franchise strategy. In total, we've monetized over 2.2 billion of assets since the acquisition of Starwood. To be sure roughly 7% of our total fees are incentive fees from North American hotels. These incentive fees are subject to an owner priority return and admittedly vary more that with RevPAR than basin franchise fees, but the downside is limited.  Further the long-term value to shareholders from these properties is meaningful as these are among our most prized and valuable hotels to our guests. As you can tell, I'm feeling very good about Marriott's prospects today and appreciate the company's compelling value. On a more personal note, I'm also appreciative for your many kind words of support. I've completed chemo, radiation and immunotherapy over the last six months. Next step is surgery. I've been working throughout and I'm still getting in my morning runs. I'm sorry, I'll have to miss our upcoming holiday party in New York, but expect to be with you on the next earnings call in February and look forward to seeing many of you in person in 2020. Before handling this over to Leeny, let me pause a moment to recognize Laura Paugh. Sadly this is her last quarterly earnings call. Laura was by my side for my first quarterly earnings call in October of 1998. She was already a veteran IR professional then and she has only gotten better and better in the 21 years, we have sat next to each other for these calls. Laura, thank you. If I may be so bold thank you from all of us at Marriott and from all of us in the industry. If we analyze our stock and the other securities in the hospitality interest \u2013 industry, you're simply the best. For more about the third quarter and our outlook here's Leeny. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Arne. Our third quarter financial performance was solid. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.47. While RevPAR growth and individual P&L line items were quite close to guidance, we were about $0.02 shy of the midpoint. Roughly $0.01 came from slightly higher-than-expected tax rate and a bit over $0.01 came from weaker-than-expected hotel performance in Hong Kong. Global system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 1.5% in the third quarter year-over-year. For North America alone RevPAR increased 1.3%. RevPAR growth exceeded our expectations in D.C., Houston and Hawaii on strong citywide and transient demand. On the other hand, New York City RevPAR continues to cope with both higher hotel supply and lower demand. RevPAR growth in Orlando and South Florida was constrained by death concern about Hurricane Dorian. RevPAR for our comparable hotels in the largest 25 markets increased 0.9% in the quarter. For group business in North America comparable hotel RevPAR rose 2%. Group cancellations remained modest and attendance at group meetings were strong. Transient RevPAR was up slightly year-over-year reflecting steady corporate demand and stronger demand from leisure travelers. In the Asia Pacific region system-wide constant dollar RevPAR increased nearly 2% in the third quarter constrained by events in Hong Kong and trade war impact on tertiary markets in China. Excluding Hong Kong, RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region increased nearly 3%. Larger markets in China were strong particularly Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Leisure demand for our hotels in China is growing and outbound room nights sold to mainland Chinese travelers in the region increased by 9% in the quarter with large numbers traveling to Japan, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia. In Europe system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 2% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, 4% excluding the impact of the World Cup in Russia last year. Europe continues to benefit from the strong dollar. Room nights sold to U.S. travelers increased 13% in the quarter with particularly strong loyalty redemption demand in Italy, Greece and Spain. London posted another strong quarter with RevPAR up 6% on strong U.S. and Middle Eastern, demand. In the Middle East and Africa region system-wide constant dollar RevPAR rose 2% in the third quarter with strong results in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt offset by weak performance in Dubai. In our Caribbean and Latin America region RevPAR rose 3% in the quarter with strong performance in Brazil. Our hotels in the Caribbean benefited from strong leisure demand and Mexico showed better result than in recent quarters. Gross fee revenues totaled $955 million in the third quarter consistent with our guidance and increased 2% over the prior year, reflecting unit growth and higher RevPAR. Residential branding fees declined $15 million, reflecting the uneven timing of residential projects from year-to-year. We continue to have a deep pipeline of residential projects under development. While total fees met our expectations in the quarter, incentive fees declined a bit more than we expected largely due to RevPAR and margin weakness in the Asia Pacific region. Arne discussed third quarter RevPAR performance for the Hong Kong market. Total fees from our Hong Kong hotels declined $3 million during the third quarter compared to the prior year and we estimate such fees could decline by $5 million in the fourth quarter. Currently for the full year 2019, we expect our dozen hotels in Hong Kong will contribute roughly $30 million in total fees. Owned leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled $67 million in the third quarter, a $15 million decline from the prior year largely due to lower termination fees. Results also reflected lower results in New York City and the impact of renovation at the Sheraton Grand Phoenix. Termination fees totaled $11 million in the quarter compared to $23 million in the prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was flat year-over-year reflecting $15 million lower residential branding fees, $12 million lower termination fees and $17 million lower incentive fees offset by rooms and RevPAR growth. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was a bit higher-than-expected due to a slightly different geographic mix of business. Compared to the prior year, our 2019 third quarter adjusted tax provision was higher, mainly due to prior year tax benefits from dispositions. Let's talk about the fourth quarter. For North America, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR will increase by 0% to 1% year-over-year. Shifting holidays and other calendar anomalies should constrain RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, but we should also benefit from favorable comparisons to last year's strikes. For the Asia Pacific region, many economists expect China's economy will continue to weaken in the fourth quarter, which could further pressure RevPAR in China's secondary markets. With ongoing weakness in Hong Kong overall Asia Pacific RevPAR in the fourth quarter could be flat to down modestly. Excluding Hong Kong, we expect RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region will increase at a low single-digit growth rate. We expect fourth quarter RevPAR in Europe will continue to grow at a low to mid single-digit rate with strong results in Venice, London and Moscow. Middle East and Africa RevPAR should decline at a low single-digit rate in the fourth quarter reflecting continued supply pressure in the UAE, while RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America should increase at a low single-digit rate benefiting from strong citywide events in Santiago in Rio de Janeiro and a strong holiday season in Aruba and Grand Cayman. For the fourth quarter 2019, we believe gross fee revenue will total $960 million to $970 million, up 5% to 7% over the prior year's quarter due to RevPAR and unit growth. This is at least roughly $20 million lower than our last guidance at the midpoint, largely due to more modest RevPAR growth, the fee impact of events in Hong Kong and unfavorable foreign exchange. We expect total incentive fees will be flattish in the fourth quarter. While incentive fees will be constrained by the RevPAR environment, fourth quarter IMF will also be helped by comparisons to last year's strikes and international unit growth. We continue to believe credit card fees could total $400 million to $410 million for the full year 2019. Owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses could total $85 million in the fourth quarter compared to $88 million in the prior year's fourth quarter reflecting $5 million to $10 million lower termination fees. Fourth quarter 2019 owned leased results also reflect the sale of the St. Regis New York and the purchase of the W Union Square. G&A should total $250 million to $255 million in the fourth quarter 3% to 5% over the prior year and consistent with our prior fourth quarter guidance. With these expectations, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter should total $898 million to $913 million, a 4% to 6% increase over the prior year's quarter. We expect our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter will be 25%, an increase over the prior year due to higher favorable discrete items in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is also a bit higher than our last guidance. These assumptions yield $1.44 to $1.47 diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter flat to up modestly from the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA will total $3.572 billion to $3.587 billion, a 3% increase over the prior year. And diluted earnings per share will total $5.87 to $5.90. Our full year diluted earnings per share guidance includes the impact of gains on sales of assets totaling $0.02 per share in 2019 compared to $0.65 per share in 2018. Our 2019 earnings guidance does not reflect a gain on the sale of the St. Regis New York, which we expect will be significant. As always, our 2019 guidance does not include merger-related costs or reimbursed revenues and expenses or additional asset sales. Total investment spending for 2019 could total $1 billion to $1.1 billion including roughly $225 million of maintenance spending an estimated $199 million for Elegant Hotels' equity and debt and the purchase of the W New York - Union Square for $206 million. We expect $550 million to $600 million of this total investment spending should be reimbursed for recycle over time. We sold the St. Regis New York last week for $310 million subject to a long-term management agreement. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 14.2 million shares for $1.83 billion. And we expect cash return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends will approach $3 billion in 2019. This assumes no asset sales in 2019 beyond those already completed. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At September 30, our debt ratio was within our targeted credit standard of 3.0 to 3.5 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR. So before we take your questions, I want to also thank Laura for her innumerable contributions to Marriott. Personally, I want to thank her for her incredible mentorship to me over the years. It's hard for all of us to imagine life at Marriott without her guidance, her steady pen and her wit, but we'll try hard to make her proud. So that we can take -- speak with you as many as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Instinet. Harry, your line is open. Laura Paugh : You're open, Harry. Harry Curtis : Can you hear me? How is that? Arne Sorenson : Now we got you. Laura Paugh : Hey, Harry. Harry Curtis : All right. All right. Technology problem here. Yes. Laura, you've been a great resource and partner over the years. Thank you very much. Laura Paugh : Thank you, Harry. Great working in with you. Harry Curtis : I appreciate that. So just a couple of quick questions. First, Arne, you were talking about corporate negotiated rates and in that process, are you guys getting any sense of the -- if whether or not the political environment is holding back travel budgets or investment by your customers? And what would it take to improve that sentiment? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I don't -- there is a little bit more apprehension, I suppose, and that we pick up. I'm not certain so much in the special rate negotiations directly as it is in just the conversations we're having with senior members of the American business community. I think that apprehension is a little bit about politics, but the way you framed it, maybe makes it almost sound a little bit too general. I think it is more focused on the trade dynamic probably than politics generally. And, of course, we've got every day news about whether or not we're nearing a trade deal. I think, if we get to a trade deal, obviously, that will be meaningful even if it's a relatively small deal. But having said that, while apprehension is a bit higher, I think, absolute performance of the U.S. economy is still quite robust. It may not be reflecting the kind of growth we'd like to see on a year-over-year basis. But whether you're looking at our industry or the economy more broadly, I think you see obviously low unemployment in our industry, you see high occupancy, you see absolute performance that is fairly meaningful. And so I think we would characterize this and you can sort of sense it in what we said to expect in terms of year-over-year increases in revenue coming from those special corporate accounts. But it feels like a cautious but steady move into 2020 from 2019, expecting a bit more of the same as opposed to something declining. Harry Curtis : Very good. And my second question, shifting gears, relates to the connection, if there is any, between the growth in Bonvoy members and correlation to credit card fees, growth in credit card fees. And as we -- you've shown a terrific increase in the number of your members. Is there -- or would you expect there to be some correlation to growth in credit card fees to a similar degree in 2020 and beyond. Arne Sorenson : Well, obviously, we had a gonzo year in 2018, when you looked at the way the credit card made contributions to us compared to before. And, of course, that was because we had renegotiated deals with both of our credit card partners. And we're in market with new limited time offers and other things that we're moving that quite robustly. Growth rates in 2019, by comparison, have been maybe a tad better than growth in total lodging fees, but not dramatically different. We have, of course, have got internal discussions underway where we're looking at what we might budget for 2020. It's a little too early to talk about that in any sort of particular ranges, but we think there is more opportunity for these credit cards as the program gets that much more powerful. Our penetration of total Bonvoy members is very light. Our penetration of the heavy travelers is obviously more significant. But I think we'll look for opportunities to grow that contribution in 2020 and probably in a number of years beyond that. Harry Curtis : Very good. Thanks very much, everyone. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz of Jefferies. David Katz : Hi. Good morning everyone. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. David Katz : Laura I just want to thank you for being patient in explaining to me synfuel, timeshare and any other detail. And for being the best caller-backer of all time. Laura Paugh : Thank you, Dave. David Katz : All the best. I wanted to just go back Arne to a comment you made in your opening remarks about margins being up 150 basis points versus 2007. Obviously, we're comparing a different business today, but I have sort of gone back and looked at what the incentive fees were and trying to compare that on a -- some kind of a per room basis. I got about halfway through that analysis and it became my turn. Help me sort of compare what the incentive fee generation is today and how we would put that in context for where you think we are in the cycle versus that 2007. I just found that comment interesting and would love to elaborate on it a little bit more. Arne Sorenson : Yes. So a couple of things. I'll repeat a couple of things I said in the prepared remarks. So we have calculated -- obviously we're talking here about hotel-level margin performance which is really about managed hotels and principally until a comment coming up is about North America. And two things. One is we've tried to calculate what margin performance is driven by RevPAR and then what margin performance is driven by implement assets we've been able to implement because of the Starwood transaction. And that difference is about 220 basis points in North America. So, we think about 220 basis points or two full points of GOP margin has been delivered because of that. In part because, of that we end up with nominal GOP gross operating profit at the hotel level up 150 basis points from the peak in 2007. Now that's an average number. It covers a lot of variables across different markets in the United States. We know that New York for example with both substantial cost growth which has experienced in the last decade not just in wages and benefits but also in property taxes and compounded with some supply growth. We have seen more pressure there on house profit margins compared to peak than we have in some other markets. Now when it, gets to incentive fees this becomes a global story of course. And what we've seen is a continued meaningful shift from U.S. derived fees to international derived fees. And while it would be an oversimplification to say that all international IMF is less risky than domestic IMF certainly on average terms it is significantly more stable through the cycles than the American IMFs are. Why? Because typically in the United States you would have an owner's priority. And until you fill that owner's priority bucket we get nothing, where in much of the rest of the world, the incentive management fee formula gives us a share of profits from the first get-go. Leeny Oberg : So just a couple of more things to add to that David that you may find helpful which is the switch from kind of what used to be two-thirds North America total incentive fees to now one-third which will -- absolutely we expect to be the case in 2019 that only one-third of the incentive fees are coming from North America. One of the interesting things when you look at Q3 is that actually the percentage of international hotels earning incentive fees increased from 73% to 75%, while not surprisingly in the U.S. they declined from 52% to 41%. So all of this again points to Arne's theme about the predominance of owner's priorities in our North America managed hotels while outside the U.S. it's much more that on dollar one of profits we earn an incentive fee albeit a lower percentage of overall profit. David Katz : Super helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Two questions or one question one follow-up. First is just looking at removals in the system this quarter it looks like the lowest rate in a couple of years. And just wondering if that was just a timing issue or if there's sort of a change in either properties in the system that are willing to make reinvestments? Or are you more lenient with not forcing some removals. So I just wanted to get some color there. And then I do have a follow-up as well. Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Okay. Great. Thanks Robin. No, you hit the nail on the head in terms of that we are expecting a lower rate of deletion from the system this year certainly than last year which approached 2% and was disproportionately related to the legacy Starwood Hotel portfolio. And this year we are looking at that being much closer to 1%. We've been giving guidance for the year of 1% to 1.5%, but as we've moved through the year and continue to have conversations with owners, we're continuing to see that many of these hotels are staying in our system. It is not a function of u0s being more lenient relative to the kind of investment required for these hotels as we've talked to you there's been tremendous investment for example in the Sheridan portfolio as many of those hotels are either undergoing renovation or we've got agreements for them to undergo renovation. I think we are thinking this early in the budget process as we look at 2020 and it's really too early to say anything more than a fairly stable historic rate that would be 1% to 1.5%. Obviously, of course, it will be great if it turns out lower, but we do think for this year it is going to end up towards that lower range. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up you talked a little bit already about incentive management fees. Just thinking about 2020 next year and you've only given the RevPAR guidance. Is it \u2013 should we be thinking about maybe fee growth not being at the same level as this year's 5% just given that if expenses continue to go up in North America just the issues that you highlighted in this quarter with incentive management fee Hong Kong where it sounds like RevPAR really expected to decline next year? And then expenses in North America we saw the pressure on North American property margins this year house margins this year. Does it seem like the expectation for fee growth next year would be lower than this year's growth rate? Arne Sorenson : I think it'd be too early to conclude that. I mean, let's be mindful of the fact we are heavily into the budget process right now, but we're not completed yet. And of course we've got a sense, which we've shared with you this morning of a RevPAR range which we think is germane to the way we think about 2020. But the teams around the world are working to sort of run that through each of their businesses and individual hotels for that matter just to where it pulls together and settles. But I would think that lodging fee growth there's every reason to believe it will be positive and should be broadly comparable to what we experienced in 2019. Leeny Oberg : As you know, we had a couple of oddball items like FX and changes in termination fees and shifts in residential branding fees that impacted. And all of those things will need to be taken into consideration as we look at next year. But the fundamental model of RevPAR and unit growth would get you certainly to something that looks quite similar to this year on that part alone. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Smedes Rose : I wanted to just ask a little bit about just the Sheraton and the Westin brands if you look at the year-to-date performance at least measured by RevPAR I mean, they're struggling versus what you've seen at the Marriott brand specifically. And is there anything that you would expect to be doing differently or something that's underway maybe that will help kind of close the performance gap in terms of percentage changes as you move forward? Or any thoughts since you acquired these brands? Arne Sorenson : Yeah. It's a good question and it does \u2013 it's a logical question given the RevPAR numbers by brand that we share in the press release. I think one of the things that we were most gratified by in Q3 we obviously talked about [Audio Gap]. But we saw index growth in both legacy Starwood and legacy-Marriott portfolios. And that is a pretty powerful sign that we think this experiment is working well. And it's going to work well we think for both portfolios if you look at it that way. I think what Sheraton and Westin are probably quite different in this regard. Westin is impacted by the law of small numbers to some extent more than Sheraton is. So the smaller the portfolio the more you've got some variability based on geography alone that can often have an impact to the reported RevPAR numbers. Sheraton obviously is a bigger brand. You still have some geographic differences there that are relevant. I think the other thing we've got is we've got a good amount of renovation activity underway in the Sheraton brand which does have an impact on the margins on the way RevPAR is posted in any given quarter. That might be short-term pain, but clearly it is long term very much to our advantage. But again, I think the \u2013 if you put a point out and said, well, how does Sheraton repositioning going in? We're really actually quite encouraged. The \u2013 a piece of that is implied by Leeny's comments about relatively lower deletions from the system. I think what we're seeing from our ownership community generally is a positive support for where we're taking the brand and an acknowledgment that that means capital needs to be brought in and those brands \u2013 those hotels need to be brought up to the kind of standards we're setting for the brand going forward. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thanks. And then can I just follow up quickly? You're continuing to expand your all-inclusive presence. From a valuation perspective it looks, I mean, that was just pretty \u2013 clearly pretty compelling and I'd imagine there's a lot of synergies there. But I wanted to ask it's a big sort of concentration in Barbados. Not as big as \u2013 it's not the biggest destination for U.S. tourists as it is for European. And I mean, I guess kind of what is your goal here? Is this just sort of set up a platform for other folks to come to you now and sort of say, we want to be a part of this? Or kind of what's the endgame ultimately? Arne Sorenson : Yeah. I mean, the \u2013 obviously, all-inclusive has grown very steadily over the course of the last couple of decades I suppose and we've watched it develop. It is almost by definition a purely leisure brand. I mean, there are certainly some hotels that are getting some group business that is not leisure but it is heavily a leisure play. We are really encouraged by the Bonvoy strength which we've talked about this morning, which really in some respects is about recognizing business travelers by giving them the kind of experiences they want, when they're taking their leisure trips. And with lifestyle and luxury and resort portfolio that we've got in our hotel portfolio, we've already got tremendous things to offer there. But we can see that in the all-inclusive space there's another thing that we would like to be able to offer which is a connection with the loyalty program for an all-inclusive stay which many, many travelers like to have. I think the bet we're making with Elegant is not as concentrated as it might seem. Well it's a handful of hotels in that market. It's only about 700 rooms total. So we're not in any way concerned about our ability to continue both to market that in the UK, which has been the strongest source market for those hotels, but increasingly open that market up to American travelers who will find the paradise of Barbados I think as attractive as many of the other markets in the region. And then I think we'll continue to move. I think the theory has been well-recognized for a number of years and that is -- isn't it obvious that hotel loyalty programs should be able to deliver good cost-effective volumes all-inclusive hotels. And I don't know that anybody has really proven that yet. Obviously some of our hotel competitors are already in with a handful of all-inclusive hotels, but I think it's still early for all of us. And we want to make sure that we get in there that we use our management team to both learn the differences in this business, but to also be able to make sure we can deliver our customer to these kinds of hotels. And I think we'll be able to do that. Smedes Rose : All right. Thanks. And Laura best of luck on your next adventure. Laura Paugh : Thanks, Smedes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff of JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : Good morning, everybody and Laura, I just want to add you will be missed. So thank you for all your help over the years. Laura Paugh : Thanks, Joe. Joseph Greff : Arne, you talked about construction delays earlier in the call. Can you talk about how much of it is related to operating expenses or construction costs and finding labor versus owners just maybe cooling things a little bit in light of macro uncertainty? And then how much confidence do you have in terms of that there's a plateau in the delay of some of these new openings as you look out to 2020? Arne Sorenson : So in fairness a good question, Joe. The -- obviously we're disappointed by this too and a quarter ago and probably two quarters ago too. We were asked about net unit growth in 2020 or in the years ahead compared to 2019. And based on the multiyear planning that we've done much of which we've shared with you when we do analyst meeting and also just based on the obvious which is that the pipeline in aggregate size is very big and we've been signing high-quality deals every year. And while every year is not a record we have been in many respects surprised to the upside about how the new projects are coming into the pipeline. And that continues well into 2019 even with the sort of apprehension in the market. So all of those things caused us to be not just hopeful, but to have some factual underpinning thinking that we were going to see unit growth step up in 2020 and years beyond from the levels we're today. And obviously, we've given you our first look at 2020 this morning or in our release last night. And I have said we now expect it to be roughly comparable negative growth rates next year as this year, which I know is disappointing to folks. We're still early in the process so we should mention that. We don't -- we've not finalized our budget plan. I think that as we've said in the past and every quarter we go through the entire portfolio pipeline. And we add new units based on signings that have been done we subtract units when they open and we subtract a few that are killed every quarter. The number that we've canceled this last category is really not moving. So we're not seeing the worst news driving this which is that deals are being abandoned. Instead, what we're seeing is sort of all of the above for delays. And by that I mean, you've got a piece of it which is about the greater upper-upscale and luxury mix that is in our pipeline; greater urban mix which is in our pipeline where permitting and construction often takes longer. You've got continued high construction costs in many markets around the world which our owners are trying to make sure that they manage well offset a little bit by continued high availability of debt financing at pretty attractive terms. And then lastly I think you do have some apprehension about the economy generally. And so I think there are some owners it varies a little bit by market-to-market, but some owners who will look and say, I do intend to do this project. I'm going to move forward with it. But I'm going to do it maybe with a bit more deliberate speed than I would have if I was really 100% convinced that I needed to cap it -- capture this thing right away. It is an American phenomenon, but it is also increasingly a global phenomenon. Because I think we are seeing the same dynamic play out probably in the Middle East and Europe next to the United States, but we're seeing these trends sort of take place around the world. Joseph Greff : Excellent. Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, it looks like based on your disclosures in the press release that the buyback activity moderated somewhat meaningfully quarter to-date. And I know the capital return commentary is left intact. If you could just help us understand; one, am I interpreting that correctly? And two maybe what drove this sort of slowdown in 4Q-to-date buyback activity. Leeny Oberg : Sure Joe, happy to. As you can imagine kind of in between every month we're constantly assessing the cash that we need for investment, the timing of that investment, as well as the timing of asset dispositions and just the general flow of cash from operations. And the reality is, we got bit a bit by the timing of both our commitment on Elegant and on Union Square and not really wanting to count on cash in the door until it actually showed up. So there isn't really any message at all relative to the timing of quarter to-date. And if you look at our first three quarters they are actually quite even except for Q1, where we were a bit more accelerated in Q1, because as you remember we started off the year with a leverage ratio that was really down towards the lower end of our 3.0 to 3.5. So as we talked about, it's the same expectation for overall level of capital return to shareholders as it was last time. And generally, the new CapEx that we've talked about is offset by the disposition that we had last week. Joseph Greff : Great. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning guys. The acceleration of the RevPAR index gain was pretty meaningful in the quarter. Was that driven more by the sales momentum you talked about or by better customer engagement with Bonvoy? Arne Sorenson : It was driven by both, but I think the Bonvoy piece is probably the broadest in its extent. That is very much a global phenomenon where penetration from the loyalty program went up meaningfully in essentially every market around the world. Our group sales at the same time which is a function of the sales force obviously is stronger than the transient categories of business, but by a point or so not dramatically and certainly not capable of explaining all of that index growth, if you will for the quarter. Anthony Powell : Got it. And you mentioned that the loyalty redemptions were up 20% in the quarter. Was some of that growth due to the fact that customers may be pulling forward some bookings ahead of changes like peak and off-peak redemptions and penetrate upper comps in the future? Arne Sorenson : Yes. The redemptions have been high this year. I think a big chunk of it is simply the stability of the program now and the ability of customers from legacy SPG and legacy Marriott rewards to experiment with a broader portfolio. And that's been very interesting to see and there's some obvious examples. Starwood for example had the Great Chica Collection in Italy principally. But Southern Europe glorious hotels and suddenly that's opened up to a huge number of legacy Marriott Rewards members. And they say, these are places that we want to try and experiment with. I think there is probably some on-sale aspect also that moved that. I think some of the bookings that could have been made through the first part of 2019 probably not into the middle of 2019 allowed some of the highest category hotels to be -- and this is not about peak/off-peak pricing, but it's about the former highest category hotels. They were on sale a little bit based on the way the minutia of those formula work. And I think you have some extraordinarily sophisticated folks who watch these loyalty programs and thought this is a good time to reserve some of those redemption stays for that kind of hotel. But I suspect, we will see pretty robust redemption activity as a steady state aspect of a loyalty program going forward. Anthony Powell : Got it. Did the mix of redemptions in the system increased significantly this year? Or was it kind of similar to prior years in terms of overall? Arne Sorenson : Well all redemptions are up, but they're up not just in luxury and upper upscale, but they're also up in the select service space. Leeny Oberg : And there's meaningful crossover which is great to see. So you've got former Marriott Rewards members going to legacy Starwood hotels and vice versa in meaningful nights. Anthony Powell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hey good morning. You were very active on the transaction front so just a couple of questions on that. Do you expect to do any more single-asset transaction in the near term? And then when you think bigger picture are you returning to your historical practice of doing a larger bolt-on transaction or small to medium-sized bolt-on transaction every year? And then, how are you thinking about larger-scale M&A like Starwood? Thank you. Arne Sorenson : I mean I'm going to say something general, and then Leeny will jump in here, and give you something that's more precise. But, we have, obviously, the capacity given our size to make some modest investments in positioning the company for accelerated growth going forward. And so, the deals we've announced, for example, in the last four to six weeks really proved that out. They are about positioning us well for the all-inclusive space, which we've talked about already this morning and making sure what we do what we want to do for the W brand, particularly in North America where we want to make sure that we invest in the strength of that brand, which has been a juggernaut for Starwood for many years; but do that in a market like New York where it is really important that we have a flagship that we feel great about. And so, both of those opportunities stepped up. We, of course, looked at them in the context of how does that individual deal value for us long-term. What's the strategy for it? But more than that we look at it in the context of are we strengthening the platform for us to grow in the future. Leeny, I don't know what should add to that. Leeny Oberg : Yeah. No, the only thing is to your basic question, the answer is no. We're not changing the business model, whatsoever, relative to the asset-light business model. We actually own 14 hotels today, which is the same that we owned a quarter ago as we bought one and resold one. And as Arne said, it's seven hotels on for Elegant, but they total only a small number of rooms. So, it continues to be the same which is that we are opportunistic whether it\u2019d be bolt-on or whether it\u2019d be single-asset purchases. They're very much done from a strategic lens, but also with a view that we are not moving at all from our asset-light model. Thomas Allen : Helpful, thanks for the color. And then, just a quick one. You highlighted in the prepared remarks that in 2019 you expect to earn $30 million from fees from Hong Kong. What was that in 2018? And do you have guarantees on those hotels? And so, just help us think about like the potential volatility in that number would be great. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : So, as we talked about, first of all, the break is that it's $30 million, which is kind of probably 65-35 between base fees -- base in franchise fees versus incentive fees. What we talked about is them being down $3 million in Q3 and $5 million in Q4. My guess is they were expected to be up a little bit this year. So, that's going to say on a net basis that they're probably down, I don't know, $5-ish million for the year this year. And then, obviously as we go forward, we'll have to see what next year brings. We don't have any meaningful sort of guarantees that would remotely be something that would kind of give you pause. We do have a JV, the Sheraton Hong Kong JV, which was impacted in Q3, and we'll be -- expect impacts into Q4 from those JV earnings. But again, these are all relatively small amounts when you're looking at only 12 hotels overall. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Graham of Goldman Sachs. Steven Grambling : This is Steven Grambling, so maybe that's me. Thanks for getting me in. Thank you, Laura for all of your insight and humor. Maybe that was one last thing to mess with me. Arne Sorenson : I promise. She didn\u2019t. But I promise you she didn\u2019t do that. Steven Grambling : First on David's first question on house margins, how much of the improvement has been driven solely by RevPAR in the economic expansion versus benefits to owners through increased sale credit card negotiations OTA renegotiations, et cetera? Arne Sorenson : Well, so the 220 basis points is all the latter, okay? That's an effort to calculate the margin, cumulative margin impact since we closed the Starwood deal, excluding the impact from RevPAR. And if you take that number and the 150 basis points, the absolute improvement in margins versus 2007, it would suggest that 100% of it -- a bit more than 100% of that difference is driven by the deal that we've done and the steps we've been able to take since then. Does that answer your question, Steve. Steven Grambling : Yeah, that does. That's perfect. And then second on Thomas' question about capital intensity. Is there a rule of thumb to think about for the combined CapEx software investment contract acquisition costs? As we move forward, given the increase over the past two years, seems like we should be moving to a more normalized level? Arne Sorenson : That's a good question. I mean I think the capital spending we do -- we've talked quite a bit this morning about some of the unusual deals. So, let's ignore it first, because that's been talked about. Leeny Oberg : Yes. The normal $650 million to $750 million that we've talked about on an annual basis and that we talked about at the security analyst meeting is still the appropriate number for what we think for ongoing organic growth of our business of which roughly, call it, $225 million is normal maintenance CapEx for our corporate systems as well as for our owned leased hotels. So, the rest is as you know there's a good chunk of key money and then bps that are either for equity investing as well as for loans and guarantees. And again as we talked about today for example in this year if you're talking about roughly $1 billion to $1.1 billion, we would expect as much as $600 million of that could be should be recycled over time. Stephen Grambling : Helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : Laura, thank you again. Certainly thank you for taking and promptly answering my many obscure questions over these years. Laura Paugh : It's been fun Patrick. Patrick Scholes : Thank you. Arne a question for you on that strong group pace for next year. How much of that strength do you see is driven by political conventions and the like? Arne Sorenson : I don't think much. I'm not sure I actually know for a certainty. But certainly over time a presidential election year is not a great year for Washington D.C., for example, all other things being equal because by and large the politicians are out on the hustings as opposed to hanging out in Washington. And so we obviously have a substantial presence including group hotels in Washington. I don't know what their bookings are for next year, but I would guess that it is sort of less than average. And I think when you look at the rest of the country, of course, you'll have two conventions in two individual cities which will be good for that. But I think overwhelmingly what we're talking about is corporate and association business. It's not about the political environment. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you for your color on that. Arne Sorenson : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning everybody and Laura I wanted to pass along my congratulations as well. And I'm sure I think 11 years ago we were talking about incentive management fees. So, I feel like it's an appropriate time to ask about incentive management fees. So, I just wanted to kind of dig in a little bit. Arne, I think you gave some color earlier in the Q&A about just sort of the breakdown in mix between domestic today versus where it was previously in international. As we look at what was kind of provided at the Securities Analyst Day though and we think about like the environment that we're in it does feel like we're sort of running below the level of targets where we thought maybe a 1% RevPAR environment we might be able to get to let's call it mid-single-digit type IMF growth and it feels harder and harder to kind of hit that. So, just could you break that down a little bit more? Is there a specific area that you think is kind of either trending below what you thought or missing expectation? Is it just across the board that there's a little bit more leverage in the model than you kind of thought there was? Or just kind of how you break that down for us. Arne Sorenson : So, maybe we should decide right now that we'll invite Laura back in a decade and we can talk about incentive management fees and what would that be 2029 or something like that. The -- and one context-setting comment before answering your question, obviously, the incentive fees are skewed towards -- by definition they are always on managed hotels not franchised hotels. And they skew towards more significant markets think of the top 25 in the United States or very well-established resort destinations. And they skew towards upper-upscale and luxury hotels all around the world. And it is those hotels which deliver disproportionately higher fees per room to us than our competitors or others in the industry will experience from the brands that they've got. So, while there is a bit more volatility in incentive management fees for obvious reasons, they come from the bottom line not the topline. They are in every instance fees we would just as soon be earning because they are economically additive to us and because they are strategically additive to us because those hotels make an extraordinary amount of difference. Leeny and Laura and Betsy and I were talking this morning actually I think if you go back and look at the securities analyst meeting and the 1% scenario, we're performing right in line with that at least in terms of total fees. There may be some variability in which of the three fee lines is contributing to that, but broadly we're within the range of what we've talked about. And so there's nothing here that we're going to be able to say to you this morning that gives you tremendously more clarity than what you know to be the obvious which is that when you're in a low year-over-year RevPAR environment with expenses growing at meaningfully faster rate than RevPAR is that that's going to have an impact to Marriott and its incentive fees just the way it's going to have an impact to the owner and their contribution from that hotel. Now, there are some things which exacerbated here a little bit one way or another. Hong Kong we've talked about at length this morning would have had a disproportionate impact in Q3 albeit modest. I suspect the impact in Q4 will be more significant than in Q3 because the performance there is going to be that much worse in Q4. And then you go around the rest of the world and you'll see different performance in different markets. New York, we've talked about too New York will be a place where because of anemic RevPAR growth or modest declines even in RevPAR. And cost increases the incentive fee contribution from the hotels that are in incentive fees in New York will be disproportionately weaker than they would be in other markets around the world. Leeny Oberg : The only thing I'd add to that is that when we look at 2019's expected full year fees, we actually at this point would expect that international incentive fees will go up year-over-year. They won't go up a lot but they will go up. And that represents two things. First of all the different quality of the incentive fees as we've talked about earlier much less of an owner's priority characteristic. And number two, in general, our managed footprint is growing faster outside the U.S. than it's growing inside the U.S. So again, when you look at those security analysts' forecast or expect models that we put out earlier this year, one of the things to remember is that we are expecting unit growth outside the U.S. to be faster than inside the U.S., which again has this difference in the characteristics over the incentive fees. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Arne it's good to hear from you. I'm glad all is trending as we've hoped so far. And Laura just echo everyone's comments. It's been fantastic. Congrats and best wishes to you. Laura Paugh : Thanks Jared. Jared Shojaian : In the 2020, 0% to 2% RevPAR guidance, can you parse out the impact from group business transient and leisure transient? And if I just take your group commentary, which seems really strong and your special corporate rates being up low single-digits, it would seem like leisure is not as strong. So correct me if I'm wrong on that. Arne Sorenson : Yes. You're testing us a little bit given we have not done our budgets yet for next year. I mean I think it's -- I think you're going to infer from what we've said that group may be the strongest contributor if you will to that 0% to 2% range that we gave for next year. I think it would be far too soon to suggest that that implies that leisure transient is meaningfully weaker than business transient. Obviously, we're going to see the way the year actually evolves but we're also going to see the way the completion of our budget season evolves. And again -- but behind that average of 0% to 2%, you're going to see some markets that are lower than that 0% and some markets that are higher than the 2% based upon market dynamics, which may have something to do with convention centers or group booking pace for that individual market or the strength of the sort of local drivers of those economies as opposed to some other economies. So I would -- while group I think will be among the strongest segments for us. I don't think it means that the others are necessarily going to be down. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you. And just a follow-up on that. I mean, if I look around at other travel industries, leisure travel in general I think still seems to be quite strong. You've got the theme of experiences. You've got the boomers retiring. That seems to be a little in contrast to some of the things we're seeing on the hotel side. Do you think some of the -- I guess call it leisure softness maybe not as strong as what we're seeing with group and the like? Do you think any of that could be related to I guess home rental starting to gain a little bit of a bigger share of the hotel pie here in recent years? Arne Sorenson : Yes. I don't -- and that's one reason I answered your first question the way I did is we don't see leisure has been weak. We see -- and again I'm probably talking a little bit about the American situation at this point but probably we can expand it to some other parts of the world as well. I think that the -- what we see is our leisure customer is out on the road and they are staying with us and they're taking their vacations. Yes of course, some are doing home rentals when they travel as well. That is I think particularly more relevant for those that are most cost-sensitive, not for those who are most interested in a great experience if you will. And of course that's one of the reasons we've decided to get into this space ourselves to deliver something which is more predictable as a great experience and more tied for travelers who are interested in more than just the cheapest rate that they can possibly get. But I think leisure remains strong. We -- I met with some senior folks coming out of China not so long ago. And I think if you look at China outbound travel which is often leisure, the global numbers are still quite respectable. Arrivals in Europe from China of course are much stronger than arrivals in the United States are from China and there are a number of reasons for that. But I would characterize really the leisure customer generally as being quite healthy. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill Crow : Good morning. Laura, I jumped on your bandwagon but I've been on it for 20 years now and thanks for the ride. Arne, strength and wisdom to the doctors. My question -- first question really has to do with incentive management fees go back to that topic. What is the mark-to-market on an expiring management fee? In other words, those that were signed 20 years ago or 25 or 30 years ago we know the economics were really good at Marriott. But as they mature, as they expire what does that change? What's the delta? Arne Sorenson : That's a good question Bill. I mean, I don't think that's terribly germane to what we're experiencing today, okay? So the performance in our global incentive fee line is not being driven by a mark-to-market of a significant number of managed hotels for example. So I would suggest this question be viewed a little bit more abstractly than that. And there I think it's going to vary a little bit by part of the world. Leeny mentioned that about two-thirds of our incentive fees now are coming from outside the United States. Those contracts are -- they're not all uniform, of course, but we're signing brand new hotels coming into our system with incentive fee formulas and real contributions from them about similar to many of the hotels we signed a decade ago, which are in. And so I don't think there's a meaningful mark-to-market risk there long term. I think if you look in the United States or to some extent in Europe, there are some above market deals that we did a long time ago. Sometimes they were assets that we controlled and sold. And as those mature, I suspect that owners will try and reduce incentive fees there. Now to be fair, owners will always try and reduce the net level of fees that they're paying, not just incentive fees but the top line fees as well. And the negotiations there really are about what, kind of, value do your brands and does your loyalty program deliver and what are they worth. And a long-winded way of saying, of course, if some of those contracts were terminated today and start all over again, I suspect that they would start with a similar formula for incentive fees but probably with a starting point, which is lower than what they're achieving today. Bill Crow : All right. And my follow-up quickly and if I missed it I apologize. But could you talk about capital return for 2020 given some of the other comments you made about trends being similar next year to this year? Any reason to suspect that you won't return $3 billion or so in capital? Leeny Oberg : Yeah, I think from a model standpoint that you're right, the fundamentals in many respects when you think about EBITDA growth and the kind of RevPAR and unit growth numbers that we've talked about that makes sense. But a couple of caveats for you Bill. First of all, we haven't gotten into the detailed planning that we're thinking about whether it's cash taxes or net working capital and the loyalty program and all that. So for the moment let's assume, we're talking kind of more of the same. And the only comment I would make is to remember that we started out this year really at the lower end of our classic 3.0 to 3.5 times leverage ratio. And we did take advantage of that in the early part of the year. So that, kind of, kick we won't have the advantage of next year. But otherwise I would say that your general thesis is correct. Bill Crow : All right. Thank you all. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Leeny Oberg : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Hi, everyone. Just had a quick question on the new OTA agreement. You mentioned that you have better control of the inventory with third parties. How meaningful is this and will show up more in the RevPAR line item? Or will there be any cost savings associated with it? Arne Sorenson : Yeah. The -- probably the most significant thing we've done with the OTAs themselves is something we've been doing not just in the brand-new agreements but probably started a bit over a year ago. And then as we have been more aggressive in essentially dialing back the business we'll take from OTAs when we project will be at high occupancies. We've had that right for a few years. We didn't use it as aggressively as we're using it now. And we've talked about that in some of the last number of quarterly calls. It conceivably had a modest negative impact to RevPAR growth year-over-year. But we think factoring in the lower costs associated with the business that came in when we turned those dials down to zero net-net it drove profitability for the hotels. And that will be something that we will continue to -- a tool we'll continue to use. The other thing, which we disclosed of course is that with Expedia, we did a -- we found a place where actually our alignment with them could be much greater and that was in the wholesale space. Wholesale is another, kind of, third party if you will that is both an expensive channel and sometimes a channel, which makes pricing integrity challenged because wholesale inventory can end up out there being passed from one intermediary to another and we don't often know where it's sold. And in talking that through with Expedia we thought well they can bring their technological prowess to bear and we can put some discipline in the wholesale market, which should make that both easier to manage from an integrity perspective. And reduce the cost of that business that comes into our system through the wholesale channel. So, that we're excited about. Obviously, we're -- it's early days in that, but the teams of both Marriott and Expedia are working aggressively. And we think there will be some good outcomes from that. Wes Golladay : Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up, and that would be obviously, conversions will accelerate in a downturn. But right now we're seeing a low RevPAR growth environment. You're also driving down the OTA commissions meaningfully lower. And you're having more increased direct bookings. So, could we see an acceleration over the next few years, in a low-growth environment? Or would we have to still wait for the downturn for the conversions to accelerate? Arne Sorenson : I think conversions are quite healthy, even today as we speak. And partly that is, the things that you've just mentioned. It is also about some of the soft brands that, we've used with luxury collection Autograph and Tribute all performing quite well. We are in a position where we can go out and both offer the top and bottom-line financial benefits. But also have some flexibility on the kind of product we take, that we wouldn't necessarily be the case, if we had only the hard brands. I think when we get to a weaker economic environment. We will see that some of the hotels that don't really have good pipes of customers, connected to them. They'll also have an incremental reason if you will, that they don't have today which should be helpful then. Wes Golladay : Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Wes Golladay : Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Kevin Kopelman : Hello. Thanks a lot. And, first of all, Arne, best of luck on the upcoming procedure. Arne Sorenson : Thank you. Kevin Kopelman : And Laura thanks for all your help and congrats. So I just wanted to follow-up on signings really quickly. So, could you talk about what approvals and signings were in Q3? And then, maybe clarify your comment about approaching record signings this year. Are you almost there already in early November? Or is that expected closer to year-end? And how would you kind of generally characterize the outlook for new signings, going forward, as it stands today? Arne Sorenson : Yeah. A couple of preliminary comments, developer our developers are the best in the industry by far. But they are a special breed. And they love to do things at -- in the fourth quarter of the year. And so until the bell is rung at the end of the year, you never really know where you're going to end up. We are -- if you look at, signings through Q3, we're marginally ahead of last year. And again, I think you could say, in the context of a -- that's global comment. But in the context of the uncertainties that are out there about the economy, or about geopolitics, or about other things that's a pretty stunning level of success. We can't say at this point where we're going to end up the year. But there's a lot that the team is working on. And they'll scramble to work it through. One funny thing, the select service team in the United States as they get into December, they've got this big bell that sits on the table. And they ring the bell every time they sign a contract. And that bell is ringing all the time in the last couple of weeks of the year. They delivered one of those big bells into my office last December just, to sort of let me share in the fun if you will. But we'll keep working through the end of the year. And obviously, we'll report when we get into January about, where the dust settled on signings, generally all good news. Kevin Kopelman : Excellent, thanks, Arne. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Ari Klein of BMO Capital Markets. Ari Klein : Hi. Thank you. Maybe just following up on the conversion side of things, can you just talk about in some of the markets that have been a little bit tougher for you? Have you seen conversions increase in those markets? Arne Sorenson : You're talking about markets in which RevPAR has been softer? Ari Klein : Yeah, yeah. Arne Sorenson : Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't -- I'm not sure I can do that justice off the cuff. I do think if you look at one of the highest supply growth environments in the world is the UAE to include Dubai. And if you look back a couple of years, I would guess that, in Dubai we had done essentially zero conversions. And in the last year or so, we've done a handful of conversions. And I think in a sense that may prove a little bit of this theory that we were talking about before, which is where businesses under the most pressure in that instance, it's mostly about supply growth not about demand weakening. But RevPAR has been negative for the industry in Dubai. Not for us necessarily in every quarter, but has been negative for the last -- much in the last couple of years I suppose in Dubai. And as a consequence, we're seeing a bit better conversion activity there than has ever been the case in the past. That would be an example. I can't give you stats for sort of a group of markets like that if you will. Ari Klein : Okay, great, yeah thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Arne Sorenson : Yeah. All right, Laura, will you bring us home? Laura Paugh : So my last comment there's no better job in the world in investor relations. And no better company in the world than Marriott to do it in. The corporate culture here isn't just about taking care of the customer. It's also about taking care of all of you. There's a real commitment here to get it right for all of you, with straightforward accurate and fulsome disclosures and candid assessments of business trends. Fortunately it takes a team of people to make that happen and they are terrific. You've met some of them that have joined me on road shows and conferences over the years. And many of them are listening to this call. So my message to all of my colleagues is thank you for making us look smart for so long. And keep up the good work. For the investors and sell-side analysts on the call, I am going to miss you. And I've really enjoyed working with you. I hope all of you come to the holiday party on December 5. We're going to have a terrific time. Arne Sorenson : Thank you, Laura. Laura Paugh : All right. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Laura. Arne Sorenson : Thank you everybody.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Arne Sorenson. Thank you and please go ahead. Arne Sorenson : Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our new Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President, Investor Relations. Let me remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Forward-looking statements in the press release that we issued yesterday along with our comments today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. In our discussion today, we will talk about 2019 results excluding merger-related costs and reimbursed revenues and related expenses. GAAP results appear on pages A1 and A2 of the earnings release, but our remarks today will largely refer to the adjusted results that appear on the non-GAAP reconciliation pages. Of course, you can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks on our Investor Relations website. As we begin our call this morning, it is obvious that the question you are most interested in is the impact of the coronavirus or COVID-19 on our business around the world. In the six weeks or so that we have been intensely watching this crisis, we have learned much, but there's still a great deal we do not know. In our press release and in our comments this morning, we will give you some yard sticks to help measure what the impact to our P&L might be. Well, this is still guess work to some extent. We know one thing with confidence. This will pass. And when it does, the impact to our business will quickly fade. So let's talk about our results. We are pleased with our solid performance in 2019, finishing the year on a high note. In the fourth quarter, we continued to add to our RevPAR index gains, increased hotel profit margins, recycled a meaningful amount of capital and signed a significant number of new hotel deals. We grew our system to more than 7,300 properties and expanded our global rooms pipeline to a record of more than 0.5 million rooms. With nearly 1.4 million rooms in 134 countries and territories, we offer unrivaled choices for our customers. In 2019 our development team signed 815 hotel agreements for a record 136,000 rooms with each of our international regions setting records in organic signings. Over 220,000 of the rooms in our 515,000-room pipeline are already under construction. Using 2019's pace of openings, our under-construction pipeline represents nearly three years of gross rooms growth, while our total pipeline represents well over six years of implied rooms growth. At year end, 7% of global industry rooms flew one of our flags, while our share of STR's worldwide under-construction pipeline led the industry at 19%. To be sure, our signings were impressive, but we are not just focused on adding units. We are focused on adding valuable hotels that drive higher fees per room and enhance our brands. Luxury and upper upscale rooms comprise over half of our distribution globally, which is one reason our fees per room lead the industry. During 2019, we expanded this lead by signing a record 45,000 rooms in these tiers. At year-end the number of our global luxury and upper upscale rooms under construction, totaled more than the next three competitors combined according to STR. Other milestone achievements in 2019 included multiple launches from our new loyalty program Marriott Bonvoy to our new home rental program Homes & Villas by Marriott International; to our all-inclusive platform which was augmented by our recent acquisition of the Elegant Hotels Group in Barbados. These expanded offerings and program enhancements provide meaningful value to our owners and guests help to drive loyalty engagement and provide additional ways for members to earn and redeem points. Homes & Villas provides the opportunity for our guests to stay at 7,500 premium and luxury rental homes in 200 locations around the world. In the all-inclusive segment our guests can currently choose from 10 resorts with seven more projects in the pipeline. In the fourth quarter, we launched our Eat Around Town offering where Marriott Bonvoy members can earn points by dining at more than 11,000 restaurants in the U.S. We also introduced peak, off-peak redemption onwards providing members with better value when they redeem points on lower demand nights. In addition to benefiting guests, the new award schedule helps owners fill more rooms by shifting demand from stronger periods to slower ones. Finally, we are piloting a program in select international markets that lets local members earn and redeem points dining at our hotel restaurants. The response from our members has been extremely positive. Collectively these efforts coupled with the strength of our brands and our broad distribution, drove Marriott Bonvoy membership to over 141 million members at the end of January. This powerful platform remains a key competitive advantage. And in 2019 paid room revenues from loyalty members increased 11%. Redemptions were also meaningfully higher as our Bonvoy travelers enjoyed the wide range of choices offered by the program. Member share of occupied rooms topped 52% worldwide in 2019, up 250 basis points versus 2018 and reached 58% in North America, up 320 basis points year-over-year. We also continue to see solid growth from our co-branded credit cards with sign-ups 12% higher year-over-year. With an improved yield management approach and an increase in Bonvoy members, more of our guests booked direct in 2019. Worldwide direct bookings including group sales, rooms booked by our reservation centers and bookings made on our digital platforms represented approximately three quarters of total room nights booked during the year. Direct digital bookings alone represented one-third of room nights. Mobile bookings a component of direct digital bookings were up a strong 64% over the year. At the same time, the percentage of nights booked through OTAs declined year-over-year. Guests intend to recommend and staff service scores increased during 2019, thanks to the efforts of our outstanding associates. We also saw impressive revenue share gains across our portfolio. Overall, our global RevPAR index accelerated throughout the year rising 240 basis points in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2019, our global RevPAR index improved an impressive 200 basis points. Each of our continents saw growth in index with meaningful gains from both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood portfolios, globally. It is worth mentioning that, we are particularly pleased with the progress we are making with the Sheraton brand. Over the last three years approximately, 50% of Sheraton hotels worldwide, have undergone are undergoing or have committed to undergo renovation. We sold the Sheraton Phoenix downtown last month, after purchasing it just 18 months earlier. And we signed a valuable long-term management agreement. We are confident that, the Sheraton Phoenix downtown will serve as a showcase to encourage renovations, at additional Sheraton hotels. Before we discuss our 2020 outlook, let me talk a bit more about the coronavirus situation. Clearly, this is a major humanitarian crisis. And our thoughts are with the many people impacted. As the virus emerged in Wuhan earlier this year, our teams assisted guests and provided support for associates, whose lives have been significantly disrupted. I couldn't be prouder of our associates in the Asia-Pacific region, who have worked tirelessly. We continue to waive cancellation fees for hotel stays, through March 15, for guests with reservations, at our hotels in Greater China and for guests from Greater China with reservations at Marriott destinations, globally. We began to see the impact of the coronavirus on our business in mid-January, with occupancy declines gradually, spreading from Wuhan to other markets in the Asia-Pacific region. In February, RevPAR at our hotels in Greater China declined almost 90%, versus the same period last year. At the end of 2019, we had 375 properties with roughly 122,000 rooms across Greater China, representing 9% of our total global rooms. Around 90 of these properties are currently closed. In the Asia-Pacific region outside Greater China, what we call APAC, February RevPAR declined roughly 25%, year-over-year. For APAC we had 412 properties with 100,000 rooms at year-end 2019, representing 7% of our total worldwide rooms. February RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region overall has been running down around 50% compared to February of last year. Outbound travelers from China in, 2019 made up less than 1% of room nights in our system outside of Asia-Pacific and around 0.5 of 1% of room nights in North America. To-date, apart from a handful of citywide event cancellations, we have not seen a significant impact on overall demand outside of the Asia-Pacific region, so the situation obviously remains fluid. Given the uncertainty surrounding the length and severity of the coronavirus situation, we cannot fully estimate the financial impact to our business at this time. So, in our press release and our remarks today, we are providing a base case first quarter and full year 2020 outlook that do not reflect any impact from the outbreak. This base case reflects the 2020 outlook our teams had prepared, as part of the company's budget process, based on the pre-coronavirus environment, including hotel-by-hotel forecasts, group booking trends, and expected supply growth. Leeny will frame how first quarter results could be impacted by the coronavirus based on current trends. Now let's start with our base case RevPAR outlook for 2020, not impacted by coronavirus. On a global constant currency basis, we estimate global system-wide RevPAR in 2020 will increase 1% to 2% in the first quarter. And will be flat to up 2% for the full year. In North America recent estimates for U.S. GDP growth, point to a modestly slower pace of economic growth in 2020 with lodging demand forecasted to increase around 2%. Industry supply growth is expected to also remain around 2%, with upscale supply expected to grow 4%. We expect leisure demand will continue to outpace business transient demand, as there has yet to be a step-up in business investment levels. Overall, this implies a continuation of low RevPAR growth in the U.S. Our group sales organization in North America had a great fourth quarter in 2019, with bookings for all future periods up 5.5%. With this strength, our group revenue on the books in North America for 2020 is up at a mid-single-digit rate. We have completed roughly 80% of our corporate rate negotiations. And while we can't predict corporate volumes, completed negotiated room rates are running up 1% to 2% for comparable accounts. Our first quarter is off to a strong start, with the benefit of easy comps in markets like Washington D.C. and Hawaii as well as continuing RevPAR index gains. We expect base case North America RevPAR will increase 1% to 2% for the first quarter. For the full year, we expect it to be around the midpoint of the global range of flat to up 2%. For the Asia-Pacific region, we assume base case RevPAR growth 2% to 4% for 2020 with weak results in Hong Kong expected to continue for the first half of the year before lapping easier comps in the back half. Again, this does not include any impact from the virus outbreak. Base case RevPAR in Europe could grow 2% -- 2% to 4%, excuse me, for the year, driven again by strong demand from U.S. travelers and strength in Eastern European markets. For the Middle East and Africa region, we assume base case RevPAR could grow at a low single-digit rate in 2020. We believe the region will benefit from higher RevPAR in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Africa somewhat offset by lower RevPAR in the UAE. Continued new lodging supply in Dubai will likely challenge 2020 RevPAR growth in the UAE, despite the Expo 2020 event that begins in the fourth quarter. In the Caribbean and Latin America region, base case RevPAR could grow at a low single-digit rate for 2020, reflecting more modest economic growth and political uncertainty in some markets. For 2020 we assume 5% to 5.25% net rooms growth including deletions in the 1% to 1.5% range. Preconstruction and construction delays persist around the world. Again, our rooms growth assumption does not include any impact from the coronavirus situation. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to thank all our global associates for their continued hard work, especially those in the Asia-Pacific region who have shown such empathy and skill managing through this challenging time. Our culture is distinctive and it is a real competitive advantage. And I feel very fortunate to work with such purpose-driven and caring individuals. On a personal note, I had surgery in November and the doctors were pleased with how it went. As part of my treatment plan, I am undergoing a few months of post-surgery chemotherapy. And while I am now fashionably bald, I feel really good. I'm grateful I've been able to work throughout, and I want to thank all of you for your good wishes and support throughout this battle. And now Leeny will walk through our financials in more detail. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Arne. Our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9% to $1.57, which was $0.11 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $1.44 to $1.47. We picked up $0.03 of outperformance from fees, primarily due to better-than-expected incentive management fees in North America and $0.06 from a lower than expected tax rate due to higher windfall tax impact and other discrete items. We also benefited from gains on the sale of two hotels in North America, which totaled $0.32. These favorable items were partially offset by $0.26 from two asset impairments, $0.03 of greater than expected general and administrative expenses related to legal costs, bad debt and unfavorable foreign exchange and $0.01 from lower joint venture earnings. Fourth quarter 2019 system-wide comparable global RevPAR, rose 1.1% in constant dollars year-over-year. North American RevPAR in the quarter increased nearly 1% with RevPAR among our full-service brands up 2.4%. Leisure markets like Hawaii and Orlando showed notable strength. Our RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region increased 0.3% in the fourth quarter. RevPAR in Hong Kong declined 54% due to continued protests while RevPAR in Mainland China increased 2.4%. Excluding Hong Kong, RevPAR for the Asia-Pacific region rose 3.5% with strength in Singapore and India. Our RevPAR in Europe rose 2.8% in the fourth quarter benefiting from continued significant U.S. demand and robust loyalty program activity. Eastern Europe was particularly strong due to increases in both rate and occ while in Southern Europe, Italy, Spain and Portugal also saw healthy RevPAR increases. Fourth quarter RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa region increased 2.8% with strong growth in Riyadh and Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Qatar also posted solid results, despite the continued political tensions in the region. RevPAR in the Caribbean and Latin America region rose 0.5% in the fourth quarter with strength in the Caribbean and Mexico, partially offset by declines in Chile and Panama. Our fourth quarter gross fee revenue increased 7% versus last year to $974 million due to room additions, higher REVPAR, improved net house profits at managed hotels in North America and Europe, and continued strong growth in other franchise fees. Depreciation, amortization and other expense increased to $179 million in the quarter. We recognized a $15 million impairment charge associated with the sale of a North American hotel and a $99 million impairment charge related to a leased hotel in North America. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 21% was higher than the prior year largely due to favorable discrete items in the year-ago quarter. For full year 2019, our gross fees grew 5% and our adjusted EBITDA increased 3%. Excluding asset impairments and gains in 2018 and 2019, adjusted EPS grew 6% year-over-year to $5.92. During the year, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders including $2.3 billion from share repurchases, thanks to successful asset recycling strong cash flow generation and a reduction in cash balances. Our loyalty program had net cash outflows in 2019. This was primarily due to the marketing spend related to Bonvoy's launch in the first quarter and significantly higher redemptions as members explored the many new locations and experiences offered by the integrated and enhanced program. We expect the Bonvoy program to continue to be a net user of cash in 2020, although meaningfully improved from 2019 levels. We received proceeds from recycled assets of $470 million during 2019, including proceeds of roughly $310 million from the sale of the St. Regis New York and $100 million from the sale of the Sheraton Gateway hotel in Toronto. Now let's talk more about our base case outlook for 2020. As you know, it does not include any impact from coronavirus merger-related costs and charges, cost, reimbursed revenue or reimbursed expenses and it assumes no additional asset sales. For full year 2020 given our assumptions for global RevPAR, our base case outlook shows gross fee revenue could increase 4% to 6% to reach $3.96 billion to $4.04 billion. Growth should be driven primarily by room additions and other franchise fees, partially offset by headwinds from renovations, property terminations, and roughly $10 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Other franchise fees, which include credit card branding fees, hotel application and relicensing fees, timeshare licensing fees and residential branding fees are expected to grow roughly 10% to $630 million to $640 million. We also expect that incentive fees will decline slightly given continued pressure on house profit margins. We assumed owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total $295 million to $305 million in 2020, flat to up low single-digits. These results include slightly lower termination fees offset by a similar amount of favorable year-over-year impact from bought and sold hotels. We assume general and administrative expenses will total $950 million to $960 million in 2020, up 1% to 2% versus 2019. And we expect a 2020 effective tax rate of 23.3%. We assume 2020 adjusted EBITDA will total roughly $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion or 3% to 6% over 2019 levels. On the bottom line, we assume 2020 diluted EPS will be $6.30 to $6.53, up 6% to 10% versus $5.92, 2019's adjusted diluted EPS excluding the impact of asset sale gains and impairments. For first quarter 2020, our base case forecast assumes global RevPAR growth of 1% to 2%, and a 5% to 6% increase in gross fee revenues to reach $940 million to $950 million. Our tax rate in the first quarter is expected to be roughly 21%, four percentage points higher than a year ago as a result of higher windfall benefit and discrete items in the prior year quarter. This translates to 5% to 7% growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.47 to $1.50 and 4% to 6% growth in adjusted EBITDA. We remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. Using the base case assumptions, 2020 investment spending could total $700 million to $800 million. This includes around $200 million of maintenance investment spending, roughly $200 million of system investments that will largely be reimbursed by owners over time, and $300 million to support new unit growth. We expect roughly three quarters of this new unit investment will be associated with luxury and upper upscale properties. These projects typically provide higher fees per room and attractive 20-plus year agreements. Projects where we invest our own capital are expected to generate a substantially higher value per key over the life of the contract on average compared to full-service deals with no Marriott capital. Under our base case and assuming this level of investment, we would expect to return more than $2.4 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends for the full year 2020 assuming no impact from the coronavirus and no additional asset sales. Note, that this outlook assumes roughly $200 million higher cash tax payments than in 2019, primarily due to timing. We remain committed to our strong investment-grade credit rating. We ended the year within our 3.0 times to 3.5 times debt to EBITDAR target range. And our base case model assumes we will remain within this target range. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus situation on the company's cash flow and debt levels and manage leverage within our targeted range. Turning back to the coronavirus situation. Arne noted our distribution in the Asia-Pacific region. From a financial perspective, 2019 gross fees earned in the Asia-Pacific region totaled $477 million, representing 12% of our global gross fee revenue. Greater China generated about half of the fees in Asia-Pacific, representing roughly 6% of both global fees and total adjusted EBITDA. Our base case model assumes Asia-Pacific and fees in 2020 will total roughly $500 million to $510 million, with Greater China fees again constituting about half of that amount. Assuming the current low occupancy and RevPAR levels in the Asia-Pacific region continue, we estimate the region will earn roughly $25 million less in fees and EBITDA per month as compared to our 2020 base case. This means that for the first quarter, given our results in Asia-Pacific to date and assuming the same low levels of RevPAR in March as we've seen in February and no meaningful impact outside of Asia-Pacific, total gross fees and total adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter could be roughly $60 million below our base case and diluted EPS could be roughly $0.14 per share below our base case. The analysis we are providing today has the benefit of actual results through the first two months of the quarter. There's still a great deal we do not know, including the length and global scope of the virus and the impact of potential supply chain disruptions on the global economy. As Arne noted, despite these unknowns, the virus will run its course. And when it does its impact will not be long-lasting. We entered 2020 with tremendous competitive momentum in RevPAR unit growth and brand strength and with an industry-leading loyalty program. This momentum will carry us through this crisis and beyond. We'll now open the line for questions. Please limit yourself to one question, so that we can speak to you to as many of you as possible. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you for all the commentary on some of the sensitivities. I know this is a really kind of fluid dynamic and I think we're all trying to get a hold of it for the global travel landscape. So, with that in mind, Leeny, as you think about some of the sensitivities you gave in the last section of your prepared remarks. Are we really -- for that $25 million are we really just extrapolating current trend line for let's call it Mainland China and Asia-Pacific? Or have we also accounted for the fact that this is spreading into where we know so far South Korea, Japan? Appreciate that Western Europe is not probably part of that sensitivity. But is there any -- so the question is one does it include broader APAC getting worse? And then second, any sensitivities you could provide for us as we start to branch out into Western Europe which we now know is an issue. And then as we move kind of towards the U.S., which seems increasingly likely. Leeny Oberg : Thanks, Shaun. Sure. Let me start. So the sensitivity we've given you is based on where we are in February, which is as Arne described is Asia-Pacific RevPAR being down about 50%. But obviously that is massively skewed by Greater China being down 90%, while the rest of Asia-Pacific is down meaningfully less. So that is based on an assumption that they stay roughly the same and that we continue to have no meaningful impact outside of Asia-Pacific. As you pointed out in your comment and your question this is extremely fluid situation. We are actually now reopening hotels in China every day. But at the same time how this exactly spreads to other continents remains to be seen. Just in terms of the other continents I think you're familiar with our basic layout of fees which is that again broadly speaking you know that North America is roughly two-thirds Greater China, Asia-Pacific we described as being roughly 16%; CALA 4%; Europe 9%; and EMEA at 4%. So all of these line up relatively well with our fee distribution as you look throughout the world. The only other thing I'll mention Shaun is just to remember that from an IMS perspective that Asia-Pacific accounts for roughly one-third of our incentive management fees. North America accounts for another one-third and the rest of international accounts for about one-third. So, all of that fits into the equation that we gave you of the $25 million per month from Asia-Pacific. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Arpine Kocharyan : Hi. Thank you very much. This is Arpine for Robin. It sounds like unit growth of around 5% doesn't include any virus impact. And you mentioned in your release that if the situation were to get worse there will be impact to unit growth. Is there any impact currently that's not included that you quantify? And I know this could be challenging but maybe you could provide some sensitivity similar to how you quantify the impact in terms of unit growth? Arne Sorenson : It's -- I think it's -- first, good morning. It is too early to give you a numeric sensitivity to openings. I think obviously you've got in Asia-Pacific particularly a very intense situation. We did open about 1,000 rooms in January in China, but in a sense that's sort of before or at the very front end of this coronavirus. I think if you look at the next few months while we've got about 90 hotels closed and RevPAR down nearly 90% in the market there's not much urgency to get a hotel open even if it's ready. That if it's ready, though it will open before the end of the year. And so the impact on full year numbers maybe nothing, but it wouldn't be surprising to see some of this get delayed. I think in the rest of the world, it's much harder to assess. We have talked to our design and construction folks. We've talked to a number of our partners. And I think generally it is decorative furnishings and some furniture and maybe some fabrics that are most likely to be sourced from China. We think that the openings that were sort of planned for the first part of 2020, are more likely to have had all those supplies either in possession or in route to them and so could well not be impacted. But I think we and many other industries, of course, are looking at the longer term supply impact will be to the supplies that we need. Obviously, in this context, it's more about hotels opening than the operating supplies. But I think that there -- it wouldn't be at all surprising to us to see some further expansion of the construction schedule, and certainly as long as this virus situation last. Leeny Oberg : The only thing I'll add is to remember that new hotels opened throughout the year, and they're all ramping up starting from zero. So, their fee contribution in year one is extremely small relative to overall fees. Now obviously year two is more important. But the year one impact frankly from a bit lower openings is not meaningful. Arpine Kocharyan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Instinet. Harry Curtis : Good morning, everyone. There are so many questions. Good morning. So many unknowable question -- answers to questions. So, maybe I'll focus on something that's a little bit more tangible, which would be the increase in your termination fees and your comments related to the renovations to the Sheraton brand. The increase in termination fees, were those more tied to the Sheraton brand? Or is it a mix of brands? And do you see the -- what's the pipeline look like for kind of the legacy brands into 2021? Leeny Oberg : Sure. Harry, we'll cover those. So first of all, let's talk about termination fees. Overall termination fees in 2019 were meaningfully lower than they were in 2018, and we actually expect termination fees in 2020 to be even lower still. So, the ones in Q4 really a question about timing and which hotels close and they can have a varying amount associated with them. The other point I would mention, if you remember last year we had deleted rooms that started to get closer to 2%, while this year we are squarely at 1% in terminations, which is on the lower end of our 1% to 1.5% guidance that we've given. So, I think from that standpoint I think we feel good about the progression of how it's going with our portfolio. I think in terms of the pipeline that we see both in terms of legacy brands and in terms of the Starwood portfolio brands, I think as we've described in Q4, we really kind of topped out a spectacular year in terms of new deal signings. And they were happily very well distributed across all of our brands with some notable growth in some of the Starwood legacy brands. Harry Curtis : Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Arne Sorenson : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Greff : Hi. Good morning, everybody. You touched on this in the press release and your earlier comments Arne about the solid RevPAR index growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Can you talk about how the Starwood legacy properties in North America performed how much of the index scene would you attribute to those assets? And then when you think about the performance in RevPAR growth this year, obviously Greater China coronavirus neutral. How do you look at the Starwood legacy properties performing versus the Marriott legacy properties? Arne Sorenson : Yeah. It's obviously a big world. But as we mentioned in the comments both legacy Marriott and legacy Starwood portfolios have been really performing extraordinarily well on index both in Q4 and full year 2019 and as we start 2020 and both really hundreds of basis points. In Q4 there were some easy comparisons. Obviously we had a strike last year in the United States, which impacted San Francisco and Hawaii probably most. They had probably a bit more impact on the legacy Starwood portfolio than on the legacy Marriott Starwood portfolio than on the legacy Marriott portfolio. But even there the RevPAR index performance in Q4 of last year was down meaningfully less than it was up this year in Q4. So, whether you look at strikes or you look at a little bit of integration noise in Q4 of 2018, we not only made up that ground but we lapped it. There are other sort of spectacular numbers. You can see from our Q4 China RevPAR numbers, excluding Hong Kong at plus 2.5%. I think the China team's RevPAR index growth for the two portfolios of plus 600 to 700 basis points. And it's all cylinders moving. It's the loyalty program. It is the digital platforms and the way they're performing. It is the sales team. There's good news sort of across the portfolio and it is very much shared by both the Marriott and the Starwood portfolios. Joseph Greff : Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : Hi. good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So, maybe a question for Leeny. If I look back at your operating cash prior to 2019, you were run rating about $2.4 billion before some of these cash headwinds that you've called out particularly on the Bonvoy redemptions, but also with the cash taxes. So, can you help me think about what you're expecting for 2020? And does 2021 get back to sort of that prior run rate level that you can grow from. And obviously I realize that a lot of that depends on how long this coronavirus impact last. But I guess what I'm ultimately getting at is, were there any benefits to pre-2019 cash flow that you just don't expect to see anymore? Leeny Oberg : So yeah. So a couple of things that I pointed out. One is that we definitely had a bit of a benefit on the cash tax side in 2019 that we will then pay for in 2020 relative, for example on the cash taxes that we're paying on our asset sales. So, that is a bit of timing that will even out obviously over time. On the loyalty side, I think that is the one that is worth spending a little time talking about. And there, I think you definitely saw that in 2018, we saw the loyalty program behave more in its more historical pattern of being a cash -- net cash positive part of our story. And this year, it moved to being several hundred million of a net cash user. And that you really need to think of within the context of the introduction of Bonvoy. I there was some pent-up demand relative to our customers being excited about being able to explore all of our properties and used their points at a much more expanded portfolio. We also had the introduction of Bonvoy, which moves some timing of marketing expenses from 2018 to 2019. And you put that together and I think in the first year of the program, you definitely saw a fairly unusual pattern for the program. We are quite confident that that will smooth out over time and return to its more normal pattern. We do think it will still be a user in 2020, but much less of a cash user. And things that we've talked about like the introduction of peak, off-peak which manages the demand a little bit better in terms of the points that it costs at the different properties both in low and high demand times, all of that will work towards getting this program to where I think it behaves more like it has in the past. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you, very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning. Arne Sorenson : Hi Patrick. Patrick Scholes : Are you seeing any discernible uptick in cancellation activity outside of the Asia-Pacific regions? At areas say like airport hotels or in general... Arne Sorenson : Yes. Let's -- obviously the weekend news around coronavirus was not good. You had South Korea and Italy both and the Iran story as well a little bit. Obviously, we don't have anything in Iran and so there's no measurable impact there. But we're just days into it. So, we are essentially every day getting the team together by phone and getting data where we look at performance across these markets. And we're listening to our customers obviously talk about it. And let me give you a few anecdotes. Maybe start with Asia-Pacific even though your question focuses on the rest of the world. I'll talk about the rest of the world in a second. China itself, Leeny mentioned about 90 hotels closed. We have RevPAR down about 90%. I think the last full week number I had was minus 87% year-over-year, so not quite as bad as minus 90. The Chinese government is trying to ramp at least some things back up. So, we can see for example in Macau, we probably got down to 1% to 2% occupancy. We may now be at 7% to 8% occupancy. Now that's still down massively year-over-year. I think it's too soon to put much stock in this effort to reopen China because it's early and you still have schools closed and we don't really know exactly how this is going to come back. But there is at least some hope I suppose that we've bottomed in China and maybe things will get a little bit better. You move around the rest of Asia-Pacific and you see some things that you would expect. So, Singapore down about 50% RevPAR year-over-year. That's a -- again a recent week number. That's not a full year February number. By contrast India, up 5%, that was before President Trump's visit so that's not driven by his visit, but is driven by the fact that India is really not much dependent on China travel and has got a different GDP story than one which is dependent on the China story. Obviously, when you look at South Korea and Italy we will see both cancellations and we will see declining RevPAR in those markets. Still too early to tell. I know that some of the Italian cities, we've probably lost a few tens of points of occupancy in the first days. But that's not the country as a whole and it's far too soon to come up with, sort of, predictions for that if you will. I think when all is said and done we would have to characterize our $25 million a month. Run rate as being probably a bit light because we're going to see some impact in Europe. We're going to see some impact in other markets around the world which is probably not entirely dependent on China travel. And our $25 million is basically a China travel story and an APAC story. But I think even though that we would expect this will be messy for the next few weeks if not maybe the next few months we'd go back to what we've said before and that is that this will end. It's clear that it will end. We can't tell you when it will end. But when people start to get confidence that they don't need to be worried about picking this up if they're thinking about going to Seoul, for example, that travel will come back and it will probably come back fairly quickly. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : Good morning, Smedes. Smedes Rose : Good morning. I just wanted to ask you -- you broke out for your CapEx line item is about $300 million towards new unit growth. How does that compare to 2019? And just are you just seeing more opportunities that you want to go after? Or is that landscape becoming more competitive? Or maybe just sort of a little more color around that expenditure. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So generally I'd say similar maybe a tad higher relative to 2019. But again it ties as I said before to the reality that these are generally on fantastic full-service and luxury projects that are well worth the investment. And I think it ties to our success in signing new deals in these hotels around the world where the owners want our brands and generally the market is competitive for capital for those projects. But when we look at the value that we get on these hotels we expect it to be meaningfully higher than the ones that require no capital. So again a little bit higher, but not meaningfully. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi. Good morning everyone. A couple of questions on the loyalty program. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Anthony Powell : Good morning. Question on the loyalty program. You mentioned the positive impact of the redemption activity in the quarter. How did points earnings trend in the quarter? And are you happy with the level of activity around earning points in the system? And given the positive impact of redemptions, does it make sense to run the loyalty program in a more of a cash-neutral position over time rather than cash-positive position over time? Arne Sorenson : The -- a bunch of questions there. I mean, I think we talked about our penetration too which is both paid and redeem nights as a percentage of total nights in the hotels and we are seeing those penetration numbers move meaningfully up. And to state the obvious that means the program is growing enough to deal with the roughly 5% unit growth, plus drive increased penetration in comped hotels. And we're very pleased with that. So we're seeing both paid up about 10% or so and redeemed up significantly too and that's all gratifying for us. I think -- well, it's a little harder to get share of wallet data, because we guess on that a little bit. We're obviously -- we don't have internally the kinds of tools we need to measure share of wallet. We're quite convinced we are increasing share of wallet from the loyalty program and from our loyalty members. I think longer term and Leeny's talked about both the cash flow impacts in 2019 and in 2020, there's absolutely no reason that the loyalty program won't get back to being a positive cash flow generator for us on an annual basis. That is obviously driven significantly by the fact that we continue to grow the program and we continue to grow our portfolio of hotels. And so as you do that, we will tend to issue more points for paid stays than are redeemed. And we will continue to see as we've done in the past that there are more and more revenues coming into this program, which are coming in from credit card partners or restaurant partners or other partners besides just the hotels that are participating in the program. So this is obviously to be cash flow negative in the loyalty program in 2019 is unusual in a sense. We'd love to wave one and have it be something different. But it is actually quite logical given the launch of the program both to market it the new name and to get this massive group of customers to experiment with it. And we are much more pleased than we are disappointed, because it shows the engagement of our loyalty members with program and with us. Anthony Powell : Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill Crow : Good morning everybody. Arne\u2026 Arne Sorenson : Hey, Bill. Leeny Oberg : Hi, Bill. Bill Crow : Good morning. You kind of classified the areas outside of China has not materially impacted today. I saw in the STR data yesterday that occupancy was down 100 basis points or more kind of everywhere different segments and everything else. I'm wondering if that's kind of the start of the impact that we should expect to see. What are you seeing as far as real-time inbound international travel from areas outside of China and cancellations when you think about maybe the gateway markets? Arne Sorenson : I think the fair response Bill is we're asking the same question you're asking. And what we get back at the moment is very much anecdotal doesn't really show up in our data yet. We obviously get our weekly flashes and we get a daily look if we want to dig in and get a daily look. And by and large, you look at the U.S. market, for example which just as a reminder, is basically 95% to 96% domestic travel. So, all business in the United States coming from international markets is in the 4% range, maybe 4.5%. And big markets in that would include neighboring markets like Canada and Mexico, which probably have a different kind of travel profile if you will than the travel coming in from further abroad. And there, we've got very, very few cases in the U.S. obviously we're all watching that to look at. But we're not really seeing a measurable impact yet. We're instead seeing as we mentioned in the prepared remarks a handful of group things really globally, which have canceled so far. I suspect it will step up a little bit, but we're going to watch that on a day-to-day basis. And overwhelmingly obviously that depends not just on time, but it depends on what are the incidences of the cases of this virus in various markets in the world and how to travelers react to that. Bill Crow : I appreciate that. And if I could just follow-up and ask if there are any takeaways from -- we went through SARS and the bird flu, and we've gone through a number of different coronavirus or some sort of flu-like thing over the last what 15 years. Anything you've taken away from that that you can kind of guide your -- the company based on... Arne Sorenson : Yeah, Leeny will have that -- precise number here that is worth talking about. But the comparison to SARS, which is probably the most similar virus is very hard to make. I think if you go back to 2003, I'm guessing here a little bit Chinese annual outbound travel would have been, I don't know, sub-10 million trips a year. And last year we were probably closer to 150 million China trips. So, the relevance of China to the rest of the world is dramatically different. The second thing I think if you look at Marriott's own story, we mentioned we've got 375 hotels open in China at the end of the year. Those are not all comp, but our comp hotels are probably two-thirds of that or something like that maybe a little bit more than that. I think if you go back to 2003, we had 11 or 12 comp hotels. They would have been mostly in Hong Kong probably and then a couple of cities in China. And so, I don't think there's much that we can really take from that other than when SARS ended it ended. And people got back fairly quickly. That doesn't mean they get back the day after, but it does mean they get back within a month or two or three. Leeny Oberg : Roughly a quarter. Arne Sorenson : Yeah. Pretty quickly. But ultimately that depends on people being able to look and say yes it looks like that's behind us. And so, I think I think that's the comparison that's easiest to draw. It's logical not just SARS and MERS, but other unfortunate events that have occurred tell us that travelers are pretty resilient. And one of the reason to be concerned is behind them they're going to get back and get on the road. Bill Crow : Great. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Arne great to hear you sounding well and I'm sure looking fabulous. Arne Sorenson : Thank you for that. David Katz : I wanted to -- as are you all. I wanted to just touched on the IMF dynamic to your point that at some point this will end. How should we think about what happens to management contracts on the back end? Are there embedded triggers within some of those contracts that move or slide that can actually help you earn IMFs faster on the back end of this. How should we think about that? Arne Sorenson : I think the short answer is no. I mean I think the -- it's a lovely thought. But the way these incentive fees work basically -- and Leeny correct me if I'm wrong here, but they're mostly annual tests. The -- if there's an owner's priority, they're mostly fixed and they don't step up which is a fabulous thing for us over the length of time. But similarly they don't mostly step down. In fact I don't know of a single contract in which an owners' priority would step down based on performance. I think the probably the disappointing thing here is if you hypothesized that this was a three-month issue in 2020 and of course that's a total guess, but just use it for the sake of discussion. The test is still an annual test. And so the -- in the United States, particularly, where we've got owner's priorities typically in managed hotels, the impact, if there is one during those three months, will have some lasting impact on incentive fee earnings in 2020, but will have no impact in 2021. I think it's the way to think about it. If you go to Asia where typically you don't have an owner's priority, we will not have probably quite the hangover impact, so if business disappears in China for three months and then it bounces back and does its sort of normal fee, if you will, we'll lose a quarter of the incentive fees we would otherwise earn. And so by the time you get to Q3 or Q4, we should be back to sort of a similar kind of pace as we in the past. Leeny Oberg : So, the only thing I'll add to that David is just to remember the reality that internationally, we earn -- 80% of our hotels' earned incentive fees in 2019, while in North America, it was 56%. So, -- and these are very similar numbers to a year ago with a little bit lower number in North America because of the cost pressures and the low REVPAR. And the other thing I'll mention is that it is the case in Asia-Pacific that it's quite common that there is a slight increase in the amount of IMF as you increase your GOP margin. So, it is the case that as you get fuller and fuller and a really robust RevPAR that you can be earning an incentive fee that is instead of 6%, it becomes 8%. And so there is the reality that as you are losing RevPAR at first, it's a pretty dramatic drop. But then obviously the closer you get to zero, you're down at a lower level of earning IMF. So, there's less to lose. But Arne's point is the right one that these are annual tests. So, you got to really look at the end of the year what you earned for the year and that will determine what you make. David Katz : Thanks for all the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario : Good morning, everyone. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Michael Bellisario : Just kind of a two parter. First on Avendra proceeds. How much is left there to be allocated? And then a second along the same lines on business interruption insurance, I know owners can get made whole. But is it possible for you guys to recoup any loss income? And then how might be Avendra proceeds be part of this to help you and your owners during this down period? Leeny Oberg : So let's just kind of as a quick refresher on Avendra. When we sold Avendra there was a gain of call it $650 million that we're going to use to offset costs that otherwise would have been charged to the owner. And I would say that we are roughly half the way through those monies. And again, as we think about all the different programs and things that we're doing, those are obviously a part of what we would expect going forward. That we would continue to use to offset cost that otherwise would get charged. But honestly, we do think of them as things that are kind of core to what we want to do for the hotel system. I don't think of them as really ones that we kind of use it to plug a hole. We've thought of them more as kind of ways to invest in the system. And though of course, it's great that we do have it and we can use it. I think at this point we continue to expect that we will be able to use it to invest in the system. Arne Sorenson : And then on business interruption insurance. I think the right assumption here is that there will be relatively few policies that are implicated by the coronavirus. We'll obviously watch that and make sure we study it. But my guess is neither the owners or Marriott are going to substantial business interruption proceeds from this. Leeny Oberg : In Asia-Pacific, most of the hotels procure their own and so it will depend on the reading of each of those contracts of what their insurance policies say. But we would not necessarily expect a big amount at least in Asia-Pacific. Michael Bellisario : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital. Wes Golladay : Good morning, everyone. I'm just hoping to learn a little bit more about the profile of the owner and Greater China. Are they capitalized to the point where they can absorb a prolonged closing of their hotels? Arne Sorenson : It's a good question. The -- of the 375 hotels that we had opened at year-end 2019, I know of only one that was not owned by a Chinese investor. Those investors are cover the gamut. I think there are many which are government-owned entities. Not all. There are a number that are substantial real estate companies that own hotels but also do residential development in the rest. And obviously, we've been in communication with owners continuously throughout the six or seven weeks that we've been looking at this. We have had really no indication yet that there are owners under severe pressure. At the same time, when RevPAR is down 90%, it's a fair assumption that none of these hotels are producing positive cash flow to service debt or to do anything else. I think one of the advantages of the economic system that China has is the government is involved not just sometimes through the ownership with government-owned entities, but on the lending side as well. And I think the government will have the tools in order to make sure that people will be able to navigate through this without foreclosures and without sort of significant long term consequences. Wes Golladay : Great. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen. Kevin Kopelman : Great. Thanks a lot. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Kevin Kopelman : I just had a quick follow-up. Good morning. Thank you. Just had a quick follow-up on the coronavirus impact. So all the indications are that in the past week, the travel booking trends have gotten significantly worse, understanding that it's only one week, could you give us more insight on what you're seeing in the U.S. in particular in terms of bookings for future states over the past week? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Yes. And I -- again as we mentioned before, we were picking up a few anecdotes, but we're not really picking up yet in the data anything that we can really what measure or predict from. I think it is brand new. Obviously, you had over the weekend stories that we're focused on these other markets outside of China, but also outside of the United States and Italy and South Korea and the like. You've got the President for the first time speaking about it really last night. And so the U.S.-focused discussion is obviously brand new. The numbers of cases in the United States are still tiny. We were at a -- my wife and I were at a dinner in Washington last night with a bunch of folks who are obviously asking questions around this. And we don't have a single case in the Greater Washington area. And that's the case in most markets across the United States. So, I think it's way too early to expect that the data is going to be very revealing to us. But at the same time, when you get the President doing a press conference on it, that's by itself not a good thing and it will cause more travels to stop and think about it. And again, it's one of the reasons I would say that the $25 million a month number that we've used as a yard stick is probably at this point a bit light, but we don't know what other number to give you. Kevin Kopelman : Thanks, Arne. That's really helpful. And then if I could ask about something completely different. The RPI improvements, what do you think -- could you call out kind of the key drivers there that are allowing you to see that RPI improvement year-over-year, what the outlook for that is going forward? And then, if there's any way you could give us just the actual RPI level that you finished up 2019? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Yes. The -- I mean loyalty -- the loyalty program is I think the thing that we would call out the most. We talked about penetration generally. We gave you the -- both North America numbers and the global numbers for penetration. Again, what percentage of total rooms is driven by both paid and redeem nights. It won't surprise you to know that the penetration numbers are higher in the U.S. just because our brand is better known. We've been doing business here for longer. And it's higher in select brand hotels than it would be in full-service hotels because you've got less group business and the hotels are overwhelmingly driven by transient business. But even when you look at all those differences, you see very healthy increases in penetration outside the U.S. and in full-service hotels and in resort destinations, all of which goes back to the loyalty thing. We're not going to publish today what our index is by brand or even by segment. I will tell you that I get monthly a global index report and the cover of that report has got a chart that starts in 2014 and ends essentially with the current month that's being reported. And the -- and that summary chart breaks it down by three segments; luxury being one segment, upper upscale being one segment, and essentially upscale or the select brands being another segment. And every one of those three is at an all-time high compared to that -- the other numbers on that 2014 chart and they continue to go up. Kevin Kopelman : That's great. Thanks a lot. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks so much for taking my question. First, curious throughout the course of 2019, a number of players in travel alluded to changes that Google was making which resulted in less free organic traffic coming to their travel websites and a greater reliance on paid as Google changes up how they monetize things with their Google hotel ads product. I was curious if you have seen any impact in your business at all from that in the second half of 2019 and into 2020. Arne Sorenson : We're watching what Google is doing very, very closely. The -- certainly, if you look back over I don't know a three or four-year period, we too have seen that the paid search volume coming out of Google has grown from what it was three or four years ago. We didn't see a significant move in the second half of 2019 for us. Now, having said that, just as a reminder, we obviously don't like to pay for paid search if somebody is searching our brand. So, imagine for taking a discussion that somebody's gone on Google and they have search Marriott New York, we don't love to pay for that. And often we don't -- usually, we don't pay for that because we think that person is looking for a Marriott hotel. And they're going to end up finding our site whether it's through Google or whether they come in through some other path, because they're focused on it. In the same way, if somebody goes on and searches Hyatt New York, we're also not likely to pay for that because that's a customer that is sadly, maybe but nevertheless focused on some other brand. That is not necessarily the case in either instance for an OTA. An OTA is going to also be selling Marriott rooms or Hyatt rooms or other rooms. And if they can get somebody to come from Google to their site and collect commission associated with that even, if they're selling the room that the customer seems to be looking at, that's going to go into their calculation in a way that's very different from ours. And so I think it's a long-winded way of saying that the first impact of changes by Google in their strategy, are much more relevant to the OTAs than they are to somebody like us. But we are watching this very, very carefully. We've obviously got a good partnership with Google and there's a lot of volume that comes through our digital channels. And we'll look for ways that we can use those tools to help us do what we want to do which is particularly find customers who are not now in our loyalty ecosystem. Find a way to bring them into our ecosystem. And if we can do that in a way that is cost effective we'll do it. Vince Ciepiel : And unrelated follow-up maybe I missed it. I don't think I heard anything about election year, what impact that could be what you've seen in the last couple and maybe how it relates to group, versus leisure, versus trend here. Arne Sorenson : So that the -- experience we have over decades is that in Washington during the Presidential Election year that tends to be bad for transient demand having said that, the group bookings in Washington for 2020 are quite strong. And so we actually think Washington will perform reasonably well. The only other point to make is an obvious one which is wherever the conventions are they're going to benefit from it where the conventions didn't occur -- well none of its commissions obviously occurred last year. So those cities should help because there will be incremental demand. But we've got lots of politicians staying in our hotels in these various markets and we're glad to have them all. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Stuart Gordon with Bernstein. Stuart Gordon : Stuart Gordon, actually from Berenberg. Just on the shareholder returns how are you thinking just over how you phase these through the year given what's happening just now? And just a quick follow-up could you break out the other fees between credit card fees and the other fee components within that bucket? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Sure. Absolutely. So it's a careful balance. We really look to maximize the returns to shareholders when we've got excess capital and we have a commitment to do that. And we want to continue to do that. At the same time, we have the same commitment to maintain our strong credit rating. And from that standpoint, we need to be looking very carefully at both what's happening now and what we expect to be happening as we move forward through the year. So we've given you our base case without any impact from corona but -- the coronavirus. But due to your question, we are going to of course have to take into consideration real-life and that will impact how we have to think about share repurchase. But we're looking at everything we can on the cash side, on the expense side, on the fee side, et cetera to continue to balance those two efforts. But they -- absolutely, as we continue to see what happens, if you assume my numbers were correct relative to $60 million of impact on the EBITDA line in Q1 that will have an impact on share repurchase for the year. And then as you think about the other question, which was on the credit card fees, yes, for the year we had $410 million for credit card fees for the full year. The rest you probably remember that we have timeshare branding fees that roughly approximate $100 million. And then, the rest is split between the residential branding fees as well as some other smaller categories and app and relicensing fees. The way, I would describe it going forward in 2020 is that group as a whole we expect to grow up towards 10%. When I think about the credit card component of that, I would call that kind of mid-single-digits maybe around 6%-ish. Stuart Gordon : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Leeny Oberg : You\u2019re welcome. Arne Sorenson : All right. Thank you all very much. We appreciate your time and interest this morning. Get on the road, come stay with us.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead, sir. Arne Sorenson : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 conference call. I hope everyone and their families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented and challenging times. And I would like to send my deepest condolences to those of you who have lost friends or family because of COVID-19. Please know that our thoughts are with you. Joining me today from their respective homes are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President-Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President-Investor Relations. I believe this is the first time that Marriott team has not been together in the same room to host this call. And that includes an earnings call from China in 2018 and one during a blizzard in 2010. I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency and year-over-year changes, and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. Let me begin with what is clearly top of mind for all of you, how Marriott is navigating through the extraordinary and continually evolving worldwide impact of COVID-19. This is by far the most significant crisis ever to impact our business. We\u2019re a company that is 92 years old and has weathered the Great Depression, World War II, and numerous natural disasters around the world, that is saying something. Well, the year generally got off to a great start. We saw sudden sharp declines in occupancy associated with COVID-19, beginning in Greater China in January and then extending around the world. Occupancy continued to deteriorate in March and then stabilized in April, albeit at very low levels everywhere except for Greater China, where trends are improving. RevPAR in April fell 90% worldwide and in North America as well. April system-wide occupancy was 12% both worldwide and in North America. For the week ending May 2, worldwide occupancy was 15% and 20% when just looking at comparable hotels that were actually open. About 25% of our hotels worldwide are temporarily closed with 16% of our North American portfolio temporarily closed. Europe is mostly shut down with just over three-quarters of our hotels closed right now. To state the obvious, we are operating in a very challenging environment. However, the glimmer of good news is that overall negative trends appear to have bottomed in most regions around the world. The resiliency of demand is evident in the improving trends in Greater China. New bookings continue to pick up with demand driven primarily by domestic travelers. Occupancy levels in Greater China are currently just over 30%, up from the lows of under 10% in mid-February. RevPAR has followed a similar trajectory, currently down around 67% year-over-year compared to an 85% decline in February. Throughout Mainland China, leisure demand was strong for the Chinese Labor Day holiday weekend in early May. Occupancy for that weekend was over 45% with resort markets close to 70%. We have seen examples of demand starting to come back in other areas around the world as well. Last weekend, as some beaches reopened, the Ritz-Carlton Bacara in Santa Barbara and our hotels in Hilton Head, South Carolina, for example, were expected to reach approximately 50% occupancy based on reservations on the book. Limited service occupancy in the US has increased a bit each week over the past few weeks, showing the most meaningful improvements in drive-to destinations. Local, state and national governments are trying to manage the tight rope between containing COVID-19 and restarting their economies. There are likely to be some areas that start slower, some faster, and some that open in fits and starts. But our business should improve as restrictions are relaxed. On the development front, our pipeline increased slightly to a very healthy 516,000 rooms at the end of the first quarter. We opened over 14,000 rooms in the first quarter and at quarter end. Over 230,000 rooms in our pipeline or around 45% were under construction. We do expect some hotel openings will be delayed due to COVID-19 related supply chain issues or local restrictions on construction activity, but at this point, we have not seen more deals than usual dropping out of the pipeline. The pace of new deal signings overall has slowed a bit as a result of the crisis, but we are encouraged by our current conversations with owners. Many continue to have a clear preference for our portfolio of brands which posted worldwide RevPAR index gains of 330 basis points in the first two months of the year. Like us, many owners are taking a longer term view on the market opportunity. In the first quarter, our Asia Pacific region saw meaningful development activity with over 9,000 rooms signed, roughly 45% more than in the year-ago quarter. And we continue to see strong interest from owners in North America, even though they are not feeling a sense of urgency to get deals across the finish line. We cancelled our North America monthly development deal approval meeting in March for the first time in more than a decade, to pause and take stock of the environment, given the dramatic pace at which COVID-19 was impacting the industry, but have now returned to our usual meeting cadence. We continue to do what we can do across all areas of our business to respond to the current environment. We have issued several updates on the numerous actions we have taken which have focused on helping our associates, our guests, our hotel owners and franchisees and the company itself manage through this situation. While no one can know exactly when and how demand will start to return in each part of the world, Marriott is ready. We have swiftly made significant short-term changes to our business and enhanced our liquidity position, while remaining focused on how to best position ourselves for the recovery and for growth over the longer term. As global trends have started to stabilize, teams across the company have been diligently monitoring various data points and developing a cross-discipline recovery plan. In addition to tracking the booking and cancelation information and macroeconomic indicators, we are also looking at data around COVID-19 testing and cases and government regulations, all with an eye towards ramping up our business in a thoughtful way as restrictions are lifted and market conditions improve. We are consulting with our owners to analyze potential market demand and hotel-level cash flow to help inform when and how to reopen their hotels. Region-specific marketing strategies are being developed that we plan to roll out in phases as different customer segments and levels of demand return. A key component of our marketing plans will be leveraging our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and focusing on reaching our highly engaged member base and our many Marriott Bonvoy credit cardholders. Throughout this crisis, we have continued to communicate with our loyalty members, including with special promotions on our co-brand credit cards in the US, such as our offer for six times points on groceries. We have also extended elite benefits, and today, to help spark demand, we will announce a new promotion to buy gift cards for future hotel stays at a 20% discount. In Greater China, our joint venture with Alibaba has been very helpful in rebuilding demand. A recent spring sale run by Alibaba\u2019s Fliggy travel site was very successful and generated terrific near-term bookings. Bookings from Ctrip have also grown significantly over the past few weeks and are up over 15% for the first week of May versus the same time last year. Another key component of our recovery plan is communicating with our guests and associates about our focus on health and safety, and giving them the confidence they need to travel and stay with us. We recently announced enhanced global cleanliness guidelines, focused on elevating cleanliness levels and hospitality norms to meet the health and safety challenges presented by the new environment. We are also working to reduce the frequency of contact between associates and guests by continuing to roll out programs such as mobile check-in, mobile key and no-contact room service. I want to take moment to express my appreciation to our team of associates around the world. Amidst furloughs, reduced workweeks, temporary hotel closures, new cleaning requirements and very lean operation staffing, they continue to inspire me every day. Their constant messages to me of hope and belief in Marriott remind me over and over that we are so fortunate to have the best team in the business. The recovery is not going to happen uniformly across all regions and it is not going to occur overnight. It may take longer than any of us would like and we will likely operate a bit differently going forward, but we have taken the steps necessary to position the company to manage through this crisis successfully, and travel will rebound. Our people, our solid financial footing, our 30 industry-leading brands and our number one Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program continue to point toward a brighter future. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to share some organizational news. Dave Grissen, our current Head of the Americas, has decided to step down from his position as Group President of the Americas in the first quarter of 2021 after a 36-year career with Marriott. Dave and I started talking about his potential retirement last year, but neither he nor I felt the time was right to finalize any retirement. As we moved into 2020 and increasingly turned toward questions around how we will rebuild our business and our company on the other side of COVID-19, it became obvious that we needed our new leaders to be fully engaged in this process. Dave will be with us through Q1, allowing for a smooth and thoughtful transition, but he will be missed by all of us and we wish him all the best as he ventures into the next phase of his life. Dave, thank you for your extraordinary contributions to Marriott. Starting in 2021, we will remain organized in a continent structure, but our global lodging business will be consolidated under two fantastic veteran leaders : Liam Brown, the current Head of EMEA, will oversee North America; and Craig Smith, our current Head of Asia Pacific, will oversee all international regions outside of North America. Liam and Craig are excellent executives and bring tremendous leadership skills to their new posts. They have been key members of our leadership team for many years and will continue to be in the years ahead. My congratulations to both of them. My last organizational update is a particularly important one to me. Although we will take the next two years to implement and appropriately celebrate the leadership of Bill Marriott, we wanted to share with you that Mr. Marriott has informed our Board of Directors that he plans to transition to the role of Chair Emeritus in 2022. Bill has been fully engaged in Marriott\u2019s work for as long as I have been alive. And he remains a daily source of contact and inspiration to me. In the midst of COVID-19, I talk to him every day. While our conversations today are focused on the crisis we are fighting, they are of a piece with the ongoing conversations that we have had day in and day out, ever since the summer of 1992 when we first met at the tail end of another crisis, the first Gulf War and the recession that followed. To state the obvious, we will celebrate Bill Marriott for his contributions to this company, to its associates and to the industry between now and his transition to Chair Emeritus in two years. For now, Bill, let me say thank you. To me, you are a boss, a mentor, a friend and truly, family. I cannot imagine a time without your partnership and friendship, and I pray that there are many more years ahead for us. In anticipation of Bill\u2019s transition to the Chair Emeritus role, we expect that David Marriott will join our Board of Directors next year. David is well suited to serve on our board, and I know he will bring not only his operations and sales experience, but also his deep understanding of Marriott\u2019s culture to board level conversations and decision-making. One other quick point and I know we are giving you a peek into our forward-looking plans. When David joins the Marriott board, we expect that he would step down at that time as an executive of Marriott. I look forward to working with David as a Director, and then Chair for many years to come. And now, I will turn the call over to Leeny for more details on our finances. Leeny? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Thank you, Arne. I hope all of you and your families are staying healthy and safe. I also want to thank our teams around the globe for their dedication and tireless efforts during these unprecedented times. Worldwide RevPAR was down 22.5% for the quarter, driven by the sharp 60% global decline in March. First quarter gross fee revenues totaled $629 million comprised of $214 million of base management fees and $415 million of franchise fees. Under the terms of our contracts, our portfolio of managed hotels earned $64 million of incentive management fees or IMFs in the first quarter. However, under accounting rules we can only recognize IMFs to the extent that the full-year forecast supports that these fees will not be reversed later in the year. At this point, there is significant uncertainty around full year performance, so we did not recognize any IMFs in the quarter. Within franchise fees, other non-RevPAR related fees totalled approximately $140 million, up 5% from a year ago, primarily driven by stable year-over-year credit card and time share branding fees as well as higher year-over-year residential branding fees. Adjusted EBITDA of $442 million included $79 million of bad debt expense and guarantee reserves related to COVID-19. Given the uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of a recovery, we\u2019re unable to provide our normal quarterly and full year P&L guidance. Instead, I thought it would be helpful to talk through a modelling scenario for our monthly run-rate of major sources and uses of cash in the current environment with worldwide RevPAR down roughly 90% and also provide you with a few modelling sensitivities. Note that this is just one scenario and not an estimate of actual results. Marriott\u2019s overall cash flow is easiest to describe in two broad categories. The first category is classic cash flow at the corporate level, which is basically EBITDA less cash interest expense, cash taxes and investment spending. The second category relates to our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, which represent the costs that we charge out to our owners and franchisees to cover the programs and services we provide to them. Starting with corporate cash, at these extraordinarily low levels of RevPAR, we assume net cash outflows of roughly $90 million to $95 million per month. That\u2019s assuming cash sources of around $60 million to $65 million, and cash uses of about $155 million per month. The cash inflows are base management and franchise fees and other non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Given we are not currently recognizing any incentive fees due to the uncertainties around full year results, it\u2019s easiest to model RevPAR related base management and franchise fees based on 2019 actuals. If you adjust those for unit growth and the 90% decline in RevPAR, the result is roughly $20 million to $25 million of fees a month per point of RevPAR. Also, as a sensitivity for you, the impact of a 1 point change in RevPAR would be roughly $2 million of fees per month. As RevPAR climbs back closer to prior year levels, obviously the improvement in fees per point of RevPAR grows significantly. In this scenario, the remaining $40 million per month of fees is expected to come primarily from other non-RevPAR related franchise fees, mainly credit card branding fees, residential branding fees and timeshare royalty fees, all of which are much more stable. Assuming RevPAR is down 90%, we expect that corporate cash outflows could total approximately $155 million per month. Compared to our 2020 budget, we\u2019ve reduced our cash run-rate for corporate G&A by 30% excluding bad debt to about $40 million per month. And we\u2019ve eliminated or deferred around 45% of our original investment spending forecast of $700 million to $800 million for the full year, bringing our investment spending to roughly $35 million per month. The remaining $80 million per month includes cash interest expense, cash tax payments and the monthly cash outflows for our owned/leased hotel portfolio in this exceedingly low RevPAR environment. The second category of cash flows relates to the revenues and expenses for the programs and services that we provide to our hotels, for which we\u2019re entitled to reimbursement. As you know, our spend in reimbursement for hotel level programs and services are meant to net to zero over time, yet there can be timing differences between dollars we spend and dollars we collect. I\u2019ll break this second category of cash flows into two buckets. The first is the cash flow related to the Marriott Bonvoy program and the second is the timing of all our other programs and services. Cash flows into the loyalty program from hotels and our co-brand credit card issuers as members earn points. The cash outflows for Bonvoy are the payments made to hotels when members redeem points as well as the costs of running the program including marketing. This year, we expect to have much lower redemption expenses in terms of both volume of nights and the rate paid for those stays, given lower occupancies. At the current low occupancy rates, we estimate that we will generate several hundred million dollars of cash from the loyalty program this year or $45 million of cash benefit a month. This does not include the cash we recently received from our co-brand credit card issuers. That leaves the remainder of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses. A largest bucket is the direct pass-through of payroll and other operational costs at our hotels, primarily for our North American managed hotels. In 2019, these costs were around 75% of the more than $16 billion of GAAP reimbursed expenses. So far this year, we have reduced these pass-through costs by around two-thirds. These expenses are generally repaid to us within days, and in 2019, managed owners reimbursed us with very little exception or delay. At this point, a very small fraction of these managed hotels are delayed in paying us. Apart from these hotel level costs and loyalties, the remaining reimbursed expenses in 2019 supported mandatory programs and services we provide to our hotels. They cover brand sales and marketing funds, our reservation system, property management systems and the like. About two-thirds of the amounts charged to hotels to cover these costs, which are also included in cost reimbursement revenues, vary based on hotel level revenues or program usage with the remaining being a fixed charge per hotel or per key. That lines up well with our cost to provide these services, which are also about two-thirds variable and one-third fixed. With the significant cost cuts and changes we\u2019ve implemented in this low RevPAR environment, we believe that the cost reimbursement revenues due would cover our reimbursed expenses. But there could be some cash timing mismatch given the systems fee discount and payment deferral we provided for April and May as well as owners and franchisees extending their payables a bit. In this very low demand scenario, we could see roughly $100 million a month of higher working capital usage before considering the loyalty cash inflows. The net cash outflow for all programs and services including the positive cash flow from loyalty could be around $55 million a month, which brings the total company cash use to roughly $145 million to $150 million a month. It\u2019s worth noting that in April, despite the 90% decline in RevPAR, the company\u2019s cash burn rate was significantly better than that estimate. And of course, as trends improve, the cash burn rate should improve as well. I want to remind you that when you look on the P&L for cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses, it will look a bit different than the cash flows I\u2019ve just described, primarily due to the accounting for the loyalty program which requires that, as cash is received, it goes on to our balance sheet as deferred revenue with no immediate impact on the P&L. We\u2019ve been focused on preserving liquidity and shoring up our cash position. In mid-April, we issued $1.6 billion of five-year senior notes, and last week, we raised another $920 million through amendments to our co-brand credit card deals. We also eliminated dividends and share repurchases until further notice. Our current cash and cash equivalent amount on hand is around $3.9 billion. If you add to that cash, the undrawn capacity on our revolver of $1.3 billion, which we paid back on May 1, and deduct around $900 million of commercial paper currently outstanding, our net liquidity today is roughly $4.3 billion. We know the recovery could take a while, but we\u2019re confident we have the liquidity we need to manage through this situation, including paying back near-term debt maturities. We\u2019ve made solid progress in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our business and are prepared for the wide range of scenarios that could play out. We feel confident that we will come through this successfully and look forward to traveling and welcoming all of you at our hotels. Thank you for your time this morning, and we will now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Arne Sorenson : Hey, Shaun. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Good morning, Shaun. Shaun Kelley : Good morning. I was trying to type about as fast as I\u2019ve ever typed to get through this section you just gave. So thank you for all the detail and hope everyone is doing well. Leeny, maybe to start with a high level one to just digest everything you kind of gave us, and do really appreciate that, could you give us a sense on maybe just the broader franchise and management system at this point? What have been some of the asks by the owner community at this point as we think through what their own kind of cash level needs may be? And specifically, if you could give any color on the percentage or number of either managed or franchise hotels that are sort of asking for either fee deferrals or fee relief at this stage? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : So, a couple things. First, I\u2019ll remind everybody once again that a huge proportion of our fees that we charge are revenue-based, so there is an automatic decline that has happened as a result of the drop in RevPAR. So that if you think about it for the mandatory programs and services that we charge, when you also include the deferral and the 50% discount that we gave in April and May, there\u2019s actually very little due at the moment from \u2013 on the mandatory programs and services. At the managed hotels in North America, we have also, as I talked about, dropped payroll incredibly, as well as all the operating costs at the hotels. So of course, you do have owners, just as we too are thinking about how we are managing our payables, everybody\u2019s trying to manage their cash as best they can. But I will say, our owners and franchisees are paying their bills. We have a really very, very small fraction of our hotels that are having trouble paying at the moment, and then except for a bit of extended payable terms that you can see, otherwise, it\u2019s really all systems go for the moment. And as I said in April, we actually saw, relative to those numbers I gave, really a fairly dramatically better situation than the one that I gave you, but we wanted you to have the benefit of our cash planning so that we are making sure that, no matter the situation, that we\u2019re able to manage through it. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Good to hear everybody and hope all of you are \u2013 and your families are healthy and well. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : You too, Joe. Joseph Greff : Thanks. Just with respect to your hotel owners, do you have a sense in North America how many of them accessed federal loans relief program? And then my second question is, can you estimate what you think maybe breakeven occupancies are for your North American full service, North American select service hotels? And I guess in that breakeven occupancy threshold, what ADRs are you assuming there? Thank you, both. Arne Sorenson : So, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about the details of our owners\u2019 access of the Payroll Protection Program (sic) [Paycheck Protection Program] and other government support. Obviously, we\u2019re in touch with them and we hear back. We think that there are hundreds of hotels that have successfully applied for the Payroll Protection Program (sic) [Paycheck Protection Program]. How many of them have actually received the dollars is a little harder for us to keep track of. And the percentages that have been approved are in the 50% to 60% range, if you include the select service hotels. Select service hotels obviously tend to be more clearly small business than full service hotels, but for each hotel owner, there tends generally to be eligibility under some of these programs to get the kind of support that the government is intended to apply. We continue to work with them to try and navigate through that. I think the other thing that\u2019s important is what we hear anecdotally from our owners in North America is that lenders have been reasonably accommodating as well. And so you put those things together and then you put the collaboration that Leeny has just described between Marriott and our owners, which includes very much our cutting above property costs including costs of programs that are paid for by the system and then work at deferring brand standards and initiatives and working to tap \u2013 defer FF&E spending and to tap FF&E dollars and those sorts of things. And generally, we think the \u2013 well, there\u2019s pressure all around. We think overwhelmingly that the system is surviving so far. Obviously, it will get tougher the longer it lasts. But we do think we\u2019re at bottom and think we\u2019re likely to see some release in pressure as we go forward, as demand incrementally begins to return. The breakeven occupancy question is an interesting one. In a way, you could look at our portfolio in the United States \u2013 and, remember, April RevPAR down roughly 90% \u2013 and say why are only 16% of the hotels closed, because it\u2019s got to \u2013 at those sorts of numbers, there are many more hotels that are losing dollars than that are closed. And that\u2019s true. But the question is, do they lose \u2013 the question is not so much do they make money by staying open, but the question at the moment is do they lose less by staying open. And our general calculation is that by the time you get to 10% occupancy or so, you\u2019re probably better off from a purely financial perspective to stay open, that the losses will be lower than the losses associated with being closed. And remember, when you\u2019re closed, you\u2019ve still got labor costs for some labor that is required. You\u2019ve still got heating and cooling. You\u2019ve got security. You\u2019ve got other costs that cannot be avoided. And so it doesn\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s not a closing scenario that gets you instantly to a breakeven level. You\u2019re still losing money on that. I think when you look at what is a cash breakeven, obviously it\u2019s going to depend a little bit on select service versus full service and the level of services provided. The level of services provided in hotels with light occupancy today is less than the level of services that were provided before COVID-19 showed up. Think about food and beverage as an example which is likely to be the significantly truncated today compared to what it was just a few months ago. But broadly, you\u2019re going to probably break even at 30% or so occupancy in the select brands and maybe 40% occupancy in the full service brands. But again, still do better by being open at occupancy levels which are lower than that than you would do by being closed. The last point I think I\u2019d make on this is, not just in terms of RevPAR but in terms of hotel closings/openings, April seems to have defined the bottom, and when we look at the last couple of weeks, there have not been significant movements in the number of closed hotels but most days we\u2019re seeing one or two or three more hotels reopen than we are seeing hotels closed. And if anything, as we see demand start to crawl back as restrictions are released, I think the trend line now is towards more openings, not towards more closings. Joseph Greff : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Patrick Scholes : Hi. Good morning. Wondering if you could give us some thoughts... Arne Sorenson : Hey, Patrick. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : Hi. Good morning. Some thoughts about potential recovery. Do you see at this point groups returning in the back half of the year? Your thoughts on corporate fly-to demand? And then any early indications of summer leisure? I know it\u2019s sort of tough to figure out but just interested in your thoughts. Arne Sorenson : Well, I think what we\u2019ve got to say here is probably not incrementally all that new from what others in the industry have been saying the last few weeks and what we\u2019ve been saying actually the last few weeks. It\u2019s \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve got a global phenomenon underway that is sort of stunning in its breadth. We\u2019ve talked about China a little bit, and China does appear to be recovering and holding. I know there\u2019s lots of debate about whether or not there is a resurgence of the virus in China. We\u2019ve got tens of thousands of associates working in our hotels and basically have a way of tapping into that community and listening to both their sentiment and to some extent the data. And by and large what we hear there is reassuring that in fact demand is coming back and the virus spread does not appear to be profound. That doesn\u2019t tell us for certain where it\u2019s going in the next few months, but there is something that\u2019s encouraging there. When you go around the world, you\u2019re going to see a different dynamic in various parts of the world. I think in Europe, Europe, unlike China and the United States, is meaningfully more dependent on long-haul travel. You think about Europe as being a destination for vacationers from all around the world who want to see those great European cities, and because it\u2019s dependent on air and long-haul, I suspect it will be probably the slowest to get back to the kind of levels that we enjoyed before COVID-19. Advantages of China and the United States are they\u2019re both domestic markets. Even in normal times, the US is about 95% to 96% US travel with only 4% to 5% in total dependent on in-bound travel from the rest of the world. And by the way Mexico and Canada are both big source markets, and they\u2019re obviously fairly close. Sometimes those are drive-to inbound business. Sometimes they\u2019re flight, obviously. Looking at the US, which maybe where your question is focused, we obviously see the drive-to markets as being the strongest. You can see that in even the data we showed on select brands in the prepared comments are performing better. And I think that\u2019s both leisure and to some extent it is sort of local or regional business, but business that is dependent on the car. And I think that will come back the most. I think we\u2019ll see some cities perform better, so a couple of contrasts here. New York may be the stickiest because of its density and its reliance on mass transportation which creates some sense of risk. And so we would suspect \u2013 and also maybe a little bit their dependence on international travel which is higher than the US as a whole. But go to a market like San Antonio or even Chicago, where there is a much more likelihood that people can drive in, in the summertime, be outside, enjoy Lake Michigan or enjoy the outdoor destinations and I think we will see those markets perform better and faster. The slowest bit of business to come back will certainly be group, and we hear from our group customers that they want to get back to a place where they can bring people together, but they obviously want to do that in a way which is safe. And that depends on some things which we can influence like the protocols we use around cleanliness and meetings in the hotels, and we\u2019ve got great work underway there. On the meeting side, it will include probably lower density in our hotels, in other words, more square footage being used for per head at a meeting than would have been the case beforehand. Maybe sadly, we\u2019ve got the capacity to do that, but there are parts of this which we won\u2019t be able to control to, and to the extent those meetings are dependent on air travel, it\u2019s not just going to be how does the plane itself feel and the airlines I think are making good progress there, but how is it getting through the airports and can you get through the security lines in a way that makes sense. I think on balance \u2013 you\u2019ve heard this a little bit from the industry data which is out there. I think what we\u2019re seeing across the United States is folks are tiptoeing out of their homes a bit more the last few weeks. We\u2019re probably seeing occupancy click up a point a week or something like that the last few weeks. That\u2019s not enough to put a stake in the ground and declare that we\u2019ve got momentum towards a recovery, given how low the numbers actually are. But it does tell you that the early travellers, which are going to be drive-to leisure, local, domestic, are interested in sort of getting out there and reliving their lives. And if they can do that and over time build confidence, collectively, we can build confidence in the safety that we can enjoy if we\u2019re out of our homes, that will get better and better. And if, on the other hand, restrictions are released and the virus spread surges and we can\u2019t have that confidence as consumers, it will not be just a question of what the government restrictions are, but it will be a question of what that confidence level is and that will make the recovery slower. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you for the very detailed answer. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hi. Good morning. I hope everyone\u2019s well. Can you give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about net unit growth? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Well, we\u2019re watching it, I think, is the right answer. Obviously, we\u2019re a month and a half into the extraordinary crisis outside of China and a couple of months longer than that in China. In various parts of the world, construction was essentially banned. In some markets, it was an essential service that was allowed to continue. Beyond that, you\u2019ve got some question about hotels that were ready to open and whether or not the final furniture supply was in-hand or not or whether it was dependent on the global supply chain, which itself slowed down. I think we can say with a relatively high level of confidence that the overwhelming majority of hotels, which were scheduled to open in 2020 would have been very far along in their construction and they will still make sense to reopen, assuming some kind of reasonable assumptions around recovery. And so while there will be delay in getting them opened, we would expect that they will open. Whether that delay is a number of months or a number of quarters probably will depend a little bit on those supply chain dynamics, construction restrictions which by and large have been released. I mean I think California banned construction for a period of time, and I think construction is now back on in California. And just the owners\u2019 sense about \u2013 obviously there\u2019s less urgency to get open but whether it\u2019s more logical to be open or to defer opening. It is likely we will have fewer new hotel openings than we assumed before COVID-19 in 2020. Whether that\u2019s down by half or down by a quarter, we\u2019ll have to watch and see. I think it\u2019s still way too early to identify. I do think that most of the hotels that were scheduled to open in 2020 will ultimately open into our system, and the same I think can be said for certainly most of the first half of 2021 openings as well. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : Hi, Smedes. Smedes Rose : Hi. I wanted to ask you guys and others have made pronouncements around what cleaning will look like in hotels in kind of a post-COVID world as you reopen. Just how do you think about just the overall labor cost at a hotel going forward? Do you think they\u2019ll ultimately stay about the same? Or do you see significant increases or decreases from here? Arne Sorenson : Well, it\u2019s going to be very interesting I think to watch. I think in the early stages, obviously, we\u2019re going to have less F&B service, for example. I think we\u2019re likely to have either fewer restaurants open, fewer meetings and the staffing that\u2019s associated with meetings, probably a difference in the approach to buffets and some of those sorts of things. So I suspect in the early quarters, it\u2019s going to be more grab and go and pre-packaged material, vary a little bit obviously by segment and by market around the world. But I think those things would generally tell you that for the balance of 2020, labor costs as a percentage of revenues are probably likely to be lower. I think when you look longer term, it\u2019s going to be interesting. Certainly, in the first stage, we would expect that digital check-in, think about using your phone as a key or checking in at a kiosk, will be important both to protect associates and to protect guests. I think there will be relatively greater effort in housekeeping between guests than there was before to make sure that those rooms are virus-free to the extent we can be certain of that. I suspect there could be relatively less services provided during the stay, however, and those things may offset each other a little bit. But obviously, we\u2019ll work our way through that in the best case we can. Long-winded way of saying I think in the near term certainly labor costs will be less, and obviously, we\u2019ll be looking longer term at making sure that we meet what our guests\u2019 expectations are and that the services provided are the services that are needed by our guests and also making sure that our owners get back to a place where their investments make sense and where their financial well-being is good for the long term. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Could I just ask you one more too? Do you think \u2013 I guess particularly in North America, as maybe some owners struggle to get reopened or maybe have difficulty working with their banks, I mean, does Marriott \u2013 would you see more of a lending capacity or potentially putting out guarantees for debt to some of the owners maybe on a short-term basis? Or is that sort of not on the table right now? Arne Sorenson : Leeny, you got that? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Yeah, I do. Yeah, I think as you know, we typically really use our capital to propel our growth. Now, we do obviously from time to time work with an owner in a specific situation, particularly when there\u2019s reinvestment going into a property as we have done with Host, for example. But I think, broadly speaking, we have reimbursables. We expect to get paid. We provide those programs and services, and the owners have an obligation to pay us. So while there is an ongoing dialogue and we certainly, as you\u2019ve seen from all of our efforts to reduce our costs as well as to defer the payment of some mandatory required fees, then wanting to be understanding about the situation. But at the same time, I would not expect to see that we would be doing extensive either guarantees or loans to deal with this. Smedes Rose : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Instinet. Harry Curtis : Hi. Leeny, just a quick follow-up on that question. As you think about your development going forward, does this crisis really change the way that you approach key money and mezz loans, given the reserves that you\u2019ve \u2013 not the reserve, but the impairment charge that you took today? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : So first of all, on the impairment charge, if you think about the biggest chunks of the impairment charge today, two of them were related to leases. They are leases that have been around, and as you know with the lease accounting change, we have these assets on our books called right of use assets that extend over the life of the lease. So frankly, they really don\u2019t relate to the classic sort of giving of key money with that. And frankly, there was one impairment charge that we took this quarter that we mentioned, the $14 million, that\u2019s on a very large portfolio of limited service hotels. And as part of that transaction, there was an agreement by the owner to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to reinvent those properties. So quite frankly, still a transaction that was in the broader scheme of keeping up our portfolio and making them competitive, make a ton of sense. Now, I think, in general, as you think about what we have to invest in our pipeline, it\u2019s actually fairly small. It tends to be that on the more complex higher-end projects that we at the margin are going to have a little bit more capital in than if it\u2019s on a kind of small price-limited service hotel. But I think fundamentally, we still view that the way that we approach investing in deals to be appropriate. Now, at the same time, I will say we are obviously cognizant of kind of where we are from a liquidity standpoint as well as rebuilding the business over the next few years. So when we think about, for example, our restrictions that we have put into our revolver covenant waiver, we\u2019re obviously going to keep very closely, a very close watch on the amounts of investment that we\u2019re spending. But I think from a fundamental approach, we still feel really good about the value that we are driving with these key money type of investment. Harry Curtis : And thank you. Arne, maybe you can respond to the second question, which is, as you imagine the recovery two to three years from now, and the house process margin that was generated across your portfolio in 2019, you\u2019ve walked through some of the gives and takes on higher and lower expenses. Is it unrealistic to think that you can get there in the next two or three years, assuming the same level of occupancy? Arne Sorenson : Get back to the same level of profit per room, you\u2019re talking about? Harry Curtis :  Exactly. Arne Sorenson : Yeah, yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s certainly really not unrealistic to try, and I think we will work hard at that, if not getting back to the same levels, getting to even better levels. I do think that the \u2013 in the first instance, the recovery, top line recovery obviously is really important to this as well as what we do on the cost side. Top line recovery in the first instance is going to be COVID-19 driven. What is the sense of government restriction that gets in the way of our business? And what is the sense of sort of remaining concern or anxiety about the spread of the virus that dampens down demand? And the recovery from that is going to depend significantly on the progress of the virus, the development of a vaccine, the development of other treatments, maybe ubiquity of testing, all the things that are being talked about every day and endlessly every day. I think beyond that, that the question about the top line is going to be driven by the economy. And none of us knows how severe the economic hangover will be when the fear of COVID-19 recedes. But there is every reason to suspect that there may be some stickiness to a weaker demand environment, at least for a period of time, simply because of GDP activity. And so, those things I think are both important from a top line perspective. From a cost perspective, we will obviously do the kinds of things that we\u2019re going to do. To the extent the top line is depriving us of dollars per room of revenue, that challenge becomes a little bit more significant. But I think as we move our way down the recovery and we see revenue per room come back, we ought to have a fighting chance at getting profits per room back too. Harry Curtis : Thanks, everybody. And Leeny, if you could send us the spreadsheet of your presentation, that would save us a lot of work. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi. Hello. Good morning, everyone. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Powell : Good morning. Question on, I guess, supply growth. So do you expect this event to have an impact on how vendors approach construction financing? Do you expect them to maybe require more equities and require more cash reserves? And could that be kind of a long-term headwinds to new construction over time? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Well, I\u2019ll start. And then, Arne, feel free to add on. So I think first of all, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s already under construction. The financial institutions today are in vastly better health than they were back in the Great Recession. And as Arne was saying earlier, these deals still make sense. They\u2019re under construction. There\u2019s no reason to think that they won\u2019t get finished as the final supplies are delivered and they have the ability to open. Now, could it be that they open a bit later, depending on the environment for demand? Sure. But again, from everything we hear anecdotally as well as see \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you notice around your towns that construction actually is one of the few businesses that you can actually still see a fair amount going on. And so, as you then think about the pipeline of new deals, I think that clearly is one that there\u2019s more question around and that there is likely to be at least a bit more of a wait-and-see attitude by the lenders on committing to new deals. However, the one thing I will say is that as you think about, if they are going to lend, who are they going to lend to, it\u2019s kind of classically been the case that the stronger brands get the financing when deals are getting done. And I would expect with all that you\u2019ve heard around what we\u2019re doing related to cleanliness and making sure that the guests know the standards that they can expect our hotels to have when they come, that will continue to be one of the strong points that our brands have when a developer goes to consider getting a loan. And the other thing I\u2019ll say that the conversations that our developers are having continue apace. Obviously, conversion activity is up right now as we think about those conversations as well as then continued on new construction. These are folks who are looking for the longer term, and from a longer term perspective, they still view it quite strongly. Anthony Powell : Got it. Thanks. And you mentioned, Arne, that you saw some good RevPAR index gains in January and February. How do you maintain that momentum in this kind of environment? Is that something you can even focus on? And looking maybe to early next year in a downturn scenario, what tools do you have to continue to grow RevPAR index? Arne Sorenson : Well, we call that Marriott Bonvoy. I think as of the end of the quarter, we\u2019re at 142,000 members or something like that. And I think the program remains a powerful tool for us to drive loyalty of travelers to our brands. And we\u2019ll continue to stay focused on making sure that program is strong and is relevant to folks, both as they travel and when they\u2019re not traveling, and I think that will be the principal tool in our toolkit. Beyond that, of course, it\u2019s the questions that are sometimes related, sometimes mutually reinforcing of that but it is the breadth of distribution. It is hotels that continue to inspire people when they dream about travel, which is often about resort destinations and about luxury and lifestyle hotels, not exclusively, but that certainly is a piece of that. And I think our portfolio there is extraordinarily strong. And then questions about how do we go to market with the sales force and how do we make sure we\u2019re delivering the kinds of operational excellence which Marriott has long been known for. I think all of those things will remain tools that we rely on. We\u2019re disappointed obviously by COVID-19 for so many reasons, but partly the momentum that we had built in the latter part of 2019 and which continued into 2020 with, as we mentioned, 330 basis points of index growth in January and February, which are massive numbers for a portfolio of our size, speak very well for our ability to get back there and rebuild that momentum. There\u2019s nothing about COVID-19 which should disrupt that momentum in the years ahead. Anthony Powell : Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on what you mentioned earlier about unit growth and I understand the new construction uncertainty of kind of how much of that will get delayed, but I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about conversions and what level of interest you may be seeing, especially given that some owners out there not in your system are probably under some pressure. And how much could conversions offset some of the slower growth in new units? And how quickly could they get into your pipeline? And then just as a point of comparison on the same topic, if you could tell us a little bit more about how in the last downturn that may have \u2013 it seems like conversions obviously uptick in a downturn. And how much did that offset changes in maybe what your \u2013 the decline in new unit growth? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : So, Leeny, you may have this data top of mind. I\u2019m not sure I do. But if you look through cycles, and this would be directional, not probably as concrete as you\u2019d like, Robin, in a weaker environment, conversions go up. They go up for us. They go up for the stronger brands, because not every hotel can perform as well in a weaker environment. And so, we\u2019re already seeing conversations pop up where folks are looking at oh, my goodness, how do I get this hotel reopened, and don\u2019t I need a pipeline of customers in a loyalty program today more than I needed six months ago or three months ago. And so, all of that will help. I think at the same time, it\u2019s fair to say that while conversions step up in a weaker environment, new builds step down and they probably step down at least as much as the conversions step up. And so, we would, if you look at 2010, 2011, 2012, the hotels that were under construction before the Great Recession continued to open into our system. But we had not signed hotels, new hotels in 2009 and 2010 at the kind of pace that we had before the Great Recession hit. And so we end up with a percentage unit growth even with the benefit of conversions which is certainly not higher than what we would have had before and, if my recollection serves, would, on average, have been a little bit lower. I think when we look now into the next period of time, I think our brands are stronger, I think the portfolio is stronger, I think the momentum with the loyalty program and our index numbers are stronger. All of which will bode well for conversion activity as by the way is the depth of the decline in performance of the industry as a whole, which gives then much more motivation I think for owners to move. At the same time, as Leeny has just gone through, I think we\u2019re going to see that while the banks are much stronger than they\u2019ve been in the prior crises, they will inevitably pause and either require more equity or get to see whether or not we can get more clarity before they\u2019re going to provide the kind of financing commitments that they were providing before COVID-19 hit. Put all those things together, I suspect we\u2019ll find opportunities here. But we will be less likely to be seeing an increase near term in net rooms openings into our system than a decrease. Leeny, do you disagree? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : No, I totally agree. The only thing I\u2019ll add, Robin, is one of the differences between now and the Great Recession is our strong portfolio of soft brands, and frankly, the interest that we\u2019re seeing in those brands around the world. So the conversion vehicles that we have now as compared to 12 years ago, I do think are meaningfully stronger, which I think is helpful. I think the financing realities are going to stay the same, so that\u2019s kind of we\u2019re going to have to \u2013 if somebody\u2019s looking for financing or refinancing to do a deal, we\u2019ll have to work through that in the demand environment with COVID. But I do think that we\u2019ve got the right portfolio of brands, kind of across all 30. And we definitely are seeing increasing conversations. But as Arne said, if you\u2019re looking at kind of normally maybe 15% to 20% of your room openings are conversion and let\u2019s say that number goes up to a third, that still is not going to offset what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the slowdown in new construction. Robin Farley : Great. That makes sense. Thank you. And maybe one small follow-up. And just if you think about sort of last year or something typical, what percent of your conversions were from the soft brands, which like you said, something you didn\u2019t have in the last downturn? Thanks. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : In North America, it\u2019s going to be overwhelmingly that way. So if you think about in full service, the full service rooms that we opened may be about call it 25%, 20% of our room openings in North America, because limited service is such a big chunk in our current pipeline, not of the existing stock but of the room openings, they\u2019re going to overwhelmingly be soft brand, either new build or conversions. So I\u2019d say we can get you the specific numbers, but a good percentage. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz of Jefferies. David Katz : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Arne Sorenson : Good morning. David Katz : Good to hear everyone\u2019s voices, and thank you for all the detail and transparency as usual. I just wanted to pose a strategic issue. When you sort of think about growing your business going forward and in the context of this event and other events we\u2019ve been through, how do you think about the hurdle rates of taking on a hotel as a management contract versus a franchise with a third-party operator and sort of calibrating all of the risks and returns associated with all that, given where we are? And this may be a larger question for another day, but I thought I\u2019d pose it anyway. Arne Sorenson : Yeah, it\u2019s a fair question and obviously one that has been raised a few times. I think there are obvious differences between management and franchise. The franchise model is dramatically more prevalent in the lower segments of the industry. Franchising is also dramatically more prevalent in the US than it is in other markets around the world. And there are obviously different reasons for those distinctions. One is that the farther up the chain scale you go, the more likely you\u2019re getting into group, the more likely you\u2019re getting into luxury, the greater premium is placed on operational expertise. And by no means do I mean to suggest that there aren\u2019t franchisees that have expertise that is able to do that. But not all franchisees do and in some markets of the world, those franchisees by and large have not existed yet. I think that there is room for us to consider whether in some of the lower segments we have more management than we need to have, whether we\u2019ve had sort of a cultural bias towards management that is unnecessary. At the same time, I think the power of the luxury brands, the power of the lifestyle brands, the power in the group space, the power in food and beverage, I for one wouldn\u2019t trade that away. I think that is something that is going to drive the stickiness of the loyalty program, drive aspirational travel, drive higher-end travel which will continue to be strong. And we want very much to keep that as a prominent and industry-leading part of our portfolio and would not trade Marriott\u2019s model for being purely in the lower segments. There might be a different risk profile there, but there\u2019s also a different upside this year. David Katz : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Wes Golladay : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Can you talk about what drove the $65 million of bad debt expense this quarter? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Yeah, sure. As you know, the new accounting standard called CECL, better known as CECL, does it a little bit differently than the way that bad debt was done for us before, and it\u2019s an accounting standard that everybody out there has got to follow. And before, for us, it was truly writing them off once it was very clear that the receivable was absolutely uncollectible. The requirement now is a little bit more as you think about like a classic loan portfolio for a bank, where it has to have obviously what you reflect as uncollectible, but also an estimate of future expected losses. So it requires that you go when you\u2019re looking at your past history of your receivables and making an estimate based on performance of where they will prove out, and so you actually are taking a classic loan loss provision against that base of receivables as well as when you\u2019ve actually got a specific receivable that\u2019s deemed uncollectable. So as you can see in the number that we talked about, $65 million, as part of what was in G&A this quarter, that obviously is meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. So it\u2019s got whatever ones that we very specifically deem uncollectible but also given the environment an estimate of future expected losses. Wes Golladay : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James. William Crow : One for each of you. Leeny, is there any risk to collecting what is owed from the timeshare business? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : I\u2019m sure they\u2019re listening to this call, so I would say, no. No. I think that\u2019s, as you know, is overwhelmingly a fixed charge, and we feel great about our partner, Marriott Vacations Worldwide, and we do not believe that there is risk associated with that fee. William Crow : Okay. And then, Arne, bigger picture, any change given the current dynamics to your investment, your commitment to Homes & Villas? Arne Sorenson : Oh, no, I don\u2019t think so. The amount of money we\u2019ve invested in Homes & Villas is really very modest. You\u2019re talking about a handful of millions of dollars, something like that, to keep the business up and running. And I think the way we\u2019ve positioned that business, which is the higher end of the home-sharing space sort of skewing towards whole home and luxury which is quite different from traditional hotel product and has different dynamics I think too in a COVID-19 environment, because you\u2019re not really sharing a part of a home and you\u2019re ending up in a place which I think can be where we can deliver the kind of professional services that we like to deliver which suggests there\u2019s still opportunity for that. It is, as a consequence, I think something that we will continue to pay attention to. William Crow : Do you think it will ramp back up similar to the way the hotels are ramping up? Arne Sorenson : Yeah, I would think so. I mean, it\u2019s obviously a tiny business for us by comparison to what we\u2019re doing, and it is leisure focused, more leisure focused than our hotel business is. There could be some modest differences in the way that the ramp occurs. I wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019re very dramatic though. William Crow : Okay. Thank you. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario of Baird. Michael Bellisario : Good morning, everyone. Arne Sorenson : Hey, Michael. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Good morning. Michael Bellisario : Just one quick question for you. I think you mentioned payment deferrals and 50% fee discounts, but that was I think just for April and May. When do you decide or what gets you to offer the same concessions for, say, June and July, for example, or maybe even longer? What are you looking for? What do you have to see? What do you have to hear from franchisees? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Well, again, I think as I talked about before, we\u2019ve done a remarkable job of being able to reduce our costs down to this level where we were able to offer this and still feel like we\u2019ll be able to recoup our expenses in providing these kind of basic mandatory programs and services. So I don\u2019t expect at this point that we would be looking at offering a further discount. Michael Bellisario : And then what\u2019s the timing or your expected timing for recouping those fees? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Oh, sorry. Yes. September. Michael Bellisario : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just a quick one from me. Arne, Leeny, what percentage of your occupied room nights in 2019 were from guests originating from a flight? Arne Sorenson : We\u2019ve asked that question too. You may have noticed that when you check into a hotel we actually don\u2019t typically ask people how they came. And so we\u2019ve looked at this a little bit based on other data sources. And it won\u2019t surprise you to learn that it varies dramatically from market to market. The select brands in the United States are going to be much less dependent on fly-to business than some markets where basically you can\u2019t get there unless you fly. Think about the Canary Islands as an example. Our estimate is it\u2019s probably half, something like that. But again, in a way you\u2019ve got to be careful about a global average because it hides dramatic variation within it. Carlo Santarelli : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, if I could, just one quick follow-up. With respect to the, I guess, it\u2019s $900 million of commercial paper outstanding right now, the next payments on that are due \u2013 any kind of sense of when that [indiscernible]. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Yeah. Mostly in the third quarter. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, both, very much. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : Can you tell me what percentage of your pipeline is under contract or approved but has not yet begun construction? And, Arne, you mentioned you haven\u2019t really seen an unusual amount of deals drop from the pipeline. Are you surprised by that? And I guess a lot of the conversation today seems to be around financing availability going forward. But from an owner\u2019s perspective, the economics of building today are certainly very different. So I guess why wouldn\u2019t we see a lot of that particular segment of the pipeline go away, the segment that has not begun construction? Arne Sorenson : [indiscernible] started construction. So I think the number we shared with you \u2013 and jump in here, team, if I\u2019m remembering this wrong \u2013 230,000 of the 516,000 are under construction. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : That\u2019s right. Arne Sorenson : So that\u2019s like 40%, something like that. 45% maybe. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Arne Sorenson : In that range. And so that\u2019s the concrete number we can give you. I think what happens with this, the balance that are not under construction over the course of the next couple of years, there\u2019s a few things to bear in mind here. One is that hotels are not entering that pipeline until typically they have been worked for a substantial period of time. It could be a year on average, although I\u2019m guessing here a little bit where an owner is identifying a site, doing detailed work about how much it\u2019s going to cost to build it, doing pro formas about what the returns are going to be and it is not, even though it may not be under construction, it is something which is very serious. We\u2019re not putting deals in our pipeline, for example, just because somebody shows up and says I want to build a courtyard in X market, but I haven\u2019t identified the site yet or I don\u2019t have a specific deal to get done. And when viewed in that context, I don\u2019t think it is at all surprising that 60 days into a crisis like this one that has a fairly uncertain path out that people are being tentative about making permanent decisions about killing deals that they\u2019ve worked on for a period of time. I think the second thing to bear in mind is while we certainly have suffered a substantial hit in terms of top line performance, we will all be looking together to see what the best thinking can be about when that top line comes back. And for hotels that have not yet been built, what is the advantage that is available to me, if I can get it financed at a lower construction cost? And if I\u2019m not open and I\u2019m not going to be open for the two or three years that I need to be under construction, which may coincide with the weaker demand environment and also the weaker construction environment, my deal actually may be a decent deal and I may decide to pursue it. I probably won\u2019t accelerate my construction until I get smarter about thinking that through, but there will be upsides as well as downsides associated with this weakness for projects that are not yet under construction. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you. And just a point of clarification, if I may. You did give the number, 45% that\u2019s under construction. But is that other 55%, is some of that conversions? Or are you saying that all that 55% is [indiscernible]? Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Yeah. I can give you that. So roughly 16,000 are pending conversions, and then as we said in the press release, about 24,000 are approved, but not yet signed. All the rest are new build pending construction starts. Jared Shojaian : Got it. Thank you very much. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Call it, roughly 240,000, broadly speaking. Jared Shojaian : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke of Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Hi. A couple of [indiscernible] again, I believe. The first one is just your view on rates. You\u2019ve talked about offering a 20% discount for prepaid vouchers. Your rate was down just 1% in the last quarter on the hotels where you control it. So just much are you willing to flex the rate to drive incremental demand? Arne Sorenson : Well, I think we\u2019ll watch that obviously. We want to make sure that we\u2019re not dropping rate to chase demand, which is not there and that obviously does nothing for us. At the same time, we compete in an industry which is highly distributed in terms of its pricing. And this is one of the challenges that we bear perpetually. People view us as, okay, you\u2019re the largest hotel company in the world, doesn\u2019t that give you pricing power. Well, the fact of the matter is, even as the largest hotel company in the world, we\u2019ve only got \u2013 what\u2019s our global distribution, Leeny? 14%? 15%? Something like that of all rooms in the world? And a significant number... Kathleen Kelly Oberg : 7% percent globally. 16%, North America, 16%. 3% outside of the world. Arne Sorenson : And many of those rooms are priced by our franchisees, not priced by Marriott. And so we will \u2013 we\u2019re not going to push rates down by any means. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure we\u2019re maintaining pricing power, but there will be price competition in our industry too as we try and get demand energized and coming back into the system. And we\u2019ll do the best we can, making the kinds of judgments that need to be made. Richard Clarke : And just a quick follow-up, if I may. Just the comment on incentive fees, you booked none this quarter, despite receiving some. Just whether I can understand how \u2013 I wonder what process would you refund incentive fees you received, and what assumptions are you making to book now in the first quarter. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : So, as you know, you basically are looking every month at the expectation of the performance against a budget and against a target, depending on what the contract requires. So if there\u2019s an owner\u2019s priority then you need to have exceeded that but again, based on that month\u2019s performance expectation. The issue, however, becomes you don\u2019t actually technically earn it at the end of the year, until you see what the full year performance is. So based on, for example, January and February which were really terrific and really strong performance, we clearly were clicking along, doing well, and as I said, now would have locked in early on $64 million of incentive fees, however, even despite Greater China starting to really feel some impact in February and March. But when we look, knowing as we enter into April that you\u2019re looking at 90% decline in RevPAR, our comfort that we can feel secure, that we won\u2019t have to give those back is not great enough for us to feel like that we can recognize them as income. Richard Clarke : Very good. Thank you very much. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Rich Hightower of Evercore. Rich Hightower : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question here. Arne Sorenson : Hi, Rich. Rich Hightower : Hope everybody\u2019s well. So can you just help us understand the implied cost of capital for the $900-odd-million of coming in incrementally from the credit card agreements? Just help \u2013 I know there\u2019s a lot of assumptions in there but just help us understand that as a source versus other sources of capital. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Sure. So let me do this, and then, Arne, obviously jump in. Think about it this way, that as people spend on their credit cards, our credit card issuers pay us an agreed amount of money, based on that credit card spend. And that is to compensate us for obviously being a part of the Bonvoy program and also for being able to affiliate with the Marriott brands. So when you think about that kind of amount over a number of years, there\u2019s kind of an expectation about how much you could be collecting in revenues from the credit card companies. And basically, it\u2019s getting some of it upfront. So what will happen over the next several years is what they will pay us based on the amount of credit card spend will be moderately a modest amount less than they otherwise would have paid us. So if you think about it from a kind of classic cost of capital, it\u2019s extremely efficient and economic for Marriott to have. It also doesn\u2019t have obviously any of the classic characteristics of debt in terms of required repayment terms, et cetera. So it\u2019s really, again, overwhelmingly a reflection of monies that we receive earlier that then will get essentially paid back by them paying us less than they otherwise would have over the next several years. . Arne Sorenson : And the cost is less than our last bond deal. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Meaningfully. Rich Hightower : Got it. Got it. Thank you, guys. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Arne Sorenson : Thank you all very much for your time this morning. We appreciate obviously your interest in us and in the recovery of Marriott and the industry. Wishing nothing but the best as we work our way through this challenging time, as a business, as an industry and as society. But know that we\u2019ll be there to welcome you as soon as you get back on the road with bells on. Thank you. Kathleen Kelly Oberg : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participant lines have been placed in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Arne Sorenson to begin. Please go ahead, sir. Arne Sorenson : Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2020 conference call. I hope everyone is safe and healthy during these difficult times.  Joining me today this morning are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President-Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President-Investor Relations. I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts, and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency and year-over-year changes, and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. The lodging industry continues to be profoundly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic, and the current operating environment remains quite challenging. Second quarter worldwide RevPAR was down 84%. While April fell 90% the toughest year-over-year comparison on record. Demand has risen steadily since then. RevPAR declined 85% in May, 78% in June; and 70% in July. Many of our hotels that were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 have now reopened. Today, 9% of our global properties remain closed compared to more than 25% in April. Since April occupancy level have increased each month in every region around the world albeit at varying rates. Global occupancy in July hit 31% for all hotels, increasing 19 percentage points from April.  And occupancy in July for the hotels that were opened for each of the last fourth months, reached 39%; growing 23 percentage points over that period. There is still no visibility around when RevPAR could return to 2019 levels; however, the global industry trends experienced over the last couple of months give us confidence that people will continue to increase their travel. We are optimistic that second quarter will mark the bottom and the worst is now behind us.  Greater China which represents 9% of our rooms, over 90% of which are managed is leading the recovery, and has seen rapid improvements in occupancy and new bookings. With the virus mostly contained at this point, many domestic travel restrictions have been lifted; and the number of daily passenger domestic flights is now around 80% of pre-COVID levels. While leisure and drive-to-destinations led the initial recovery; it is encouraging to see business transient as well as group also picking up nicely. Occupancy levels in Greater China have reached 60%, up significantly from the single digit levels in mid-February; and much closer to the 70% we saw at the same time last year. RevPAR has followed a similar trajectory; after declining 85% year-over-year in February, RevPAR in Greater China improved to down 34% in July; averaging over 10 percentage points of improvement per month. At the current rate of recovery and assuming no wide resurgence of COVID-19, the Greater China market could approach 2019 occupancy and RevPAR levels as early as next year, even assuming limited international guests. In 2019, nearly 80% of its room nights were sourced from guests within China. Trends in the rest of Asia Pacific are improving at a slower pace as countries are in various phases of reopening and as certain borders remain closed. But the recovery of travel in Greater China demonstrates the resiliency of demand once there is a sense that the virus is better under control, and restrictions can be safely lifted. In North America 96% of our hotels are now open. We are experiencing a steady recovery across all chain scales, although the rate of recovery within markets and by hotel type has varied tremendously. In 2019, domestic travelers accounted for 95% of North American room nights, a benefit in the current environment. Leisure demand has been strong in resort areas, as well as in secondary and tertiary drive-to-markets; not surprisingly our extended stay hotels have experienced the fastest pace of recovery. New bookings in North America have been building nicely led by near-term leisure transient reservations. Despite the recent surge in cases in some states, consumers are increasing their travel. While U.S airline passenger traffic is still well below last year's levels; the number of air travelers the last two weeks of July has more than triple -- was more than triple they are in the first two weeks of May. And system-wide North America RevPAR continued to improve in July to a year-over-year decline of 69%, which is seven percentage points better than June. Historically leisure has made up roughly one-third of our total room nights in North America. The more interesting part of this statistic is that the monthly variance in that percentage is actually quite small. In 2019, the estimated proportion from leisure was around 36% during the summer, and only declined to 32% in September and October. We expect that solid leisure demand will continue through Labor Day in North America and could continue into the fall, as employers and schools alike operate remotely. Business transient in group demand in North America while lagging are showing very early signs of improvement. For now the group bookings outside of those associated with our caregiver and first responder programs tend to be mostly smaller ones such as weddings or travel sports teams. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region or EMEA and our Caribbean and Latin America region or CALA posted the lowest occupancy levels and steepest RevPAR declines in the second quarter. Severe restrictions following rising rates of COVID cases in many countries combined with a much higher dependence on international travelers in these regions have suppressed demand in these regions. In 2019, the percentage of room nights from international travelers was around 40% in Europe, 50% in the Middle East and Africa; and 60% in CALA. 75% of our hotels in EMEA and 70% in CALA were closed for most of the second quarter. Trends in both regions have started to improve recently as the prevalence of cases drops and border restrictions ease. Many of our hotels in these regions are welcoming guests again with under 30% remaining temporarily closed. On the development front, owners are showing great interest in our brands with Greater China again out in front. Greater China contributed nearly one-third of deal signings in the first half of the year with the entire Asia-Pacific region accounting for roughly half of all signings. Owners in the region are taking a long-term view on the market. Year-to-date, we have signed 30% more deals in Asia Pacific than we did in the first half of 2019. The pace of signings is not as robust in other regions around the world largely due to the lackluster lending environment and owner uncertainty. We cancelled one of our monthly deal approval meetings in the spring, which reduced our signings year-to-date, but we are having productive conversations with owners and franchisees, who want to move forward. Some are hoping to see lower construction costs in the weaker economic environment for new builds, while others are interested in conversions to our brands.  Our pipeline totaled approximately 510,000 at the end of the second quarter with over 230,000 rooms under construction or around 45%. The pipeline is 1% lower than at the end of the first quarter with the slowed signings and a few more projects than usual put on hold. While construction activity has resumed in most parts of the world, we still expect some openings will be delayed due to slower construction timelines and supply chain issues related to COVID-19. There is uncertainty surrounding future worldwide room's growth, but given current trends; we could see net room's growth between 2% and 3% in 2020. The final result will depend a great deal on the way the pandemic plays out around the world in the remainder of the year. Over the last several months, we have enhanced our liquidity position and materially reduced our cost structures at both the corporate and property level. We are in constant dialogue with our owners and franchisees, and are working together to navigate these extremely challenging times. As demand returns, we are adjusting our operating protocols and ramping up our business in a thoughtful way. First and foremost, we are focused on the health and safety of our associates, and guests and on communicating these important efforts. We continue to enhance our cleanliness guidelines to meet the health and safety challenges presented by COVID-19. We have mandated that all hotels have electrostatic sprayers to help quickly disinfect public areas, and all properties must submit a monthly commitment to clean certification. And we are increasingly leveraging technologies like mobile check-in, mobile key; and mobile chat between guests and hotel associates to reduce face-to-face interactions, while amplifying operational efficiencies. Additionally, we've announced that guests are required to wear face coverings in the public spaces of our hotels in the Americas, a policy that is also currently in place for associates globally. We are stepping up our marketing efforts around the globe as demand improves. Each region is carefully monitoring social, economic and travel trends, and implementing a phased-in approach based on local consumer sentiment and travel intent. With over 143 million members globally, Marriott Bonvoy, our award-winning Global Loyalty Program underpins all our marketing strategies. We remain focused on engaging our members with targeted email campaigns, and various promotions; such as points accelerators on our co-brand credit cards for gas, dining and groceries; gift card discounts and our current Bonvoy boutiques is sweepstakes for items like bedding and robes. For elite members, we have extended their status through early 2020, and in June credited their accounts with a one-time deposit of elite night credits; allowing them to reach the next tier faster. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I must take a moment to say how proud I am of our incredible team of associates around the world. This has been a time of tremendous stress and uncertainty yet our teams continue to impress and inspire me. I also want to comment on the current social justice movements. As we said in our recent statement, we stand against racism. We believe that racism must be eradicated. Our company believes in equality, justice and putting people first no matter what they look like, here they come from; what their abilities are or who they love. My management team and I are deeply committed to building on our historic commitment to diversity, and to do more to champion diversity, equality and inclusion; both within our company and within the broader community. In closing, while this was by far the most challenging quarter in the history of our company; I am pleased with our progress. I believe we can look forward to a brighter future for travel and for Marriott. With our unparalleled portfolio of 30 global brands, superior loyalty programs; strong liquidity position and the best team in the business, I am optimistic about the trajectory of our business in the months and years ahead. And now Leeny, who has ably led our finance team to buttress our liquidity and to set Marriott up with the strength it needs to survive this crisis, will talk more about our financials. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Arne. And I hope all of you and your families are staying well. I also want to express my appreciation to all our associates around the globe for their dedication during these unprecedented times. This morning, I will review our second quarter results and current trends. There's still too much uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of the recovery to give P&L guidance for the rest of the year. But I'll provide an update on the monthly cash burn model that I shared with you on our first quarter call. As Arne noted, second quarter global RevPAR was 84%. Second quarter gross fee revenues totaled $234 million, comprised of $40 million from base management fees; $182 million from franchise fees and $12 million from Incentive Management Fees or IMF. In the first quarter, we did not record any IMF given a significant uncertainty regarding hotel level full year performance. In the second quarter, we had more information and could better predict where hotel performance will warrant IMF recognition for the full year, and as such we recorded IMF fees. The majority of IMF's recognized in the second quarter were at hotels in Asia Pacific, where there is generally no owner's priority with Greater China particularly strong. Almost 65% of Greater China's hotels had positive gross operating profit in the second quarter due to increasing demand, and our ability to control costs. In 2019, over one third of our incentive fees were from Asia Pacific. Within franchise fees, unsurprisingly our non-RevPAR related fees were the most resilient totaling $107 million in the second quarter, down 27% from a year ago. Credit card fees declined to the lower card spend versus last year, while total fees from timeshare and residential branding were relatively flat. Second quarter G&A improved by 22% year-over-year and by 35% excluding bad debt. Bad debt expense is primarily based on our estimate of future credit losses, and is not a reflection of current cash losses. The significant reduction in net administrative expenses demonstrates the many steps we've had to take to reduce our cost structure to align with the decline in revenues in this low RevPAR environment. These steps have included furloughs, reductions in executive pay; and reduced work weeks throughout the organization. We reported positive adjusted EBITDA of $61 million, which includes $36 million of bad debt expense. We were pleased with our lack of cash burn during the second quarter, especially in light of the 84% decline in RevPAR. The additional monthly fees we earned moving from our 90% RevPAR rev car decline cash burn model to the actual 84% RevPAR decline, were better than the $2 million per point per month estimate we gave a quarter ago; as a result of incentive management fees and a bit better credit card fees. Favorable timing of investment spending and cash taxes during the quarter was also helpful. Lastly, strong working capital management and loyalty cash inflows contributed to our overall positive cash position. Given that many of our programs and services are funded by revenue-based charges, we are billing the hotels vastly less than a year ago. We have had to dramatically cut our costs to match this decline in revenues, while still providing the required services. We've been able to reduce current breakeven profitability rates at our hotels around the world by 3 to 5 percentage points of occupancy to help our owners preserve cash. From a working capital perspective, owners and franchisees are largely finding enough liquidity to pay these lower bills albeit more slowly than usual. We continue to work with those owners and franchisees that are challenged to pay on time and for many have set up short-term payment plans. So far this year, we have had only a few hotels go into foreclosure, but our management and related agreements protect us. And historically we have held on to most franchise agreements in that situation as well. The cash burn scenario that I'll outline today is just one scenario, and not an estimate of actual results. Please remember that assumptions for certain line items are not paid out evenly throughout the year; so our averages over a number of months this year. Our overall cash flow is comprised of those at the corporate level, and those associated with our net cost reimbursement. The model I walked you through a quarter ago assumed a year-over-year global RevPAR decline of 90% as we experienced in April. It included monthly averages for several categories of spending like taxes and investment spending; and yielded total net cash outflows of around $145 million to $150 million per month. We've updated this analysis assuming a worldwide RevPAR decline of 70% as we experienced in July. The revised model results in monthly cash outflows of about $85 million, a significant improvement of around $65 million a month; 45% better than the prior scenario. Roughly three quarters of the improvement is at the corporate cash flow level; largely as a result of additional fees due to higher RevPAR. In today's scenario, total monthly fees could be about $110 million per month versus the $60 million to $65 million in fees assuming RevPAR down 90%. The impact of a one point change in RevPAR in our revised model would be roughly $2 million to $2.5 million of fees a month, though the sensitivity is not completely linear given IMS. Improving RevPAR is likely to coincide with higher credit card fees as well. The monthly cash flows cash outflows at the corporate level include cash G&A costs, investment spending, cash interest; cash tax payments, and cash outflows for our owned and leased hotels. Despite the revised RevPAR assumption, the total outflow from these items has not changed meaningfully from the $155 million we described a quarter ago. Although, there are some key timing differences to point out. Cash taxes in 2020 will primarily be paid in the third quarter, while cash interest will be higher in the fourth quarter given the schedule of interest payments for our senior notes. Total investment spending for the full year is expected to be roughly $400 million to $450 million with higher outlays in the second half of the year versus the first half. The lumpiness of these cash flows will naturally impact our cash balances in the third and fourth quarters. All-in-all, the 70% RevPAR decline scenario yields an average total corporate cash burn of roughly $45 million per month, about half of the $90 million to $95 million presented in the scenario a quarter ago. While the absolute cash burn numbers in this model still reflect a tough operating environment; the sizable improvement demonstrates the strong cash flow characteristics inherent in our asset-light business model. The remaining one-third of the cash burn improvement comes from our net cost reimbursement. Today's scenario yields cash outflows of about $40 million a month for this category versus outflows of $55 million in the original scenario. The improvement is primarily due to better matched timing of our cash outlays and reimbursements, as well as continued collections of receivables. This is partially offset by slightly lower cash contributions from loyalty, given redemptions are expected to pick up as occupancy improves. Note that this model does not currently include any severance and other payments associated with our global restructuring initiatives. It's extremely difficult to have to undertake these efforts, which include a voluntary transition program announced in the second quarter, as well as additional job eliminations. The extent of the decline in our business, and our expectation that it will take time for demand to return fully require these measures. We currently expect the total cash charges related to our above property restructuring activities around $125 million to $145 million. In the second quarter, we recognized $26 million of costs related to these efforts of which $6 million was in restructuring and merger-related charges on our P&L, and $20 million was included in reimbursed expenses. We're still working through the details, but currently expect these restructuring efforts will reduce total above property controllable costs, which includes both corporate G&A and program and services costs by roughly 25%. We'll know more about the specific impact on G&A as we work through the 2021 budget process. We're also developing restructuring plans to achieve cost savings specific to each of our company operated properties, including our owned leased hotels. We expect to implement these plans over the next couple of quarters. In addition to focusing on preserving cash, we've substantially boosted our liquidity, and extended our average debt maturities. During the quarter, we raised $2.6 billion of long-term debt and $920 million of cash through amendments to our credit card deals. As part of our liability management, the $1 billion raised in June was largely used to tender and retire a portion of our near-term debt maturities. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents on hand was around $2.3 billion; adding that cash to the undrawn capacity of our revolver of approximately $2.9 billion and deducting around $800 million of commercial paper outstanding; our net liquidity was approximately $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter. We believe our strong liquidity position, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets comfortably position us to meet our short and long-term obligations. While there is still a lot of uncertainty, and there are many factors impacting our business outside of our control; we are very pleased with the progress we have made in the areas we can control. Many of the steps we have taken have been painful, but the company is in a solid position to navigate through these challenging times. The global recovery may take longer than any of us would like, but the strong recovery in Greater China and trends in the rest of the world show the resilience of lodging demand and make us hopeful about the future. We all look forward to traveling again and to welcoming all of you at our hotels. Thank you for your time this morning. And we'll now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from one of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. JosephGreff: Good morning, everybody. Nice to hear your voices and thank you for all the information. Arne, I found fascinating your comments about the new signings in Greater China. Can you talk about what's driving that? And can you talk about that maybe the construction cost environment there? And the new signings, how do they compare versus the year ago in that geography? ArneSorenson: Yes. So the statistic on the last part of that question, we put in the prepared remarks; so we're -- our signings are up over last year about 30% or so in Asia Pacific, all driven by China. And I think the thing to keep in mind in China; one, is about the markets generally obviously the recovery is well apace. I think it's easy to be in China and look at COVID-19 as being not a thing of history quite yet because that probably won't happen until we get a vaccine, and obviously there are events that come up most recently in Beijing, where there need to be some reassertion of restrictions. But those actions get done quickly and by and large the Chinese are back to traveling again. And so I think you've got much greater confidence about the future in the markets generally. And I think secondly, the Marriott has done extraordinarily well in China with the combination with Starwood that we did a few years ago. I think our position in the luxury and upper upscale space if you use the nomenclature from the United States is very, very strong with a dominant RevPAR index position. And I think we end up with tremendous share of the new development in those segments as well as increasing growth of course in the moderate tier with Courtyard, Fairfield and the like, which is moving sort of. And I think in a way you can contrast that with the United States. You could see our total pipeline is down 1%, and I think if you look at the US and Europe by comparison, we're just much earlier in reacting to COVID-19. And I think given the uncertainty about what the path is out of this, I think people are confident; it will get behind us ultimately and we'll get back to a different place. But how long it takes? How the lenders respond? What happens with the supply chain? All of those questions are still very much unanswered I think in the United States. JosephGreff: And can you talk about within the pipeline? Obviously, it was down a little bit sequentially and China obviously added on a growth room's basis. How much did you revisit and just come to the conclusion that the likelihood is less today than a few months ago or six months ago or do you think those discussions accelerate from here? How do you view that? ArneSorenson: Well, I think a couple of things to keep in mind here. One; is that by and large just as it's too early to answer questions about exactly what the shape the recovery looks like in the United States; it's too early to kill projects in the United States. So what we are not seeing on the bright side folks say we've abandoned this project, and decided not to do it. I think on the other hand, if you're not financed; if you don't have your debt financing or if you don't have all your equity raised for a project even if you've been working on it for a number of quarters or maybe a year or two; you're probably not able to complete those financing challenges as well as you would have been before COVID-19 to state the obvious. And even if the financing is done, if construction hasn't already started, it well might be that you're sitting there saying, well, let's watch it here now that over the next number of months and see what happens. We have told you before that in April, I think, we cancelled our hotel development committee meetings and process in the United States. It seemed to be a what -- inappropriate maybe the wrong word, but an odd time I suppose to be bringing in deals that we couldn't really underwrite in a way to know that they were the kind of high probability we would want in order to add to the pipeline, and to some extent our partners couldn't really evaluate them in the same way. And so I think this is a place we watch. Now I think as recovery builds, as we collectively get more confidence about COVID-19 starting to move behind us, and we can obviously talk more about that in this call, I think, we'll see folks who see long-term projects that still make sense; enhanced probably by reduction in costs associated with the construction costs, and other development efforts and we'll probably start to move forward. But it's going to take a while for that clarity to reach the pipeline. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Robin Farley of UBS. RobinFarley: Great. Thank you. Two questions; one is on the SG&A reductions that you outlined for this year, how sustainable is that into next year and forward? And then my other follow up is the commentary on business versus leisure travel. I know you mentioned September, October it's still decent levels compared to the summer. Could you quantify how Q4 looks versus Q3 that sort of business versus leisure travel mix? Thank you. ArneSorenson: Yes. So why don't I take that the latter part first and then Leeny why don't you jump in with the G&A and other spending. We were curious to go back and take a look at the leisure in the fall versus in the summer because I think a lot of us have a little more caution around the corporate traveler than we do around the leisure traveler based on the first few months of recovery here. And somewhat gratifying we see that leisure travel is only about five points lower in terms of total hotel mix in September and October than it is in the summer, going from 35% or 36% to 32% something like that. And what that tells you is leisure may continue to be a pretty significant source of recovery even as we get past Labor Day and into the fall. I think that the corporate traveler has been interesting too. We have watched segments over the course of the quarter; all of us in the industry including Marriott have talked about leisure being the strongest, but interestingly special corporate is probably up five points in terms of RevPAR decline year-over-year in the last two months, just sort of looking at weekly numbers. Our guess is that is driven by business travel in what -- in the Midwest more in smaller companies more than bigger companies in aspects of business, which are less probably dependent on flying. There is still frustration to me that when we -- too often see big, big companies they're making decisions about keeping offices closed for as much as the next year; frustrating to us because in a sense that's just sort of withdrawing from the economy. And while all of us need to make decisions that protect our people, and make sure that we're not putting people out in risky environments before it's ready. There is absolutely no reason for us to be making decisions about what offices look like or what travel looks like in the second quarter of 2021 for example. In any event, I think that the way of putting this is that so far in the recovery every segment has gotten better every month albeit with leisure and drive to being the strongest, we see government rate -- government business up modestly; we see special corporate business up modestly. We basically see that folks are increasingly willing to step out and travel a bit more. So with Leeny maybe you want to take the G&A question. LeenyOberg: Sure and I'm going to tag on one other thing, Robin, I think you'd find interesting, which is that to remember that November and December typically actually see the pop-up back up to more summer-like levels for leisure, if you remember how a lot of people do their travel in November and December; so there again that that kind of goes to the same point. On G&A, you've clearly seen just substantial moves that we've made this year and really battening down the hatches and making sure that we're putting ourselves in a position to deal with the decline in revenues. What we've done with the work over the past few months is to really be thinking more broadly about restructuring the company to move forward knowing that it needs to be sustainable, and knowing that it needs to reflect the fact that it's going to take beyond 2021 at least to return to 2019 revenue levels.  So in that regard there when you think about kind of broadly speaking if you remember back last quarter, and I talked about all the reimbursable; a bunch of them were pass-throughs, but there were about $4 billion of our reimbursable that are around delivering the programs and services to all of our hotels around the world and then obviously you've got G&A on top of that. And that is the very large part of cost that we have gone after to try to restructure, and put ourselves in a good position going forward. And that's where I think 25% reduction in that full set of costs is what we're expecting. The details about exactly where that falls relative to G&A, we will work through the budgeting process; so I can't give you a specific number. I think for the rest of this year, as you know we've taken dramatic steps this year whether you call it reduced executive pay et cetera. So I think for the rest of this year you're going to continue to see these really dramatically low levels, but giving you kind of sustainable forward numbers; I think we'll work through that but I would expect them to be quite substantial. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. ThomasAllen: Thank you. Good morning. So, Arne, about three weeks ago you were quoted in the press as saying you were less optimistic than 30 days prior. Can I ask you that question again? How do you feel now? ArneSorenson: It's a fair question. I guess in on some level I'm -- depends whether you're thinking about the virus or you're thinking about lodging recovery, travel recovery. I am no more optimistic about the virus than I was a month ago. And that was -- that's what caused me a month ago or so to say I'm less optimistic than I was a month before that. I am, however, more optimistic about the recovery of travel; and the recovery of our business. And I think if you read the news every day, which we all do; it's sort of obvious why that's the case. The virus numbers are frustratingly high particularly in the United States, and they remain high; and it is hard to look across the country and see the kind of what strategy that we'd like to see to have confidence that we can put this thing behind us sooner rather than later. Why am I more optimistic about our business? Well, I think if you look at the July numbers as a whole, and we've put some of those in the press release as well as the prepared script; it shows a gratifying resilience of American travelers, American consumers notwithstanding the high virus numbers to get back up. And so 1s of July this virus resurges a little bit, we of course immediately have July 4th weekend which is positive because of its leisure intensive travel aspect. And we see a little bit of a pause maybe in the days after July 4th, but as the month continues; we go back to trend essentially and see occupancy build in each week by a point or a point and a half compared to the prior week. And we end up with July being about five points better than June in the U.S occupancy context. And so that tells I think us that notwithstanding the frustration around the virus numbers, the American traveler and consumer; and I think increasingly the business traveler too will say what we got to get back and live our life. I've got to get back, I'd like to get back to work; I maybe can't get back to the office depending on where I go to the office. Many of you are in New York, which of course has got its own unique set of skills, and I just remind all of you don't assume the United States as a whole has got the same dynamic working as New York does. New York is less dependent on people driving to work; it is much more concentrated in terms of elevator traffic and the like. It's obviously had high virus numbers particularly early in the crisis. You get to much of the rest of the country, and people still commute to work by car. They tend to work in smaller buildings with less a challenge in terms of being able to be there safely. And I think they're more inclined to be stepping back to work, and stepping back towards normal life. So that's what makes me more optimistic than I was a month ago. ThomasAllen: And just as a follow-up. Are you more optimistic around your net unit growth as you were a quarter ago? ArneSorenson: About the same I think. I think it is highly likely that we will see a bunch of these new projects take longer to get to opening than we thought before COVID-19. We mentioned this in one of the earlier questions. I think it's still hard to predict with certainty how much longer those things are going to take. But I think we'd be foolish to think that these projects are going to open as quickly as they would have before. We will have some increasing opportunities to offset that in the conversion space. And we've got conversations that are up in the conversion space. I would say there too it's a little early for conversions to actually start moving when you look at prior economic cycles conversion volume tends to step up in weaker environments, but it tends to step up with transactions stepping up. And by and large while there are increasing numbers of hotels that are out there under some pressure, we haven't seen many transactions take place yet. And I think as we do we'll see our conversion ads step up as well. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Shaun Kelley of BofA. ShaunKelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. I was just wondering, Arne, maybe to stick with a little bit of the same theme. In the prepared remarks you mentioned just in general the business traveler outlook maybe being a little bit more positive, I think, you said for both business travel and group. Just any kind of more specificity if you could give around what you might be seeing? Is it really that drive-to piece, any certain markets or areas and particularly your thoughts on obviously the domestic piece of that would be helpful? ArneSorenson: Yes. So looking at the U.S for a second and let's make sure we don't oversell this. I want to make sure I get my data. So I mentioned that special corporate is up five points in the last eight weeks, but when you look at RevPAR for special corporate; it's gone from minus 85% eight weeks ago to minus 79% last week. So you're still at numbers which are monumentally negative, and by comparison if you look at retail for example which is where a lot of leisure is going to land; some corporate will land there too it's obviously the sort of rack rate business. We've seen a 15 point improvement compared to that five point improvement special corporate and the RevPAR associated with it is down 57 compared to the down 79 for special corporate. So there is improvement to be sure, and it's measurable essentially week by week; and we would expect it continue to continue. But we would expect corporate to be slower in recovery, and then leisure has been so far; and probably slower to recover in the fall depending of course on the shape of the virus. I'm struck always we've got a -- we live in Washington DC area where we're headquartered obviously. And I've got three kids who live in New York. I've got one that lives in Washington. We have a place on the Chesapeake Bay where we have spent significant portions of the pandemic, and it's interesting to see the different rhythms. So out in the county seat out here where you've got lots of small businesses that are operating; they're all back to work. You can see their surface parking lots are by and large as busy as they've ever been before, and the more you get into the Central Washington, the more you see quiet and I think that is a function both of some restrictions locally, but I think it is a function of you get greater conservatism; you get greater reliance on public transportation or other higher risk tools I suppose than you do in the smaller markets and in the smaller cities. And as a consequence, I think we'll see business travel steadily continue to improve. I would think absent some unanticipated thing in the virus or some calendar event, we'll see that not just leisure but we'll see that business travel improves every week as we go through the fall, but it will be a little bit slower coming back. And it's going to be slowest in the places where the population concentration is highest and where the companies are most conservative. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Patrick Scholes of Truist Securities, Inc. PatrickScholes: Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Question on what you might expect for permanent hotel closures? What percent of your system just might not be around in a year or two? And then a follow-up on that is we noticed the EDITION Time Square closed really quickly once COVID hit. I'm wondering what was -- why so quick for that one? Thank you. ArneSorenson: Leeny, do you want to take that? LeenyOberg: Yes. I'll start and then Arne feel free to jump in. So obviously this is all going to take some time. I think what you are seeing so far quite frankly is our dilutions are below average, if you look at where we were in the second quarter and in the first quarter it's below kind of even the % to 1.5% that we guided in normal times. Obviously, though it's really going to depend to some extent on how long the virus persists, and in which areas and to what extent. And then obviously the owner's ability to get through that. So I can't give you a specific sort of estimate, but I'll also say that so far we've seen really strong capabilities on the part of the owners to be able to find access to the liquidity they need to keep the hotels going, and the banks have shown a clear willingness to kind of essentially press pause for a while. And when you think about kind of the depth of what we've seen to have really only a very few hotels already in foreclosure. That I think demonstrates the fact that everybody wants to try to see their way through this. Now we clearly are going to see a bunch of foreclosures through all of this, but that doesn't necessarily mean the hotel is closed. I think in many cases what happens is the banks want to preserve the value of the asset in which case keeping the brand on it is the best way to do that and will do so. And the EDITION is a great example as you've described where the lenders have stepped in, and I think you could actually see that hotel reopen that you saw lots of urban full-service hotels close temporarily to kind of stop and reassess the situation; work really hard to figure out what the right occupancy breakeven is to be open or not open. And I think that you're seeing more and more of them open up. So it's obviously something that is very top of mind for us. We, our North America team and all the teams around the world for that matter are spending just an inordinate amount of time working with the owners; whether it's on kind of short-term payment plans or looking at the FF&E reserves or making sure there's a conversation about our bills and working through the other bills like property insurance et cetera, but again I do think that for the moment it's been a really good pattern for the hotels marching through it. But it does depend a lot on how long this lasts/ ArneSorenson: I think it's perfectly put, Lenny, the -- get to a bottom line. I would guess very, very, very few of our hotels around the world will not reopen if they're closed now or will fail so profoundly that they close permanently. Now in a portfolio of 7,500 hotels or 8,000 hotels, even before COVID-19 hits; there is a handful, maybe a couple handfuls of hotels where profitability is not sufficient for the long-term viability of those hotels. And they're the ones not surprisingly that Leeny and team are working with first in this crisis because they were in trouble before, and when they're in trouble before and you end up with something like this; that's a double whammy. I actually think that the EDITION Time Square is not the poster child for this; it's a brand new hotel, it's a beautiful hotel. I'm optimistic actually that that hotel will open and we'll be fine. But there are hotels in New York City that were not making money before COVID-19 hit, and some of those closed and some of them may not reopen because the cost burdens whether that be labor costs or property taxes or the like, mean that they're -- the owners will not be able to look at them, and say I can see a path towards profitability that I need to have in order to justify this. But I think those circumstances are globally, and in terms of number of hotels or a number of rooms very, very unusual; and I think over time while the owners are broadly under significant pressure, and we've got to make sure that we work with them to build back profitability that the best use for this portfolio of assets, real estate assets will be as hotels and that they will open and be open for the long term. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. StephenGrambling: Thanks. This is a bit of a crystal ball question, but how do you think about the impact of work from home, if the recent acceleration holds? And as part of this question, what has been the impact from work from home as you look at corporate relationships or end markets where these trends were the most pronounced over the past 5 to 10 years? And if you were to maybe even peel the onion back further, can you see whether those individual customers in those sectors have changed their leisure behavior along with it? ArneSorenson: Those are good questions. The last one, I don't think, we've got data that tells us much yet. We've obviously got many business travelers particularly who are not back on the road yet, who are relying on remote work and or technology tools in order to continue to work from home; and to avoid travel. I think the statements that you hear from folks frequently that will never go back to the office or will never go back to travel, I would take with a huge grain of salt. We've heard similar comments in each of the last three crises that we've been through starting in the early 90s; obviously, the technology has gotten better and better. But in 2001 and 2002 and 2008 and 2009, we heard the same thing, which is we don't need to go back to travel the way we've done before. A difference to be sure this time is the remote work kind of context, but you've all got a perspective about this; and I think what we've heard over the last month or so particularly is an increasing level of frustration about remote work. Maybe particularly for folks who are relatively earlier in their career for whom training and networking and pursuit of opportunities depends much more on being present with somebody, but I think even for others; we have gotten to the point of after two or three or four or five months saying this is not -- it's not as good. We can't maintain our culture. We can't bring on new people. We can't train people. We can't invest in the kind of relationships we need to have with our business partners, and with our customers. And I think increasingly we will see folks say, we've got to get back out there and get back at it. And I do think there will be some more flexibility on whether we all go to the office every day when we're not traveling, and we'll see people that can sort of further mix to some extent work in leisure. I think there's a piece of that which will be good for us. So imagine that a year from now or two years from now that week in Florida or weekend the Caribbean, which would have been 100% vacation and I could only do it once a year; I might be able to do twice a year now because I can go down there for a week, and I can do a couple of days of work concentrated or spread out over the work over the week, and have my vacation and to some extent I think that blending of leisure and business could actually be an aid as much as a threat to travel. All things considered, we would say that that we will build back and see the kind of levels of travel demand that we've had in the past. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Anthony Powell of Barclays. AnthonyPowell: Hi. Good morning. Question on group bookings, have you seen meeting planners start to book for the second half of next year or any part of next year? And how are you approaching on booking business for your hotels generally right now? ArneSorenson: So I think the most clear trend, clearest trend which is obvious is that folks that had near-term group business deferred more than cancelled, but basically put off those meetings. I think most of our group customers want to have those meetings, and so that's why they deferred instead of cancelled. And of course, we've been interested in having them defer as opposed to cancel because we just seen that business show up ultimately. And most of those folks are folks who are engaged in hosting those meetings, and they believe those meetings are valuable; and want ultimately to have them. I think at the same time we have seen new bookings for future periods be less robust than they would have been before because if they've not already committed to that meeting; they are probably a little less likely to commit until they've got some greater clarity about what the future looks like. What that means is that so far we've seen business on the books for 2021 not really cancel in big numbers. We've seen group business on the books for 2020 cancel significantly, and I suspect we'll continue to see cancellations for business that has not been cancelled yet or deferred yet as the better word to use for latter parts of 2020 probably continue to cancel until we get some greater confidence around the virus. And ultimately when we get to the point where it looks like group meetings can be had safely, we will see both less deferral of business already on the books; and we'll see new business come in. Give you one statistic I think group business on the books for 2021 compared to what would have been on the books for 2020 a year ago is about down 10%. I think in some respects that we're likely to see the first part -- the first half of next year be meaningfully worse than the second half of next year in terms of group, but that is based on a guess on where the virus is and where the vaccines are. And obviously the more the virus recedes into the background and the more confidence or availability we get in the vaccine, the more we'll see this group business start to build back. LeenyOberg: Anthony, the only other thing I'd add is that for 2022 and beyond versus 2021, the rates of decline are meaningfully less. So when you think about the kind of the overall decline, it's nearer in where there's more concern, but when you look at corporate bookings beyond that, it's down much less. AnthonyPowell: Thanks for that and separately on Homes and Villas, what have you learned having that business in the portfolio and in this environment? Have you seen more people look for more space? And do you think having that option is increasingly valuable for you in the current future environment? ArneSorenson: So three things on HVMI, which are consistent with what Homes and Villas by Marriott International I should say, not use our internal lingo too much and expect you all to know it, but our home sharing business has been benefited by three trends all of which we've talked about; leisure, drive -- well two of them we've talked about, leisure, drive-to both advantages and whole home is an advantage. So what people are drawn to in terms of home sharing particularly in a COVID-19 environment is do you have a place where I can take everybody, and where we can be on our own. I don't want a separate bedroom. I don't really want an apartment that somebody lives in regularly. I don't want the old style home sharing because I can't be certain about the cleanliness or comfort of that. But if you can give me a vacation home on the beach or in New England or someplace I can drive to then I know that I can control my environment. I can control my transportation, and it suits my purpose because it's a leisure trip anyway. And so generally that has been a positive thing although to state the obvious it is a very small part of our business. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Smedes Rose of Citi. SmedesRose: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just really wanted to ask you assuming whenever this pandemic is behind us, how do you think about the operating model for the owners coming out of this? Since there's been a lot of talk from their end that they can come out with better margin, and that there's been meaningful changes to, I guess, kind of brand requirements. So I'm interested in your thoughts around that, and I guess specifically how do you think the trajectory of kind of in-room housekeeping during a guest stay goes? And am I right and thinking that would be kind of a significant cost savings, if it were to go away? ArneSorenson: So all good questions and, Leeny, you should jump in here because you've got some good data. I think that will be really helpful. I mean we are working with our owners to make sure that we do everything we can to get back to the kinds of margins they had before if not better. The only caution here is rate and revenue are important, and so the longer it takes us to get back to the kind of RevPAR levels we had in 2019, the more pressure that's going to be on that. And we would make -- want to make sure we're focused not only on the cost elements, but that we are really focused on driving revenue because that's an easier way to get back to margins in many respects. I think on the operating cost side, which is where your question focuses, I think there will be a couple of things that could be sticky. I think one is probably more digital check-in, contactless keys and the like. I think will be adopted more during COVID-19 and could be helpful longer term. I think housekeeping protocols could be interesting. I mean I think we'll see that there is certainly during COVID-19 less intensive or less housekeeping period during a guest stay then between guest stays. That protects both the guests and associates. We have frustratingly seen a couple of cities move in the opposite direction, certainly at the behest of unions to try and bring jobs back. But essentially to say that notwithstanding COVID-19 every room should be cleaned every day, and that should be done as a matter of municipal policy requirement; and in many respects the consequences of that, I think, is we'll see hotels that reopen slower in those markets and we'll see the jobs as a consequence come back slower and at lower numbers than would have been the case without that. But we'll be looking at not just housekeeping and check-in, but we'll be looking at food and beverage and other things to try and make sure that we do what we can to bring back the margins. So that our owners can be healthy, which is in the long-term interest obviously not just of them but of us? LeenyOberg: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Smedes, is I think a lot of the work right now that we're doing will help very much in the longer run. A whole lot of the work right now is focused on lowering the breakeven at these lower levels of demand. So whether you're doing things more flexibly around how you're managing certain departments, all the kind of contactless work that Arne was talking about using technology more that frankly will kind of change the way the guests interact with the hotel team. All of those things are tremendously helpful, and as I said, we've kind of globally reduced the breakeven occupancy by 300 to 500 basis points around the world, and that much of that should be helpful in the much longer run. But again as Arne said, we got to kind of got to get back there to have the proof of the pudding. And our goal is to make sure that over the next few years that we get as much cash flow as we can while the demand is still building back. Operator : Our next question comes from line of David Katz of Jefferies LLC. DavidKatz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Look, I -- what we've observed across our coverage and in listening to all of your commentary so far, could we see scenarios where the cost basis both for yourselves and the hotel owners; obviously, you're adjusting to a reduced demand environment, but what are you aiming for? Are there scenarios where in the next 12 to 24 months we see a lot less revenue but improved profitability and better earnings for Marriott? Is that what we're ultimately aiming for or are we trying to just sort of hold steady until things get back to approaching 2019 levels? ArneSorenson: Well, I mean it a little bit depends on what you are comparing to; obviously, the -- we ought to see improving profitability for owners. We ought to see improving profitability, improving earnings; improving EBITDA for Marriott every month and every quarter from this point going forward. Now that's not saying much obviously given the absolute numbers we reported more this morning, but with a fairly high level of confidence you can't say with certainty obviously but with a fairly high level of confidence, the second quarter of 2020 should be the worst quarter we have ever seen by far forever. And things will get better from here. I think as it relates more towards what I think your question was focused out, we have or in the process of nearing completion of I suppose the re-baselining of our business. And by our business I think I mean to include hotels that we manage for others. What our franchisees are doing but what Marriott is doing also. As you all know, we manage a big portfolio of hotels. We manage more hotels in the luxury and full-service space than any other company in the world, and in the managed context of course, we provide services from above property; sometimes there are shared services in a given market, sometimes they're localized by countries; sometimes they're global services think about a reservations platform for example. And the costs of those are paid for by the hotels, which are supported by those services. And we've obviously got our own G&A spending that we do to provide support for our brands. And to provide management of the company and to do all the other things we need to do to manage our business for ourselves as well. But in both of those contexts as Leeny talked about, we are moving towards about a 25% reduction in the gross level of spending between both categories combined. And that's the new base from which we'll build. And we will do our best of course over time to build from that base only at the kind of rates we would have built on the pre-existing base in the past, and are hopeful that we will see RevPAR and fee growth for Marriott and EBITDA growth for our hotel owners grow at a faster pace than the pace at which we're growing costs. And that could well be the case for a number of years. DavidKatz: Right. So my point being earnings and cash flow should improve more quickly and hopefully at a better rate than anything we're going to see on the top line for a while. ArneSorenson: I think that's fair. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. JaredShojaian: HI. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And, Arne, it's great to hear your voice on this call. Just going back to China, can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how leisure is performing versus those other two segments? I mean you called out the improvement in business transient group, but anything you can share for us to just kind of contextualize what that looks like? And then with inbound travel restrictions it would seem that demand from Chinese locals is now above pre-Covid, if I understand that right; so correct if I'm wrong there. Do you think intra-China is getting an outsized benefit because there just aren't really outbound options right now? And so you're seeing a substitution of outbound trips for inbound trips? ArneSorenson: Yes. There's a lot there -- lot of good questions in that. I appreciate that very much. I would say generally that China is coming back in all segments, leisure, business transient and group. You can point at different markets and reach different conclusions. So we've got probably 20 to 25 hotels open in Sanya, Hainan Island, which you can think about as China's Florida. They are doing extraordinarily well, and they are going to be mostly leisure in some group. On the other hand, parts of our Greater China numbers are Macau; Macau is a leisure market and by and large Macau is not reopened, and so that sort of pulls those numbers back a little bit. I think when you look at Shanghai; you look at Guangzhou and surrounding areas, which are much more business travel dependent. I think generally you see fairly strong, very strong recovery certainly from their lows. Remember in February, our occupancy numbers in China were sub 10%. I think 9 and change and we're now running about 60%. So you can see a substantial move. And I mentioned the Beijing context; in Beijing, I think they had, oh, I don't know a couple of dozen cases, and they ended up testing a million people for COVID-19 in 30 days or something like that, and managed to get sort of COVID-19 back under control. The only other thing I think we could say about China and this is maybe odd given the kind of political dialogue that is taking place or political events that are taking place; maybe not that much dialogue is that China and the US are quite similar in the travel sense; demand is overwhelmingly domestic. U.S., 95% domestic; China we have the number of 80% being domestic, but I actually think the number is probably higher than that. China is not a big leisure market for the rest of the world; people some adventurous travelers go to China to see -- to take their vacations, but by and large the international travel is business travel, and overwhelmingly the shift has been towards domestic travel. I think you're right to say that some of that recovery is probably Chinese travel that would have gone abroad maybe to Asia Pacific or to some place else, and has stayed home in China this year. We're certainly seeing the same dynamic in the United States. Nobody's going to Europe and they're more likely to take their vacations here. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. WesGolladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. My question actually is just a follow-up. Just a quick question on the follow-up to your answer to the last question. Can you give us a sense on trying to gauge how the US could follow Greater China in a recovery? You kind of highlighted both being more of a domestic market, but can you potentially talk about the biggest variances you see in those markets? For example, is the U.S. more dependent on large group compression nights and maybe will lag a little bit longer? ArneSorenson: Yes. That's a good question. I think the generally what we see in China bodes well for what we should expect in the United States, and there are differences; obviously, but the domestic predominance is similar. So there's really not that much dependence on long-haul air travel for example, probably not that much difference on regional air travel; obviously, China's got a big aviation business and those planes are back flying and they're back flying at bigger numbers than they are in the US. But remember China is two or three months ahead of the US in the COVID-19 recovery. I think the resilience of the American consumer is second to none. And I think we see that already and that sort of was what causes us to be a little bit more optimistic today than three or four weeks ago in terms of the way the business may recover in the United States. I think all of that is either similar or maybe even better. I think the negative is we do have more group business in the United States than we do in China. We as an industry and we as Marriott both, we are whether that be association business or corporate business; the meetings side has been a more established part of business for many, many years. But at the same time, I think there are other compensating factors. I think that we spend more money on leisure travel in the U.S than China does. I'm guessing there a little bit net-net; I would think the recoveries generally ought to look about the same subject to the recovery of society from COVID-19 and subject to the strength of the economy generally. I think you should shelf the last two questions which is how does GDP look in the U.S compared to China when we get through COVID-19 and how does the COVID-recovery curve look like in the United States compared to China. Sorry, Leeny, you were going to jump in on this. LeenyOberg: Yes. I should say that the only other difference is when you just look at the fundamental portfolio differences, and that is that there is broader and deeper limited service presence of our portfolio in the U.S than there is in China, which probably at the margin is more skewed towards full service and maybe a bit overall urban. So I think there you're clearly seeing in a limited service portfolio; you're seeing in the tertiary markets, you're seeing this demand come back; so that's the other difference that actually accentuates the positives of North America. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of William Crow of Raymond James. WilliamCrow: Hey. Good morning, Arne. You sound well. I hope you are feeling well. Couple of a two-parter on unit growth; the first question is I get that 2% to 3% growth this year, and maybe I missed it but did you talk about how that might bounce back in 2021 and 2022 if these are really just kind of delays in the construction process? ArneSorenson: Yes. I guess the short answer is, no. I mean I think we will see these projects overwhelmingly become reality is our guess. I mean the certainly when you look at 2008 -09, when you look at 2001or 2002, even projects that we thought were dead often came back, and of course most were never -- we never thought of as being dead. We thought of as being slowed because of financing or construction, while the depth of RevPAR decline is more significant this time; it is particularly tied to one reason. That reason will ultimately get behind us, and I would guess that overwhelmingly these projects move forward again. Whether they move forward to see a bounce back in 2021 or whether it takes us a little bit longer than that. That's the question that's hard to answer. And I think that's going to depend on COVID-19, and I think it's going to depend on the financial markets. WilliamCrow: The second part of the question might have something to do with that as well, which are how many requests are you getting for key money? And do you think that the conversion activity that you and Hilton and other peers keep talking about is going to be largely driven by key money that's offered to the owners? ArneSorenson: We are and Leeny you should jump in on this, but I think we are generally in part to manage our own liquidity and financial resources. We're probably putting less money, less key money and then we've done in the past years for the projects that we are signing today; I think when we get to the conversion market in some respects maybe this is a little bit of wishful thinking, but in some respects the relative value that is achieved by joining a portfolio like ours in a weaker market is more obvious; and therefore the need for key money is less powerful than it would be in a stronger environment where everybody's performing fine. Now whether we can turn that into actual terms of deals that are signed; obviously, depends on our deal makers and the way they negotiate those deals. Leeny, you want to add anything to that? LeenyOberg: Yes. The only the only thing I'd say is that the biggest I think question mark, Bill, for the moment is around the lenders, and while certainly on key money it can be a competitive perspective; it is making sure you've got lenders on board to fill the biggest part of your capital stack, and that in many cases really depends on the strength of the brand. The strength of the cash flow that's going to be delivered to the hotel, which I think does lead us back to brands like ours. And while sure key money always competitive, but I don't think on the conversion side that that's going to be kind of the one sole element that then makes or breaks it. I think it has so much to do with the asset value because these are long-term assets. So key money will always be an important part of the discussion, but I don't think on kind of that element in and of itself is really that different from other times. Operator : Our next question comes from line of one of Chad Beynon of Macquarie. ChadBeynon: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about a booking window what you're seeing in the U.S? If that really changed at all in the last couple months, particularly going into July, if that's kind of still in under a week or if that's starting to expand beyond what we've seen? Thanks. ArneSorenson: It still very short term. And it shouldn't surprise you because although the occupancy numbers improved -- have improved, we've still got a pretty general availability across the portfolio. ChadBeynon: Okay and then, Leeny, maybe a hypothetical and a tough question, but regarding some of the positive sequential improvements you've been seeing on the revenue side and the reduction of cost. Should we still assume that North American IMF fees that it's pretty difficult to see a positive outcome just because of the accounting method or do you think if the trends continue we could kind of eke out a positive outcome? Thanks. LeenyOberg: Sure. Believe it or not there were a couple in Q2 from North America but it's overwhelmingly from Asia Pacific, and there a whole lot of that's going to depend on Q4. So we need to get farther into the year, but as you might imagine for the North American hotels where you have an owner's priority under most any circumstance you're seeing absolutely massive decline in RevPAR in 2020, and so for this year I think it's hard to imagine that there's anything very exciting to talk about there. But then and when you start talking about rebound, and as demand comes back; I think one of the things that has been good to see is that as demand really picks up rate has also done what demand and supply show it to do, which is that it has also shown the qualities of being quite resilient. So when we think of kind of special corporate rates et cetera for next year. I think again it would point you to a potential view that as demand comes back you will see things pick up nicely. And again, as we've said there's been so much work on the cost side that kind of points to margins being able to be helpful as well. But I do think if you look at our history of North American recovery in IMF; it does take a while because of these owners priority. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Michael Bellisario of Baird. MichaelBellisario: Good morning, everyone. Just one follow-up on your net unit growth comments, looking forward what does the split of managed versus franchise growth look like? And are you any more hesitant to take on managed properties today given the working capital requirements that we've seen -- that were so great this last quarter? ArneSorenson: We are we are no more hesitant to take on manage than we were before, particularly in the luxury and full service space. But I think the question really has to be assessed from a global perspective, and I think given the relatively greater strength of Asia Pacific in our year-to-date adds to the pipeline, if anything we might skew just a tad more managed than franchise, but if you look at it like-to-like our new unit growth in the United States is going to tend to be select service, which is going to tend to be overwhelmingly franchise and obviously those numbers are down. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Rich Hightower of Evercore. RichHightower: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Good to hear from you. I wanted to follow up on another twist on the China versus North America question. And, Leeny, I think you may have answered part of this to an earlier question, but in the prepared comments Arne you said that both occupancy and RevPAR levels in China might come back to 2019 sometime next year. How much -- so there's a pricing component to that. So how much of the fact that you're talking about lower absolute ADRs translated into dollars and China contributes to that, and how do we sort of think about that versus the recovery and rates in North America, let's say? ArneSorenson: You're going to test maybe Leeny, can do this, but you're testing my knowledge here. I think it's relatively easy to see RevPAR getting back to 2019 levels in 2021 in China just based on the strength of recovery so far. I can't tell you the split between ADR and occupancy, okay. LeenyOberg: Yes. I think again I think occupancy is obviously typically that's the first driver, and that is the one that you can see so quickly, get the pricing back right when you have super high demand over a weekend or over a holiday or a Tuesday through Thursday in a certain urban market then all of a sudden that compression happens very nicely, and you quickly see the rate pop. When we look at how our Chinese hotels are performing relative to the market, I think we all know that the classic RevPAR index things are not great kind of perfect analyses given you got a bunch of other hotels closed. But we have seen that our hotels have performed dramatically better than the industry. So I think again when you see demand for the brand and demand come back that then rate can pick up pretty quickly. I think in North America, we're going to -- it's going to depend more on the segments, right? It's going to depend more on the shifts between retail, special corporate, and leisure and group because they all have some variances. They are on the ADR front, so if you have a fundamental shift on the percentages of group versus retail for example, you might see a difference in rate. But again, we would expect as you see the occupancy pick up quickly to see the rate move fairly quickly. There aren't kind of institutional reasons why the rate is going to behave super differently. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Arne Sorenson for any additional or closing remarks. Arne Sorenson : All right. Well, I just say thank you everybody. We appreciate your interest and your time. And of course, look forward to welcoming you back to our hotels just as soon as you feel comfortable getting on the road, which we hope is very soon. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star, one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, press star, zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Arne Sorenson, President and CEO. Thank you, please go ahead. Arne Sorenson : Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President, Investor Relations. I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements made in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actually events unfold.  Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our REVPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency year-over-year changes for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. Before I talk about the quarter, I want to again thank our incredible team of associates around the world who continue to work tirelessly and show true resilience during these challenging times. The power of the Marriott culture has never been more evident and I am incredibly grateful. I hope everyone joining us today is staying safe and well. While COVID-19 is still significantly impacting our business, our third quarter results showed meaningful improvement versus the second quarter. Third quarter worldwide REVPAR declined 66%, almost 19 percentage points better than last quarter\u2019s decline. Globally 94% of our hotels are now open with 97% open in North America. Our worldwide occupancy levels improved each month during the quarter and continued to close the gap to last years. We saw a steady climb in demand through August and then the rate of improvement began to plateau towards the end of the quarter in most regions; however, we are pleased with the overall progress we have made since the trough in April.  In September, our global occupancy reached just over 37%, an improvement of 25 percentage points from April\u2019s 12%. Worldwide REVPAR in September declined 64% versus September of last year, over 25 percentage points better than the year-over-year decline in April. The recovery trajectories have differed greatly by region. The recovery in Greater China, especially in mainland China, has been the strongest. Results have improved meaningfully since February, demonstrating the resiliency of travel when the virus is perceived to be firmly under control. Occupancy in mainland China reached 67% in September, a bit ahead of occupancy in September of last year and an extraordinary improvement from 9% occupancy in February.  In 2019, around 75% of room nights in mainland China were sourced from domestic guests. Even with strict travel entry requirements limiting visitors from outside the mainland, demand has rebounded strongly across all segments. Leisure transient bookings in the third quarter were over 25% ahead of last year\u2019s bookings, helped by domestic travelers taking more trips inside the country. Business transient and group bookings have strengthened each month since February solely from domestic meetings and events but are still lagging a bit compared to last year. Hong Kong and Macau, which are reliance on visitors from the mainland, are recovering more slowly as travel restrictions are easing, but cumbersome entry procedures are still inhibiting demand.  Demand in the rest of Asia Pacific has also continued to improve but generally at a much slower pace. Countries are in various stages of reopening with many still imposing strict travel restrictions. Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines continue to drive performance, helped by quarantine business for travelers entering those countries. In North America, where 95% of room nights in 2019 were sourced from domestic travelers, results in the third quarter were also meaningfully better than the second quarter, though the rate of improvement did slow in September. Third quarter REVPAR declined 65% versus the third quarter of last year with occupancy reaching 37%.  During the quarter, all chain scales continued to show improvement versus the second quarter, although there were still large variations among hotels and markets. Drive-to leisure demand continued to lead the recovery, particularly for extended stay and resort hotels and for properties in secondary and tertiary markets. Business transient and group bookings in the quarter picked up modestly versus the second quarter but still remain significantly lower versus last year. The improvement in demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the Caribbean and Latin America, or CALA, has also been slower than in North America and China. In the last few weeks, rising numbers of cases in many countries in Europe and CALA have led governments to re-impose or extend lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing regulations. These measures discourage international travelers, who made up about 40% of Europe\u2019s room nights and about 60% of CALA\u2019s room nights in 2019.  Compared to CALA and Europe, demand trends have been a bit better in the Middle East and Africa, where international guests have historically made up around 50% of room nights. Certain resort properties in Turkey, the UAE and Qatar were particularly strong in the quarter. Currently 20% of hotels are closed in CALA, 26% of hotels are closed in Europe, and 9% are closed in the Middle East and Africa. Globally, the plateauing of demand that we saw towards the end of the third quarter has generally continued into the first few weeks of the fourth quarter. Occupancy levels in most regions have remained relatively in line to slightly better versus September levels, which were marginally ahead of occupancy levels in August.  Booking windows remain very short and visibility is still limited; nonetheless, we do expect an easier year-over-year REVPAR comparison in the fourth quarter given our historical seasonality. We usually see a substantial step down in occupancy around the world in November and December as compared to September and October due to the holidays and relatively less business travel.  In 2019, global occupancy was around five percentage points lower in November than October, and then December occupancy was another eight percentage points lower than November. This year with the leisure segment showing the strongest demand, we could see occupancy levels throughout the fourth quarter remain relatively flat with September and October. As a result, year-over-year REVPAR comparisons could look better in the fourth quarter than they did in the third. Of course, as we have seen to date, results vary greatly by region and can change quickly, and the recent virus resurgences in numerous countries could have a dampening effect on demand. We know the road to recovery is going to take some time; however, we have been very pleased with the progress we are making across a number of key operational and financial areas. One of the biggest operational adjustments has been our heightened cleanliness standards. The health and safety of our associates and guests remains a top priority. Throughout the pandemic, we have adjusted our protocols to elevate our cleanliness guidelines and tools, and every property across our portfolio is now required to complete a monthly commitment to clean certification. By increasingly leveraging contactless technologies such a mobile and web check-in, mobile key and mobile chat, we are re-imagining the guest stay experience while also amplifying operational efficiencies. We also continue to roll out innovative targeted phased in marketing strategies. Our messaging emphasizes our heightened cleaning guidelines and safety measures while appealing to evolving consumer sentiment and travel intent. Many of our recent creative offerings, such as Fall for Travel and our October Week of Wonders, have been very successful in sparking leisure demand, and at the end of October we announced our new Work from Anywhere packages, which are designed to capture additional revenue driven by the remote work trend. Our award-wining loyalty program underpins all of our marketing strategies and we remain focused on engaging with our 145 million Marriott Bonvoy members, including those who are not yet ready for a hotel stay. We have also been highlighting non-hotel stay experiences such as Eat Around Town and Homes and Villas by Marriott International, and in collaboration with American Express and Chase we have been offering numerous grocery and retail spending accelerators and limited time offers on our co-branded credit cards. The increased demand amongst our Bonvoy members for our homes and villas whole home rentals during the pandemic and a much more modest decline in Chase and Amex Bonvoy card spend compared to the decline in REVPAR are great indicators of the value of the Bonvoy program to our customers. Another key constituency is our owner and franchisee community. We have had an unprecedented level of engagement with them this year, including weekly webinars in many regions and more frequent interactions with our owner advisory committees. We are deeply committed to working closely together to manage through these challenging times. We remain focused on reducing their costs as much as possible in this environment, as Leeny will discuss during her remarks. On the development front, we now anticipate net rooms growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2020, the high end of our expectation from a quarter ago, reflecting strong openings in the third quarter. This takes into account 1.5% to 2% deletions which is around 50 basis points higher than we estimated in February, primarily due to certain hotels that were already struggling entering 2020 deciding to close permanently due to COVID-19. Given the current fluid environment, we have more uncertainty than usual on opening dates for many hotels nearing completion, but the good news is that 46% of our almost 500,000 room pipeline is currently under construction with rooms under construction up 6.5% from a year ago. Although signings are not as strong as in 2019, they are quite solid considering the extraordinary impact of COVID-19 on our industry. We believe that many of the rooms that do not open in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 will now likely open in 2021. The pace of openings will likely vary depending on the recovery of lodging demand in specific markets, with heightened uncertainty in markets where air lift is key. We are also encouraged by the increasing number of conversations we are having around conversions. We remain keenly focused on conversion opportunities that are accretive from both a brand and a financial value perspective. Assuming progress is made in containing the virus, we would expect our gross room additions to accelerate next year compared to our expectations for 2020. We are in the middle of developing our 2021 budget so it is too soon to give a definitive outlook for room deletions for the coming year. It is worth noting that the potential 2021 exit of the 89 hotels owned by Service Properties Trust, which are almost all limited service properties, would create a short term headwind of roughly 1% in net rooms growth, but we are confident in our ability to replace many of those first generation limited service hotels with brand-new updated product. Finally, as Leeny will discuss in a moment, we have made significant strides in shoring up our financial position to weather the crisis. While the recovery is going to take longer than anyone would like, we are seeing encouraging signs that demand can be extremely resilient. With the steps we have taken for our customers and owners, the power of Marriott Bonvoy, our strength and liquidity position, and our incredible team of associates around the world, I am confident that we are very well positioned now and for the future. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Leeny Oberg, our CFO. Leeny Oberg : Thanks Arne very much. I hope all of you on the call are staying safe and well. I\u2019d also like to thank our team of associates for their incredible work this year in making sure Marriott comes through this crisis strong and healthy.  In the third quarter with global REVPAR down 66%, our gross fee revenues totaled $397 million, a decline of 58% versus the year ago quarter. Gross fees were comprised of base management fees of $87 million, franchise fees of $279 million, and incentive management fees, or IMFs, of $31 million. Seventy-five percent of IMFs in the quarter were earned at hotels in the Asia Pacific region where contracts generally have no owners priority.  Over 90% of our hotels in Greater China had positive gross operating profit in September with almost three quarters generating positive profit for the first nine months of the year. These results are a reflection of the strong rebound in demand and our ability to help our owners control costs. With franchise fee, our non-REVPAR related franchise fees were again much more resilient, totaling $119 million in the third quarter, down 18% from the year ago quarter with credit card fees down 22%.  Third quarter G&A improved by 40% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a full quarter of the difficult but necessary steps we took earlier this year in response to COVID-19. These steps included furloughs, reduced work weeks, and meaningful cuts in executive compensation. As REVPAR has improved from the global trough experienced in April, corporate and above property furloughs and reduced work weeks generally ended by late September. Of course, REVPAR is still well below 2019 levels and expected to take some time to fully recover. With that in mind, we focused on restructuring our organization to reduce costs on a more sustainable basis at the corporate and above property level, as well as at the hotel level so we can operate more efficiently today and going forward.  Our restructuring efforts are anticipated to reduce total corporate and other above property controllable costs by 25%, in line with the expectation we noted last quarter. This includes both classic corporate G&A as well as programs and services we provide to the hotels, for which we are reimbursed. We are still working through our budget and exact allocations for 2021, but based on our preliminary estimates we expect total corporate G&A costs in 2021 could be around 20% lower than our original 2020 guidance of $950 million to $960 million, with expenses for reimbursable programs and services down well over 25%. Importantly, we expect the reduction in G&A to be largely sustainable subject to wage and inflationary increases.  We reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $327 million, down 64% versus the third quarter of last year and a significant improvement from adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of this year. We do have a couple headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter adjusted EBITDA. As we have mentioned, G&A savings will not be as large as in the third quarter with the return of our workforce to full time, and the fourth quarter is a seasonally slower quarter.  At the hotel level, as part of our cost mitigation efforts we conducted a thorough review of all reimbursable programs and services in order to reduce the associated costs to our hotels. This work went beyond the naturally lower fees charged in this environment given that the majority of bill is based on a percent of hotel revenues. Our work has led to significantly lower expenses for the hotels. While some savings are volume related given fewer associates, transactions and the like, others reflect a real reduction in program rates. For example, after providing a discount this year on certain fixed mandatory fees paid by all of our hotels around the world, we have worked to provide a meaningful discount on these same fees in 2021 as well. Of course, we have also significantly cut our expenses associated with providing programs and services given the lower expected levels of reimbursements from the hotels. As we noted last quarter, we\u2019ve been able to reduce breakeven profitability rates at our managed properties by three to five percentage points of occupancy. As you might imagine, we are applying this same disciplined approach to our owned and leased properties as well. We have also been allowing owners to access FF&E reserves for working capital and have extended the waiver of required funding of these FF&E funds through the end of March 2021, with lender consent where applicable. Additionally, we worked with our U.S. managed hotels to file for CARES Act tax credits which led to refunds of $119 million, which should help support our hotels\u2019 working capital position.  These measures combined with our aggressive collection efforts have been quite effective. The vast majority of our owners and franchisees continues to pay their bills on time or are on short term payment plans. Despite the current environment, only a small number of hotels have gone into foreclosure this year as lender have been relatively patient to date, and with only a handful of exceptions, the few hotels that are in foreclosure or receivership are retaining our flag. In North America, our management and related agreements generally protect us and historically we have held onto most franchise agreements as well when properties go into foreclosure. Last quarter, we laid out a cash burn scenario with REVPAR down 70% that indicated a monthly cash burn rate of around $85 million, or $255 million a quarter at that REVPAR decline. Our actual cash burn for the third quarter was around flat, much better than the model would have shown even including severance payments of around $60 million in the quarter that were not included in the model. We were pleased that total fees came in higher than our $2 million to $2.5 million of monthly fees per REVPAR point sensitivity would have predicted, with REVPAR for the quarter down 66% primarily due to higher incentive management fees. The other major drivers of our neutral cash burn were better owned lease results, lower G&A costs, strong working capital management, and robust loyalty program cash flows. The model we provided last quarter should still be useful as we think about potential monthly cash burn in the fourth quarter, with a couple updates. We still expect the sensitivity of a one-point change in REVPAR on our fees would be in the $2 million to $2.5 million per month range. As we\u2019ve seen, the sensitivity is not completely linear given the variability of IMFs and does not include impact of changes in credit card fees. We expect that continued strong collections of receivables should again help minimize our working capital outlays in the fourth quarter.  Investment spending for the full year is now expected to be slightly below the low end of our prior expectation of $400 million to $450 million and significantly below our original forecast of $700 million to $800 million at the beginning of the year. This is another example of the strong progress we have made in reducing cash outlays in the current environment. The variance versus last quarter\u2019s expectation is primarily due to the timing of key money payments and additional reductions in systems spending.  There are also two timing-related items to highlight which will impact our cash flow in the fourth quarter. In October, our working capital was impacted by the funding of our 2019 company match to associates\u2019 401k plan contributions, which totaled around $130 million. That payment usually occurs earlier in the year. Also, cash interest payments will be roughly $100 million higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter due to the timing of when the payments are due. Through the first three quarters of 2020 with year-over-year REVPAR down an unprecedented 59% through September 30, we have demonstrated our ability to adapt quickly and we\u2019ve confirmed the power of our asset-light business model. Our cash from operations less capital expenditures has been positive year to date. At the end of the third quarter, our net liquidity was approximately $5.1 billion, representing roughly $1.5 billion in available cash balances plus $3.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. The substantial increase in liquidity from the prior quarter reflects our August $1 billion bond issuance maturing in 2032. Most of those proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our revolver balance. We believe our liquidity position and resilient cash flow from operations comfortably positions us to meet our short and long term obligations. In closing, while the timing of a full recovery is unpredictable, we\u2019re confident that COVID-19 will eventually be contained and that travel will come back quickly. We look forward to welcoming new and returning guests to our hotels before too long. Thank you for your time this morning, and we\u2019ll now open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning everyone. Arne Sorenson : Hey Shaun. Shaun Kelley : Hi Arne. Just to start off, you covered a lot of ground in the prepared remarks, so thank you for all that. Could we hit on the net unit growth commentary for next year a little bit more deeply? Arne, I think you talked about a couple of the puts and takes around the SVC terminations being a bit of a drag, but what else could factor in, and just broadly speaking, do you expect to see some level of maybe elevated terminations relative or system exits relative to past behavior, just given the environment we\u2019re in, or do you think these kind start to normalize? And in this comment, could you give any thoughts around particularly just maybe the health and status of the Starwood legacy portfolio? Thank you. Arne Sorenson : All right, well there\u2019s a lot in that, and let me start maybe by saying it\u2019s still a little early, obviously. There is a lot of uncertainty out there because of the pandemic. I think we were pleased to see in Q3 the increase in openings again compared to Q2. I think Q2, to some extent, even as projects were ready to reopen, either restrictions precluded it or the total lack of business precluded it, or just the uncertainty in the environment precluded to it. So to get to about 19,000 rooms opening in Q3, I think is a sign that at least for projects that are under construction and nearing completion, those will open, and I think that\u2019s what gives us the most optimism about not just Q4 but looking into 2021, that we should see - obviously all of this depends on the virus, but that we should see these projects that are under construction open as scheduled, if you will, over the course of the next couple of years, something like that, but very much including 2021. The deletion side of the equation is harder, and of course there\u2019s an offsetting potential upside, which is conversions. Both depend a little bit on what happens with properties are under trouble and what happens with change in ownership or change in capital structure for existing hotels. Some of what we\u2019ve lost year to date, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, are hotels that entered the COVID-19 pandemic already under financial pressure and simply did not make sense to reopen, certainly not to reopen under their current positioning. I suspect we\u2019ll see some that next year. Besides SVC, we don\u2019t have a number for it yet - we\u2019re obviously just in the process of trying to build our budget. Our teams are dealing with owners all around the world. I think by and large on the positive side, conversions into our system and on the negative side deletions from our system will become clearer as ownership of hotels change hands or as the new capital stacks are put in place, and I suspect that will begin to occur more in 2021 than it is doing right now. Shaun Kelley : Thanks, and maybe just as a follow-up on the same topic, are there a large number of these sort of--let\u2019s call it cross, single guarantee type contracts out there? Is the SVC situation pretty unique? Just any color you can provide on those types of structures. Arne Sorenson : Yes, SVC is very unusual. Those portfolios were initially put in place with HPT 20 years ago, maybe 25 years ago, something like that, and they were initially a lease structure or a lease-like structure. They\u2019ve evolved since to be sort of a management structure but with a cap guarantee. That structure was re-done with SVC earlier this year. We were quite optimistic that actually it was done in a way that would bode well for long term, including getting substantial additional new capital into those assets to bring them up to standard, and of course the pandemic had profound impact to that. We are in discussions with SVC today about the possibility of renewing that. I think based on what we heard, including as recently as yesterday from that team, they seem to be hard wired to make those hotels Sonestas. We of course don\u2019t know exactly how Sonesta would perform, but looking at the ROI from assets that are Sonesta flag versus ours, it looks like that ROI is roughly half, and it\u2019s a little bit surprising to us that the separate stockholder and debt holder interest in SVC could be furthered by converting those to Sonesta\u2019s brand, as opposed to the dramatically stronger brands that are on those hotels today.  But again, that seems to be the direction they\u2019re heading, and so our expectations would be that those hotels would leave the system. We do not think there is anything comparable to that, that remains in the system. Shaun Kelley : Thank you for all the clarity. Arne Sorenson : You bet. Leeny Oberg : It\u2019s also just worth noting one addition, that when you think about the impact on fees, it\u2019s quite minimal related to that portfolio. I think total fees in 2020 this year are expected to be $10 million to $15 million from those hotels. Shaun Kelley : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Joe Greff : Good morning everybody. Leeny Oberg : Hey Joe. Joe Greff : Arne, you mentioned in your comments for next year in terms of gross room additions, for that to accelerate next year, and part of that confidence is some of the rooms that would have opened in 2020 were being pushed out to open in 2021. To what extent are the ones that you would have thought a year ago to open in 2021 will be pushed out to beyond 2021, into 2022, and does that room addition acceleration comment from you take that into account? Is there typically visibility in stuff that gets pushed out, so if something wouldn\u2019t hit in \u201921 right now, would Marriott in November of 2020 have a good sense of that? Arne Sorenson : Yes, it\u2019s a fair question. I think generally we would say that everything in that pipeline has gotten extended by at least a few months. Undoubtedly that\u2019s a little bit of an overstatement, but when we deal with--think about the end of the first quarter and the second quarter of this year, with business sort of functionally disappearing in many markets around the world, including restrictions on lots of activity that is happening in those markets, the uncertainty and those restrictions certainly caused many, many, many projects to slow down, even if they were already under construction, so I think it\u2019s a fair point to say that if in January of 2020, we targeted a June of 2021 opening, that opening could well have slipped by a few months. We do have a team that is out there working with our development partners and trying to make sure they understand what is under construction and what the status of that construction and what the forecasted opening is, for obvious reasons. I think on the very positive side here, the 45% or so of the rooms that are in the pipeline that are under construction, 230,000 rooms roughly, we can all have an extraordinarily high level of confidence that those hotels are going to open. I think you get beyond that to the hotels that are not under construction yet and I think we\u2019re going to have to watch that. I think they are real projects, in many respects the land is owned and controlled, they\u2019ve been designed, they\u2019ve been improved by us and by our partners. We have signed contracts for the overwhelming majority of them, but if construction hasn\u2019t started, each one of those partners has got to make a decision about what do I get for building in a weaker environment, which I might save something on construction costs, and what do I potentially lose in committing myself to a project that may open in a market that is harder for me to predict and underwrite today. Our experience from prior crises is that most of the projects which are not under construction overwhelmingly will ultimately open, but the delay in those openings could be not just some quarters, but some years, particularly for the higher end luxury or full service projects that may take some time to get financed and get underway.  So on balance, I think we would say we can have a reasonably high level of confidence that the gross openings will step up next year - again, this is based on reasonable assumptions on what happens with COVID-19, but it\u2019s a little bit too soon for us to give you really precise numbers about it. Joe Greff : That\u2019s helpful. Then as a follow-up, Leeny, your mutual cash burn in 3Q was impressive, and you mentioned working capital management was a contributor to the EBITDA upside. To what extent do you think working capital be a source of-a positive contribution to cash flow, operating cash flow, free cash flow next year? Leeny Oberg : Well, one of the big questions is around loyalty. If you remember, Joe, last year we actually had loyalty as a use of cash relative to strong redemptions throughout the system, and this year it\u2019s kind of a bit of the opposite. Now, the reality is I actually would expect next year that that stabilizes a bit as we continue to rebound from the low levels of demand that we are, so that while I would expect meaningfully more redemptions, they won\u2019t be quite at the same peak prices that they were in 2019. From that perspective, I would expect that loyalty is not as large a source of cash as this year, but also not like 2019 either. When I think about it overall, we\u2019re still early days as we go through the budgeting process, but I would not see it as a major source but also not a major use of cash next year, as we think about from a working capital perspective. Joe Greff : Thanks guys. Have a great day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about, you know, some of your owners have talked about saving--permanent cost reductions from changing brand standards. I just wonder if you can talk about how permanent is that really, because right now, okay, you don\u2019t need a doorman on duty or you don\u2019t need a 24-hour shuttle to the airport, but won\u2019t those come back, so how permanent are they really? Also, when you have 30 brands, do you lose some of what distinguishes the brands if some of those brand standards do change permanently? Arne Sorenson : Good question, Robin, and good morning. I think what we want to do is have as many of the savings as we\u2019ve been able to find and implement be long lasting, to state the obvious. I think there are some, and your question illustrates a few of them. I mean, food and beverage service, I think would be one that\u2019s on the top of my list, maybe even before a doorman. We have, particularly in the markets in which demand is the weakest, we have fairly limited, sometimes dramatically limited food and beverage service, and that\u2019s not going to be satisfactory to most guests when we get back to a normal demand environment. Guests can be quite sympathetic and empathetic during a tough, tough time, but when we get back to something that feels a little bit more normal, they\u2019re going to expect the full services, particularly from a full service hotel that they have come to anticipate.  Having said that, I think we will see some things in keyless entry, I think we will see some things in the staffing models that we have been experimenting with. I think some of the above property costs that have been cut, and Leeny can talk a little bit about that, we think will stick and stay for a while. I mean, our estimates today, I think are--we\u2019ve probably reduced breakeven occupancy by three to five points, something like that, depending on the brand.  At the end of the day, though, we\u2019ve got to make sure that the guest is satisfied with the experience that they\u2019re getting, and you\u2019re right - it\u2019s going to vary a little bit from brand to brand and segment to segment. Obviously the advantages, of course, on the higher end segment is we\u2019ll see rate begin to move at some point up too, even as the costs move forward a little bit.  Net-net, we\u2019d expect that what we\u2019ve done should deliver some long lasting margin improvement. It\u2019s a little too soon to be able to tell you what that number will be. Robin Farley : Then maybe just as a quick follow-up on the conversation about conversion, I know in the release you mentioned the percent of conversions, 1,400 out of the 19,000 rooms opened, so still a pretty small percent because obviously that was all pre-COVID. Can you talk about the signings in the quarter, what percent of those are conversions, and did you see that go up during the quarter for signings? Thanks. Arne Sorenson : Yes, I don\u2019t have that number. I know that the team is talking, having significantly more conversations around conversions than they\u2019ve had in the past. The one quarter signings don\u2019t necessarily make a huge amount of difference - I\u2019m aware of a few significant ones that are underway now and the team of transactors that are working on them are hoping that they get done in the fourth quarter. Whether that happens or not, of course, is another question. We\u2019ve gone back and looked at our conversions experience through the cycles - obviously we knew this is of interest not just to you but to us as well, and you can see even in the last two years before COVID, we had--of our openings in 2019, 18% were conversions, but the year before in 2018, it was 12%, and so you can see a little bit the obvious fact here, which is even in a very similar economic environment, these things can be a little bit lumpy and a little bit hard to predict. We\u2019re in the teens for most of the last decade or so, and conversions as a percentage of our openings were highest coming out of the Great Recession - \u201911 was higher than \u201910, \u201912 was higher than \u201911, \u201913 was higher than \u201912, and as a percentage they peaked in \u201913 but the number of rooms we opened as conversions in 2014 was higher yet again.  Again, this is what we said before, but we would expect conversion activity to increase certainly in terms of discussions starting now. We would expect that the more substantial increase in terms of actually opening into our system will depend a bit on the new ownership structures or financial structures for hotels that caused those folks to be able to look to the future and say, I now know what I want to do with that hotel. Robin Farley : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust Securities. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning everyone. With the layoffs in corporate level sales staff and also property level sales staff, should we interpret that as your belief that it\u2019s going to be a long, slow recovery for your group business, and also related to that, how is your group business tracking for next year? Thank you. Arne Sorenson : Our group business for next year is down about 30%. It won\u2019t surprise you to know that the first quarter is the worst by far in terms of group business on the books, and as you get farther into the year, the decline is meaningfully less than that 30% number. What does that tell you? It tells you that folks are still optimistic about holding their meetings, that COVID-19 will allow them to hold their meetings as you get further into 2021. I think we are optimistic, as are many, that we can have a vaccine or two, maybe, approved by the end of this calendar year, and could see it start to get broadly distributed by sometime in the first half, maybe it\u2019s the latter part of the first half, but sometime in the first half of 2021. As that takes hold, we\u2019re optimistic that group business will come back. I think what we\u2019re seeing in group today, and I think you\u2019ve heard this from other companies in the industry, there is group business. Obviously it\u2019s stronger in China, but coming back to the United States for a second, the group business in hotels in the United States is not a lot like the group that I think we all first think of, which is corporate group and association business and the like. I think the group business we have today is much more likely to be healthcare workers or somehow connected with the COVID-19 pandemic itself, or things that are more leisure focused - that could be some athletic groups, it could be some larger family groups, that sort of thing. The core corporate business is still pretty weak. I don\u2019t think you should read too much into the efforts we\u2019ve made to manage our costs in the sales space. Obviously those costs are borne by the system of hotels that are out there. We have got to make sure that we\u2019re managing those costs in a way that meets the level of reimbursement that can come in there, and we\u2019re doing our best to do that and to make sure we continue to call on the customers that we know are important to us and important to the recovery. We\u2019d be optimistic, I think, if COVID-19 goes the way we think, that we will start to see this group business that\u2019s on the books hang tight and ultimately come to pass, and we\u2019ll start to see meaningfully more bookings when those vaccines start to take effect. Patrick Scholes : Okay, thank you. I certainly hope so. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Steven Grambling : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  I just had a bit more of a strategic question related to the loyalty program. You\u2019ve mentioned the strength in Bonvoy and corresponding credit cards. What are you learning from how consumer are engaging with the program in this difficult time that could drive changes to further differentiate the brand in a recovery, and potentially even lead to stronger conversions and/or development in the future? Arne Sorenson : Conversions and development - you\u2019re talking about hotel development, or back to credit cards and the Bonvoy program? Steven Grambling : I mean, it\u2019s really all together because I feel like if you\u2019re creating additional value and differentiation for the consumer, ultimately that drives stronger REVPAR and development opportunities in the future. Arne Sorenson : Yes, well I think we mentioned a bit of this in the prepared remarks, that we\u2019ve been actually quite pleased with the performance of the credit card portfolio during this crisis. It\u2019s probably worth starting with that because you would wonder about how well that would do, an Affinity card for travel in a market in which there is very little travel. But what we\u2019ve seen is that folks are still aspiring to travel, dreaming about travel, eager to get back on the road, and as a consequence when we\u2019ve with our credit card partners done things around grocery or done things around restaurants or around hardware, the card has performed extraordinarily well. The Bonvoy membership, I think, has continued to engage with us in a way that\u2019s pretty powerful.  I think if you go back to before the pandemic, what we saw was a continued increase year-over-year on the number of Bonvoy members as a percentage of the total business in our hotels, and one of the frustrating things, we talked about this a quarter ago, about the timing of this pandemic is as we got into the second half of 2019 particularly, the Starwood integration work was behind us, the systems work was behind us, the new Bonvoy program was launched and we could see, whether it was in REVPAR index or in loyalty penetration or other data we look at very carefully, really powerful momentum towards proving the value of those programs. I don\u2019t have any doubt that we will get back to that. It will come back stronger, obviously, the sooner people get back on the road and know that travel is going to be a part of the way they live their lives, but when they do, they will find that they\u2019ve got a credit card program, they\u2019ll find that they\u2019ve got a broad portfolio of destinations to stay at - we have the biggest portfolio of hotels around the world, clearly the strongest in the luxury and lifestyle and resort and urban space, plus other things like Eating Around Town and Homes and Villas and other things that we still are working on and hope to get launched before too long. Leeny Oberg : The only other thing I\u2019d add, Steven, is the digital experience. If you think about travelers today, if they are traveling, the contactless element of the experience is all the more important, and that is all driven through the Bonvoy app, so as you see more and more people signing up for that experience, that again gets them more invested and they really have an opportunity to see what Bonvoy can do for you. Steven Grambling : Makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. I guess one unrelated follow-up on just at the hotel level from a profitability standpoint, what are you learning from reopened hotels that can inform when incentive management fees could come back in fuller force in North America? Arne Sorenson : Leeny, you want to take that? Leeny Oberg : Yes, sure. Again, I think the reality is that we are in a position now where, in many cases, you\u2019ve got for a full service hotel, it is better to be open than closed, not in all cases but in most cases, but that is really about what is the least bad, so we\u2019re still a very long way from obviously occupancy levels that get us to IMFs, because overwhelmingly in the U.S. you\u2019ve got owners priorities. But at the same time, I\u2019ll say with the reduction in cost structure, that I do think that it will help us as we come back to get to incentive fees earlier than perhaps we were before COVID, because of all the work that we\u2019ve done on the cost structure.  I think the other side of that is obviously wage pressures, and I don\u2019t see any sign of those actually going away. I think what we obviously have done is try across every single discipline of our hotels to improve our efficiency and to improve ways that can drive more to the bottom line, so I do think it\u2019s certainly that we will hold onto a bunch of these savings in a sustainable way, but I think the wage pressure element on a full service hotel is obviously going to be--you know, with those being, call it 40% of your cost structure of a hotel, that\u2019s going to be a big element of how quickly we get back. Steven Grambling : Helpful, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Anthony Powell : Hi, good morning. You mentioned that business travel in China has lagged leisure despite the virus being under much greater control there. Is there anything to read into from that in terms of the potential recovery in the U.S. or other markets? Arne Sorenson : No, I don\u2019t think so. Obviously we talked about occupancy being higher than it was a year ago, and so that\u2019s a really good sign; but beneath that total, you\u2019ve got two things that are happening. One is that business transient travel and group travel is still a bit softer than it was last year, and the second is you\u2019ve got the Chinese travel business that used to go abroad staying home, which is driving those leisure numbers meaningfully higher. Remember we had in February 9% occupancy in China, a country entirely shut down, and even today now we have occasionally a flare-up in a market in which the Chinese government response is to essentially shut down that market and test everybody in the market for COVID-19, and they\u2019ve managed at least in two or three circumstances to nip that in the bud, if you will, and get those markets reopened and get going again. They have had an impact to us, probably less than a point or so on REVPAR, but a little bit of an impact as they roll forward, but it\u2019s just a reminder that even in China, where there\u2019s a much broader sense that COVID-19 is under control, it is not irrelevant yet. Until it becomes irrelevant, I suspect we will see a little bit of relative weakness in business transient and group, albeit they are dramatically stronger than what we\u2019re seeing in the United States, which of course would be the next strongest big market. You get to Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific, it\u2019s probably weaker yet. Anthony Powell : Understood, thanks. You\u2019ve mentioned a few times the relative strength of Homes and Villas over the summer, but it still seems that you do that as more of an amenity versus a core business. Is there an opportunity for you to maybe grow the inventory there and grow that business a bit more dramatically, given the demonstrated popularity of the offering that you\u2019ve seen? Arne Sorenson : We are growing it. As we\u2019ve talked about from the beginning, though, our effort here is a whole home product and obviously if you look at our urban markets globally, but particularly in the United States, you would see that we\u2019ve got tremendous hotel capacity and extraordinarily little demand in those markets. Partly that\u2019s because offices remain closed in too many of those markets, you don\u2019t have business transient travel, you may not have much leisure travel because people are more inclined to go to resort destinations or other destinations.  We will remain focused, I think, on whole home, warm weather, ski country, resort destinations. I am quite convinced that that will continue to grow substantially and it will be a nice complementary feature to the traditional hotel business for us. Anthony Powell : Could you work with developers to maybe build new inventory in those markets, like ski resorts or warm weather, or is that mainly going to be finding existing inventory? Arne Sorenson : It\u2019ll be both. We have had conversations with some of our good partners about exactly what you\u2019re talking about, which is building new inventory, if you will, in some of those resort markets. Anthony Powell : Great, thank you. Leeny Oberg : Anthony, just one follow-up on your comment about business travel, is to remember that in the ballpark of a quarter of the travel in China in our hotels is from international business from outside China, so the fact that business nights, yes, they are down but again you\u2019re also having the impact that you\u2019re not getting the travelers from outside China coming in. So all things considered, I would--although it\u2019s not quite as robust as leisure because people are not traveling outside China, it\u2019s still quite robust a recovery on the business side. Anthony Powell : Thanks for that detail, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi everyone, thanks for taking my questions. Arne Sorenson : How are you, David? David Katz : Hey, good morning. Good to hear everyone\u2019s voices. As you talk to your business peers, we obviously are all very focused on this business travel element. Do you think the collective wisdom is that--you know, the gating factor is entirely therapeutic, or is that one component of maybe a larger set of strategies to get the likes of me out and traveling again? What are you hearing? Arne Sorenson : Well, I think there are three things, and obviously the most urgent and most impactful will be what happens with COVID-19. Clearly travel has plummeted because of the risks associated with it and the way those have impacted either through formal restrictions or informal restrictions - think about airline capacity, international travel, all of those sorts of things - that impact has been very profound. We will have, I think, a meaningful step up in group and business transient travel the moment that COVID-19 risk recedes from the threatening horizon, if you will.  I think once that happens, there are two other things that we\u2019re going to have to pay attention to. One is what\u2019s the state of the underlying economy, and as we\u2019ve all watched for years and years and years, demand in our industry does correlate well with the strength of the economy, and my guess is we\u2019re going to see an economy which has got some lingering weakness because of small businesses being closed, many probably not able to reopen, relatively higher levels of unemployment around the world, a number of factors that it will take some time for us to work our way through. Then I think the third is what happens as a function of remote work, the digital tools we\u2019ve all learned to use even more than we used before to meet with each other and stay connected in a time in which we can\u2019t be out, maybe can\u2019t even be in our offices let alone traveling, and there of course you\u2019ve got significant conversation about how much of that will impact long term travel trends.  That last piece, to some extent, is similar to the conversations we participated in during the Great Recession and even when the tech bubble burst in early 2001 and 9/11 followed, and the travel recession we had then. What generally we saw is that in the few years following, most of that group and most of that business transient travel comes back. Not all of it - if you look at 20 years\u2019 worth of mix for the industry and including for Marriott, we have seen a couple of points, maybe two or three points shift from business transient and group combined towards leisure. I suspect we\u2019ll continue to see that in the years ahead as leisure remains probably a pretty powerful driver of demand, but we\u2019ll get through--we\u2019ll see business transient move to--the fact of the matter is, people love to travel, they love to travel both for themselves personally and they love to travel for work. It\u2019s often the most interesting, and the places they\u2019re going to learn the most, and we\u2019ll see the lion\u2019s share of that come back, even if it\u2019s not every single night from every single company that we do business with. David Katz : Noted, and-- Arne Sorenson : Does that answer your question, David? David Katz : It largely does. If I can follow it up, just specifically around the COVID piece of your answer and the need for a vaccine to be a gating factor to mitigate the risks of COVID, are you hearing from any of your peers about interim steps or alternative strategies in conjunction with or instead of vaccine? Just trying to think about whether we\u2019re sitting around waiting for one single event or a series of things, just from what you\u2019re hearing. Arne Sorenson : Yes, I think--I do spend a lot of time talking to our big customers, sometimes though the business roundtable, sometimes in other one-on-one contexts, and I\u2019d hesitate to speak for the corporate world globally but I do think there is an increasing sense that with each passing month, we lose a little bit more in terms of the connective tissue between our people in companies in all sorts of different industries. I think as a consequence--and you know, when you\u2019re talking about collaboration or innovation or strategic conversations, that maybe is most obvious that those are the things that are harder to do through a Teams call or through some sort of digital tool, so I think there is a sense that when we can safely do it, we should start to probably more significantly open offices and bring people back to work.  That is made difficult by a resurgence of the virus today - you know, I think we\u2019re talking about some days with over 100,000 new cases in the United States, and it\u2019s made difficult by the school situation, which some markets they\u2019re open, some markets they\u2019re closed, in many market they\u2019re hybrid, and employers are trying to work their way through that process. But I am hopeful that we will, even before the vaccine is broadly distributed, we will start to see offices opened up with social distancing, with mask wearing, and probably with reduced density, but starting to get to a place where it\u2019s at least a step towards a more normal environment. It has to be done safely, but I think it can be done safely because I don\u2019t think the office environment is a particularly risky one. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s probably as risky as the grocery store, for that matter. We will start to see, I think, some positive impact on our business from that too, and that could precede the vaccine. David Katz : Right. If I can ask one more very short follow-up, you commented earlier in your remarks about conversions and accepting or embracing those that are financially accretive and brand accretive. If you could just color us, because all conversions are clearly not created equal beyond the financial impact, how you think about that brand accretive concept beyond just REVPAR index and the like? Arne Sorenson : Yes, I\u2019m not sure you can even find out what we all do because we don\u2019t necessarily publish it. I think some of our--some players in the industry are compensating their folks simply for adding units. Our compensation tools basically are to reward folks for units that deliver value, so an NPV calculation is a big part of or compensation scheme for the folks on our team that out there, helping us grow.  We\u2019ve also got our brand and operators that are involved in making sure that the products we bring on meet brand standards, and typically that will come home to roost for conversion in what does that property improvement plan look like for a pre-existing hotel in order to put one of our flags on it, and we want to make sure that--obviously we want to make sure we\u2019re growing. We\u2019re really interested only in growing if it\u2019s delivering value. We\u2019re about creating value, we\u2019re not about simply adding rooms that have no value, but we know long term that the reinforcing aspect of the power of growth depends on the strength of the brands, and so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we are getting the kind of quality that represents the brand well. So all of those three things are going to be very much in the mix, and if we can\u2019t be satisfied that all three of those exist, we\u2019re not going to take that product. David Katz : Thanks very much. Be well, everyone. Arne Sorenson : You too. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hey, good morning. It was helpful in the prepared remarks that over 90% of hotels in China had positive gross operating profit in September. Do you have that percentage by region or for your broader portfolio, and how has it--I know you anticipate it to trend. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Yes, I don\u2019t have it for you by region. Obviously it\u2019s not going to surprise you, we\u2019ve got big chunks of hotels still closed in CALA and Europe and with REVPAR down in the 70%, that\u2019s an extremely difficult process for them. In the U.S., I\u2019ll work in getting you some numbers, but obviously it\u2019s going to be a far lower percentage. But again, I think it shows you in China the remarkable resilience of both the profits and the revenues from a demand perspective. Thomas Allen : I guess the bigger question in a way is the--I mean, on the surface, I think people view that this is going to be a relatively--I mean, in the short term, it\u2019s a very deep downturn, and then there\u2019s some concerns it\u2019s going to be a long recovery and hotels may be seeing negative operating profits for a prolonged period of time, which on the surface a lot of people feel like will lead to closures, maybe not now but maybe once debt maintenance deferrals are put off. What gives you confidence that that\u2019s not going to be the case? Leeny Oberg : A couple things. First, again I think you do have to look back at how-you do have to look at China as being somewhat helpful in evaluating how things can come back, so I don\u2019t think--although we haven\u2019t seen it everywhere else, I think it is instructive. Then for example, when you\u2019ve seen in the luxury occupancy at the resorts, you\u2019ve clearly seen that the leisure demand has moved that up quite nicely when you see the Ritz Carlton brand, for example, had 27% occupancy in the third quarter in North America, and we\u2019ve talked before about how breakeven occupancy can be around 40%, and that\u2019s still with REVPAR for Ritz Carlton being down 64%, so all that to be said is I think it can rebound fairly quickly. I think if you look back and see what happened in the Great Recession, you also had the most complex hotels dramatically impacted by a massive drop in demand, and what you saw is while it took a little bit of time, they did get through it, they did get through to generally not being foreclosed upon, and getting back to strong profits and, in many cases, incentive fees for us. So while I appreciate--we all appreciate that this is going to take longer than any of us would like, I think the most--the guiding light, I know that we see, is how quickly when people feel comfortable about travel, how quickly demand returns and, frankly, rate. All things considered, rate has held up fairly well when you think about big picture, where things are. For example, when you see a quick pop to demand and a drive to luxury resort, you actually see that rate stays in pretty good shape, and again I think we\u2019ve worked on the cost structure at the hotels to be able to take up some of the slack that has been created from the demand side. You know, you\u2019re right about it will depend based on how long this takes, but generally speaking the hotels are in better shape from a leverage standpoint than they were the last go around. I do think the lenders have been quite patient and I think when we get some ability to travel, that the demand is going to come back fairly quickly. Thomas Allen : Helpful color, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. You covered a lot of ground this morning, but I just wanted to ask you longer term, when free cash does start to re-accelerate more meaningfully, are there any changes in the way that you\u2019re thinking about the leverage levels that you\u2019d like to attain, or should we expect that you\u2019ll just really focus on reducing debt, or maybe how do you think about returning to a dividend program or some sort of repurchase program? Leeny Oberg : Sure, thanks Smedes. I would love to be thinking about those questions. I think for the moment, that\u2019s still a little ways off. This will obviously depend on how quick REVPAR come back, and we\u2019ve got--as you know, we\u2019ve got leverage ratios that we want to get back in line, certainly on our revolver covenant, to even consider share repurchase and dividends. We need to get back to four times to be able to even consider that, so I think it\u2019s a ways off in terms of actual planning. I think one of the things that you know we\u2019ve been focused on is really thinking about our debt maturity stack, and so that is one of the things that we\u2019ve done that is more permanent and I think will hold us in good stead as we think about managing our cash flow. When you\u2019re not looking at having quite as much in commercial paper, which is so short term and so much more subject to a crisis like this, obviously stretching out our maturities will be helpful, but I think we want to be strong investment grade, we want to continue to be in that range, but we also will obviously be working hard to generate that excess cash flow to consider what to do with it. We like a mix of dividends, of a modest dividend and share repurchase for the flexibility and for the modest ongoing return to the shareholders, and I suspect that we will continue to like that; but exactly where we want to peg the leverage, I think will absolutely depend on the pace of this recovery and the timing of it. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Appreciate that. Arne Sorenson : Let me throw one thing in on this, if I can. What Leeny said is exactly right - there\u2019s obviously been a fair amount of conversation in policy circles about whether repurchasing stock is somehow a sign of bad behavior by corporate America or by businesses around the world. In the context of Marriott, we have been buying back stock for decades - 40 years, 45 years maybe, something like that, and it is not because we are uninterested in growing our business or investing in the economy or in our people but because the business produces cash and in the fullness of time, we often find that we do not have attractive enough investments to use all of the capacity. As a consequence, we believe it\u2019s our shareholders money and should be returned to shareholders, either through dividends or share repurchases. While Leeny\u2019s comments about let\u2019s take this one step at a time and see how the recovery and EBITDA comes back, and we\u2019ll continue to monitor this in terms of appropriate debt ratios and the like, and the maturity ladder of the debt that we have, all of those things are extremely important. I do think we will get back fairly quickly, in fact, towards a place where we have excess financial resources that belong to our shareholders and that through dividends and share repurchases, we will continue to give it back to them. Smedes Rose : Okay, good. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you too, just circling back on the SVC, assuming those rooms do come out of the system, I assume that that lifts a lot of territorial restrictions, and just given that it is a big chunk, and you sort of talked about this on your opening remarks, but what would be the strategy, I guess, to replace rooms in those markets sooner rather than later? I\u2019m not really familiar where the hotels specifically are, but would you expect to have a very focused conversation with developers or even conversion opportunities in those markets to replace your presence there faster, sooner rather than later? Arne Sorenson : Our development team has already looked at that list and they are obviously going to be focused on the markets where they are convinced hotels will make good economic sense, and we\u2019ll be talking to the appropriate partners in those markets to see whether or not we can add something there quickly.  Now, they will be new builds, so obviously it--and we are in a pandemic, so it\u2019s not like they will be opening in the first quarter of 2021, but I suspect that we\u2019ll move fairly quickly. Leeny Oberg : And without getting too far into conversations, we\u2019ve already received some phone calls on that very topic from some of our partners, so I think you can expect there will be some near term opportunities. Smedes Rose : Okay. Just sort of on that, are developers--do you have just a sense in general of how a developer is able to access financing now, or what sort of changes are you seeing? Leeny Oberg : I think obviously you\u2019ve got the reality that our large multi-unit partners and our lenders are assessing the situation and trying to figure out the health of their own assets, whether it\u2019s the loans or the hotels they own. That is in some cases requiring that they take a bit of a pause, but at the same time these are in many cases folks who are thinking over the longer term and who do have access to capital to get things going, so again as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve clearly had a drop in signings, we\u2019ve had lenders clearly waiting on the sidelines, but it\u2019s not to say that all activity has stopped.  Certainly in some of our larger diversified owners, they\u2019ve got the ability to continue to move forward, looking at pieces of land and starting the process in talking to us and putting deals together, so the conversations certainly get going. I think as you\u2019ve seen, certainly on the financing front, kind of putting pen to paper and getting committed capital on some deal has slowed, but the conversations absolutely continue. You know, the business has had downturns before, it\u2019s a cyclical business, and will again, so I think this I sometimes when there can be some great opportunity, but to really see things pick up in a meaningful way will take that there\u2019s more resolution around the COVID situation. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on the reimbursed costs. It looks like you were profitable on that line in Q3, but you\u2019re talking about making a 25% cost saving in there. What will actually happen to the costs you save in there? Does that benefit the owners? Are you going to be able to cut their fees or will you reinvest that in marketing, or does Marriott benefit somehow from that? Leeny Oberg : Right, well we benefit from it indirectly. We benefit from the standpoint that obviously we need to make sure that what we charge for our programs and services is competitive in a variety of REVPAR scenarios, and as you know, many, many of our charges are actually based on hotel level revenues, so they\u2019re a percent of sales, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that our costs also flex with those changes.  First and foremost, ultimately on the reimbursements, it is a net neutral goal. What you\u2019re trying to do over time is to match your costs to your revenues, but also make sure that what you\u2019re charging the properties is competitive. So you\u2019re right that you see it\u2019s positive, but again that\u2019s overwhelmingly due to loyalty, and I talked before earlier, that really does flex a bit depending on what\u2019s going on with redemption buy-in. We do basically manage it over time to be neutral, as well as all the other programs and services that we charge the hotels for. Richard Clarke : Okay, so just to clarify, in future years the costs you\u2019ll need to spend there will go down by 25%, but you should be able to recover the revenues you make in that line-- Leeny Oberg : I was going to say, since so many of the charges that we\u2019re charging them flex with revenues, I\u2019ve got to reduce my costs by that 25%, because remember I can\u2019t charge them as much. So when we talk about many of those costs that are above property related to programs and services, that is a function of knowing that as you think about, for example, next year, we\u2019re likely to enter into the year not meaningfully different from where we are now, unless there\u2019s some unbelievable piece of news. So again, we\u2019re just making sure that our cost structure matches what we by contract are able to charge the owners, so that 25% savings is really designed to match what we\u2019re charging the owners, but also to try to find ways, as I said in my comments, to actually reduce the rate that we\u2019re charging for programs and services, which will then show up in higher hotel profits over time, which should make us more competitive as a manager and franchisor. Does that address your question? Richard Clarke : That makes sense. If I can also ask one very quick clarification - on the front of your release today, you talk about a number of hotels that you\u2019ve opened from other brands. Does that include from independents as well or is it just from alternative brands operators? Arne Sorenson : It\u2019s from independents as well. Leeny Oberg : Yes, it\u2019s from any - independent or other brand. Richard Clarke : Makes sense, okay. Thank you very much. Operator : At this time, we have reached our allotted time for questions. I would like to turn it back over to Mr. Sorenson for closing remarks. Arne Sorenson : All right, well thank you all very much for your time and attention this morning. I was thinking as the questions were asked by so many of you, how much we miss you. It\u2019s great to hear your voices. Leeny Oberg : So true! Arne Sorenson : We hope you\u2019re all navigating through this time well. We obviously can\u2019t wait, for so many reasons, to see you in person again soon, and between now and then, we wish you nothing but the best.  Obviously if there are questions that we didn\u2019t get to this morning, feel free to call the team and we\u2019ll be in touch and make sure you\u2019ve got the information you need to have. But thank you all, be well. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to Jackie Burka McConagha, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jackie McConagha : Good morning, everyone. We are all truly heartbroken by the recent unexpected passing of our President and CEO, Arne Sorenson. He was an exceptional visionary leader but more importantly an exceptional human being. He will be deeply missed. As you are aware, Arne decided to reduce his schedule to fully focus on his health earlier this month, in consultation with the board Arne asked Stephanie Linnartz, the Group President of Consumer Operations, Technology and Emerging Businesses, and Tony Capuano, Group President of Global Development, Design and Operation Services, two longtime members of our leadership team to jointly oversee the company's day to day operation. Stephanie and Tony will continue in this capacity until our board appoints a new President and CEO, which is expected to occur in the next two weeks. Stephanie and Tony are joining us on our call this morning. As usual, we have Leeny Oberg, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Betsy Don, our Vice President, Investor Relations with us as well. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts, and are considered forward looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comment. Statements and our comments in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, or revPAR and occupancy comments reflect system wide constant currency year-over-year changes for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. Like all of you, my heart is very heavy on Arne's passing. I feel incredibly fortunate to have worked with such a wonderful and talented leader and to count Arne as a good friend. So many of you have reached out to us with your condolences for his family and for Marriott. And you've shared your fond memories of him. And we've been comforted by your kind words. Stephanie, Tony and I wanted to share a few stories with you about Arne as well this morning. In hospitality business work inherently includes a lot of travel. Those days when Arne was on the road, he would lead an early morning group run around the hotels neighborhood with his many associates as we're interested. As a fellow runner, I would join the crew and watch Arne somehow find a way to spend time with every runner in the group, to run ahead with the quick runners and then run back to the walkers and find a way to connect with each and every person, would ask them about their families, their roles at Marriott, and their points of view about their markets. The run would be over at 6 :30. And then he would move on to a full day of meetings and at least five more hotel tours. You could tell he fed on these connections with people and that he cared about them deeply. I've learned so much from him, and I'll miss him tremendously. We're all committed to honoring our incredible leader by building on his legacy. And we of course want to update you on our business this morning as we move the company forward. Today, we will cover our usual earnings called topics with Stephanie focusing on the customer and demand side of the business. And Tony discussing our room's growth and development trends. I'll cover our financial results in liquidity. Given the uncertainty around the pace of vaccinations, and therefore demand recovery, we will not be providing earnings guidance today. We will however, share what we can about our outlook for 2021 and a few key areas. We'll plan to take your questions after our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn it over to Stephanie. Stephanie Linnartz : Thank you, Leeny and good morning. This week we lost a wonderful friend and mentor. Arne was an incredible leader, both for Marriott and the industry. And he was fun in a competitive way. Like Leeny I also remember the countless times we ran together and he would always beat me, always. But what I will remember the most about Arne was his humility, his lack of ego and his passion for developing others. Arne and I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos together for the past six years. The first year I attended, I went to everything with Arne taking it all in and learning so much from all of his interactions. The second year we went pretty much as soon as we arrived, he pushed me out of the nest, so to speak. He encouraged me to schedule my own meetings and do my own media interviews. He believed I was ready. And in typical Arne fashion, he empowered me to grow. He knew what was best for me and for the company. That's the true leadership is believing in your team and helping your teammates believe in themselves. I am honored to have worked with him and we are all committed to building on his legacy. I know Arne would want us to talk about business. So let me start this off. COVID-19 has impacted our business to an extent we never imagined making 2020 by far the most challenging year in our company's history. Full year worldwide revPAR declined 60% with average occupancy of just over 35% compared to 73% for full year 2019. In 2020, occupancy and year-over-year revPAR changes showed steady improvement from the trough in April through the summer and into the early fall. However, with spikes in COVID cases in many markets around the world, we saw the global pace of recovery flattened in the fourth quarter, and in the first few weeks of 2021. Currently, over 94% of our hotels are open. Recovery trajectories to date have varied greatly by region. Mainland China, where there has generally been a sense that the virus is under control has led to recovery and strongly exemplifies the resiliency of demand. Occupancy reached 60% in July and remained above that level to the end of 2020. Fourth quarter revPAR in Mainland China was only down 12% year-over-year. We saw additional proof points have the ability for demand to recover quickly in other areas as well during the fourth quarter, including the Maldives and Dubai.  Occupancy in both markets jumped to over 60% in December, after their government's ease travel entry restrictions. In the fourth quarter, many countries around the world reinstituted strict temporary limitations on traveling and gathering to combat rising virus cases. Demand in the US was clearly sensitive to spikes in COVID cases and government travel advisories. As we saw during the traditionally travel heavy holiday period from Thanksgiving through New Year. Many cities in Europe also shut down. Similarly in China, we have recently seen several markets essentially unlocked down in January and February for several weeks at a time in order to fight the spread of the virus, leading to a meaningful drop in occupancy in these markets. Overall occupancy in mainland China year-to-date has fallen to an average of around 40%. The good news is that once these temporary shutdowns are lifted, we have seen demand return quickly. For example, occupancy in Chengdu and Qingdao recently jumped from around 20% to over 60% in just two weeks after their local governments announced the virus outbreaks were under control and remove travel restrictions. Our worldwide occupancy and year-over-year revPAR declined in January were roughly the same as we saw in December. Looking ahead to the rest of 2021, booking windows remain very short, and there is still a large amount of uncertainty. While vaccines are slowly rolling out, the pace is too uncertain to be able to predict when occupancy will move meaningfully higher. But as the year progresses, assuming wider distribution of effective vaccine, we are optimistic that the pace of recovery will pick up speed and accelerate throughout the year. In the US and Canada, we are encouraged to see some small green shoots of increased demand for corporate and leisure transient bookings, as well as in group lead volume. While still down meaningfully year-over-year, transient booking pays and visits to our direct booking sites have been improving recently, occupancy over Presidents Day weekend was the strongest we have had for a long weekend since the beginning of the pandemic led by leisure demand. And we are also starting to see a bit of momentum behind special corporate bookings. Group revenue pays in the US and Canada for 2021 is also still down significantly compared to group revenue pace for 2020 at the same time last year, so the declines are less severe for the second half of the year. In January, we had a very strong month for group bookings in 2022 and beyond. Additionally, this business was booked at average daily rates 11% higher than business booked in January 2020 per stays in 2021 and beyond. These are encouraging signs that there is strong demand for travel in future year once real progress has been made in containing the virus. As we think about marketing in this environment, our teams continue to analyze the latest consumer trends to help shape our recovery strategy. We are keenly focused on personalization and localization on capturing more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur, and on increasingly leveraging our digital direct channels, and in particular, our Marriott Bonvoy app. We recently released our updated redesigned Bonvoy app, with the goal of better meeting the travel shopping needs of today's leisure traveler. The power of the Bonvoy platform has become even more evident during the pandemic, as many of our more than 147 million members has continued to interact with us in ways other than staying in our hotel. Our Marriott Bonvoy credit card holders have remained particularly engaged. Global credit card spending on our cards for 2020 was down only 16% year-over-year, and marked contrast to the steeper decline in revPAR. And while not material from a financial perspective, one of the most significant expanded offerings to members recently has been our whole home rental platform, Homes & Villas by Marriott International or HVMI, we grew the number of units on the platform from around 2,000 at launch less than two years ago to approximately 25,000 today We saw increased demand from our Marriott Bonvoy members with over 90% of HVMI roommates in 2020 booked by members. We continue to focus on driving demand to our hotels, and engaging with our members with creative content and special offers, including our escape to luxury, and Bonvoy escapes promotions. Additionally, early last year, we extended elite member status through early 2022. And we recently credited their accounts with another deposit of elite night credits to give them a head start towards elite status in 2022. Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to thank our incredible team of associates around the world who have shown true dedication and resilience throughout these challenging times. Tony? Tony Capuano : Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning. Arne was a remarkable person, and I'm proud to call him a friend and mentor. One of my favorite trips with him sums up how truly special and unique he really was. After we acquired Starwood in 2016, Arne wanted his senior leadership team to do an eight day whirlwind trip around the world. He wanted to visit as many properties as we could to welcome our new associates and show them that the Marriott people first culture was real. And he wanted each of us there with him. As we toured property after property, already made a point to meet as many people as possible, to shake every hand and to look each person he met in the eye. He was so sincere and genuine. He also made sure to spend time with his leadership team outside of these meetings. In particular, I remember one overnight flight to the Middle East. Towards morning, Arne woke us all up and brought us to the lounge in the back of the plane. So we could just spend time together and enjoy each other's company. This was classic Arne. He wanted to build a cohesive team that was not afraid of some spirited debate, truly liked and respected each other. And it worked. Our jobs are infinitely easier because we're all rowing in the same direction. Now being the humble person that he was, I think Arne would say that we need to move on to the business. So let me now talk about our room's growth. In 2020, we added nearly 63,000 rooms worldwide for room's growth of 4.6% on a gross basis. Room openings in the year were impacted by slower construction timelines, and supply chain issues, as well as some owners temporarily waiting to open their hotels due to COVID-19. Asia Pacific was the one region where we open more rooms in 2020 than we did in 2019. Adding over 18,000 rooms with gross room's growth of over 8% versus year in 2019. In China, we recently opened our 50th Hotel in Shanghai, the JW Marriott Shanghai Function, and a phenomenal accomplishment as our international growth continues to strengthen. On a net basis, including deletions of 1.5%, our global distribution grew by 3.1% year-over-year. Deletions were generally in line with the average levels we've seen over the last three years, despite a number of hotels exiting our system for COVID-19 related reasons. While signings for full year 2020 were not as robust as we had expected at the beginning of the year. Our overall pipeline continues to lead the industry totaling over 498,000 rooms at year end. We also benefited from continued momentum in our residential branding business, and had another strong year for residential signings, a testament to the power of our brands. For the full year 2021, assuming progress is made and containing the virus, we expect gross room's growth to accelerate to approximately 6%. While we have seen some delayed construction starts and could continue to see some delays in openings, 46% of our pipeline is already under construction. Additionally, we anticipate benefiting from the backlog of openings that were pushed from 2020 into this year. We also expect to see a meaningful impact from conversions this year, as owners and their lenders seek the incremental top and bottom line benefits from being part of the Marriott system. We are extremely pleased with our recently announced conversion deal in [Cawa] that is expected to add 19 resorts and nearly 7,000 rooms to our all inclusive portfolio. Our biggest deal yet in Cawa, these hotels fit perfectly with our focus on leisure currently the strongest segment of demand. And while they were not in our year end pipeline, these properties are all anticipated to join our system during 2020. Let's now shift to our 2021 outlook. for net room's growth, not including the approximate 100 basis point one time headwind from the 89 Service Properties Trust or SPC mostly limited service hotels that are leaving our system by the end of March, we expect deletions of 1.5% to 2%. That's slightly higher than we have experienced recently, due to the potential for more COVID-19 related exits. Coupled with our gross room's growth expectation, we expect net room's growth of roughly 3% to 3.5%, including the exiting SPC rooms. We have already received interest from multiple owners about new deals in those markets, and look forward to the opportunity to replace many of the first generation limited service SPC hotels with newer product. A key component of our demand recovery strategy is remaining keenly focused on the health and safety of our guests and associates. We first introduced our heightened cleanliness standards in April of last year. Since then, we've been increasingly leveraging contactless technologies such as mobile and web check in, mobile key and mobile chat to reimagine the guest stay experience for this environment. Last month, we began rolling out additional health protocol options for group meetings at certain properties, including on site temperature checks, and providing for COVID testing capabilities. We've also remained focused on working closely with our owner and franchisee community to help them navigate these challenging times and have taken many steps to significantly lower their costs in this environment. These steps include waiving FFE contributions for most hotels with lender concern, reducing certain fixed charges for programs and services and extending the delay on renovations. We are also working with hotels on payment plans when necessary, and we are very pleased that the vast majority of our hotels are paying their bills. I also wanted to acknowledge our associates this morning. They have exemplified the Marriott culture throughout the pandemic. Whether it's looking after first responders, prepping meals for those in needs, or hosting blood drives at our hotels. They are a remarkable team and we could not be more proud. I will now turn the call back over to Leeny to talk about our fourth quarter financials in more detail. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. In the fourth quarter of 2020, worldwide revPAR declined 64% with occupancy of 35%. As Stephanie noted Mainland China continued to lead the recovery. Leisure remains the strongest driver of demand in Mainland China. And in the fourth quarter stays in the leisure segment were up double digits year-over-year for the second quarter in a row. Business transient group demand in the region also continued to rebound well in the fourth quarter. And we've been pleased to see this evidence of pent-up demand across all travel segments. In fact, group stays comprised around 20% of overall room nights in the fourth quarter back in line 2019 distribution. Demand in the rest of Asia Pacific also continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with occupancy reaching 35%, up 10 percentage points from the third quarter, primarily driven by domestic leisure travel in Australia, South Korea and Japan as well as economic reopening efforts in countries like the Maldives and India. In the US and Canada, leisure and drive to destinations remained the strongest markets throughout the fourth quarter. RevPAR declined 65% in the quarter in line with a year-over-year third quarter decline, with occupancy of 35% just below third quarter's level of 37%. The seasonal decline in occupancy that typically happens during the fourth quarter was less pronounced in 2020. Given the overall lower level of business travel. Trends in EMEA were mixed. Fourth quarter occupancy in the Middle East and Africa reached 36%, an 11 percentage point improvement from third quarter, reflecting strong domestic leisure demand in many major markets in the Middle East. The recovery in Europe took a step back in the last few months of 2020 as most countries re-imposed restrictions after major second waves of the virus. During the fourth quarter, roughly one third of our hotels in Europe were temporarily closed and occupancy fell to 15%. In [Cala] around 20% of hotels were closed during the fourth quarter resort properties, particularly in Mexico drove an improvement in occupancy to 24% in the region, up from 15% in the third quarter with global revPAR down 64%, our fourth quarter gross fee revenues totaled $423 million, a decline of 57% versus the year ago quarter, largely in line with the year-over-year decline we saw in the third quarter. Over 60% of the $44 million of fourth quarter incentive management fees were earned in Asia Pacific, of which three quarters were earned in Greater China. Over 95% of our hotels in Greater China had positive gross operating profit in the fourth quarter, with over 90%, generating positive profits for the full year. These results reflect the strong rebounding demand when the virus is under better control and our ability to help our owners control costs. Within franchise fees our non revPAR related franchise fees continued to be resilient, totaling $133 million in the fourth quarter, down 15% from the year ago quarter, with credit card branding fees down 18%. Fourth quarter G&A improved by 31% year-over-year, reflecting our significant cost reduction efforts. In the fourth quarter, our total income tax provision was a benefit of $150 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of pre acquisition Starwood tax audit. We reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $317 million down 65% versus the fourth quarter of last year essentially the same decline as in the third quarter. I'll now turn to cash burn as we've described on prior calls, our monthly cash burn rate was only slightly negative in the fourth quarter even with revPAR down 64%. The impact of the company's $130 million 401-k match payment in October and higher cash interest due to the timing of payments will partially offset by continued strong receivables collection efforts and robust loyalty cash flows. We've been pleased with the strength of our cash generation in 2020 in light of the dramatic reduction in revenues. Our full year financial show net cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 billion, which included the one time $920 million of proceeds from our amended co brand credit card agreements; subtracting out the $920 million as well as all investment spending, we still generated positive operating cash flow, a strong performance in the year when revPAR was down 60%. These results show the true power of our asset light business model, and are a testament to our company's ability to quickly and effectively adapt to a significant and rapid change in demand. Loyalty was a key piece of the equation generating over $500 million of net cash flow in 2020 after being a net user of cash in 2019. This year's positive cash generation from loyalty is on top of our credit card related fees including an EBITDA, as well as the $920 million of cash received from our amended co brand credit card agreements. The loyalty program benefited from strong cash inflows from our credit card programs given the resilience of consumer credit card spending. While the loyalty programs operating cost and redemption expenses were down significantly. Redemption expenses were much lower than usual in terms of both volume of nights, and the rate paid hotels for redemptions given the low occupancy environment. At the end of the fourth quarter, our net liquidity was approximately $4.4 billion after the pay down of over $600 million of debt during the quarter. The company's net liquidity represents roughly $800 million in available cash balances, plus $3.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. We believe our liquidity position and resilient cash flow from operations comfortably positioned us to meet our short and long-term obligations. I also want to briefly discuss the $243 million fourth quarter charge related to the Sheraton Grand Chicago put shortly after the Starwood deal closed, we granted the hotel owner a one time right to put the leasehold interest in Marriott in 2022 for $300 million in cash. Given the current environment, we have determined the put is likely to be exercised so we increased our liability. We have the right to defer the closing on the put until late 2024. Moving on to full year 2021, while we won't be giving revPAR or earnings guidance, I'll provide a bit of color on certain items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line at current revPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a one point change in revPAR compared to 2019 revPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. Please note that given the nominal level of revPAR in 2020, the impact of a one percentage point change in 2021 revPAR compared to 2020 revPAR could be more like $15 million to 20 million. As we saw throughout 2020, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMS and the inclusion of non revPAR related franchise fees as well. In order for us to start earning IMS in the US and other markets where IMS stand aside to owner priorities, we'll need to see substantial improvement in revPAR levels. We anticipate that the majority of IMS in 2021 will again be earned in international markets. We expect our non revPAR related fees to remain resilient and show strong year-over-year growth in 2021. We expect G&A to total $775 million to $800 million in 2021. Note that the cash component of G&A will be lower than this range given non cash stock compensation. Interest expenses anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. Turning to several other major items that will impact cash flow, our cash taxes are expected to be $275 million to $300 million for full year 2021. Investment spending, excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the full year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time for total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. Approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance CapEx in our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. We expect cash flows from the loyalty program to be roughly neutral in 2021 even after the reduced payments we will receive from the co brand and credit card companies that effectively repay roughly one third of the $920 million received in 2020.  In closing, while the timing of a full recovery is unpredictable, we are optimistic that we will see notable progress over the course of this year. We've seen real evidence of the pent-up demand for travel. And we look forward to welcoming more and more guests to our hotels. We will now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. ShaunKelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess I just like to start by offering my most heartfelt condolences to the Sorenson and Marriott family and team regarding Arne's passing. I think we all appreciate the stories and memories that everyone shared on the call. And we're all better people for having gotten to spend time with him. So you will be warmly remembered and greatly missed by all of us. If I could turn pinch -- if I could turn attention maybe to some of the comments and appreciate all the color that the team has put together this morning. Yes, I think maybe a good place to start would be to refer to some of Stephanie's remarks around some of the green shoots that she alluded to, and that we're starting to see in the travel environment. So Stephanie, if possible I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of your comments around the group booking position as we move across the year if you could help to give us a little bit more on that. And then specifically the rate commentary, you mentioned the up 11% if you can help us unpack that a little bit. I think that's highly encouraging and a little different than we might expect to see in a different hotel environment or a different cycle. StephanieLinnartz: Sure, of course, and good morning, Shaun. So as it relates to our group business. We are encouraged to see some really positive trends as I mentioned in the prepared remarks at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, our group pace for 2021 it was down negative 57%. But the second half of the year was down just 25% to 30%. We're also on the group front seeing some positive trends as it relates to group canceled; they've really slowed for the second half of 2021. And they are at normal levels for 2022 plus. We're also seeing some great trends on lead volume. While it's certainly behind 2019, it's improving. As a matter of fact, over the last 45 days, lead volume has increased 20 to 30 percentage points. So in a significant improvement from what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. The other thing I note on the group home, we're starting to see a pickup in what I'd call more normal types of groups. So as an example, we're starting to see some incentive meetings book in the fourth quarter of this year. And to your question about rate, yes, January was not only a strong booking month, which was terrific, actually the best month we've had in a couple years, but the rate was up on for futures 11%. And you should know most of those groups that were booked into the future years, those higher rates were in house group versus city wise, we haven't quite seen citywide bookings come back yet. So I think that the story on the group front just underscores the point that there will be a return to meetings and group business and it may be slower than we would like. But we're seeing that we're seeing the demand and as you can imagine, Shaun we are talking to our customers all the time meeting planners our top accounts, and they all want to get back out on the road and on -- and travel. We're also seeing in China some quite positive things on the group front. As a matter of fact, the bookings in China, group bookings were up to 20% of our room nights, again, which was encouraging. China's a great story, it shows that there's pent-up demand for travel. Six weeks after this firework was announced in China, people started booking roommates again, started with leisure, but then quickly towards as the year moved on moved to both business travel and group. And of course, much of it, most of it was domestic, but still strong demand. So we're very encouraged as to what we're saying on the group front. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. JoeGreff: Good morning, everybody. I'd like to offer my condolences as well. Arne was obviously a talented executives and everybody respected him for what he's done over the years at Marriott for the lodging industry, but I remember him is just being a good man and how he treated everybody so respectfully and something to aspire to for everybody else. So I know it's a big loss for you guys. So I just wanted to mention that. So my question is for you, Tony, I was I was hoping on the gross room to outlook commentary for this year, if you can go through the composition of the gross rooms, how much of it? Is conversions, how much of it is new construction and of the new construction, I guess how much of it is pre-COVID vintage versus any limited service? New construction that maybe thinks about is commencing since March of last year? And then as you think about investments spent for the balance of what's in the pipeline next to the 2021 gross room's openings. Do you think that accelerates in 2022 and beyond relative to what you're spending this year? TonyCapuano: Great. Well, first of all, thank you for your kind sentiments, most appreciated. I think as we think about 2021 openings, obviously, we've indicated in our prepared remarks and acceleration to about 6% gross openings. And to state the obvious, there's more limited visibility than we've had into the markets, pre-COVID. But there are a number of factors, I think that give us some measure of comfort that support our guidance. I think number one, we've got about 230,000 rooms under construction around the world as we sit here today. You also heard us talk a little bit about the Sunwing all inclusive projects, adding 7,000 rooms that give us almost 100 basis points of growth in gross openings in 2021. To your point there were a number of hotels under construction last year that had been targeted for 2020 openings, and they slipped principally because of COVID related construction delays and we expect a significant number of those hotels to open in 2021. And then I think the last thing I would say is that while it's certainly early days, we're only 10 or 11 weeks into the year, we're seeing some encouraging signs related to accelerating conversions activity. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2020, about 21% of our signings were conversions. And that was the highest percentage contribution from conversions that we had seen since the first quarter of 2019. And so we did go back and take a look at some previous cycles. And in fact, it's the last peak, we saw conversions spike all the way up to about 24% of total signings. And I think that's quite encouraging as well. The only other thing I would add, Joe is that also gives us some measure of comfort. We've seen from quarter-to-quarter since the pandemic started a relatively steady level of rooms under construction. And obviously, we've shared that with you and each of the quarterly calls. LeenyOberg: And Joe when you think about on the investment front, obviously, as you're adding more rooms on a relative basis to 2020, you see a little bit more investment but when you think about the kind of classic typical investment, either per deal or per average key and a full year, I would say we're not seeing any sort of meaningful increase in the amount of investment that we're needed to put into deals. And obviously, when you look at our pipeline, for example, in the US, which is 80%, limited service they're typically the investment is far less. And so I think while you would expect that our investment will increase a bit relative to the really low 2020 levels, I would not expect it to see it take kind of meaningful step up relative to the overall numbers of rooms. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. ThomasAllen: Hey, good morning, and let me just echo my condolences to Arne's family and all of you at Marriott. As analysts, we were lucky enough to watch him as an incredible CEO, and experienced him as an amazing leader. And just it will be truly missed. So for me, can we just talk about the all inclusive strategy a bit more? In 2019, you announced the Elegant Hotels acquisition and you've been intermittently announcing some more organic growth. And then that was the announcement this week, or last week about with Sunwing. Can you just talk about what you've been learning so far as you've kind of built up this business? Thank you. TonyCapuano: Sure. Thank you, Thomas. I think maybe I'll talk a little bit about all inclusive from a growth and a deal side. And then I might ask Stephanie to chime in from a demand and a leisure perspective. On the transaction side, As we talked about, when we launched into the all inclusive space, it was frustrating for us to see the pace of growth in the all inclusive space, certainly in [Cala] but even in Southeast Asia and some of the Eastern European resort markets and not to have a platform to compete for those opportunities. Since our launch, the market reaction from the development community has been quite significant. I think one of the things that give us so much enthusiasm about the Sunwing announcement, beyond of the fact that it's great, rapid increase in our footprint. It has accelerated the volume of inquiries we're getting about new opportunities, particularly on the conversion side. And Sunwing is a terrific partner for us. They have been in the all inclusive space much longer than we have. And we think it is going to be a very symbiotic relationship where we both have a lot to teach each other. Stephanie, maybe you can chime in with a little bit on leisure demand. StephanieLinnartz: Yes, sure. Absolutely. We are really excited to see are offering them all inclusive properties grow for our consumers on leisure demand is very -- is the strongest segment right now. And it is also leisure is as a segment overall growing even faster than business travel. So we see a lot of runway for continued leisure demand. What we're most excited about with our all inclusive properties is we're going to have on properties across seven of our brands, seven of our premium and luxury brands. And it's going to be a terrific offering particularly for our Marriott Bonvoy members. It is really anything that makes the Marriott Bonvoy programs stickier and more engaging is great for our business. So whether it's growing our all inclusive business, HVMI, of course are terrific leisure properties around the world. We just see the growth of all inclusive is a great proposition for our consumers. ThomasAllen: And then just sticking on the development front in the past, you used to do about one bolt-on acquisition a year, they can delta or -- Gaylord is the current environment, creating opportunities, and how do you think about balancing it with your balance sheet? Thanks. TonyCapuano: Sure. I think there are lots of conversations. I think from where I sit, I'll be surprised if there is a high volume of activity because I think buyer and seller pricing expectations are still out of alignment. And I think there may be some distressed circumstances where transactions occur. But I do think that gap is significant. I will -- we will continue to look and if we see something that makes sense, we'll use the same lens that we've always applied to the evaluation of bolt-on acquisitions. Does it fill a gap for us in terms of either geographic distribution or segment? And are the economics compelling? Also, maybe the last fine point I would put on that not only for individual hotel transactions, but for M&A transactions. The financing markets are challenging at best. And I think that will have some cooling effect potentially on the volume of M&A deals you see in the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. StephenGrambling: Good morning. I also want to share my condolences to everyone on the call, as well as the entire Marriott and Sorenson family. We will miss Arne's voice, his openness and his outrageously pretty fast response time and emails, which I guess is just another size ability to connect everyone. So Leeny you mentioned G&A in the $775 million to $800 million range, can you help us think about the different levers of costs that were removed? And how we may expect somebody to return perhaps in 2022 and beyond a more robust recovery? And as a related follow up how do you think about permanent reductions in management costs or charge outs to owners that could also bolster margins for them and allow you to recapture IMS at a lower bound revPAR? LeenyOberg: Yes, sure, thanks. So first of all, on the corporate G&A front when you look at these levels, compared to the 2019 levels, you're looking at a high teen reduction in comparison, and you do need to remember that both of those numbers include bad debt. And while in the long run bad debt is a cash cost, it is kind of in the year for the year often not a cash cost, because it's a reserve taken. And again, it's a little bit hard to predict exactly where that'll go in 2021. I think you would normally expect in this environment, it might be a little bit higher than normal levels. And certainly in 2019, it was not even anything to worry about. But overall, I would say from a cash perspective, you would see that our cash costs on a G&A front with this $775 million to $800 million is that reduction is a bit higher than the high teens sort of number that I've described on the expense line. And when I think about it going forward, Steven, I would say a couple things. First of all, obviously, I would expect that some will need to be added back as we move forward into a much improved picture for our industry. But I will also say that we undertook some work in 2020. That was while extraordinarily painful and difficult, I think was a reflection that we view that it will take some time for the industry to recover. And we really need to put ourselves in a position where we could make these cost savings last a very long time, if not permanently. So while you could see costs go up more than inflation, I think you will see most of these savings be sustainable. And similarly on the hotel front we've done a lot of work to do things that are both temporary and sustainable on the cost front. We've obviously done some temporary reductions in fixed costs at the hotel level; we've obviously done some again really painful work in the way of furloughs, et cetera. But we've also done some really innovative things around how to better staff the hotels how to better get our work done, how to manage some of the programmatic costs that go to the hotels. And I think those, again will be sustainable. When I think about in 2021, what we've tried to do is gone to as much of the margins that we had in 2019 as possible. So while I think the hotel margins will obviously suffer from a reduction in revenues compared to 2019, at the hotel level, we did we think we have been able to save the vast majority of that margin decline through the work that we've done. And then obviously, as we move into a much more normal picture, there will be sustainable savings that allow us to get to a profitability point that returns back to where it was much quicker. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. SmedesRose: Hey, good morning, our condolences as well as regarding Arne and just thinking about him, it just seems like he's always struck me as a man with such kind of grace, and that it's just really sad that he's not with us anymore. But I wanted to ask you really just a little bit more about the relationship with owners who may be facing financial stress. And what, if anything Marriott is doing I guess in terms of concessions or delayed payments or any other kinds of relief and whether some of those might be permanent? LeenyOberg: Sure. I talked the question before about some substantive work that we've done to try to match the cost with the revenue decline in the short term, and again, try to make a bunch of it sustainable, but overwhelmingly, our owners are paying us and we've had tremendous success in collecting our receivables. Most hotels have reopened. And obviously, amongst the select service hotels, quite a few of them are actually cash flow positive. We have arranged payment plans for a large number of our hotels. And when you think about it typically, Smedes, they pay us in 30 days, and to be able to stretch that out over several months is a big help. And we're seeing there, again, overwhelmingly that they are making payments on those payment plans. And while they're obviously we need to get back to where there's substantial recovery to get them to a much better spot. For the moment, they are hanging in there, and they are able to pay some down and work with us to be able to navigate through this time. But I do agree with you, we are paying incredible attention to our costs on property and working with the owners to try to find ways to do even more. And a lot of this depends on what the owner's particular situation is too in terms of how well capitalized, what is the debt structure, and what kind of market they're in. But overwhelmingly, we have seen really strong performance and the newest information about the PPP loan extension and expansion, as well as whatever may come from a stimulus bill, hopefully will be added benefit to them as well. SmedesRose: Okay, thank you. And then I just wanted to ask you on the agreement with Sunwing, did Marriott pay any upfront money for those properties come into the system? And also, did the owner agree to invest in the incremental CapEx or do you feel like they are kind of ready to go? LeenyOberg: Well, I'll take the first one. And then I'm going to turn it over to Tony for the second one. And we would never get into specifics on a particular deal. But I can tell you that this was a very, very capital light deal. I'll just leave it there. TonyCapuano: And I think similarly on the second half of your question, these are terrific physical assets. There are some modest renovation requirements. But these are pretty conversion ready assets that we're excited to get into the system and start welcoming of our Bonvoy guest. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust Securities. PatrickScholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Certainly our deepest condolences to both the Sorenson and Marriott families. Obviously it goes without saying; we will deeply miss him very much. Question for you, you talked about 94% of your hotels at the end of the year, open and find 6% not open. How might you think or what do you internally think about the trajectory of reopenings? And I assume those are mostly urban top 25 hotels, correct? StephanieLinnartz: Well, so let me help you a little bit here. Thank you, Patrick. And we appreciate your thoughts. So first of all, in US and Canada, we're only talking 3% of the hotels. So only 159 in all of North America, the biggest concentration is in Europe, where 34% of themselves are closed. And then also in Caribbean, Latin America, where 11% of the hotels are closed. So I would say there, there can be some true structural reasons why in those markets, government regulations, actually, in some cases require that the hotels be closed. So I think one of the things that we've all learned over the last year is that in many cases, even down at levels of 10% to 15%, occupancy, a hotel can be better off being open, than it is closed from a cash flow perspective. And we began done everything we can, most of our charges, as you know are based on revenues. So that floats with the occupancy. So I think in general, we would, as you see, things start to pick up a little bit. Hopefully, as the vaccinations continue to progress even more than you will start to see these remaining closed hotels open up. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Robin Farley of UBS. RobinFarley: Great. Thank you. Please let me add my condolences on Arne's loss. I am very sad obviously; he was such an unfailingly kind person. So let me add my condolences. My question is on the unit growth topic. I know conversions visibility is kind of more limited maybe only within the next few months and removals kind of similarly. But when we think about growth unit additions from kind of new construction that would happen next year in 2022. A lot of that would probably be underway or have to be underway already now. So I guess I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on the gross unit additions for 2022. In another words, you're trying to get a feel for whether how much of the acceleration in growth additions in 2021 is the opening pickup pushed from 2020 to 2021. And kind of what that may look like past that the impact of those openings sliding into 2021. Thank you. TonyCapuano: Thank you, Robin. As I said in response to one of the earlier questions, state the obvious the there's a lot less visibility into the future than we've had prior to the pandemic. I think beyond 2021, we're going to need to get a bit further into the economic recovery. And to see how quickly the financing markets rebound. And how quickly construction starts begin to pick up. As I said, we do have 230,000 rooms under construction. But it is interesting as I talk with our transactors around the world; the good news is we're generally not seeing much in the way of fallout of under construction projects from the pipeline. I think if there's going to be an impact; it will likely be further impact on the length of the construction cycle. And so it's a little tough to know what that looks like in 2022. I am hopeful that in the next couple quarters that visibility will improve a little bit. But I just don't think we've got great visibility beyond 2021 at this point. RobinFarley: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks. I was actually surprising how many rooms are under construction very similar to what it was a year ago. And actually, given everything that's gone on, I would have thought that new starts would have made that number lower but it it's fairly consistent and it's only 1,000 rooms different than a year ago. So that's why it seemed potentially encouraging for 2022 but -- TonyCapuano: We agree that's one of the statistics we've been watching. And to your point it's quite encouraging that we've seen such stability in the volume of under construction rooms around the world. RobinFarley: And then just one quick follow up, can you give a little more color around the put option? It's just -- when you -- we normally look at your, what's added back for restructuring or for acquisition costs related to Starwood obviously, that production is a significant amount. So just a little bit of color around that. Thank you. StephanieLinnartz: Yes, sure. Absolutely. Yes we always say we're overwhelmingly done with the integration. And we're kind of hopeful that this is the last bid. But when we acquired the company, Starwood management agreements for the Sheraton Grand Chicago in the Western Times Square included very broad cross brand territorial, which actually, when you think about it, that for the rest of our 28 brands, we were severely limited in those areas. So soon after we did the deal, we entered into a settlement agreement with a hotel owner, where basically, we granted that owner a one time right to put the leasehold interest in the hotel to Marriott in 2022, for $300 million in cash. Now, it's worth noting that there is a ground lease underneath this hotel, we actually don't have to buy that if we want to buy that land, we'll have the right to for an additional $200 million. But it is worth noting that there is a ground lease on the hotel as well. But this is providing the interest in the hotel. The other interesting part is that, given the current economic conditions, we believe that the put is probable of being exercised. And as a result, we need it to reflect what we think is the current value. And obviously all these markets are struggling. And that resulted in this charge. The other thing that's worth noting is that we actually have the right to not actually close on the put until late 2024. So even though it could get put to us in 2022, we wouldn't necessarily have to buy it until the end of 2024. And so it's actually worth noting that also part of the impairment that we had in the contract amortization line reflects the fact that frankly, right now, if you ask us, we would expect that we would defer that purchase until the end of 2024. And continue to manage the hotel until the end of 2024 to take into consideration the fact that we don't buy it until then. The other part that I guess I'll add is that since that agreement was signed, we've actually added 4,000 rooms in the Chicago and New York markets. So while it is painful, and clearly a direct result of COVID. We do think that in the broad picture, it's really important for us to be able to have the capability to expand our brands and that really important market. RobinFarley: And as the value of the hotel improves over the next two years or between now and late 2024. You would reverse some of the loss I would assume value that's being run through. StephanieLinnartz: Yes. Obviously, you've got to look at that every single quarter. And we would but this was question of a whole lot of different factors as we move over the next few years, but fundamentally, yes, you're right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. VinceCiepiel: Great thanks. I also wanted to express my sympathy to Arne's family and the Marriott team. He certainly will be missed. I had a question on leisure. You mentioned the favorable trend lines there expectations for outperformance in that segment for some time meeting that demand with the all inclusive offering. I wanted to dig more into your homes and villas. Just curious how you think you're progressing there? What do you think about the trend lines and demand for short term rentals as we live in an increasingly remote world, and how you think you're meeting the needs of those around 150 million loyalty members in terms of their interest, an appetite for short term rentals. StephanieLinnartz: Great. Well, thank you, Vince for that question. Yes. We really are excited about HVMI primarily as an offering for our Marriott family members. We launched that business in 2019 with about 2,000 homes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and the reason we launched the businesses, we were talking to our Marriott Bonvoy member, an eight out of 10 of them said not only-- not that they were just thinking about renting a home, but they actually had done it through another platform. So we knew it was an offering they wanted that we didn't have. And we knew it would be complimentary to our core hotel business. So we launched the business in 2019, we've grown to 25,000 homes, there is about a couple million homes in the segment in which we play in, I think it's really important when we talk about HVMI to make some distinctions from other platforms. First of all, we only have whole homes. We also, it's not an open platform, like some of the other players; you can't just put a home on there. We only work with professional housing management companies. And we have very, very strict standards about what type of premium and luxury homes will allow on the platform standards around amenities, design aesthetic, service levels, on safety, security, et cetera. So we are very strict about which homes get on the platform. And one of the most important things about HVMI is you can earn loyalty points and burn oil loyalty points there. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks that 90% of our bookings are coming from loyalty members and also 30% of the bookings on redemptions, people are redeeming their Marriott Bonvoy points. And we saw the business do well, particularly during last summer because people wanted a whole home 40% of our HVMI destinations are actually new to Marriott there where we don't have hotels, and many of them are in more remote locations, which really was quite attractive during COVID. So we're excited about the offering and we see it as complimentary to our core business and a tremendous value proposition for Marriott Bonvoy members. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Dori Kesten of Wells Fargo Securities. DoriKesten: Good morning, everyone. I also wanted to offer my condolences. Arne was really one of a kind that will be sorely missed. I was wondering I guess this is for Leeny. How important is it for Marriott internally to return to share purchases and or dividends? And is there anything beyond your leverage target that we should be using as a timeline guide? LeenyOberg: No, I don't think so. I think obviously, the stability of the marketplace will be important. I am kind of assuming that we continue on the beginnings of this recovery and get to a much more stable place. I think we clearly have to recognize that it will take us a little while to get back to where our leverage ratios or where we want them to be. And we will need to be considering whether the market is as stable as it was from 2012 through 2019. When you think about the volatility of our cash flows, but I think broadly speaking, looking at our business model, and the way we generate cash, that I think the fundamental strategy is still the same, which is grow absolutely the best way we can, with really efficient use of capital, resulting in a business model that generates significant excess cash over and above what we need to reinvest in the business. And in that respect, we would look forward to returning to both modest dividends and share repurchase. DoriKesten: Okay, thanks. And Stephanie and as a follow up, if you look out three years, how would you expect your exposure to leisure business transient and group to have shifted or you have the belief that will eventually return to the distribution that we had over the last few years? StephanieLinnartz: Yes, when we look medium, longer term past COVID. We think there is robust demand for travel across all segments, leisure, business travel, group meetings. There could be some slight shifts here and there. But again, as I mentioned, we -- when this disease when COVID gets under control, we see the demand come back. And we're already on the business travel side. We're seeing -- we're starting to see green shoots, our special corporate bookings in January in the month for the month were the best that we've seen since last fall. And when we look at the bookings from our corporate accounts further out, we're seeing them tick up each week, particularly from accounting and consulting firms and technology companies. So again, post COVID we see robust travel demand across all segments, again, could there be some shifts here and there? Yes. But we're quite bullish on the overall outlook. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon of Macquaire. ChadBeynon: Hi, good morning. I'd also like to offer my condolences as well, we all learned so much from Arne. And he was such a kind person to all of us. So thank you. Tony, somewhat of a hypothetical, but how do you think domestic price integrity in ADRs will play out once occupancies improve? I guess, near term in the back half of 2021. And then medium term in 2022, obviously, this is a the higher component of house profit and IMS, was there anything that you saw in China in the fourth quarter in terms of how pricing played out and anything to think about this from prior cycles? StephanieLinnartz: Sure, Chad. I think, this is Stephanie. I'll take that one on pricing. I mean, pricing is really about compression, not trip purpose. And so in normal times, we can get compression from leisure business in our resorts when they're quite busy or special events on and our retail rates, we don't really differ between business and leisure. We do have some negotiated volume discounts for corporate accounts. But the key to pricing really is about occupancy, rebounding. And right now, that's the challenge. I mean in terms of ADR, it fell very steeply in April and May of last year. And that was driven by very low occupancies. And we had caregiver rates in the lake and our hotels, but the occupancy did tick up throughout the year. Of course, it varies market to market. In general, last year, we saw luxury ADR hold up fast with extended stay ADR next and again, it really does get to compression. I think it'll be interesting to watch this recovery. If demand comes back much more quickly than we anticipated, we may be able to grow ADR faster than we did coming out of the last downturn. But again, it's really about -- it's more about impression than it is about a trip purpose. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions and answers. I'll now return the call to Leeny Oberg for additional or closing comments. Leeny Oberg : Thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining this morning. We can't wait to see you out on the road. And thank you again so much for your kind thoughts. Take care. Operator : Thank you for participating in Marriott International Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand today\u2019s conference over to your speaker today Jackie Burka McConagha, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jackie Burka McConagha : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Marriott\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer, Leeny Oberg, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts, and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy and ADR comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR, occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2021 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of March 31, 2021, even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019, or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our investor relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie. As I enter my 26th year with Marriott, I\u2019m honored and humbled to be here this morning for my first earnings call as CEO. The senior leadership team and I have worked together for many years. We are all committed to building on our legacy and advancing the strategy we\u2019ve put in place to navigate the pandemic, drive towards recovery and grow our business. Global RevPAR is currently still substantially below pre-pandemic levels, and certain countries continue to experience concerning levels of COVID cases. Yet more and more people are getting vaccinated every day and demand is rebounding rapidly in some of our largest regions. Over 95% of our hotels are opened globally and we\u2019ve seen overall worldwide occupancy improve every month this year. In March, we saw the largest month over month sequential increase in global occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy reached over 45% up 9 percentage points from occupancy in February. March global RevPAR was down 53% compared to March of 2019, 8 percentage points better than February\u2019s decline. Global occupancy in April rose again to around 48%. RevPAR for April declined roughly 50% compared to the same month in 2019. We remained very encouraged by the strong recovery in Mainland China, while several markets were impacted by strict government mandated lockdowns in January and February of this year. Demand recovered quickly once COVID cases were under control and restrictions were relaxed. Occupancy in March was 66%, almost flat to the same time in 2019. Importantly, despite limited international travel into Mainland China, we saw robust demand from both leisure and business guests in March. Leisure transient room nights were above pre-pandemic levels for the third quarter in a row. Business transient room nights surpassed pre-pandemic levels in March, up 5% versus March 2019. While group room nights in March still trailed the same month in 2019 demand in this segment stepped up significantly after restrictions on large gatherings were lifted mid-month. Seeing these trends in Mainland China, running near pre-pandemic levels gives us confidence in strong full recoveries across all customer segments in other regions as conditions improve. We\u2019ve seen demand pick up quickly and meaningfully in countries with early and swift vaccine rollouts like the U.S., the UAE and Qatar, and in places where airlift has improved or travel restrictions have been relaxed like Mexico, Macau and the U.S. Virgin Islands. While room nights overall are still heavily weighted to leisure, the resilience of demand is clear, and whether it\u2019s from conversations with business leaders, customers, friends or family, we know there is a significant amount of pent-up demand for all types of travel given that so many trips had to be put on hold over the past year. For example, when the EU recently announced that they expect to be open to vaccinated U.S. travelers this summer, our reservation center saw an immediate surge in call volume. In the U.S., occupancy has increased swiftly this year with the acceleration of vaccine rollouts. In March, the U.S. and Canada region had the second highest occupancy behind Greater China at 49%. The domestic rebound is still being primarily led by leisure, transient demand. Special corporate and group bookings in the U.S. and Canada remain meaningfully below pre-pandemic levels, but are slowly recovering. In March, special corporate bookings for all future stays exceeded February\u2019s bookings by 25%, the largest sequential monthly increase in this customer segments since the pandemic began. And special corporate bookings took another nice leg up in April, improving 13% over March. Group bookings for the U.S. and Canada also continue to pick up as meeting planners are increasingly optimistic about the recovery and are feeling more confident that they can plan events, especially in 2022 and beyond. At the end of the first quarter, group revenue on the books for 2022 was down less than 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels as compared to group revenue on the books as of the end of the first quarter of 2019 for 2020. Perhaps more importantly, rates for group room nights booked in the first quarter for 2022 and 2023 are currently 6% and 10% respectively above pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating that we are not trading rate for occupancy. Turning to other regions. Demand continues to improve in the Middle East and Africa. March occupancy reached 45% driven primarily by local leisure staycations, sporting events and room blocks for medical personnel related to vaccine rollouts. The recoveries across Asia Pacific, excluding China or APAC, and the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA had been more uneven. In APAC, strong demand in Australia and the Maldives has been offset by rising COVID cases in other countries like India and Japan. In CALA, while many resort properties are enjoying strong demand, especially from U.S. leisure travelers, urban markets remain challenged. In Europe, given rising COVID cases and strict restrictions in many countries, 25% of the region\u2019s hotels are currently closed, and the recovery has been much more muted. Our marketing teams are employing localized and personalized marketing strategies that utilize our direct channels to help capture more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur. We are especially focused on leveraging our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and on enhancing the platform through new expanded collaborations that help make the program even stickier for 150 million members. Interacting with our members who are not yet ready to stay in a hotel has been a priority for us through the pandemic. Our co-branded credit card holders have been particularly engaged and new card holder acquisitions are improving as well. Helped by popular spending incentives, first quarter global credit card spending was down just 5% versus the first quarter of 2019. We continue to grow our global co-brand portfolio with the recent introduction of new cards in South Korea and in Mexico, bringing the total number of countries with co-brand cards to seven. The early results from these recent launches have been excellent and are a strong testament to the power of our brands and the Bonvoy platform in markets around the world. Another way Bonvoy members have been engaging with us is through the whole home rental platform Homes & Villas by Marriott International or HVMI. While HVMI does not have a material impact on our financials, it is complementary to our portfolio of hotel brands. With roughly 30,000 listings it continues to grow and is a popular way for members to earn and redeem points. We also recently announced a new program with Uber, allowing members in the U.S. to earn loyalty points in high-frequency activities like ride hailing and food delivery. Early engagement for this program has been quite strong. The health and safety of our guests and associates is extremely important to us. We first rolled out our elevated cleanliness standards over a year ago. Since then, we\u2019ve continued to evolve our contactless experience and leverage technologies such as mobile and web check-in and mobile key to help meet the changing needs of our guests, while also driving productivity. We are currently testing contactless arrival kiosks and contactless grab and go marketplaces at several select service properties across the U.S. as part of our efforts to further streamline our operations and enhance the guest experience. Over the past year, we\u2019ve ramped up engagement with our owner and franchisee community through multiple channels of communication. We\u2019ve worked very hard to help owners lower their costs and maximize hotel operating margins in this low occupancy environment. We continue to work closely to align on priorities as we navigate the recovery Together. Turning to development. Our pace of signings has picked up and is dramatically better than it was for much of last year. Our conversion activity was particularly strong in the quarter. As we talked about on our last call, in February we signed a conversion deal in CALA for approximately 7,000 all-inclusive rooms, positioning us to be a top 10 player in the popular and fast growing all-inclusive space. Given our impressive roster of conversion friendly brands and the meaningful benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system, we expect our momentum around conversions will continue. We added over 23,500 rooms to our system in the first quarter, 60% more than the first quarter of last year. 31% of the rooms added were from conversions, the highest percent in any quarter over the last six years. Looking ahead to the full year, we still expect gross rooms growth could accelerate to approximately 6% and net rooms growth could be roughly 3% to 3.5%. While we and the industry are still seeing some delays in construction starts, 45% of our industry leading pipeline of approximately 491,000 rooms is already under construction. Our net rooms growth expectation includes a one-time 100 basis points headwind from the 88 Service Properties Trust or SVC hotels that left our system in the first quarter. We look forward to replacing the mostly limited-service first-generation SVC hotels with newer product, and are already in active discussions for new deals in nearly three quarters of the portfolios markets. Before I turn the call over to Leeny to talk about our financials in more detail, I want to say that our hearts are with everyone who has lost colleagues, friends, or family, because of COVID-19. We have all witnessed the devastation caused by this pandemic. And it\u2019s hard to see the alarmingly high number of COVID cases in too many countries today. I also want to recognize our amazing team of associates around the world, who have worked tirelessly through these uncertain times. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of their dedication, determination, and resilience during this crisis. They have redefined what it means to truly take care of each other and our guests. I do believe that Marriott will continue to see improving global trends and that we can all look ahead with real optimism. We are seeing wonderful signs that demand for travel is undeniably resilient. While some regions will recover faster than others, based on the progress we\u2019ve seen to date, I am confident that it is not a question of if demand will return to pre-COVID levels. It is really only a question of when? Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. We were pleased with the pace of continued recovery in our business during the first quarter, particularly in the U.S. In the first quarter, global occupancy was 38% and RevPAR declined 59% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and 46% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our gross fee revenues totaled $445 million for the quarter, down 29% compared to the year ago quarter. Franchise fees of $306 million declined only 26% year-over-year with our non-RevPAR related franchise fees proving to be particularly steady. They totaled $141 million in the first quarter, up slightly over the year ago quarter. Credit card branding fees were $81 million down only 12% year-over-year. We are also seeing strong performance in our branded residences business, where fees were $11 million higher than a year ago. Incentive management fees or IMS were $33 million in the quarter, around 45% of our IMS were earned in Asia Pacific, mostly from hotels in Greater China. In the first quarter, which has traditionally been the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, adjusted EBITDA was $296 million. G&A improved by 22% versus the first quarter of last year, primarily due to $50 million of lower bad debt expense, and $14 million of lower guarantee reserves. Expenses in the 2021 first quarter included $14 million of additional non-recurring executive compensation related to leadership changes. As Tony mentioned, we\u2019ve been working closely with our hotel owners to write five costs that our hotels given their low occupancy level. We are pleased that we\u2019ve been able to reduce hotel breakeven occupancy level significantly. Many of our initiatives to streamline operations and improve productivity such as more efficient management staffing levels at many of our managed hotels will remain in place after the pandemic and should help offset wage inflation. Additionally, we are currently assessing post-COVID renovation and brand standards with a view towards finding more ways to improve hotel profitability, while preserving the quality and experiences guests expect of our brands when they stay with us. While the operating environment has been quite challenging for more than a year, we\u2019ve been pleased that the vast majority of our hotels continue to pay their bills. We have even seen the number of hotels on payment plans come down meaningfully over the last several months, as occupancy has improved. Turning to our cash flow, even in this low RevPAR environment, cash provided by operating activities was $27 million in the quarter. That amount reflects in part the impact of roughly $90 million of reduced cash payment from the co-brand credit card companies. As you may remember, the company received $920 million of cash in May 2020 as part of amendments to our credit card agreement. And we will therefore see lower cash payments for the remainder of 2021 through 2023. If you add back that roughly $90 million and also deduct capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, and other investing activities of $39 million in the quarter. The company generated positive cash flows of around $78 million. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the strength of our cash generation throughout the pandemic. It\u2019s a clear reflection of our ability to quickly and effectively adapt our business and a real testament to the power of our asset-light business model. At the end of the first quarter, our net liquidity improved to approximately $4.7 billion representing $600 million in available cash balances, plus $4.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on our revolver. During the quarter, we increased our weighted average debt maturity with a 10-year $1.1 billion bond issuance that has a 2.85% coupon and we also retired $750 million of senior note. As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 assuming continued progress with vaccinations and an improving consumer and macroeconomic environment in many regions around the world, we believe that the pace of the global recovery will continue to accelerate. While trends will vary by region, we expect overall leisure demand will strengthen further into the summer months. In the U.S. and Canada, reservations that our resort hotels are particularly strong, booked transient room nights per stays 30 days out or more are now over 60% above 2019 level. And on top of that, rates are almost 20% higher than 2019 level. Occupancy on the books for our resorts in the region is higher, relative to the same time in 2019 for every month through the end of the year. We believe transient \u2013 business transient and group will continue to slowly improve for now. And then business demand could really accelerate in the fall as more businesses reopened. With business transient returning faster than group, given the lead time, it\u2019s generally required for booking group business. As we think about the cadence of RevPAR recovery ADR is also a key factor. It\u2019s encouraging to see that where demand has rebounded swiftly ADR has come back quickly as well. In March, Mainland, the popular resort market in China achieved occupancy of 79% driving ADR 40% above 2019 levels and resulting in March RevPAR over 1.5 times higher than 2019 level. Here in the U.S., occupancy across our 34 luxury resorts rose to 69% in March, leading to ADR up 26% over March of 2019. Similarly, certain resort properties in Caribbean destinations, such as the Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas and the Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico saw record first quarter ADR as a result of sudden surges in occupancy. Well, we feel optimistic about the recovery trajectory ahead. There is still too much uncertainty about timing to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line at current RevPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a one point change in RevPAR versus 2019 RevPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. Please note that given the nominal level of RevPAR in 2020, the impact of a one percentage point change in 2021 RevPAR compared to 2020 could be more like $15 million to $20 million. As we have seen the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. For us to start earning meaningful levels of IMS in the U.S. and other markets where IMF stand aside to owner priorities, we still need to see significant improvement in RevPAR. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to show the impact of the improved credit card spending and strong fees from our branded residences. We now expect full year G&A to be at the top end of the range we shared last quarter are roughly $800 million primarily due to the additional non-recurring executive compensation associated with our recent changes in leadership and higher outside legal fees. This is significantly lower than G&A in 2019. And I\u2019ll also note that the cash component of G&A will be meaningfully below this range given non-cash stock compensation. Interest expense is still anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $300 million to $325 million. Another element related to our company\u2019s cash flow is the loyalty program. As leisure demand has accelerated and been particularly strong for our resort properties. We\u2019ve seen loyalty redemption nights\u2019 pickup nicely. We expect this trend could continue as our Bonvoy members are excited travel again. Even if redemptions do increase, given our focus on carefully controlling program administrative costs, we anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around one-third of the total $920 million we received in 2020, cash flows from loyalty could be modestly negative. Our expectation for 2021 investment spending has not changed. Full year investment spending excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time. This would lead to total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. As a reminder, approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. In closing, we are pleased with our progress so far this year, and are increasingly confident that the pace of recovery will improve significantly from here. We hear from so many people who are eager to get back on the road and we look forward to welcoming more and more guests at our hotel. We\u2019ll now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Good morning, guys. Tony, you\u2019re probably the best guy at Marriott to ask this question, given your background and development, but can you just talk about your medium term views on full service urban development in the U.S. and how long that takes to recover? And then maybe related to that, can you talk about, within the net rooms growth outlook for this year, if you want it to kind of break it out between \u2013 on a global basis between managed and franchise? That would be helpful to us. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Sure. Thanks, Joe. Well, as we\u2019ve said for a while, the fluidity at the markets makes it pretty tough for us to look much beyond the end of 2021. We continue to feel confident in the forecast we\u2019ve given you for 6% gross rooms growth through the end of 2021 and 3% to 3.5% net rooms growth, 4% to 4.5% percent, if you back out the one-time headwind from SVC. On the mix of full service versus limited service, maybe I would point to the current pipeline. So if you look at the current pipeline today, interestingly about 40% of the global pipeline is full service. And even within that 40%, 25% of those full service rooms are in the luxury tier. And I think that\u2019s quite encouraging for us. As you know, the fees coming out of a new luxury hotel can easily be 10 times that of a limited service hotel. And so I think we continue to focus certainly on the metric of gross and net rooms, because that\u2019s an important metric. But as you\u2019ve heard me, Joe say four years, looking at the composition of those rooms is every bit as important. Leeny Oberg : Next question. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Good morning, everybody. Was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on some of the changes in brand standards that were mentioned. Obviously, it seems like some of this is here to stay, but also just wondering where you\u2019re at in that overall review process and sort of what does that mean for owners as we move into the kind of fall as occupancies pickup, because we\u2019ve definitely seen an explosion in margins for some hotel owners, but it seems like that\u2019s in part because they were still running on contingency plans a little bit, so just kind of curious on your comments? Leeny Oberg : Sure, absolutely. You\u2019re right. And this is obviously a pretty fluid situation. So the kind of the first part of this is around the dramatic changes that we made last year, which obviously cut down to the very bare bone of what we needed to do at hotel to manage with extraordinarily low levels of occupancy. But then as you\u2019ve seen demand pick back up, particularly in the resort hotels, we\u2019ve obviously added back meaningfully more in the way of services for our guests. But to your point, we\u2019ve also got the reality that guests also have their own views on what they feel comfortable with as it relates to housekeeping. And so we have made sure that there are choices for them to be able to \u2013 for example, in a luxury hotel, we continue to have daily housekeeping while if they are not comfortable with somebody coming in with their stay, then they can have that too. Our view is that we will continue to be looking at this really with an eye towards the occupancy in a variety of markets, where we are going to need to be flexible. But I do think by the end of the year, Shaun that we will have been able to make some decisions as we look forward about how we\u2019ll manage this \u2013 as occupancy really gets back closer to being normal. And in that regard, we do believe that there are some things that we can do to improve the productivity of the hotels. It obviously varies a lot by the tier. What is expected at a select service hotel is very different from a beach luxury hotel. But I do expect as we get into 2022 that we will have reestablished where we are on the brand standards. As you know, renovation is also a whole another topic. And there, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re taking into consideration that dramatically lower cash reserves that the hotel owners have and picking our spots and making sure that we\u2019re picking the renovation work that is critical to the customer experience. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas, your line is open. If you\u2019re muted, please unmute. Thomas Allen : Sorry, here I am. So, good morning. Leeny, could you just give us some more detail on the owned and leased segment performance there and how you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s going to recover through the year. Leeny Oberg : Sure. You\u2019re right on the money in terms of the question about the variability there, Thomas. Just as a quick reminder, we\u2019ve got 66 owned or leased hotels of which 20 are owned. And I think it varies so much depending on what is going on in the occupancies of these various markets. So just to give you a sense Galla and Emiya are where we\u2019ve got really the toughest time for occupancy right now for our owned, leased hotels. And for that, if you think about the elegant acquisition where we had those hotels compared to a year ago in the first quarter, they obviously had a dramatic change in their profitability year-over-year in the first quarter and similarly in Europe. But at the same time, I think, in the U.S., what we\u2019re seeing is with the improved demand situation that those owned leased profits are in better shape. So broadly speaking, the other thing to remember is that, in the first quarter, we also had $17 million of termination fees, which actually helps owned and leased line. And that tends to be in a given year or something like, $45 million in that ballpark. So I think, if for better, for worse, is going to depend very much on what happens Galla as well as in Emiya to see these owned leased numbers rebound. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about when for the \u2013 in the U.S., for the group bookings and the corporate \u2013 maybe modest corporate pickup you\u2019ve seen so far. It sounds like no, because you mentioned higher rates. But just in general, do you think companies are concerned around increasing their travel budgets after having enjoyed a year of no travel and with high productivity evidently any kind of pushback or just kind of thoughts for getting around that? Leeny Oberg : Yes. So, I think, again \u2013 I think for all of us, we\u2019re all seeing that \u2013 the comfort people have around travel is now moving in the right direction. But there is still uncertainty. And as you\u2019ve got different vaccination rates in different part of the world and even within the U.S. at different rates in the U.S. there is still some concern around getting everyone together in a large group. But interestingly, what we see is that by the time you get to 2022, we really aren\u2019t seeing cancellations there. And frankly, even when you look at the pace between Q3 and Q4, you\u2019d see a notable difference. And when you look at the ADR in the U.S. for example, for system-wide, you\u2019re actually looking at ADR for group pace being up versus 2019, starting in Q3 of 2021, all the way through 2022. And overall revenue being, from a group pace standpoint, 20 points better in Q4 than it is in Q3. So we do believe by the time we get to 2022, there is a lot of pent up demand. And that from all that we hear from our corporate clients and association clients, that people are very anxious to be back in the groups, but whether that feels comfortable exactly in Q3 or exactly in Q4 is, where we do sense hesitancy. But that once you get past 2021 that there is a full expectation that people will be getting back into doing their group business. Tony Capuano : And I think just to build on Leeny\u2019s point, the statistics I gave you on rates for the front of 2022 and 2023, I think really speaks to your concern about reluctance. The fact that in the first quarter of 2022, our rates are 6% higher than they were two years ago, and 10% for 2023, I think underscores Leeny\u2019s point that reluctance is fading as folks crave the ability to meet face to face. Smedes Rose : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. Two clarifications, one is, just on the group business, I know you were talking about the rates ahead in \u2013 starting in Q3. Did you say that total group nights for 2022, how that compares to pre-pandemic levels just in terms of the volume of nights? Leeny Oberg : Yes. It\u2019s total room nights at this point are down 16%. Now this is on group pace. This is not on the books. This is just group kind of the group pace that we\u2019re seeing. And they were down 16% compared to 2019 levels on rooms as compared to this year down 62%. But again, it\u2019s early days, right? We\u2019ve only seen Q1. So I think part of this is the uncertainty I was pointing out that people are looking for just a little bit more clarity around, is it August? Is it October, when people are more comfortable having these large group meetings where everybody can be together. Robin Farley : And then and you said the down 16% was group pace, but not group room nights on the books. Is that a number you could kind of ballpark for us that for 2022? Leeny Oberg : For group room nights on the books at this point, we\u2019ll get back to you. I don\u2019t have anything specifically in front of me. I would guess again, at this point, it\u2019s down a bit more than that. As again, you would expect in the year for the year. Jackie or Betsy, if you have it? Jackie Burka McConagha : In the U.S. and Canada, room nights are down 16% in 2022, right. Leeny Oberg : Right, that\u2019s pace. Jackie Burka McConagha : Right. And then revenue for coming quarters. Robin Farley : Okay. So I can circle back later. And then maybe just one other clarification when you\u2019re guiding for the growth and net for the year, and just kind of looking at where Q1 came in, is there anything we should be keeping in mind about gross and net changes in the next couple of quarters? In other words, clearly, there would have been maybe some construction delays in 2020 that. So just thinking about, is there \u2013 are there quarters where the gross and net will not be as kind of consistent with the full year? Tony Capuano : That\u2019s a good question, Robin. And again, it\u2019s a little hard to forecast quarter-to-quarter. I think what I would say to you is, we continue to see some construction delays around the world. But it\u2019s part of the reason, we\u2019re so encouraged by the first quarter\u2019s volume of conversion activity. Conversions will have been and will continue to be a significant priority for our transaction teams around the world. And I think it\u2019s in many ways, the one silver bullet we have to offset the impact of ongoing construction delays. Robin Farley : Okay. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Robin, just to circle back, on the books was the minus 16% of room nights that I gave you, when we talked earlier. In terms of bookings for next year, when we look at in the quarter, we also there \u2013 we\u2019re seeing that the room nights are down 30%. If you\u2019re again, looking solely at what was booked in Q1, but from the group that is on the books for the moment for next year, it was the 16% room nights that I described earlier. Robin Farley : Okay. And those are both versus 2019. Is that Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Yes. They are. We find that to be a better comparison. Robin Farley : No, absolutely. I just want to make sure. Okay, great. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Robin. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Patrick Scholes : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : One concern that \u2013 good morning, one concern that I have been hearing from hotel owners, including a one or more hotel REITs is regarding the automatic rebooking tools. These owners and REITs are feeling that the brands aren\u2019t doing enough in developing technology to prevent it, and they see these rebooking tools as a real resistance to increasing rates. Is there anything that you folks on your end can be doing to help with that? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : So I\u2019ll make one comment. I guess, I think the first thing is to look at where we did talk about some of our March numbers, which was when you saw that occupancy rebound dramatically, you also saw a rate respond extremely well and very dynamically. So our revenue management system is designed to be that dynamic. And we\u2019ve spent a lot \u2013 we\u2019ve paid a lot of attention to making sure that we adjust it for what has happened to business over the last year and a half. And so I think from our perspective, we\u2019re very pleased with what we see in terms of rate discipline, the group numbers that we talked to you about, what we\u2019ve seen on the special corporate side, which is that this year rates stayed essentially flat. So it is something that we\u2019re paying really close attention to and market by market is right. This is very much something that happens depending on exactly what\u2019s going on for a particular tier in a particular market. So we are very careful to be looking to make sure that as we see the pickup in demand that we\u2019re adjusting for rates extremely quickly. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Steven Grambling : Hi. Good morning. I may have missed this in the opening, but can you remind us of your capital allocation priorities, including how you might consider reinstating the dividend or buyback? And how do you think the pandemic has altered your view longer-term on the right balance there? Leeny Oberg : Sure. So as we talked about before, we are working quickly to get our leverage ratios back in line. We are still not there. We have a ways to go, as you think about our EBITDA, still being in the ballpark of down 60% to where it was before. And we are determined to through both suspending the cost, the cash management, as well as obviously stimulating demand to getting back there as quickly as we can. And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to get there and hopefully sooner rather than later. When we think about capital return, I\u2019ll also point out that we have worked hard to extend our weighted average maturities on our debt over the past year and a half, which I think does put us in good position to be thinking about capital return. Once we get our leverage ratios back where we want them to be, I can\u2019t predict exactly when that will be. And I think when you ask about the question of, will we be keeping them at a different level? I think a lot of this does depend on how we see business coming back and the stability of it. So we will see when we get there, obviously discussions with our Board on that topic and continue to look forward to that conversation. But again, I\u2019m confident that we will be there before too long. Steven Grambling : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the notion around perspective inflation. Two-fold, one being the degree to which that may play into construction costs and have some impact on new constructions starting up again. And secondarily, we have an awful lot of discussions about labor costs across our coverage and the degree to which that is factoring into your thoughts today. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : So I\u2019ll start on the hotel margin side, and then Tony can talk about the development side. On the hotel margin side, as you\u2019ve heard us talk about before so much of how we hold onto these margins depends on how fast demand comes back, because we do believe that there\u2019s some work that we\u2019ve done that will permanently help keep some of this margin improvement. But obviously, depending on how long it takes for demand and ADR to come back, you\u2019ve obviously got annual wage inflation risks that start to cut against some of the savings that we\u2019ve come up with. So from that respect, we do watch really carefully. I\u2019d say roughly 50% of a full service cost structure is related to labor. And we are watching that very carefully. As we see demand come back and look at all the things that we\u2019ve done on the productivity side, but the pace there is very much around how quickly demand comes back. So far from what we can tell, we do like what we see in terms of the pop back on rate and feel good about our ability to hold on to some of these savings in a more permanent way. But obviously, wage inflation is something that we see. And frankly, it is typically been the case that when you have inflation on wages, you often also have inflation on ADR, which helps to offset that. On the development side, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Yes. I think the point we need just made is an important one, which is our owner and franchisee community look at both sides of that coin. We are seeing increases in construction costs both on the labor and materials side. But as you\u2019ve heard from us in the past, our owner community doesn\u2019t necessarily try to time the market based on cost factors in a given quarter. They tend to be long-term holders of these assets. And to Leeny\u2019s point, while they are appropriately aware of potential impact of inflation on wage rates they also embrace the historical impact of inflation on ADR growth. David Katz : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Bellisario of Baird. Michael Bellisario : Good morning, everyone. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Michael Bellisario : I was hoping you could provide some details on RevPAR index performance during the quarter. I don\u2019t think you provided any numbers. And then also just bigger pictures, seeing a little bit further out, where do you think system-wide index could normalize compared to pre-pandemic levels? Tony Capuano : Both great questions. The challenge obviously is in this environment, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen an environment where RevPAR index numbers are less relevant. We look anecdotally at the way our hotels are ramping up and the preference that our guests continue to have for our brands. But as you know, we\u2019ve essentially \u2013 we\u2019ve been pleased with the momentum we saw coming into 2020 on the improvements of index. And we think when we get beyond the pandemic, we expect to pick up essentially right where we left off in terms of improvements in index across the portfolio. Leeny Oberg : Just as a reminder, index has done as you know, at the local level. So right now the index numbers can very often have hotels that is either not open or it\u2019s just opened. And so while frankly, the numbers may overwhelmingly looks really good, they also frankly, are not really a good, steady state view of how the hotel is doing because the demand is so volatile. So at this point we just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a number that is reflective of the real state of play for our hotels and our brands, but look forward to them getting back that way. Michael Bellisario : Got it. And can you provide where 2019 was for the portfolio? Leeny Oberg : We don\u2019t talk about specific numbers, but except to tell you that they were going up steadily across all the brands. And frankly, as we moved into 2020, what we saw in January and February moving into with some really powerful momentum as the full integration of our loyalty program and all of the systems was complete and really a strong set of movement across all the brands around the world on RevPAR index. Michael Bellisario : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your last question will come from the line of Richard Clarke of Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to follow-up on the 6% to 10% ADR uplift you were seeing in group. Is there anything behind that you called out in terms of mix? Is that helping? Is the U.S. recovering quicker there or different types of group? Or is this what you\u2019re charging? Are you charging up for this because of some of the new technology the clean promises that are being put in there? And then maybe any commentary on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of rates for business transient, as that comes back? Tony Capuano : Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll take the group question and let Leeny take the BT question. Nothing particularly remarkable, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any dramatic difference in trends from region to region. I think as Leeny alluded to earlier, the strengths of our revenue management infrastructure really is allowing us to drive rate in the face of what is really encouraging upticks in demand for group. And that really \u2013 the demand for group is really kind of tracking the overall recovery REIT trends we\u2019ve seen by region across leisure NBT. Leeny Oberg : And on business transient, this again gets to \u2013 it\u2019s very market specific. So if somebody frankly needed to go and do business in Miami in the month of March or April, frankly, they were paying really strong rates. But in many markets, it\u2019s more of a reflection like a New York City or Chicago, where it was obviously lower. Special corporate kind of rates overall, though, in terms of our contracted rates with our corporate \u2013 large corporate clients, as you probably know, they actually rolled over in 2021 from 2020. So you see a pretty steady sort of pricing, while if you look at the last recession, they actually went down by 6%. So we\u2019ve been pleased to see them hold steady. I think obviously as we get into this fall, we\u2019ll see where that goes for 2022 because that\u2019s typically when we go out and renegotiate these rates for next year. But for this year, they\u2019ve held pretty steady. Richard Clarke : Wonderful. Thanks very much. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Tony Capuano : Well, I want to thank you all again for joining us this morning and your continued interest in Marriott. As we said at the outset, we continue to be encouraged at the pace of recovery around the world and look forward to hopefully sharing more good news a quarter from now. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Jackie Burka. Please go ahead. Jackie Burka : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Marriott\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy and ADR comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR, occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2021 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of June 30, 2021, even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with our second quarter results and the accelerating pace of the global recovery. The tremendous overall improvement we saw in both occupancy and rate in the quarter demonstrate a basic premise. People love to travel and to stay in our hotels. Demand grew steadily throughout the second quarter. Worldwide occupancy gained 6 percentage points in the month of June, compared to May and top 55%. Average daily rate in June was down only 13% from June two years ago. As a result, global RevPAR has risen meaningfully and swiftly from the depths of the pandemic when RevPAR was down 90% to down just 38% in June compared to the same month in 2019. Recovery timelines vary by region, given uneven vaccination trends, virus case loads and travel restrictions. Yet we remain encouraged by the incredible resilience of travel demand, demonstrated by the rapid return of guests in areas where rules have been eased and people feel they can travel safely. This can be seen most keenly in Mainland China, the first major market where RevPAR has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. RevPAR in the second quarter was driven by very strong demand, resulting in ADR exceeding 2019 levels. Occupancy reached 71% in April and 68% in May, before dipping to roughly 60% in June, due to small COVID outbreaks and strict lock downs in certain markets. Demand recovered quickly once the restrictions were lifted, as we have seen throughout the last year, July RevPAR is again expected to exceed 2019 levels. Perhaps most encouragingly, in April, for the first time since the pandemic began, leisure transient, business transient and group room nights in Mainland China were all ahead of 2019 levels. This is especially impressive given the absence of international arrivals, excuse me, due to stringent border restrictions. The U.S. and Canada accounts for roughly two-thirds of our rooms, and in this region, lodging demand grew impressively during the quarter, led by increasingly strong leisure demand, as the number of vaccinated people continued to rise. U.S. leisure room nights in the second quarter were 15% higher than in the second quarter of 2019, though we are seeing more blending of trip purpose, with the more flexible work-from-home or anywhere trend. Total U.S. occupancy reached over 63% in June, with ADR down just 11% versus June of 2019. Our strong momentum has continued into the first three and a half weeks of July. With U.S. occupancy reaching 67% and ADR down only 2% compared to July of 2019. July RevPAR for this period was down around 16% versus July of 2019. The U.S. is also seeing increasing signs of recovery in both special corporate and group demand. While special corporate booking levels in the first three and a half weeks of July are still down around 45% compared to the same period in 2019. We are optimistic that we have turned a corner. U.S. special corporate bookings rose 23% in June over May and then rose another 27% in the first three and a half weeks of July, as compared to the first three and a half weeks of June, with improvement widespread across industries and lengthening booking windows. Many of our corporate customers are telling us they are beginning to get back on the road this summer and we expect to see a step up in business travel post-Labor Day, as children go back to in-person learning and workers increasingly returned to the office. Group bookings in the U.S. have also gained momentum. U.S. group bookings made for all future dates were down 29% in June, compared to those made in June of 2019, a large improvement from down 56% in March of 2021 versus March of 2019. And for the first time since the pandemic started, group bookings made in the month of June or any time in 2021 exceeded in-the-year bookings made in the same month of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group revenue pace versus 2019 was down 31% for the fourth quarter of this year, improving to down 21% for the first quarter of 2022 and then down 12% for the second quarter of 2022. However, it\u2019s still early, and we expect bookings made closer to the event date will increase group revenue on the books for these time periods. Most importantly, our sales team is holding on to average daily rate. ADR for group bookings is almost flat for the fourth quarter and 3% higher for full year 2022 compared to the same periods in 2019. In other regions of the world, demand in the second quarter improved over the first quarter in the Middle East and Africa, in the Caribbean and Latin America, and in Europe. Middle East, Africa is benefiting from relatively high vaccination rates in many countries in the Middle East. Occupancy strengthened to 47% in June, largely driven by staycations in the UAE and quarantine business. Occupancy in Caribbean and Latin America improved meaningfully during the quarter, rising to 45% in June, while urban destinations continue to struggle, given slow vaccination rates and high COVID case counts, many of our resort properties in the Caribbean and Mexico are flourishing as they benefit from easing international travel restrictions and their close proximity to the U.S. Europe\u2019s recovery is still lagging, given its heavy reliance on international guests, slower border reopenings and shifting restrictions that change on short notice. Yet, with the EU easing many travel restrictions beginning in May and an increasing number of hotels reopening, occupancy doubled in just three months, reaching 31% in June. The recovery in Asia-Pacific, excluding China, stalled in the second quarter as countries such as Japan, India, South Korea and Australia imposed strict lockdowns in response to sharp rises in Delta variant cases and low vaccination rates. Encouragingly, the recovery is now picking up steam again as caseloads in some countries like India have started to decline. Shifting to the development front, our pipeline stood at nearly 478,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter. Openings were strong, with nearly 25,000 rooms added to our system during the quarter and deal signings were also healthy. Additionally, less than 2% of rooms fell out of the pipeline, one of the lowest levels we have seen in the last three years. We are very pleased with our momentum around conversions as well. Conversions accounted for 26% of rooms added in the first half of this year and have been a meaningful contributor to signings. We continue to have the largest pipeline of global rooms under construction. We are also seeing great momentum around our branded residential business, with a record 18 residential properties expected to open during the year. For the full year, we expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to approximately 6% and with more visibility into anticipated full year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth to be towards the higher end of our previous expectation of 3% to 3.5%. As a reminder, this estimate includes the 100-basis-point headwind from the 88 Service Properties Trust hotels that left our system earlier this year. We are pleased with the continued progress on replacing those hotels with new products. We are now in conversations for 80% of those locations, with signed or approved deals for nearly 20%. We continue to enhance and expand Marriott Bonvoy into an immersive travel platform that includes multiple products and offerings that enable us to provide value to our members beyond hotel stays. The program grew to over 153 million members at the end of the quarter. Homes & Villas by Marriott International or, which currently has around 35,000 whole home listings, has been an attractive offering and tool for engaging with members throughout the pandemic. With nearly 40% of listings in markets where we don\u2019t have distribution, HVMI is expanding the number of destination options for our guests. Over 90% of HVMI room nights in the quarter were booked by Bonvoy members. Our co-branded credit card holders were very active in the second quarter, with global card spending surpassing the same period in 2019. Global card acquisitions were also strong, reaching 2019 levels. Our recent credit card launches in South Korea and Mexico have seen strong initial interest from consumers in those markets. The South Korean card issuer, Shinhan Financial Group, touted the launch of our card as one of the most successful premium card launches they have ever had. Our total co-brand credit card fees in the second quarter surpassed those in the same quarter of 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began. We have also been very pleased with our successful Uber collaboration in the U.S. The number of members linking their accounts to-date has far exceeded our expectations. Activated accounts were already averaging six transactions in just the first 10 weeks, demonstrating our ability to drive real engagement with our Marriott Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay. We are always working on innovative ways to enhance our guests\u2019 full travel experience. Just last week, we became the first major hotel company to provide U.S.-based customers with the opportunity to purchase travel insurance. Guests can now buy travel insurance when they make a reservation through Marriott\u2019s website or mobile app by linking to approved products sold by Alliance partners. As part of this distribution agreement, Marriott will earn commissions from Alliance. In another effort to connect with Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay, we are piloting a program that allows members to earn and redeem points at food and beverage outlets in select hotels, even if the member is not staying in the hotel. The program is currently in over 200 outlets in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, with expansion to over 500 outlets expected by the end of the year. We also remain keenly focused on engaging with another key constituency, our owner and franchisee community. We have worked closely with them throughout the pandemic to help lower costs significantly. With some meaningful improvement in demand, profitability for many hotel owners accelerated in the second quarter. As the recovery continues, we are aligning with our owners and franchisees to balance two important goals as we think about our path forward, maximizing hotel level cash flow and driving great guest experiences, as Leeny will discuss in more detail. We are also working to address the labor challenges we are seeing, mainly in the U.S. in markets such as Southern Florida, Texas and Arizona, where demand has rebounded quickly. To that end, we are increasing our social and targeted marketing of Marriott as a best employer with career advancement opportunities, as well as holding job fairs to reach qualified candidates. Hiring tools, including onetime sign-on bonuses and temporary incentives, sometimes in combination with base salary adjustments in select markets are also being successfully employed. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to thank our amazing team of associates around the world. I have spent time in Los Angeles, Miami and New York over the last couple of weeks as I have been getting back on the road again. It has been wonderful to visit our hotels and to meet with so many of our associates and see firsthand their passion and resilience. These have been challenging times, but we are looking forward with optimism. While the time line is uncertain, I am confident that our business will fully recover and continue to grow from there. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Our second quarter results reflected the strong pace of the global recovery and the incredible resilience of our business model. Worldwide occupancy came in at 51%, a significant increase of 13 percentage points over the first quarter of this year. We also saw a meaningful improvement in our average daily rate decline versus pre-pandemic levels, with ADR down 17% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2019. We are optimistic that rate recovery will occur faster than in prior downturns, when ADR gains lagged occupancy gains. It\u2019s been very encouraging to see that in Mainland China ADR has come back in tandem with demand. Elsewhere, ADR has also been particularly strong in areas where occupancy has rebounded quickly, in Aruba, Puerto Rico and Mexico, over half of our 28 luxury and upper upscale comparable resorts saw record high ADRs for the month of June. In the rest of the U.S., robust demand across our 34 comparable luxury resorts drove ADR for those hotels, up more than 40% above June 2019 levels. Demand in Greece rose quickly after travel restrictions were eased in April, leading to a 20% premium in ADR for the quarter versus the same period in 2019. Global RevPAR declined 44% compared to the second quarter of 2019, a more than 15-percentage-point improvement compared to the first quarter RevPAR decline versus the 2019 first quarter. We recorded gross fee revenues of $642 million in the second quarter. Our non-RevPAR related fees again proved to be quite resilient. Totaling $160 million in the second quarter, these fees have now fully recovered to second quarter of 2019 levels. Our residential branding fees were strong again this quarter at $14 million. Incentive management fees or IMF totaled $55 million in the quarter. Almost half of our IMFs were earned in Asia-Pacific, mostly from hotels in Mainland China. Around 30% of our IMFs were earned in the U.S. and Canada region, with a number of U.S. luxury hotels generating more incentive fees than in the second quarter of 2019. Second quarter G&A and other expense was 18% lower than in the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of our significant restructuring activities undertaken last year. We had a tax benefit of $41 million in the quarter due to releasing $118 million of reserves related to the favorable resolution of pre-acquisition Starwood tax audit. We continue to believe that going forward our core tax rate will be around 22% to 24%, absent any legislative changes to corporate tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $558 million, which included $22 million of German Government support for certain of our leased and joint venture hotels. I also want to highlight the sale of the Prince Anita\u2019s [ph] St. Regis in the quarter, a joint venture in which we held a minority interest. It\u2019s encouraging to see transactions like this occurring and we expect to receive a total of at least $36 million in after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. We will continue to operate the hotel under a long-term management agreement. At the hotel level, our numerous cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts have significantly lowered breakeven occupancy levels around the world, even further than we anticipated when the pandemic got underway. As a result of these efforts, as well as the strong recovery progress, the financial condition of many of our owners and franchisees continues to strengthen, as does our accounts receivable collections performance. Over 95% of our managed comp hotels in Mainland China had positive gross operating profit or GOP in the second quarter. Our GOP margin for managed comp hotels in this region expanded over 200 basis points versus margins in the second quarter of 2019. The strong margin expansion exemplifies the beneficial impact of our recent cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts, given operations have fully come back in Mainland China with the recovery and demand. These results also reflect our strong topline performance, driven by meaningful share gains in the region, thanks to our strong distribution, especially in the valuable luxury space, our popular brands and our powerful loyalty platform. In the U.S., the number of managed hotels with positive GOP improved significantly in the quarter as demand increased. Approximately 90% reported positive GOP in the second quarter, up from about 60% just one quarter ago. As occupancies increase, we are working closely with our hotel owners around the world to balance maximizing hotel profitability, while also driving guest satisfaction. We are being thoughtful about how and whether to bring back costs, programs and amenities that were reduced or eliminated, as we navigated the depth of the pandemic. For example, we have already reinstated accountability for our intent to recommend scores with accountable brand standard audits resuming next year. We also introduced a new set of renovation rules, which will allow for additional deferrals of some renovations, as well as reduced scopes for certain properties. We are considering how best to evolve housekeeping brand standards across each of our hotel brand tiers while ensuring guest expectations are met. We do believe that once business has fully recovered and operations are fully backed, there will be permanent areas of margin improvement, primarily related to our productivity enhancements and the increased use of contactless technologies such as mobile check-in and mobile key. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, while we are keeping a close eye on variant strains, we are optimistic about the continued global recovery. Our momentum has continued into July, and we expect an uptick in business travel this fall. We expect that when improved ease of international travel occurs that will also fuel further recovery in lodging demand. While there\u2019s still too much uncertainty to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, I\u2019d like to provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the topline, at current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full year 2021 RevPAR versus 2019 to be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to benefit from strong co-brand credit card fees and robust fees from our branded resident sales. We still expect full year G&A to be roughly $800 million, significantly lower than in 2019 and interest expense is still anticipated to be around $430 million. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $325 million to $350 million. A key component of cash flow is the loyalty program. With an acceleration of leisure demand, we have continued to see redemption nights\u2019 pick up nicely, especially in our resort destination. We remain focused on carefully controlling Bonvoy program administrative costs and we still anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around one-third of the total $920 million we received in 2020, we continue to expect that cash flows from loyalty overall could be modestly negative. With better visibility and our continued disciplined approach to investment spending, we are lowering the top end of our full year investment spending expectation and narrowing the range to $575 million to $625 million. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities. We are focused on bringing our credit statistics back in line with our historically strong investment-grade levels. Our leverage ratios continue to improve, as Marriott\u2019s asset-light business model is showing its resilient cash flow characteristics. We expect continued improvements in cash flow generation as the recovery progresses. I also want to add my appreciation for our incredible team of global associates who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. They truly exemplify the Marriott spirit to serve and take care culture. In closing, we could not be more pleased with our progress in the quarter and we look forward to the continued return of guests to our 7,800 hotels around the world. We are happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with BoA. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I was\u2026 Tony Capuano : Good morning. Shaun Kelley : Good morning, Tony. I was wondering if we could just talk a little bit about the development environment. I was just hoping you can give us a little bit more color, obviously it looks like the NUG increase was primarily driven by reduction in deletions. But maybe help us look out a little further, 2022, 2023. How are the conversations going and how do you think excluding the SBC component, the outlook has looked or changes versus maybe 90 days ago? Tony Capuano : Of course. Thanks, Shaun. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver at the top end of our range in 2021. I think, when we look at factors like the number of rooms we have under construction, more than 200,000 rooms, the lowest fallout we have seen from the pipeline in about three years, the accelerated pace of conversions, we are increasingly optimistic that we can get back to a mid single-digit net unit growth pace. But as you have seen with some of the data coming out of STR around the slowdown in U.S. construction starts, the reality is the impact of those reduced construction starts will make it challenging for us to get back to that mid single-digit level over the next year or two. Shaun Kelley : Tony, just as the follow-up to mid single-digit being more of a medium-term target, but just for the next year or two construction starts probably limiting maybe a little bit below that range. Is that the way to think about it? Tony Capuano : Yeah. I think that\u2019s right. I think we are guiding to about 3.5% net unit growth, excluding the impact of SVC in 2021, and then 2022 and 2023 will be the years that we think will be impacted by that drop in construction start activity in the U.S. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Tony Capuano : Of course. Operator : Your next question\u2026 Leeny Oberg : Shaun, just one follow-up and that\u2019s that we do believe that, while we are constrained by these lower construction starts that the industry has seen in the U.S., that we are going to be able to offset some of this through conversions and we are really pleased with the pace of conversion signings and the conversations that we are seeing on that front. Hard to be specific at this point about exactly where that leaves us, but that, again, as Tony said, we are confident about getting back to the mid single-digit rooms growth rate. Shaun Kelley : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Joe Greff : Just one the -- you touched on this a little bit in terms of the labor challenges and labor costs going up. So when we look at the 2Q results and we are looking at your reported results, is there a lag in sort of the operating cost structure, particularly with labor relative to the revenue recovery? Is the exit rate coming out of the 2Q in cost structure, is that something that\u2019s more significant than the reported results because of potential add? Leeny Oberg : Well, as you know, that\u2019s going to overwhelmingly show up in IMF, Joe, from a standpoint of kind of the way that the quarter\u2019s operating profit works at the hotels. So, and as you might imagine, with owners\u2019 priorities in the U.S., we didn\u2019t have a very high percentage of hotels earning incentive fees yet. The biggest growth in incentive fees was in Asia-Pacific, and frankly, the labor cost pressures are much, much lower there. So, honestly, I don\u2019t think that there is a meaningful impact at all relative to the really rapid increase in occupancy that then necessitated that we get our employment levels in the hotels up as quickly as possible, and as you said, I think, there is a little bit of a lag there. But I don\u2019t think it had any sort of impact on the profits for the quarter. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you. And then, you mentioned, a group pace for the first quarter and second quarter of maybe you gave it and I missed it, but did you talk about full year 2022 pace? Tony Capuano : Yes. The, sorry, Joe, the -- yeah, we talked a bit about 2022 pace and I think the -- there\u2019s a couple of encouraging things. When we look at booking pace, we continue to see volumes increasing pretty measurably into 2022, and maybe just as encouraging, if not more encouraging is the pace of ADR growth that we are seeing for 2022 bookings. In fact, if you look at group bookings beyond -- in 2022 and beyond, ADR is actually about 3% ahead of what we were booking back in 2020 for the following year. So the ADR pricing power that we are seeing in group in 2022 and beyond is very encouraging. Joe Greff : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Thanks. Just you have seen some really encouraging trends out of China. Can you just talk about like the pluses and minuses of using China as a comp, like how does your China business differ from kind of your global business? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : So, Thomas, it\u2019s a good question and I will say a couple of things. I think one of the things that is the most consistent in Greater China and the U.S. is the reality that the overwhelming percentage of travelers that stay at our hotels in those two regions are domestic. And so we are seeing -- obviously, you are seeing some of the same trends in the U.S. that we saw earlier in Mainland China, which is that when people feel comfortable to travel, the demand picks up really, really quickly, albeit with leisure being the strongest. And clearly, that is quite helpful for the hotel\u2019s occupancy levels, because they are not traveling outside their country. But I will say that, I think, the trends have been remarkably similar in terms of the pace of ADR recovery at the same time. And I think the other thing that I will point out that is interesting is that in Mainland China you do see markets, when they do have a pop in some COVID cases, they do shutdown demand very quickly, because the cities are closed down. We haven\u2019t obviously seen that same impact in the U.S., because the population is more varied in terms of kind of the travel and the way cities are shut down or not shut down. So in that regard, it\u2019s perhaps been a little bit more fluid in the U.S. But we have seen really terrific similarities in these markets where the occupancy is so much based on domestic travel. I think the other thing I will point out is that the F&B recovery in Greater China, I think, does point out the real strength of our hotel brands there, and that, I think, has been really impressive as well. Thomas Allen : Thanks again. Just a quick follow-up, you mentioned RevPAR was down 16% in July versus 2019. Is that U.S. only or is that global, and if it\u2019s one of them, can you give us the other two? Leeny Oberg : Yes. Tony Capuano : That\u2019s U.S. only. Leeny Oberg : Yeah. Thomas Allen : Do you have a global number? Leeny Oberg : We don\u2019t have. Jackie Burka : Yeah. Leeny Oberg : No. We don\u2019t. And that was just for the first three and half weeks. Just to be clear, that wasn\u2019t for the month of July. As you know, this is all in real-time that we are pulling this together. So we don\u2019t have all those numbers quite yet, and again, as we said, that was for the U.S. Thomas Allen : I appreciate all the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Thanks. I have a question about margins, but first, if I could just clarify Tony\u2019s comment about guidance for this year for unit growth at 3.5%. I thought I him say excluding the Service Properties Trust, but you meant including that, right? Tony Capuano : Yeah. Sorry. That\u2019s right. So excluding the impact of our SVC, our guidance would be 4% to 4.5% and we guide to the high end of that. If you would account for the impact of those 88 SVC hotels, it would be 3% to 3.5% and we are guiding towards the high end of that range. That\u2019s correct. Sorry if I misspoke. Robin Farley : I just -- thanks. I just wanted to clarify that. And is the sort of higher end of the 3% to 3.5% range from fewer removals, is it a timing factor or in other words or were there properties that sort of were not maybe in compliance with brand standards that came back into compliance and won\u2019t be removed in 2021 or is it just that some of the removals are sort of pushed into 2022? Tony Capuano : No. I think really, Robin, it\u2019s a byproduct of as the year advances, we have more and more visibility on both fronts, in terms of the timing of the individual openings and the status of projects going out -- potentially going out of the system. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then the margin clarification or question. Leeny you mentioned 200 basis points ahead of 2019. I think it was for -- in Greater China. And I think when you have talked about potential for margin improvement in the U.S. You have maybe sort of said you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect a big increase or a big change in the margin when RevPAR is recovered. Is that still the case? In other words, should we think about the -- some of the -- this sort of 200 basis points of margin in the example you used in China, is that kind of temporary maybe because brand standards aren\u2019t what they were in 2019 or I am just trying to square that with\u2026 Leeny Oberg : Sure. Robin Farley : \u2026 sort of previous comments. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So a couple of things. First of all, I was speaking about Mainland China, and there, I think, the interesting thing is that, with RevPAR back to essentially similar levels in 2019, we are producing GOP margins that are 200 basis points better. So I think that shows you some of the work that we have been able to do on the cost management side and productivity enhancement side that would tell you that those are kind of good margins to think about going forward. I think in the U.S., Robin, the interesting thing here is that we have got a lot of those similar productivity and cost enhancements that we have done here, which would lead you to some similar sort of conclusions. I think the thing you have to think about is how quickly do labor costs and benefit cost increase. So as we talked about before, if ADR recovers really quickly, and you have got these productivity and cost enhancements in place, you have probably got a similar opportunity in the U.S. for those similar kinds of numbers that we talked about in Mainland China. But, again, a lot of this depends on how quickly it all comes back in the U.S. and also what\u2019s going on with wage rates and benefit costs. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Leeny Oberg : Hi, Smedes Smedes Rose : Hi. How are you? I was just hoping you could give a little more color on the kind of the composition of the group improvement you are seeing in 2022, maybe any changes on a regional basis, maybe potentially away from larger, higher cost cities or if you are seeing anything just in terms of the kind of corporations or they tend to be smaller, is it larger? Maybe just some color on what you are seeing on any kind of forward bookings? Tony Capuano : Sure. So as you know, group is a complex group of subsets of types of groups. Where we are seeing really significant acceleration is on social. In fact, in many ways, social group demand is largely back to pre-pandemic levels. We are not seeing rapid recovery in city-wide yet, the sort of big-box convention hotel city wides that we enjoyed pre-pandemic. And then the fall, I think, will be quite telling as we look for more conventional corporate group demand to return. The only other comment I might make\u2026 Smedes Rose : Okay. Tony Capuano : \u2026 Smedes is that, we are seeing in the year for the year group bookings stronger than what we have typically experienced in a pre-pandemic environment. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Tony Capuano : You are welcome. Smedes Rose : And can I just ask just to kind of follow-up on the question about margin. As you guys make decisions around housekeeping, would that be kind of the key driver for potential margin improvement for owners is possible the elimination or significant reduction in housekeeping or are there other items on the table that would be very important towards potentially driving margin expansion at the property level? Tony Capuano : Smedes, you can expect us to continue to try to strike the right balance between the expectations of our guests as they get back on the road and the financial realities that our owners and franchisees face. We will continue to be guided by guest preference and it is quite interesting when you read some of the verbatims that we hear from our guests. Some of our guests that are dipping their toes back into travel are still a bit hesitant about having housekeepers in the room and they appreciate the choice of housekeeping at their discretion. Others are vaccinated and feeling encouraged about the safety of travel and they would prefer a more conventional housekeeping solution. And so, I think, whether it\u2019s housekeeping protocols, whether it\u2019s food and beverage service, we will continue to evaluate and evolve those service levels by market and by quality tier around the world. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Tony Capuano : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Hey, Tony and Leeny. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Hi, Stephen. Stephen Grambling : Good morning. How are you? Leeny Oberg : Great. Tony Capuano : Great. Stephen Grambling : So you mentioned -- great, a number of things about the Bonvoy brand extensions and creating value there, as well as the strength of non-RevPAR related fees, including the credit card fees. How do you think about the growth of this segment going forward and how closely it\u2019s tied or not tied to kind of the core business, whether that\u2019s net unit growth or RevPAR going forward? Leeny Oberg : So just broadly speaking, the non-RevPAR fees, Stephen, are made up of kind of a variety of things. But the biggest chunk of them that make up -- again when you think about it going back to 2019, call it, $579 million, the biggest chunk is obviously the credit card. And that is going to overwhelmingly relate to both the number of cardholders and the amount they spend on their co-brand cards. And as we talked about today, their spending has actually gone back to 2019 levels, and you saw the similar thing happened to our co-brand fees. So I think both the power of Bonvoy combined with sort of general level of consumer spend and health of the economy, particularly obviously the U.S. and fees are overwhelmingly driven by the U.S. cardholders, is how you should think about that. I think you are going to continue to see outsized growth in our residential branding fees, although they are obviously meaningfully smaller. But timeshare fees is much more of a stable number because, as you know, those are overwhelmingly fixed. So I think the biggest driver is really how you think about consumer credit card spend on our co-brand cards. Stephen Grambling : So, I guess, as a follow-up, is there an opportunity to monetize or generate credit card fees or other types of fees in the international markets where it hasn\u2019t been as much of a contributor? Leeny Oberg : Yes. So they are just -- they are meaningfully smaller depending on kind of the economic structure of the credit card business in those various countries. And obviously, the U.S. is a very, very large market. So, yes, we are, and we expect to continue to see increases in our international credit card co-brand card fees. And as we talked about in this insurance, travel insurance business that we are entering into, we should also be able to benefit there as well. But I would not expect them to be meaningful in terms of Marriott\u2019s overall earnings stream. Stephen Grambling : Great. And if I can sneak one other follow-up on just on the IMF, you referenced that only a few North America kind of above that under priority level. Is there any kind of level of occupancy recovery or specific markets that we really need to see to start seeing those starts to be earned again? Leeny Oberg : Well, honestly, they range all over the map. Just to give you a sense, when you go back to 2019, we basically were in a position where our full service hotels about half of them were earning incentive fees, and overall, for the U.S., it was, call it, 56% when you take in our limited service and there you obviously had occupancies up into the 70s. But, otherwise, I will say it\u2019s a big mishmash depending on the specifics. The counter to that is as we described in Greater China, where we are at 77% earning in the year-to-date numbers for IMF and back in 2019, it was at 86%. So you can see that they behave much more in line with base fees, while in the U.S., you really have a ways to go before we back to earning meaningful incentive fees from the U.S. Stephen Grambling : That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Tony Capuano : Good morning, David. David Katz : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to take a little longer term look, Leeny, and wonder what would have to happen and how you might be thinking about getting back into the capital returns game and whether we would have a shot at maybe recommending a dividend by the end of the year and how you might be thinking about the setup for these items next year, which is sort of what we are used to with Marriott? Leeny Oberg : Sure. Absolutely. I think, as you pointed out, David, we are seeing tremendous progress. Our credit ratios are absolutely improving literally month-by-month and we are really pleased with the progress. First and foremost, we want to get our credit ratios back in line with being a strong investment-grade credit. That is the first priority and we are well on our way and so I do think we are going to be talking about capital return sooner rather than later. As you know, David, so much of this is around the pace of continued global vaccination rates, as well as restrictions on travel and consumers\u2019 comfort with travel, both domestically and internationally, as well as people returning to their offices, et cetera. So as we said, we can\u2019t predict and give you RevPAR and earnings outlooks in specifics. But if we continue to see really strong progress like we have been seeing, we could absolutely imagine that we are talking about capital return later on in 2022. Exactly when we are able to count on that and have a discussion with our Board on that topic remains to be seen. But you certainly can envision a scenario that, assuming things continue to progress, if that is the case. David Katz : If I can follow that up, three 3 times to 3.5 times was usually a target. Is there any qualification around that that we should be thinking about today? Leeny Oberg : No. Except to say that we, again, would want to feel like we are squarely staying there, i.e., that the market is -- the lodging recovery has stabilized, that things have gotten to a position where reaching that 3 times to 3.5 times is something that we foresee being very solid going forward. But think that other than that there\u2019s no additional constraints. David Katz : Got it. Thank you so much. Good luck. Leeny Oberg : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Richard Clarke : Just want to ask a quick question on the gap between your gross and net unit growth. I think you have done about 19,900 exits in the first half and if I look at the gap between your net unit growth that would imply you need to do about 15 -- a bit more than 15,000 exits in the second half. That\u2019s about double what you did in the second half of 2019 and actually even ahead of the exits you had in the second half of 2020. So is there anything in particular -- anything particular that\u2019s coming out there? Is it just conservative or anything you could mention on that? Tony Capuano : No. I mean, I think, we continue to expect to see deletions for the full year in that 1% to 1.5% rate. They -- excluding the impact of SVC, obviously, in terms of baseline deletions, they tend to ebb and flow a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But on a full year basis, we are increasingly comfortable with that guidance of 1% to 1.5% deletions, excluding SVC. Richard Clarke : Okay. That makes sense. So are you saying that the deletions in Q2, the sort of 2,000 or so 2,500 exits, that\u2019s a particularly low number and there might be a bit of a catch-up from that in the second half? Leeny Oberg : Yeah. They do -- they are really quite variable during the year. You could have one quarter with 7,000. You could have one quarter with 1,000. So it\u2019s really it varies and we do look at this region by region very carefully and looking at expirations and how things are going. So it is -- continues to be, as Tony said, it continues to be our best estimate at this point. It is clearly better than where we were earlier in the year, because again, we had a wider range that we were considering, and we have been able to firm up that range so that we feel better to say that we will be in the space that says we would be at the top end of that 3% to 3.5% range. And I should add, part of the comfort around that is with the openings as well that we have greater visibility on the openings and we are extremely pleased with the openings in the second quarter and year-to-date. Richard Clarke : Wonderful. Thank you very much. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Dori Kesten : Thanks for\u2026 Tony Capuano : Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Hi, Dori. Dori Kesten : Hey, Leeny. Given the trends that you have seen in new signings in opening schedule, when would you expect to see the pipeline resume quarter-over-quarter growth? I think in the last downturn you saw about six quarters of compression? Tony Capuano : Yeah. Again, I might give a different version of the answer I just gave on deletions. The pipeline tends to ebb and flow a little bit. Some of the indicators we look at, development committee volume for instance and we are starting to see an acceleration in our volume of deals, particularly in June and July in our biggest markets, specifically in the U.S. and Canada and in China and I think that is encouraging for us. The other thing is, remember, more than 25% of our volume right now is in conversions and because of the quick turn on those conversions, often those get signed and opened and never even make their way into the pipeline. And so that adds to some of the quarter-to-quarter variability as well. Dori Kesten : Okay. And can you just remind us what the difference is in fees between a -- between your pipeline that\u2019s luxury versus flex service on average? Tony Capuano : Sorry. The difference in fees, you said? Dori Kesten : Yeah. The -- like the long-term expectations of what a risk can own for you guys versus a residence? Tony Capuano : Sure. I mean setting aside the fact that there can be pretty wide variations from market-to-market, the rule of thumb we have shared in the past is that a luxury hotel stabilized annual fees could be as much as 10 times the annual fees of a select-service hotel like a Fairfield Inn. Dori Kesten : Okay. Thanks, Tony. Tony Capuano : You are welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario with Baird. Tony Capuano : Good morning, Michael. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two part questions, I wanted to focus on Bonvoy. I am not sure you mentioned it, what was the occupancy contribution during the quarter? And then the bigger picture question, maybe just, how are you thinking about further broadening the platform and value proposition for guests? Is there any renewed interest in travel adjacencies, partnerships or any other brand holes in the portfolio -- the brand portfolio that you are seeing, really just kind of what are your plans to add more value for greater share of everyone\u2019s travel wallet today? Tony Capuano : Great. Well, let me try to take both of those and Leeny may chime in as well. On your first question, Bonvoy penetration continues to recover. In Q2, we were almost 50%, 49.5% to be precise. That was a significant increase. We went as low as about 43% at the bottom of the pandemic. But it\u2019s still a couple of points shy of where we were pre-pandemic at about 52%. But the pace of penetration recovery, I think, is quite encouraging. And then on your second question, I think, we continue to look for opportunities to make the program stickier to engage with our customers even as they start to get back into travel and we tried to give you a few examples. I think the new travel insurance program is an example. The Uber partnership, I think, is a terrific example. The new branded credit cards are a good example. And then just the number of app downloads that we are seeing with the Marriott Bonvoy app. I think all of those point to our efforts and the, excuse me, the success of those efforts in trying to grow engagement among our Bonvoy members. Michael Bellisario : Helpful. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Of course. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Good morning, Vince. Vince Ciepiel : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of mine have been answered, but one thing I am trying to get a little bit more clarity on, as it relates to your perspective, the trajectory of U.S. RevPAR. I think you mentioned in the first few weeks of July down only 16, ADR impressive only down 2. It sounds like leisure is really contributing nicely to that. I am just curious how you are thinking about the handoff through the second half from leisure into more corporate and group, and just how sustainable that July run rate is? Tony Capuano : Well, certainly, the fall is going to be fascinating to watch, as more and more schools open for in-person learning, as more and more companies get back to the office. I think the data that is perhaps most telling from our perspective is some of the statistics we shared with you on special corporate bookings. As we mentioned, those bookings rose 23% in June as we compare to May. And then again, it\u2019s just the first three and half weeks of July, but we saw another 27% increase in those first three and half weeks of July versus the same three and half weeks in June. And so the magnitude and the steadiness of the growth in special corporate bookings I think is quite encouraging. And then you have heard us talk about this before, this blending of trip purpose continues to be a real and measurable phenomenon and we think it\u2019s good for our business and we think it will continue well beyond the end of the pandemic. With all that said, we will continue to be vigilant as we watch the pace of vaccinations around the world, the effectiveness of those vaccinations relative to the Delta variant and monitor the impacts of that on our business. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And one follow-up, if I may, with that ADR number in July, I think the recovery in ADR has been progressing really nicely and probably better than a lot of folks thought going into this year. Curious what do you attribute that progress in ADR too and how sustainable do you think that is through the second half? Tony Capuano : Well, we certainly look at the pace at which demand is recovering and the amount of pent-up demand is maybe best illustrated by the pricing power we are seeing in rate. We knew we would have that in leisure, but it\u2019s really encouraging to see that pricing power extend to both business transient and group. And in China, obviously, we have seen ADR come back at the same time and so you throw all that in the blender, it\u2019s really encouraging, and I think, it\u2019s just driven by the sheer volume of demand. Leeny Oberg : The only other thing I will add to that is the reality that so much of this depends on macroeconomic factors. And so as consumer confidence and consumer spending and general economic growth continue, that will be an important part of being able to continue to see this growth in demand and that has also -- always had an impact on how companies do their group bookings, do their business trips, et cetera, and that is another element of this price power. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Tony Capuano : Good morning, Bill. Bill Crow : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Hi, Bill. Bill Crow : Good morning. First, a clarification, I think, it was Smedes had asked about 2022 group segmentation. And I think your answer was about -- it was largely a social with little evidence of city wides coming back, was that really more about 2021 or is that still 2022? Leeny Oberg : We will get Jackie to get back to you with super specific. But I think the reality, Bill, overall, if you are still seeing big chunks of association, corporate and government nights in 2022. But at the margin, where we are seeing the strongest kind of in the period, for the period demand is in both the smaller and medium-sized groups, as well as the social groups, where, in many cases, they have put off having events for a year and now coming forward. But, again, when we think about the big chunks of business, we have still got, I mean, you -- I am sure you have heard from Gaylord about their bookings. There\u2019s still a wide swath across all the big segments of group business for 2022. The other thing to point out is that we still are in a position where the room nights are -- the current pace for group is still down for 2022. It\u2019s just down a lot less than it used to be and that it also -- we are seeing strong rate, where rate is actually up compared to 2019. And with each progressing quarter, you see those nights improve as you move farther and farther away from Q3 of 2021, where there\u2019s still obviously some concern around these variants. Bill Crow : Thanks for that clarification. If you will, my question that I really wanted to address is housekeeping and how are the guest requests for nightly housekeeping trending? We had heard from someone else that they had doubled over the last three months to six months, where the guests are proactively asking for that? And then, I guess, the second part of that is simply -- should we expect that the guest facing experience at luxury and upper upscale hotels will be very similar to where it was eventually in 2019, and therefore, the best opportunity for margin improvement on the housekeeping side might be at select service hotels? Is that a fair way to think about it? Tony Capuano : Okay. Well, so there\u2019s a few questions embedded in there. I think, on your first question, the housekeeping protocols will really continue to be driven by guest preference and will likely vary as you kind of move up and down the quality tiers. On your second point, I think I tend to agree with you that in the luxury and upper upscale tier, I think that the expectation -- the guest expectations should be much more similar to what they saw in a pre-pandemic environment. And then on your third question, I am not sure I necessarily agree with that for the simple reason that what\u2019s driving margin. Certainly, there\u2019s the cost side, but there is the topline piece as well, and while it\u2019s a single data point, we saw over 4th of July weekend, U.S. resort ADR up about 10%. But if you carve out just the luxury tier -- Jackie has to keep me honest here, but I think we were up close to 35% in ADR and so at that sort of premium and rate, you should expect some meaningful margin improvement even if you are back to pre-pandemic service levels. Bill Crow : Yeah. Perfect. Appreciate it. Thank you for your time. Tony Capuano : Of course. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist. Tony Capuano : Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Scholes : Hi. Hi. Good morning. One of the more controversial topics right now are -- is what percentage if any of business travel may be permanently lost, and certainly, a New York Times article yesterday throwing more fuel on that fire. I am wondering what your thoughts are around that question? Thank you. Tony Capuano : Well, again, we have shared a bunch of data points with you today that I think underpin our optimism about the return of business transient demand. I do think going forward this blending of trip purpose that you have heard me talk about, we continue to think it\u2019s great for our business and our industry and we continue to think it\u2019s here to stay for quite a while. We are optimistic about the return of business travel. We talk to about 700 corporate travel managers every month and we are hearing anecdotally from our customers, particularly those that are in customer service businesses, law firms, accounting firms, consulting firms, that it is critical to their business that they would be on the road and in-person with their customers. If anything going forward I do think it may be a bit more difficult to determine precisely looking at a guest walking through the lobby exactly what their trip purpose is. We are not asking you at the front desk are you here for business, are you here for leisure or both. But I do think you will see a lengthening of stay as a result of this blending of trip purposes. And in fact, that length of stay is measurable and we continue to see that through the second quarter of this year. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you for the color. Tony Capuano : Of course. Thanks, Patrick. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Tony Capuano : Great. Well, again, thank you all for your participation and interest this morning. I hope you hear our optimism about the pace of recovery we are seeing in many markets around the world. We are excited ourselves to be back on the road. We hope you are getting out there as well and we look forward to seeing you in our hotels in the weeks and months ahead. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this call may be recorded and I will be standing by should you need any assistance. And it's now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jackie Burka, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jackie Burka : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott 's third quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me are Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer, Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President Business Operations. And Betsy Dawn, our Vice President of Investor Relations. We are very high happy to not only be doing this call altogether in person this morning, but to be doing it from the road at the beautiful JW Marriott Orlando Bonnet Creek.  I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filing, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold.  Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2021 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of September 30th, 2021, even if they were not open and operating for the full-year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Over the past few months, I've been fortunate to have spent the majority of my time back on the road. I've been speaking with our associates, meeting with customers, attending industry conferences, and engaging with our owners and franchisees as I've been doing this week here in Orlando. My travels have taken me to Europe, the Caribbean, in Latin America, and many parts of the country here in the U.S. It's been wonderful to see so many people traveling again and to witness firsthand the resilience of global travel. This resilience was clearly evident during the third quarter.  The strong global RevPAR recovery momentum we experienced in the spring continued into the summer, thanks to sustained, robust leisure demand and impressive average daily rates. July worldwide RevPAR reached a new peak since the beginning of the pandemic, down just 23% compared to 2019 levels. Occupancy in July rose to 61%, an increase of over 500 basis points from June, while ADR was down less than 3% versus July of 2019. In August, global demand softened a bit primarily as a result of the impact of the Delta variant and the subsequent delay in many companies' return to the office.  However, demand stabilized in September before rising once again in October. Recovery trajectories remain varied by region and have been uneven. RevPAR and all of our regions except for greater China improved in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The recovery in Greater China has been choppier given it's zero COVID-19 policy. Mainland China was the first market to see RevPAR return to pre pandemic levels a quarter ago. And RevPAR rose again in July to 11% above July of 2019. But demand then fell significantly in August after the government imposed strict lockdowns in response to small regional COVID outbreaks, leading to a meaningful decline in RevPAR for the month. Demand then swiftly rose again in September, as soon as those restrictions were lifted. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR performance improved meaningfully to down less than 20% compared to the same quarter of 2019. Results were driven by elevated leisure demand and ADR nearly at 2019 levels. Total occupancy reached 67% in July, retrenched a bit in August, and held steady in September before rising again in October. Third quarter RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada improved across all brand tiers and all market segments, primary, secondary, and tertiary.  While primary markets are still the most challenged, these markets saw the larges RevPAR gains during the quarter as demand in gateway cities like New York continued to rise. Group demand accelerated nicely in the U.S and Canada in the quarter. Group room revenues for the quarter were down 46% versus the third quarter of 2019, a significant improvement compared to the second quarter's decline of 76% versus the same time period in '19. Group bookings have also been increasing. In the year for the year, U.S. -managed group bookings beat 2019 levels for each of the last 5 months through October, as event-booking windows have shortened during the pandemic.  Most importantly, group ADRs continued to rise, and for full-year 2022, it's currently pacing nearly 4% above pre -pandemic levels. In the U.S. and Canada, special corporate was the segment most impacted by the Delta variant during the quarter, given the delay in return to office timelines. As a reminder, the special corporate segment represents business transient customers who book at pre -negotiated rates. We estimate this segment has been accounting for roughly 1/2 of business transient room nights, although we can't know with certainty the trip purpose for transient bookings other than special corporate.  The special corporate segment therefore gives us the best indication of business demand trends. Special corporate bookings showed steady recovery each month this year until we saw a slight pullback in the back half of the third quarter. The gradual upward trajectory returned in October with bookings versus 2019 growing each week during the month. Special corporate bookings are currently down less than 40% compared to the same time frame in 2019.  From conversations with our corporate customers, we know that many of them, especially those with more client-facing jobs, are increasingly eager to get back on the road. We expect a recovery in business transient to gradually continue as more workers returned to the office, guest visitation policies are relaxed, and greater numbers of employees are permitted to travel again. We also expect the traditional business trip to continue to evolve with a blurring of the lines between business and leisure travel. In the Middle East and Africa, third quarter RevPAR came in less than 20% below pre -pandemic levels, led by strong performance in the UAE and Qatar. RevPAR top third quarter 2019 levels in Qatar, thanks to preparations for the 2022 World Cup. While RevPAR in the UAE was nearly even with 2019, largely benefiting from Staycations. Europe's recovery took another large step forward in the quarter. Occupancy doubled in one quarter to reach 47% as many key international borders reopened, entry restrictions eased, and almost all hotels were once again open. The Caribbean and Latin America posted third quarter RevPAR 18% below 2019 levels. Demand for our resort properties remained robust, particularly in the Caribbean and Mexico.  Urban destinations, while slowly improving, still lagged. Historically, the third quarter is the region's softest quarter seasonally, yet many resorts saw record occupancy in ADRs, and our luxury ADR in the region for the quarter was ahead of 2019 levels by 32%. The recovery in Asia-Pacific, excluding China, advanced more slowly in the third quarter. Results were mixed across countries, though India saw meaningful improvement in demand as COVID caseloads dropped and restrictions lifted.  Encouragingly, many countries in the region have recently taken significant steps to reopen travel, such as announcing new vaccinated travel lanes. Demand in October accelerated nicely as a result. Developers\u2019 sentiment continues to improve in step with the global recovery and the pace of signings has picked up meaningfully this year. At the end of September, our pipeline stood at nearly 477,000 rooms. Gross room openings through the third quarter of this year exceeded the first 9 months of 2019 by 25% and surpassed the same period last year by almost 50%, and deletions from the pipeline remain at the low end of our long-term trend.  Conversions remain a meaningful driver of rooms growth, given our impressive roster of conversion-friendly brands and the meaningful top and bottom-line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system. We've already added more conversion rooms in the first nine months of this year than we did in all of 2019. Accounting for over 30% of all signings in the first 9 months of this year compared to around 15% of signings pre -pandemic, conversions are expected to be a significant contributor to growth over the next several years.  For the full-year, we still expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to around 6%. With more clarity around our estimated full-year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth will be approximately 3.5%. The attractiveness of our brands is increasing development activity, our momentum around conversions, and our industry-leading pipeline give us confidence that we will see meaningful rooms growth going forward. We expect that over the next several years, we will get back to our typical mid-single-digit net rooms growth that we demonstrated prior to the pandemic.  However, the exact timing is hard to predict and will depend on a host of factors related to the global recovery, including the lending environment and evolving supply chain dynamics. Supply chain issues have pushed some openings and construction starts out a few months. But the deals continue to move forward. Turning to Marriott Bonvoy, global enrollments driven by digital sign-ups, accelerated during the quarter, growing the program to a 157 million members as of the end of September. We remain extremely focused on fostering engagement with our members.  We recently rolled out numerous successful special promotions such as our second annual Week of Wonders and the re-launch of Marriott Bonvoy Moments, where members can use points to gain VIP access to a broad variety of experiences. Additionally, we just announced several loyalty program updates including status, award, and point extensions, which should further encourage members to stay with us as global travel rebounds. Since the start of the pandemic, we've grown our share of bookings coming through our digital and other direct channels.  Over 76% of our global room nights in the first 3 quarters of the year were booked through our direct channels, with around half of these booked through our digital channels. In closing, I firmly believe that the long-term recovery is on track. The resilience of travel and consumers desire to visit our 7,900 global properties is undeniable. And I'm looking ahead with a lot of optimism about our future. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. We're pleased with our third quarter results which reflect the continued meaningful improvement in the global recovery. Third quarter worldwide RevPAR was down 26% compared to the same quarter in 2019, despite the impact of the Delta variant in the latter half of the quarter. In comparison, global RevPAR declined 44% in the second quarter versus the same period in 2019. Worldwide occupancy rose to 58% in the third quarter and ADR was only 4% below the third quarter of 2019. We've been very pleased to see rate almost back at pre -pandemic levels in just 20 months.  In comparison, global ADR have lagged the recovery in RevPAR in prior downturns, taking around 5 years to rebound after the 2009 recession and around 4 years to recover post 9-11. Importantly, the recovering rate has not just been driven by customer mix. Our third quarter retail or rack rate in the U.S. and Canada was essentially flat with the third quarter of 2019. Gross fee revenue reached $776 million in the third quarter. Our non - RevPAR related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $173 million in the third quarter, 19% ahead of 2019 levels.  Credit card branding fees of $113 million were up 11% compared to the 2019 third quarter, on the back of strong new account acquisitions and robust global card spending. Our residential branding fees also had another outstanding quarter totaling $18 million. Incentive management fees or IMF totaled $53 million in the quarter. Over 40% of IMFs were earned at resort properties, with IMF from our luxury resorts around the world up almost 30% compared to the third quarter of 2019.  We were pleased to see positive results from our owned and leased portfolio in the quarter, primarily due to improve performance at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Third quarter G&A and other expense totaled $212 million and were impacted by compensation true-ups and additional legal expenses. We continue to realize meaningful savings from the significant restructuring activities undertaken last year, and we still expect full-year G&A and other to be roughly $800 million down 15% to 2019 levels. We also recorded a $164 million pretax loss on extinguishment of debt during the quarter associated with the repurchase of a billion dollars of our 5.75% senior notes due in May 2025.  As part of our balance sheet management, we have focused on bringing down our average interest rate, lengthening our average debt maturities, and reducing our debt balances. Over the last 18 months, we have reduced our outstanding net debt by $1.4 billion. At the hotel level, we have significantly improved margins to lower break-even occupancy levels around the world. In the third quarter, even with RevPAR for managed properties in the U.S. and Canada down 27% versus pre -pandemic levels, 97% of our managed hotels in the region had positive GOP or gross operating profit.  We're proud of the work our teams have done in maximizing margins during the pandemic. We expect many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we have implemented will be maintained as occupancies continue to rise. Given the current labor environment, we are keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation as associates are hired back and open positions are filled. But our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years. As demand continues to rise, we're working closely with our owners and franchisees to maximize hotel profitability while delivering the outstanding guest experiences our customers expect from our brands.  We're close to completing an extensive review of our brand standards and are already implementing numerous changes intended to help reduce into our operating expenses while improving flexibility based on customer needs as occupancies rise. Looking ahead, we're still not in a position to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, but I would like to share some general observations and provide color on certain additional items, where we do have some visibility. We're optimistic about the pace of global recovery as we look ahead into next year, as more markets reopen around the world. With meaningful continued improvement in business transient and group demand, continued growth in leisure demand, and healthy levels of ADR, we expect to make substantial progress in closing the gap to 2019 RevPAR levels by the end of next year, assuming no major setbacks in the pandemic recovery. To further help your modeling for 2021, as a reminder, the fourth and the first quarters of the year historically have seen lower demand than the second and third quarters. In 2019, global occupancy fell around 6% points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  Turning to fees, at current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full-year 2020. RevPAR versus 2019, could be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variabilities of IMFs and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to benefit from strong credit card and residential branding fees. Interest expense is now anticipated to be around $420 million.  Full-year cash taxes are now expected to be $350 million to $375 million. Our anticipated full-year cash flow from the loyalty program has not changed from our expectation a quarter-ago. We still expect it to be positive for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we've received in 2020, we continue to anticipate modestly negative cash flows from loyalty.  We remain focused on carefully watching capital expenditures and we now expect full-year investment spending of $525 to $550 million below our expectation of $575 to $625 million that we shared last quarter. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. As we think about capital allocation, retaining our investment grade credit rating remains a top priority. We're making excellent progress bringing our credit ratios back in line as we continue to generate positive cash flow and manage our spending levels. Assuming this progress continues, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022. We're very enthusiastic about how our business is performing, and we're happy now to take your questions. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Once again if you would like to ask a question, and we will take our first question from Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Joe Greff : Good morning everybody. Tony Capuano : Morning. Joe Greff : Thank you for taking my questions. I know you don't want to necessarily talk about 2022 with any great specificity. But I just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about the leisure segment as we head into next year, obviously, that's a segment this year, where demand has recovered the most, pricing has been fairly inelastic, and price obviously upped significantly. Do you think leisure can maintain some growth trajectory in 2022 or do you think that has to come down? And then obviously, it's more than compensated by the growth in the business transient segment. How are you thinking about that right now? Tony Capuano : Thanks for the question, Joe. We are -- continue to be quite bullish about leisure. We think there's lots more run room in terms of this leisure-led recovery. You heard some of the statistics that Leeny and I shared in our prepared remarks about the performance and the pricing power that we've seen in our resort destinations. And so, the short answer is we absolutely believe that leisure can continue to grow into '22. Leeny Oberg : Joe, one other comment I'll make is that we've seen -- actually, since 2010, we've seen leisure trips grow faster than business trip. And I think with the reality that there's still some pent-up demand as well as increased savings rates, and frankly, more flexibility in travel that we absolutely believe that leisure can continue to grow going into '22. Joe Greff : Great. And you mentioned it on the call and you haven it in the press release that you have greater visibility on deletions and I know that the room deletions comment was really specific for this year. Can you talk about the visibility on deletions for next year and maybe where that trends? Obviously, I'm not looking for a gross or net rooms growth number, but just how are you see the visibility on deletions for '22 maybe relative to historical percentage deletion rates? Leeny Oberg : Great question. We're in the middle of our budgeting process now, so I think we feel extremely solid about the numbers for '21. It's too early to give you a specific number, but obviously the one-time bump that we had this year from the SEC portfolio, we don't expect to happen. And I do believe that it will fall back to more normal levels in 2022 with perhaps still a tinge of COVID -related impact. But I think more likely to be falling back into levels that you've seen before. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you, guys. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Joe. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Maybe as my first -- Tony asked the same question. If I could, but you're focusing a little bit more on corporate and group. Obviously, we're right at the cusp of probably how much lead time you have. But can you just talk a little bit about corporate behavior and give us a little color through as the things are rebounding a little bit in October, but what little signs do we have heading into '22 on, what I consider core business transient, and then also just maybe on the group bookings front? Tony Capuano : Of course. The biggest improvement we expect or that we saw this quarter came from business transient, which is -- already picked up even a bit in October. We're quite encouraged. Special corporate bookings have improved each week in October as when we compare them to 2019. And because you asked for a little bit of granularity, I can tell you that new special corporate bookings in October for some of our key customer categories had some really nice growth, and I'll give you 2 examples. Accounting and consulting grew 35% over what we saw last month, and technology business grew about 31% versus last month.  When I switch to group, which was the second part of your question, at the end of September, roof revenue was pacing down around 43% versus '19. But we think we can see some improvement from that level given the volume of last-minute bookings, which have been quite a significant recent trend. In the quarter -- fourth quarter bookings in October, were above October of '19 by the highest percentage we've seen since the pandemic began. And maybe the last thing I would tell you on group that is also quite encouraging, when we look at the group that's on the books for 2022, the ADR for that group is up to about 3 -- almost 4% relative to the group that was on the books for 2019. Shaun Kelley : Thank you. And maybe just as my follow-up, if we could -- could you just give us a little bit -- there's been more discussion in the industry than probably as normal about small and medium-sized corporates and that activity rebounding a bit faster than what we've seen in maybe the larger Fortune 500 or top 50 accounts. Could you talk a little bit about that exposure for Marriott if you break it down that way or maybe the behaviors that you're seeing between small and medium and large-sized corporates? Tony Capuano : Yes, of course. Historically, we saw business transient business coming out of small and medium-sized companies was about 60% of our business transient revenue. Now, given that the larger businesses have been a little slower to recover during the pandemic, for the first 3 quarters of this year, we've seen about 75% of that revenue coming from small and medium accounts. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Tony Capuano : Of course. Operator : And we will take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas Allen : Thank you. Given much of your marketing spend is done through the system fund, it'd be interesting to hear just an update on where you are in your marketing strategy and spend for this pre - COVID. I remember back to early 2019, you did a big Bonvoy push. I'm just trying to think about what you're doing now and potential implications for distribution and market share. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : You're absolutely right that broadly speaking, our marketing spend is a function of the top-line revenue from our hotels. And that is in 2 places Thomas. 1 is obviously in classic sales and marketing fund, but also when you think about the revenues coming into our loyalty program are also driven by a combination of our credit card spend as well as hotel revenues and penetration of Bonvoy stays at our hotels. And so clearly that is still meaningfully down from 2019. However, obviously a whole lot better than it was in 2020.  And I'm sure you've seen lately, we've done a fabulous new campaign that has been on everywhere from airlines to sports -- on sports games, etc., that really emphasize how special it is to be able to travel and to have experiences that open your mind, if you will. And so, it's been a really concentrated reminder to the -- to our consumers of how special travel is. And that new campaign has generated incredible response from all the different customers and media touch points. Thomas Allen : Okay. Just as a follow-up, just can you update us on OTA distribution and your thoughts there? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Yeah, sure. It's very similar to what we've talked about before, which is that clearly, the OTAs have gained share as a result of special corporate being down on a relative basis. But we're still seeing that our digital channels are gaining share faster than the OTAs. So, while -- I'd say the OTAs are probably now at about 14% of total bookings. You still remember that our direct channels are over 76% and about half of that is coming through the digital channel. So, we're very pleased to see that digital continues to gain share very nicely. Our mobile app downloads have grown really well. So, the OTAs have been an important driver of business for us during this pandemic, but I think from a share perspective, we're continuing to see the same trends we've been seeing. Thomas Allen : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Patrick Scholes : Hi. Good morning. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : Morning, morning. Hilton has been pretty vocal about having daily housekeeping on demand and I haven't heard as much from you folks. What do you think about that going toward especially for your mid-scale types of properties? Tony Capuano : Plus, a timely question Patrick, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've just spent 2 full days with a significant number of our owners and franchisees here in North America. As we shared with them, we continue to run a few different proofs of concept of valuating how we strike the right balance between guest expectations and the economic challenges that our owner community continues to face. We got tremendous engagement and input from that community, and I think we continue to move towards a more definitive and permanent position on housekeeping. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up question. You had noted eventually getting back to your mid-single digits long-term net unit growth. But for next year, is it reasonable to assume that net unit growth percentages will be roughly similar to what they are this year? Tony Capuano : It's too early to give specific expectations. Now, what I can tell you is we are with increasing confidence feeling like in the midterm we're going to get back to that mid-single digit rooms growth. But I think it'll be a bit challenging next year, and we'll be challenged for a few reasons. I think number 1, the continued unpredictability of the pandemic, but maybe more impactful, we have seen some delays in construction starts, some of which have been direct results of interruption to the supply chain.  But again, those feel like short-term impediments. And in fact, it's interesting if you look at the pipeline. Both in Q2 and Q3, the fall out we saw was the lowest we've seen in the last 3 years. So that would certainly suggest that while we may have to struggle through a bit of these short-term delays, it actually bolsters our confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-single digit growth rate. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you for the update. Tony Capuano : You're welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Grambling : Hi. Thanks. I guess to follow up on the initial 2022 expectations, what guardrails can investors think about around the more concrete expense items such as G&A? And should the relationship you've outlined between RevPAR and EBITDA generally hold as we think into future years? Leeny Oberg : Sure. A couple of things. On the G&A front, I think certainly you have to take into consideration what's going on with wage and benefit inflation. And then I think as we get back to more fully loaded RevPAR numbers in the system, I think you should expect that for the next year anyway, that it'll be a little bit higher than just inflation as we get the organization back to full operations.  But again, I still think that you're looking at overall levels of G&A reflecting the significant work that we did in 2020 to rebuild Marriott so that it still will be meaningfully lower than the kind of guidance that we gave at the beginning of 2020, which was $950 to $960 million. Similarly, as you ask about -- what was your other question that you asked about, Stephen? Stephen Grambling : Just as we think about the relationship between RevPAR -- Leeny Oberg : Yeah, for EBITDA and RevPAR. Yes, I think it will be the same except perhaps a little bit bigger, as we have more and more owned lease profits coming back as well as IMF coming back. If you remember, pre -pandemic, we were close to $50 million per point of RevPAR. We're obviously getting hopefully closer to $40 million and that's obviously hotel-related RevPAR. The non-RevPAR will tie much more into both the residential fees as well as the credit card fees, but it should expand. Although, I think again in 2022, it will still be closer to the $40 million in 2022 and then again continue to grow from there. Stephen Grambling : And since you mentioned the non-hotel-related fees and credit card fees, I think you referenced that you'd had very strong sign-ups. Can you just remind us of how a customer typically progresses once it signs up? Do you see a burst of spending right at sign-up or is there a gradual build. Are you seeing any changes in engagement than that? Leeny Oberg : Absolutely, absolutely a gradual build. You're right. It absolutely takes a while to get going. Stephen Grambling : Great. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask you a little bit more on the group bookings that you are seeing in the U.S. Is it fair to say that that sort of larger CVD to more group-oriented properties are continuing to lag or have you seen -- are you seeing any uptick there and maybe any other just changes in the competition of group? Tony Capuano : Of course. Maybe I'll give you some macro-observations. But before I do that, certainly we're seeing really strong social group activity and expect that to continue. In terms of city-wise, which I think was part of your question, it was interesting. We spent the last 2 days with many of our full-service owners here in the U.S., and I think their view is they're seeing softness in city-wide activity in the first half of '22, but are hopeful they'll start to see some pickup in the back half of next year.  More broadly around group, you heard some of the comments I made in the prepared remarks. Q3 revenues down 46% in group as compared to '19, which was a big uptick compared to the statistics we shared with you last quarter, where we were down 76% versus '19. The other statistic I would share with you that I think is interesting, in-the quarter-for-the-quarter bookings in October were above in-the-quarter-for the-quarter bookings from October '19 by over 30%, which is the highest percentage increase we've seen since the beginning of the pandemic. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. And then I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about what your owners are saying on labor costs. It sounds like you're somewhat optimistic about growth in IMF next year, and I'm just trying to square that with the fact. We heard from one owner last night that labor's up 20%. I'm just wondering what your folks are saying. Tony Capuano : Of course. Like many other companies around the country and around the world, we are seeing some challenges with labor. It won't surprise you that those challenges are most acute in the markets where we've seen the most rapid recovery in demand, so leisure destinations kind of leading the way. From our perspective, we're -- we have a multi-pronged approach to try and address those issues.  We've been doing -- we've ramped up our efforts in social and targeted marketing, highlighting the extraordinary opportunities that exist at Marriott. We have in some instances used one-time sign-on bonuses or temporary incentives. And we do still have many open positions to fill. But we are seeing a bit of an uptick in applicant flow and have been filling jobs pretty steadily over the last several months. Leeny Oberg : And I would add, we are not hearing from our owners that it's universally 20%. There may be a couple of markets here and there where that could be happening in a particular situation, but broadly speaking, while it's clearly meaningfully higher than it was back in '18 and '19, I would say 20% is not the norm. And the only other thing I'll say is that while ADR is still not back to 2019 levels, traditionally in our business, we have been able to see that ADR tends to be able to hold onto inflation that we've seen ADR increases that at least inflation, if not higher. And while clearly at the moment we're not back there yet, that should be helpful as well. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Katz : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. David Katz : Good morning. I know that we have seemingly a fair amount of time to discuss this, but with respect to capital returns, if you could just talk about what would have to happen for capital returns to maybe start earlier or later, for that matter. And within the construct of those capital returns, any changes in how you would think about the mix of buybacks versus dividends and the puts and takes around those just so we can start the conversation now nice and early? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So, first of all, similar messages to what you've heard before, which maintaining our investment-grade credit rating is a top priority for Marriott. We do want to continue to get our credit ratios back to the 3 to 3.5 times levels of debt-to-EBITDA. We are really pleased with the progress that we're making in that regard, probably happened faster than we might have imagined a year ago. And so, with that in mind, we are feeling increasingly confident that we'll be able to turn to returning capital to shareholders, perhaps with continued progress in the recovery in the back half of 2022.  When we think about the mix of dividends versus share repurchases, I think it's instructive to look at what we did in the great recession, which is that we -- as we move closer and closer to that 3 times to 3.5 times range, we reinstituted a modest, a smaller than -- smaller than it was before cash dividend and then returned to the normal level of cash dividend before we began share repurchases. And Tony and I will be talking about that to the board and continuing to have a dialog, but I don't think that that's a pretty good framework for you to consider as we move forward.  I think from a rationale, David, I think one of the things we really like about the 3 to 3.5 times level for us is the flexibility then it then gives us when we see an opportunistic investment come our way. And so, we do want to return to that area knowing that when those come up, we want to be able to take advantage of them. And in that regard, re-establishing that policy and those levels, I think is where we're headed. David Katz : Perfect. And if I can just follow-up with one model in detail, when we look back historically versus this year with the differential and cost reimbursements in revenue in costs. There are periodic positives versus negatives, and this year it's been more of a positive so far. Is there any sort of input you can help us, with the remainder of this year and how that evolves into next year, just to keep our model straight? Leeny Oberg : Sure. I think as a reminder, over time the idea is that is essentially net neutral to the Company, i.e., these are cost reimbursements without a profit component. And the timing of the revenues and the expenses can obviously vary. Just to your point, as you look at what's happened this year, you have seen that the gap has narrowed between the net reimbursed revenue line, and that's really a reflection of loyalty.  When you think about last year, far fewer redemptions were taking place and we had lowered our administrative costs in the loyalty program to take into consideration the much lower RevPAR that we had in the system. So naturally, that has come back to a higher level this year as -- and redemption have also grown meaningfully. But again, I think over time, you'll continue to see some variation quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. But over time, the general direction is net neutral to the Company. David Katz : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Will take our next question from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Tony Capuano : Good morning, Bill. Leeny Oberg : Morning Bill. Are you there Bill function on your phone. Bill Crow : All right. Sorry about that. Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Morning. Bill Crow : Tony, I appreciate the comments on special corporate rated business travel and the pickup you're seeing in that consulting and technology in particular. Curious whether the destinations have changed. As we look at the STR data, it's pretty barren in some of these bigger -- New York, Chicago, San Francisco. Is that consistent with where your -- what you're seeing from the special corporate rate of business? Leeny Oberg : First of all, as we talked about, the smaller and medium-sized business transient has been relatively stronger, and that, to your point, is more likely to be in secondary and tertiary markets. However, during Q3, we saw the best improvement in our big cities in special corporate that we've seen since the pandemic. So, I think it is absolutely moving in the right direction, including those larger cities. Bill Crow : Okay. And then my follow-up is kind of on a bigger picture basis. Should we be putting a bigger risk premium on the fee income coming out of China given the changes in Government attitudes going on there? Tony Capuano : Well, how much time do we have, Bill? I think -- listen, China is a really important market for us, it is a dynamic and evolving market. Like anybody that's got a significant footprint in China, we continue to watch with great interest and great focus the evolving landscape there. But when you look at the composition of ownership that we have, when you look at the percentage of our portfolio that has whole or partial ownership by state-owned enterprises, I don't think we look at it as having any really remarkably higher risk profile than we've thought for the last number of quarters. Leeny Oberg : And one reminder is that -- is I'm sure you know all too well; we typically do not have an owner's priority on our IMF there. And so, the IMF actually behaves very similarly to base fees. Bill Crow : Okay. Thank you for the comments. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Hey, Dori. Good morning. Dori Kesten : Hey. Based on early conversations that you're having with developers, how do you expect signings to trend over the next several quarters, and are there certain markets that you're having to provide additional incentives that you haven't historically? Tony Capuano : Well, as I mentioned earlier, the pace of global signings has picked up significantly since the bottom of the trough created by the pandemic, year-to-date our signings are up or about 30% compared to where we were same time last year. What we hear anecdotally from our partners, financing for acquisitions and conversions of existing assets continues to be pretty readily available, construction financing for new builds is more challenging.  The construction financing that is out there as we've seen in other more conventional down-markets tends to rely heavily on relationship lending, tends to rely heavily on quality of sponsorship and tends to rely heavily on the quality of the brand affiliation. In terms of additional investments, we are not seeing any remarkable spike in the use of the Company's balance sheet. The guiding principles that have guided our deal-making in good and bad markets remain intact. In instances where we see strategic imperative or in instances where we think we can drive premium fees and earnings for the Company, we will consider use of the Company's balance sheet. Dori Kesten : And I may have missed this, but what was the reasoning for the lower investment spending in 2020 -- I'm sorry, in '21? Leeny Oberg : No, it's fine. As we've talked about before, a couple of things : 1. is that we did talk about how some construction starts have pushed forward a little bit, and so that would then impact some of when the key money goes out the door. But probably more importantly and larger is we just really are able to refine the amount of CapEX that we're going to spend on system CapEX as well as the Company's new headquarters building. And when you put those together, you get the reduction that we described today in the press release. Dori Kesten : Okay. Great. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Your line is now open. Rich Hightower : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Leeny Oberg : Morning. Rich Hightower : Just in terms of the development pipeline again, I guess given that it's a little more heavily skewed towards luxury and upper upscale than maybe some of your peers, wondering if you could describe any differences in the economics of those tiers specifically versus the select service tiers. And even by geography, are there are there any pockets of tightness more so than the average around construction costs, lending availability, etc. etc. that we should be aware of? Tony Capuano : Sure. Maybe I'll remind you, we got a question on this topic a quarter ago. And I think the specific question we got was, within our portfolio in terms of the economics to MI or to Marriott from a fee perspective, how would a luxury hotel like a Ritz-Carlton compare to a lower-tier product like a Fairfield Inn? And the response we gave a quarter ago was obviously subject to variability by geography.  But it's about 10X. We see about 10 times the fee potential in a luxury hotel that we typically achieve in a select service hotel. They are more complex projects, they are more capital-intensive projects, the complexities of getting them financed are not insignificant. But as evidenced by the volume of luxury in upper upscale on our portfolio, the strength of our brands, I think command pretty effective ability to source debt for those projects. Rich Hightower : Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate that. Maybe I'll turn it on its head for a second, but the economics to the owners as well, are there any key differences in that regard versus what actually impacts Marriott itself? Tony Capuano : As I said, the -- these are complex projects, you heard in Leeny's prepared comments, some pretty extraordinary numbers about our branded residential business. And with increasing frequency, we see the luxury projects being developed as mixed used projects that include a branded residential component that's often critical in again, underwriting those projects and getting them financed. In leisure destinations the premiums we've seen in luxury rates over the last couple of quarters have been extraordinary. Rich Hightower : All right, thank you. Tony Capuano : Of course. Operator : And we will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is now open. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I want to circle back on the group looking outlook. I know you talked about price rates being up 4% next year. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what group bookings is relative to 2019. And I think there's this idea that there's going to be a lot of pent-up demand for it, but I'm wondering if that's actually translated into bookings yet. Maybe obviously not for Q1, but are there quarters in Q2, Q3, or Q4 where the -- what's on the books is back to '19 levels or are groups not pulling the trigger just yet? Thanks. Tony Capuano : Of course. Thanks, Robin. If I look at 2022 in aggregate and I look at total group revenue on the books at the end of this past quarter and compare that to what was on the books at the end of the third quarter in '19 for 2020, we're down about 20% in gross revenue. We're down about 23% in total booked rooms, and as I mentioned earlier, were up nearly 4% in ADR. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Now that's helpful, thanks. And then just on the lower investment spend, and I know Leeny, you mentioned it was kind of refining some of the headquarters\u2019 and system's CapEX. Is there -- is something related to the -- there's something like impaired contract investment in the quarter that -- was there a significant project or maybe it's multiple ones that got canceled or something? Just wondering if that is related. Leeny Oberg : No, not at all. Robin Farley : So, what's driving the impaired contract investment in the quarter? Leeny Oberg : Actually, it was a -- it was not a contract investment. This was an initiative for some international hotels that we had begun in 2019 related to operational improvements in some international hotels. But as a result of COVID and all that is going on in those hotels, it no longer makes sense to carry forward with that. So, the investment that we had put on our books to date needed to be written off. It was actually a program initiative of the Company for the hotels, it was not related to a hotel contract. Robin Farley : So, it was like you had made loans to some hotel owners as an incentive and then now the loans are written off? Is that roughly how it works? Leeny Oberg : No. No, actually as you know, very often we have programs that we do for our hotels that they reimburse us for. And in some cases, we actually develop the programs and over time, the hotel owners pay us back. And in this case, we had begun work on the program and invested some funds to develop the program and decided once COVID came, it no longer made sense to implement that program at the hotels and have them repay us over time, so we wrote off the investment. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you, that's helpful. I don't know if -- one final. You made a comment when talking about priority of using your cash flow reinstating a smaller dividend than larger dividend, and you mentioned the investment-grade rating to take advantage of opportunities -- to be opportunistic, I think, was the expression you used. Is there anything acquisition-wise that you think about where you would be looking for opportunities? I don't know if you can characterize anything. And then that's it for me. Thanks. Tony Capuano : I would say that the approach we've taken to evaluating those sorts of opportunities remains intact. If you look at our track record in this area, we don't feel any particular pressure to do acquisitions simply for the sake of scale. If we see a gap in our portfolio, whether that be brand gap or tier gaps that we think represents significant growth opportunity or a significant gap in our geographic footprint that can be solved the way we did with AC in Spain or Protea in South Africa, we would certainly take a look at that. But I think Leeny's comment is really around our capital philosophy to ensure we are in a good position should one of those opportunities present itself. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquire. Your line is now open. Chad Beynon : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the continued recovery in rates, given how strong it's been, Anthony, you talked about the outlook for Group, but I'm wondering if you could touch on maybe some of the differences in leisure BT in group. Have you guys been able to test and learn maybe how high you can push pricing, or is this tough to do without kind of full compression nights? Tony Capuano : Well, there's a lot in that question. I think the good news, what we've seen through the last couple of quarters, is the ability of the leisure segment to create compression. And the creation of that compression, almost irrespective of which segment drives the compression, is driving really terrific pricing power. I think when you look at our retail rates across the portfolio, we are essentially back to 2019 levels, and that's another statistical illustration of the strength of our pricing power, and what's really encouraging about that is that we're achieving that pricing power, albeit at lower occupancy levels than we were experiencing in 2019. Chad Beynon : Okay. Great, and then a quick follow-up, maybe a near-term modeling help. Leeny, you mentioned that normal seasonality is for Q4 over Q3, to be down 6% sequentially from a RevPAR standpoint. Has there been a major difference looking back on leisure versus corporate, given that I think we all expect for corporate to improve sequentially here. Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Yeah, sure. I think when you look overall at the business, it is traditionally the case that you have lower business overall. Again, I think interestingly, I actually expect leisure could continue to strengthen because when you think about coming out of the pandemic, increasingly people are feeling comfortable traveling where we see festive bookings in places like CALA, etc., its great demand, and the holidays are pacing up well compared to 2019, so I think we're very encouraged.  But the overall message we were trying to impart is that typically, it is a period just with family holidays, etc. that it is a lower occupancy quarter. And it's worth mentioning that when you go back to 2019 and '18 levels and you look at our EBITDA in Q3 and Q4 as we talked about in our comments, that typically Q3 is a higher RevPAR -driving quarter than Q4 typically. Chad Beynon : Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Thanks for the help. Operator : And I will now turn the program back over to Tony Capuano for any additional or closing remarks. Tony Capuano : Thank you very much, and thanks to all of you for your continued interest in the Company and the recovery of the global travel and tourism industry. We are back on the road and we look forward to running into you in our hotels around the world. Thanks again, and have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jackie Burka, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jackie Burka : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Business Operations; and Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on this day, which marks the 1-year anniversary of Arne's passing. I know everyone on this call, especially our Marriott associates, miss our dear friend, an inspirational leader, a great deal. We can take comfort knowing his amazing legacy lives on in the incredible work of the thousands of people around the world who wear a Marriott name badge. Let me turn the call back over to Jackie to get us underway in discussing this quarter's results. Jackie Burka : So let me quickly remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2021 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of December 31, 2021, even if they were not open and fully operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to pre-pandemic for 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website.  Tony? Tony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie. We're very pleased with the remarkable progress we made in 2021 across the entire global portfolio despite the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We finished the year on a real high note with the emergence of Omicron having a limited impact on results in the fourth quarter. In December, global ADR was 3% above 2019 levels, and occupancy for the month gained further ground compared to December of 2019, driving global RevPAR to an 11% decline versus 2019. This was a 53 percentage point improvement from the RevPAR decline in January of 2021. In the fourth quarter, global RevPAR was 19% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Global occupancy for the quarter came in at 58%, 12 percentage points below 2019, while ADR was only 2% shy of 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter RevPAR declined 15% compared to 2019. Results were driven by strong ADR, which was less than 2% below pre-pandemic levels. Further strengthening of already robust leisure travel and steady improvement in the recovery of business transient and group demand also helped results. Fourth quarter group room revenue in the U.S. and Canada was down 32% versus 2019, a 9%-point improvement from the third quarter decline. With booking windows still much shorter than usual, in the quarter for the quarter bookings were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Group cancellations ticked up late last year and early this year due to Omicron mostly for arrival dates in January and February, but those cancellations have slowed more recently. New group bookings have also been gaining momentum, especially in the year for the year. In fact, just last week, Salesforce held a large company meeting in New York City that was booked just 1 month before the event. It was the largest internal meeting Salesforce has held since the start of the pandemic with over 25,000 room nights across 11 of our properties. While special corporate demand in the U.S. and Canada was still well below '19 levels, there was gradual improvement in the fourth quarter. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, bookings in the quarter were down 33%, 11% -- excuse me, 11 percentage points better than the decline in the bookings in the third quarter. Weekly bookings around the end of last year were impacted by Omicron, but they have recovered since the trough in early January. All of our international regions, except for Greater China, posted sequential RevPAR recovery from the third to the fourth quarter as more borders reopened and travel restrictions eased. Greater China's fourth quarter 27% RevPAR decline compared to 2019 was in line with the decline in the third quarter as their zero COVID policy once again resulted in the lockdown of several cities. The Middle East and Africa or MEA region performed particularly well in the fourth quarter, really demonstrating the resilience of travel demand. With relatively high vaccination rates and low travel restrictions during the quarter, the Middle East has become a safe, easy place to visit. Led by strength in the UAE, fourth quarter RevPAR in MEA rose 8% in 2019 driven by 20% higher ADR -- excuse me, 8% above '19 driven by 20% higher ADR. Fourth quarter occupancy in MEA topped 65%, the highest of our regions. Leisure demand was remarkably strong, benefiting from a significant increase in international visitors. Room nights from international guests rose nearly 60% from the third to the fourth quarter. Throughout the pandemic, strengthening our valuable loyalty platform and engaging with our Marriott Bonvoy members have been key areas of focus. In the fourth quarter of '21, 52% of room nights globally and 58% of room nights in the U.S. and Canada were booked by Bonvoy members. And global membership grew to over 160 million members at year-end driven by strong digital sign-ups. Turning to development. Both room additions and signings were strong in '21 despite ongoing challenges associated with the pandemic. Despite industry-wide preconstruction and construction delays, some labor shortages and supply chain issues, we added a record 86,000 gross rooms and 517 properties leading to 6.1% gross rooms growth for the year. Our global net rooms growth was 3.9%, above our previous expectation, given deletions were towards the low end of those expectations. Our deletion rate for 2021 was 2.1% or 1.2% excluding the exit of 88 Service Properties Trust hotels. We are also pleased that we continue to grow our share of rooms globally. In 2021, around 15% of all global new build rooms opened under our brands compared to our year-end room share of 7%. This share is expected to continue as we had 18% of all global rooms under construction at the end of '21, more than twice our current share of open rooms. Our development team signed franchise and management agreements for approximately 92,000 rooms during 2021, and our year-end global pipeline totaled roughly 485,000 rooms. The composition of our pipeline dovetails nicely with current demand trends. Leisure demand has led to recovery, and we are well positioned to continue growing our lead in resort destinations, including in the high-growth, all-inclusive space. We've also been seeing strong preference for our luxury properties. With luxury rooms accounting for more than 10% of our pipeline, we are poised to further expand our industry-leading portfolio in this valuable high-fee segment. Conversions were a significant growth driver in 2021, accounting for 21% of room additions and 27% of signings. With the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales and the meaningful top and bottom-line benefits associated with being part of our system, we anticipate that conversions will remain an important contributor to growth over the next several years. For 2022, we expect gross rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely, 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S. As a reminder, average construction time lines are currently around 2 years for limited service deals and often longer for full service deals. Yet given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our conversion momentum and our industry-leading pipeline, we are confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I did want to share a few highlights of the company's ESG efforts over the course of the year. The Board of Directors and our management team are keenly focused on these important areas as we're committed to making a positive and sustainable impact in the communities where we live and work. In June, as part of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, we announced we were setting new internal diversity goals for our group of Vice Presidents and above. The new targets aim to achieve global gender parity by 2023, an acceleration of our prior timetable and to increase representation of people of color in the U.S. to 25% by 2025. In July, we updated our human trafficking awareness training, which will be made widely available to the entire industry. More than 900,000 associates have now taken training in this area. And in September, we pledged to set science-based emissions reduction targets in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius emissions scenarios. As I finish my first year as CEO, I want to again thank our incredible associates for all their hard work through these challenging times. I've spent most of the last few months on the road, traveling across the U.S. from New York to Los Angeles and also abroad and have seen firsthand their dedication to serving our guests. I'm so proud of all we've accomplished over the last year and continue to be very optimistic about our outlook for 2022 and beyond.  Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Our fourth quarter results reflect the clear resilience of travel, our strong focus on cost containment and the benefits of our asset-light business model. Gross fee revenues reached $831 million in the fourth quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $186 million in the fourth quarter 19% ahead of 2019 levels driven by robust global card spending and new account acquisitions as well as outstanding performance in our branded residential business. Incentive management fees, or IMF, totaled $94 million in the quarter. Just under half of these fees were earned at resort properties with IMF from our comparable luxury resorts up almost 45% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our owned and leased portfolio generated $19 million of profits, a nice increase from a loss of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 as results improved at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Our operating teams have done extraordinary work to adapt quickly and return these hotels to breakeven profitability or better despite continued lower-than-normal occupancy levels. G&A and other expense totaled $213 million in the fourth quarter, higher than prior expectations as a result of higher compensation costs, including true-ups and higher legal expenses. For full year 2021, G&A and other came in at $823 million, 12% lower than full year 2019, reflecting ongoing savings resulting from our significant restructuring activities in 2020. At the hotel level, we have partnered with our owners and franchisees throughout the pandemic, working diligently to lower costs, bring down breakeven occupancy levels and drive cash flow. With the recovery well underway, we're committed to delivering consistent and positive guest experiences while keeping hotel operating costs down. Many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we put into place will be maintained as occupancies rebound. While the labor environment is slowly improving, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation. We're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years. As always, we are also carefully managing cash outlays at the corporate level. We were pleased with our cash flow generation during 2021 and with our year-end liquidity position of over $4.8 billion, which covers near-term debt maturities with significant cushion. Our full year cash flows from the loyalty program were positive before considering the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which effectively repaid around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, loyalty cash flows were modestly negative. Looking ahead to 2022, there is still too much uncertainty and volatility to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again share some general observations and provide color on certain specific items where we do have some visibility. I'll start with some thoughts on the first quarter of 2022. Omicron meaningfully impacted global group and business transient demand in January, historically the lowest occupancy month of the year. While we saw minimal disruption to leisure travel, global RevPAR for the month declined 31% compared to January of '19 primarily due to lower occupancy as rate was just 4% below 2019. We expect to see the recovery pace pick up nicely in February and March given weekly bookings across customer segments have now returned to pre-Omicron levels. However, with some countries reinstituting strict travel restrictions earlier this year, we could see first quarter 2022 RevPAR compared to '19 levels take a step back from the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of '21 versus 2019. We then expect significant forward progression in the global recovery each quarter through the end of the year. Following the temporary Delta-related slowdown during the third quarter of last year, demand picked up meaningfully through the end of last year. That bolsters our optimism that by the end of the year, the 2022 fourth quarter gap to 2019 fourth quarter RevPAR will narrow meaningfully compared to the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of 2021. As additional markets reopen and more employees return to the office, we expect robust ADR, sustained strong leisure transient demand and significant improvement in business transient and group. We also expect to see growth in trips that blend business and leisure. International travelers getting back on the road should also drive further improvement in RevPAR. In 2019, nearly 20% of global room nights were from cross-border guests. So far, most global demand during the pandemic has come from domestic visitors. Cross-border room nights in 2021 were down more than 60% compared to 2019 while domestic room nights were down 16% over the same time period. Our fourth quarter performance in the Middle East illustrates how impactful the return of international travel can be. We're encouraged by the swift pickup in booking activity that we've seen in the last few weeks in places that are opening up, such as Thailand and the Cayman Islands. Turning to fees. At current RevPAR levels, we expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year '22 RevPAR versus full year '21 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. This sensitivity is no longer compared to 2019 as the compounding impact from new rooms growth contributions makes the comparison less relevant 3 years out. In 2022, we expect continued growth from our non-RevPAR-related fees driven by higher contributions from credit card fees. We also anticipate profit growth from our owned and leased portfolio as the global environment improves. For the full year, interest expense net is anticipated to be roughly $350 million, and our core tax rate is expected to be around 23%. G&A and other expenses could total $860 million to $880 million, still well below 2019 levels but higher on a year-over-year basis primarily due to higher compensation costs and assumed higher travel expenses. As always, driving cash flow will be a priority in 2022. We anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. We expect cash flows from loyalty to be slightly positive in 2022 before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. We made great progress in improving our credit ratios during 2021 and remain focused on bringing our leverage in line with our target of 3 to 3.5x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. Assuming the recovery continues largely as anticipated, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022. We would likely begin by paying a dividend with a payout ratio a bit below our traditional 30%. We can then see more meaningful levels of capital returns, including share repurchases, along with dividends in 2023 and beyond. Over the last 2 years, our business has been tested in ways we never could have imagined. We're incredibly proud of how our teams have adapted and how well our company has performed. We made significant progress in 2021 and are excited about continued recovery and our growth opportunities ahead. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : So Tony, I just wanted to start with development activity. So thank you for the net unit growth guidance, and I think it makes sense relative to where we are in the development cycle. I sort of wanted to get your sense a little bit longer term. Do you think this is the bottom, and these levels are pretty sustainable just given where we are in the broader kind of CapEx and development cycle? Or do you think 2020 -- just help us think through maybe 2023? And are the levels going to be consistent with that? Could we even be a little bit better? Or do we need to be cautious there just given the timing on openings in full service? Tony Capuano : Thanks, Shaun. Well, as we've said the last couple of quarters, the ripple effects of the pandemic create less visibility beyond '22 than we might like. With that said, I think you heard the momentum on signings in my prepared remarks. We continue to see good volume on the conversion front. In the short term, obviously, we've got a bit of challenges in terms of construction starts, particularly in the U.S. But in some ways, that causes us to think about it as a when, not an if. And in fact, one of the statistics we look at most closely is fallout from the pipeline. If we were seeing wholesale project cancellations, that might cause us to think differently about the medium to long term. But in fact, what we saw in 2021 was about 6.5% lower than our average fallout over the last decade. Shaun Kelley : Really encouraging. And then maybe just as my follow-up, your comment on the RevPAR cadence, Leeny, in your prepared remarks, was interesting as we get to kind of the 4Q '22 area. Just any possibility that we could actually see maybe a month or a point in 2022 where we actually return to 2019 levels of RevPAR? Or kind of what's your sense about that cadence? That's it for me. Leeny Oberg : So thanks very much. And it is interesting. When you look at December, for example, the U.S. and Canada in the month of December was really -- was down only 6 percentage points compared to 2019. So it is absolutely the case that you could see depending on the mix of business and exactly how countries open up and kind of the classic occupancy from a seasonal pattern standpoint. I could imagine that it's possible that you have that happen, Shaun. I think though, so much of this really depends on the global picture in terms of the pace of the recovery. So you need lots of things happening on all the points of business, not just leisure but also special corporate as well as group to see us get to that delightful place. But at the same time, I think we feel great about the momentum. The other comment I'll make is when you see countries open up their restrictions, the kind of jolt that our reservation centers feel is impressive. And I do think that momentum gives us confidence that we could see this resilience continue to build. Operator : And we will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Just thinking about the visibility of recovery. Can you give us some insight into what group bookings for the second half look like? Because understandably, of course, Q1 would have been very disrupted by Omicron. But for second half, how is that compared to 2019 levels in terms of -- it seems like at some point, there should be an accumulation of groups that haven't met in a while, and that, that should start to look good. And I'm just wondering if you can see that turning point yet in your future group bookings. Tony Capuano : Yes. Thanks, Robin. And maybe I'll refresh some of the data that we shared with you last quarter. I'm going to give you some comparisons between at the end of '19, what we saw is definite bookings on the books for '20 and '21 and how that compares at the end of '21, what we see on the books for '22 and '23. So at the end of December of '21 as we looked at definite bookings for '22, we were down just a shade under 22% compared to end of '19 for '20. When we look at what's on the books for '23 at the end of 2021, we're down just a shade under 15% versus what we had on the books at the end of '19 for 2021. And so to your specific question, we are seeing steady and encouraging forward bookings in the group segment. And the other thing I would point out, Robin, you heard in my prepared remarks the comment about that big piece of Salesforce business that was booked just 1 month before. We expect to continue to see improvement from the levels I just described to you because we're seeing more short-term bookings, and that's been the trend over the last number of weeks and months. Leeny Oberg : Just to add one point, Robin, when you look at Q1, understandably, with Omicron, clearly, you're looking at a weaker group picture than you are as you get into Q3, which is meaningfully better. So your point is well taken that it should move as we go through the year. And I think the other part that is just fantastic is that rate both in '22 and '23 already from what's on the books is up 3% to 4%. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up question is in terms of the visibility of just sort of business transient or transient in total, has that moved out? And I know it's tough after the last 6 weeks because maybe it was moving out and now contracted a little bit. But how far in advance -- I feel like pre-pandemic, you used to talk about a 30-day booking window, and maybe last year, it was like a 7-day booking window. So just wondering if you're seeing transient a little more visibility or a little bit of improvement in the pace of that? Leeny Oberg : So the booking window has extended, but it is not the way it was back in 2019. So it's improved, but it is still the case that we're not back to where we are. And I think, clearly, in Q1, Robin, January is a great example where you saw special corporate particularly weaker with what was going on with Omicron. So I think part of this, you're going to see it get -- see more visibility as we get further and further into the year. But it is a bit better than it was in 2020. Tony Capuano : And Robin, let me just give you a little more granular information to try to address your question. This is a global number. But if you look at the global booking window, it really got the shortest in the second quarter of 2020, where it was down to 5 years. Leeny Oberg : 5 days. Tony Capuano : Excuse me, 5 days. If you look at fourth quarter of 2021, it had risen to about 17 days. So to Leeny's point, certainly not back to where we were pre-pandemic, but trending in the right direction. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Throughout much of last year, leisure demand was fairly inelastic to rate in the industry's fairly robust rate gain as you alluded to this morning. Can you talk about leisure price elasticity thus far in 2022 in your forward bookings? And are there any changes relative to last year, i.e. are you seeing demand become more sensitive to further ratings, maybe more pronounced in markets or chain-scale segments where service levels might be constrained by labor availabilities? Tony Capuano : Of course. Obviously, we're early in the year, but maybe a good indication that addresses your question as we gear up for President's Day weekend here at the end of the week, this is a U.S. data, but the RevPAR numbers are pacing up about 12% ahead of where we were in '19 for Friday through Sunday. And to your specific question about pricing power, ADR is pacing up about 20% versus '19. Joe Greff : Great. And then a follow-up question on new development. Can you talk about the cadence of net rooms growth or net rooms growth rate this year? Is it even throughout the year? Is it more heavy in the second half? And lastly, how does the full service select service mix of net room development in '22 compare to that mix the last couple of years? Tony Capuano : Of course. What I will tell you is pretty consistent for the last decade or more is our transactors, they are a big fourth quarter team. We tend to see a big pop in signings volume in the fourth quarter. But because our conversion volume was meaningfully higher in '21 versus history, when you have a deal like Sunwing, which I think was in the second quarter, that can impact the quarter-to-quarter numbers. But fourth quarter tends to be the biggest volume of signups. Leeny Oberg : And for openings, Joe, I think we definitely saw in Q4 of this year that you clearly saw a bunch of owners wanted to get ahead of this recovery that's moving forward. So we had a great fourth quarter. But we have traditionally been fairly steady unless there is a certain group of hotels that have all kind of come on at the same time. So I would say we've always tended to have some quarter-to-quarter variations, but that should march forward fairly squarely throughout the quarters on the opening side. I guess the only other thing to point out is just a reminder that construction for a limited-service hotel takes, broadly speaking, 2 years, and full service takes longer. So as you start to think about 2020 and recognize that as you get into Q3 of 2020, you were in the depths of the pandemic and starting to really see the impact on construction starts. That will start to obviously then have an impact as you go into '22. Operator : We will take our next question from Thomas Allen with JPMorgan -- I'm sorry, from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : So your non-RevPAR fees have been really encouraging. And Leeny, thanks for the commentary that you expect growth in 2022. Can you just give us a little bit more color there? I think I calculated that your 2021 non-RevPAR fees are about 15% above 2019 levels. What's giving you the confidence that, that should continue to grow? Leeny Oberg : Yes. So first of all, thanks very much. Just as a reminder that our credit card fees make up roughly 2/3 of our non-RevPAR-related fees. And so obviously, that's a big driver. They ended up, up 4% over 2019 levels for the full year in '21. And that was with really quite a weak Q1 as we were still in the heaviest part of the pandemic. So as we continue to see great card acquisitions and credit card average spend, I think we feel very good about those. I think residential branding fees, that business has been doing extremely well. And we expect to continue to see strong openings of those, which is when we get the fees. And then we continue to have application and relicensing fees as obviously, our business continues to grow on the franchise side. So we feel quite confident in the growth of that fee stream based on a continued strong economy. Thomas Allen : And just a follow up, Leeny, not asking for 2023 guidance, but there is some -- when we think about starts, right, like there is some impact from openings and close -- sorry, there is some impact with starts not only the [non] but for residential branding fees, for example. Does that look like it's going to continue to grow as you go past 2022? Leeny Oberg : No, that's a good reminder, actually, Thomas, to remember that while we do get annual management fees, that is the smaller part of the fee stream that we get from residential. And those are overwhelmingly one-time fees that we get when the unit is ready for occupancy. So in that regard, even in '22, I would expect our fees to be a little bit lower than they were in '21 because in '21, it was -- we just had so many sales in residential. So I expect them to be a bit lower, although still meaningfully higher than our traditional levels of residential branding fees. And yes, you're right, they're lumpy because you can have 1 unit of 100 units goes into sales and closes literally within a quarter or 2, and then another one might not happen for 2 more quarters. So it is likely to be lumpy. And again, overall, we're really pleased with new signings that we're getting in the residential branded business. So I think you'll continue to see that business grow very nicely. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Patrick Scholes : Great. Tony, I have a question and a follow-up question. Tony, my first question, a high-level question. Last year, in March and April, we certainly saw a very large acceleration in U.S. leisure demand. And what that means is we certainly have a very tough comp for U.S. leisure demand coming up. As far as your intuition, Tony, do you think U.S. leisure demand once we hit those tough comps in April onwards could actually eclipse last year's very strong levels? Just curious what you think about that. Tony Capuano : Of course. Thanks, Patrick. Well, we continue to be really optimistic that there's still a significant tailwind for leisure demand. And I think part of that is because of the evolution of the way folks work. The incremental flexibility that you're seeing in working from home, working from anywhere has been an accelerant for leisure demand. And if anything, we expect further acceleration in that regard. And then when we look at our forward bookings, we already have more leisure on the books for months further out than we did in the same months last year. So we continue to be quite bullish on accelerated growth in leisure. And remember, leisure was already growing much more rapidly than business transient even pre-pandemic. And maybe the last part of my answer would be you heard Leeny talk a little bit about how modest cross-border travel has been. We've really only seen domestic leisure travel. And as more and more borders open, we think that influx of international leisure travel will also serve to accelerate the pace of leisure demand growth. Patrick Scholes : Okay. That's definitely encouraging and good points on the international. Shifting gears on my follow-up question here. Certainly, it's been tough sledding for the hotel industry in China due to the 0 COVID policy. With RevPAR really still significantly down in China, have you seen that any impact on your pipeline given how much the -- in China, given how much the industry is struggling in China? Tony Capuano : That's a good question, but thankfully, the answer is no. We continue to see really strong momentum, both on the signings and the openings front. And I think in many ways, our owners and partners in China are the mirror image of our owners and partners in other areas of the world. They don't try to time the market for the next quarter or 2. They tend to be long-term investors. Many of the projects that are getting done are parts of larger mixed-use projects. And the hotel components, in some ways, define those projects, so they are critically important. So we've not seen any sort of meaningful slum down, quite the contrary. We continue to see really strong demand for our brands from a development perspective across China. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Good to hear. Leeny Oberg : Just one quick follow-up for you on that. When you look at how many rooms we've currently got in Greater China, it's around 140,000. And our pipeline is only about 20% to 25% less than that for the pipeline for Greater China. So it's really -- you're looking at doubling that business potentially in not too long. Operator : We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : I wanted to just circle back on your commentary around conversion activity, which I think you said was about 18,000 rooms in '21. And I know you had said that you think it will continue to be strong. But can you maybe just -- do you think it can surpass what you saw in '21? And maybe you can talk a little bit about where you're seeing the conversions coming from on a regional basis? Is it mostly U.S.? Tony Capuano : Sure. So I will remind you that one of the most significant contributors to our conversion volume in '21 was the conversion of about 7,000 all-inclusive rooms in the Caribbean with Sunwing. And I raised that not to apologize. Those sorts of large portfolio conversion opportunities are a meaningful part of our strategy and something that we'll continue to look for. But in terms of baseline conversions, we are seeing elevated interest from the owner and franchise community for our brands. And so we expect to see really strong volume continuing into 2022 and beyond. And as we talk with our owners and franchisees, not only do they like the flexibility of some of our soft brands, they like the fact that we've got conversion-friendly platforms across multiple chain scales. And they are focused not just on the ability of the company's revenue engines to drive top line revenue, but also some of the margin efficiencies that result from affiliation with our brands. Leeny Oberg : And Smedes, just as a reminder, 27% of our signings in 2021 were for conversions. One of the things that's been really gratifying to see is a number of owners who want to do a conversion, but with meaningful investment in the property. Tony Capuano : Yes, I think that's a great point. Leeny Oberg : They may take 12 months to actually get open, but they're turning it into a beautiful representation of one of our brands and putting meaningful investment in it. So whether it opens specifically in '22 or '23, it's all going to be great for our guests and frankly, for our associates and for the owners. Tony Capuano : And that 27%, Smedes, was about 10 percentage points higher than what we saw in the signings in '20 and in '19. Smedes Rose : Great. And then I just wanted to ask you when we were out at Atlas meeting, we met with a lot of owners. And there continues to be a lot of discussion, as you guys have commented on as well, of helping to reduce their costs being affiliated with large brands. And I'm just wondering, do you think there's a lot more to go there? Or do you feel like you're sort of streamlining and brand standards are changing sort of customer expectations is kind of reset now? Or how is that sort of relationship sort of panning out? I mean, we heard frankly, like just a broad range of commentary. Wondering how you're seeing it from your side. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So I think, first of all, I think the partnership during the pandemic between us and our owners and franchisees have never been better in terms of trying to manage these dramatically lower occupancy levels. And as I said in my comments, I think there is quite a bit of the savings that we put into place that is permanent, that will mean kind of significantly lower costs and significantly better productivity as we move forward. Now as you know, we've got the reality that for more complex hotels, they're -- it's a much higher percentage of costs that are labor-related. And we're obviously seeing a lot of pressure on that side, just like every other industry in the U.S. So there, we are -- we will continue to find ways to try to improve the margins. Rising occupancy, obviously, always ultimately helps you when you're spreading costs at a hotel. But it also means you've also got to make sure to have enough people there to deliver the service that our guests expect, and we are committed to making sure that we deliver those experiences that bring them back to our hotels over and over. And then the last thing I'll mention is just the great part about our business is we do reprice our rooms every day. And so when you think about what's been going on with our ADR, that has been a fabulous mitigation of what's been going on the labor cost side. So we will certainly continue to find new ways, but we are determined to make sure to deliver what our customers want. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario : Just a question for you on loyalty and your top customers. Maybe help us understand how are they spending today versus pre-pandemic levels? And then when you think about the lifetime value of that, say, top-tier platinum customer, has your view changed on who that customer is, who that platinum customer is on a go-forward basis? Leeny Oberg : Michael, sorry. You're breaking up. Can you start the question from the beginning? Michael Bellisario : Can you hear me better? Leeny Oberg : Yes. Michael Bellisario : Just a question for you on loyalty and your top-tier customers. How are they spending today? And where are they spending differently versus pre-pandemic levels? And then when you think about lifetime value, say, of a top-tier platinum customer, has your view changed on who that customer is going forward, given the changes in travel patterns today? Tony Capuano : Okay. I said -- Mike, I apologize. You were breaking up a little bit. I think I heard your question. I think maybe our penetration rates, especially in the U.S. or maybe the best indication. We were back to 57% penetration in the fourth quarter, which is almost back to where we were pre-pandemic. So we're quite encouraged about the penetration rates, the passion and the enthusiasm we see within the Bonvoy base and as you heard in my prepared remarks, the pace at which the program continues to grow. And I think one of the really exciting things for us was as our credit card platforms continue to grow, they really gave us a unique opportunity to stay engaged with those most valuable Bonvoy customers even when they had hit the pause button on the volume of travel they experienced prior to the start of the pandemic. Leeny Oberg : And just to add fuel to Tony's fire, I'll mention 2 things. Number one, we have started doing credit card programs in other countries and found them to be really well received by the customers and seeing nice card acquisitions on that front. And then also just when you think about the growth in our digital share, and that is very much tied to the Bonvoy platform. And when you look at our digital share compared to '19, the share of reservations has gone up almost 500 basis points on our digital channel. And overall, we've grown up 300 basis points in our direct channels up to 76%. So I think that all ties very well into the power of Bonvoy. Operator : And we will take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Just first, just following up from some of the questions you've had already on inflation and particularly with regard to your incentive fees and the owned and leased portfolio profitability. If we get a full RevPAR recovery kind of into 2023, is that enough to get the incentive fees back to pre-pandemic levels? Or what's the dynamics that will kind of keep us away from that? And then a similar question on the owned and leased profitability. Is inflation going to hold back the recovery there? Leeny Oberg : Right. So a couple of things. You are right to point out that nominal level of RevPAR is not the same as real. And so when we think about it, for example, now, the real recovery of RevPAR is about 3 points worse relative to the nominal just because of -- in '21, to your point about inflation. At the same time, one of the things I think is what's been so impressive about the operating teams is we used to think about breakeven levels for a full-service hotel of 40% to 50% occupancy. And what you're finding is that with the great work that they've done on managing the hotel and dramatically lower occupancies that they've been able to return these hotels to either neutral profitability at dramatically lower levels of breakeven occupancy. And so I think that will really help offset on the inflation side. The other comment I'll make is on the incentive fee side is just a reminder that it depends a whole lot on where. So just when you think broadly speaking, we were at almost 72% of our hotels were earning IMF in 2019, and we're now still a tad under 50%. And where you see the biggest difference is really domestically in the U.S. And that is that with owners' priorities, that is going to mean you really need to get back to those hurdles of levels of actual real profits before we're going to get our incentive fees. Now internationally, no surprise, where you've got quite a bit more of hotels without the owner's priority. There, you're already seeing dramatically higher percentages of hotels earning IMF. So I think we've got some great potential in the international hotels where there have been such restrictions on entering the country, and they're more dependent on international travelers. I think of Asia Pacific outside of China as an example there. And in the U.S., I think as you heard me say in our comments, the IMF that we're getting from the resorts have just been fantastic and in many cases, are already above 2019 levels. So when you think about the large cities in the U.S. and their greater relative dependence on international travel, I think it delivers a lot of confidence that we will get back. I just think predicting whether that is '23 or not is probably a bridge too far, but certainly moving in the right direction. Richard Clarke : And just as a follow-up. Last year, you talked about trying to cut some of the kind of cost reimbursement fees for the underlying hotels to help out their profitability. In Q4, it looks like that cost reimbursement revenue is about 85% of 2019 level. So it's recovered basically in line with your other fees. So just where are we in that process of sort of lowering that sort of reimbursement contribution from the owners? Leeny Oberg : So a couple things. One is a reminder that 85% of our reimbursed costs are based on the top line revenues of the hotels. So an overwhelming part, like, for example, our sales and marketing fees are contractually set at a percentage of revenues of the hotels. So they are, by nature, going to move up and down. The other thing is to recognize that we worked very hard on certain parts of the fees where we were able to impact kind of the fixed and floating component. And so that we do believe that there is more efficiency as we grow larger in terms of what we can do for the hotels. And as an example, when you're a digital share, your direct share of reservations is growing as well as it is. It's just a reminder that those are some of the lowest cost reservations for a hotel as possible. But we did lower our fixed cost by roughly 30% for the system. But as I said before, overwhelmingly, the charges are based on a function of hotel revenues. Operator : We will take our next question from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : You spoke about delivering the service that the guests expect and when I hear that, I think about food and beverage, I think about housekeeping. I'm curious kind of what percent of the way back you are as it relates to your breakfast buffets and select service hotels, your 3-meal-a-day restaurants and more full service? And can you remind us what percentage of guests are kind of -- are you on the opt-in model? And what percentage of guests are opting in for housekeeping? Tony Capuano : Sure. So on housekeeping, we continue to evolve our approach. Today, in our select tier hotels, it is an opt-in approach. Daily housekeeping is available at the discretion of the guest. And at luxury, we are doing daily housekeeping. We're testing those options today. We're using those learnings to try and strike the right balance between guest expectations and economic realities for the owners. And as we work through those tests, we intend to launch a definitive approach sometime here early in 2022. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And how about on the food and beverage side? What percentage of the way back are you there? Tony Capuano : Yes, we're here. So we're getting there. It's -- we are largely back to where we were in the markets that have seen the most rapid recovery. So if you are lucky enough to visit our hotels, particularly in resort destinations, you'll experience food and beverage services and offerings very similar to what you saw pre-pandemic. An example of that, we just had our Board meeting down in South Florida. Most of us had to order in-room dining because the restaurants couldn't offer us reservations prior to 10 :45 p.m., and they were full. In those markets where we've seen demand recover more slowly, we are moderating the pace at which we bring back our food and beverage offerings and trying to have that pace match the pace of demand recovery. Vince Ciepiel : That makes a lot of sense. My second question is on distribution. With special corporate being down, I imagine OTA contribution is up. But can you just remind us, I think pre-pandemic, I think you were in the low double digits for OTA contribution. What did that end up being in 2021? And then I think your digital direct channel was growing pretty fast, maybe even faster than OTA. How has that evolved? And where do you see that going in 2022? Leeny Oberg : Sure. So I think a couple things. And that's just a reminder that in 2019, you also had -- special corporate is classically done through what we call GDS. And that is what is obviously taking the biggest dip. So now when you look at kind of their percentage share, they're down 600 basis points as compared to '19. Now the OTAs are up with all this leisure business by 200 basis points, and they're at 14% in 2021. But at the same time, a direct share of total room nights is up to 76.3%, and that's actually up 340 basis points. So actually, our direct channels have grown meaningfully more than the OTAs. The OTAs have clearly obviously benefited from the leisure business. And GDS classically and more related to business travel has been the one that has lost the most share. And the only other thing that I'll mention because I just find it interesting that also within the direct share growth is the movement off of voice to digital. And I think that all makes sense when you think about our Bonvoy technology and our app and how many downloads we get that our guests are feeling more and more comfortable using the digital channel, which, again, is an incredibly efficient channel from a cost perspective and from a value delivery to the customer. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Rich Hightower : Just on the development pipeline and as I think about supply chain delays and the like, maybe help us understand, if we go back to the beginning of 2021, what your outlook was for the room\u2019s growth at that time? How many of those projects got delayed versus your original outlook and maybe pushed into 2022? And then likewise, what sort of cushion do you get to the 2022 forecast as you think about ongoing delays and so forth? Tony Capuano : Yes, I'll take a try at that one, and Leeny may chime in. I think about it a little bit -- I think about the pipeline a little like a conveyor belt. We've got some projects, one of the reasons that our openings were so strong in the fourth quarter is we saw some projects that in our earlier forecast, we assumed would open Q1 '22. And they actually got done a little more quickly and opened in December. We do see some delays that come out the back end. But I think maybe the most relevant statistics are the pace at which shovels are going in the ground and the lengthening we've seen in the construction cycle. You heard Leeny in her remarks talk about roughly 24 months start to finish as an average for our select service hotels here in the U.S. There's not a lot we can do to accelerate that. If anything, we've got some challenges with supply chain and the like. But that 24 months seems to be older. It's one of the reasons we continue to be so focused on conversions in the year for the year. Leeny Oberg : And as Tony said, we do -- for what it's worth, when we build our budget, we do go project by project, country by country. So it is a quite detailed estimate. But as Tony pointed out, there are some that finished a little bit earlier, and some that end up being a little bit later. And we do our best every year at estimating. But the other part that I'll point out when we talked about where we were at the beginning of '21 is that we actually expect the deletions to be higher. And I think you all will remember that my comments then reflected probably about 50 basis points of an expected COVID-related hedge that it was hard to predict at that point where exactly all these hotels would go as we move through the pandemic. And I think happily with a lot of work on everybody's part, including the owners in revenue management and on the cost side, that -- and the banks have been very good partners to work with as well. We have seen deletions come in better than we expected. And that has also ended up helping the net rooms growth number even compared to where we were 4 months ago. Rich Hightower : That's really helpful color. And if I could just add one follow-up. Maybe back to, I think, one of your responses on the leisure side and thinking about demand and pricing power in that segment. If we look at some of the non-traditional short-term rental companies, for instance, Airbnb and so forth, everybody sort of talks about their leisure customer the same way. And a lot of this is the business has improved meaningfully with work from home and a hybrid workforce and all that kind of stuff. I mean, would you say that there's more or less or about the same customer overlap as you think about your core leisure customer versus what we see in the short-term rental space? And how has that changed over the course of COVID? Tony Capuano : Well, I think if you look particularly at the performance we've seen in our luxury tier resorts and our full-service resorts, one of the things we hear from our customers pretty clearly is their desire for a full complement of services and amenities. And as we've said in response to versions of this question in the past, that's probably the most significant differentiator between our product offering and some of the short-term rental offerings that are out there. Leeny Oberg : The other thing I'll mention is clearly in the beginning of the pandemic when you were kind of imagining searches for people wanting to get away, there was larger proportion of searches that were for places that are out of the way, truly places where people felt comfortable going where they could be away from others. And we have seen that gap narrow in terms of the searches for kind of classic room-sharing type places as well as hotels. We've seen that gap narrow, which I think makes sense given the progress as we move through the pandemic. Operator : And we do have another question, and that will be from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : On the owned and leased segment, can you give us a little bit more color on some of the puts and takes that could impact that segment RevPAR and margin performance versus the system-wide trends in 2022? And maybe even tie in how you're thinking about any asset sales there, if possible, given how strong the transaction market has been? Leeny Oberg : Sure. I think on the asset sales, we will obviously continue to be opportunistic, Stephen. And it really depends on where the hotel is both in terms of its stage of CapEx. As you know, in a number of hotels that we own, we really want to get them to be great representations of our brands. And in cases where the markets have really not recovered, we are not going to feel compelled to rush that sale. So in that regard, it will really vary. We've also got JV interest as you know. For example, our St. Regis Punta Mita JV was sold during 2021. That market was doing great. The hotel was in great shape, and we were able to get a really good sales price on that asset. So I think it really does depend a lot on the situation. Remember that owned lease also has termination fees, and that also I would expect not to be growing, but also to continue to provide somewhere in the ballpark of $40 million in fees a year. And then on the owned leased profit, I think you will continue to see progress. But do remember that we have a chunk of leased hotels. And there, you obviously need to get to where you're covering your fixed rent payment to the extent it is fixed rent, which will mean it behaves a little bit more like a U.S. owner's priority where you need to get to a floor before you're actually getting any profit. So I think we look forward to seeing the numbers get better and better. But in terms of getting back to the full levels of 2019, I think it will take a little bit of time. Stephen Grambling : Makes sense. And perhaps as a big picture follow-up, Tony, now that we're coming up on the roughly 1-year mark that you've taken over as CEO, I'm curious how you could characterize where your thought priorities are now position the company, not only for this unique recovery, but longer term, and how they may have shifted over the course of the year, particularly given you've met with folks in the field more recently? Tony Capuano : Sure. Thanks. I don't think they've shifted meaningfully. I mean, I think we are encouraged, as you've heard this morning, about the pace of demand recovery. But the priorities really continue to revolve around our key constituents, leading with our associates, certainly our guests and as we've discussed at length this morning, the economic health of our owners Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions this morning, for your continued interest in Marriott. And with increasing frequency, we look forward to seeing you on the road. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session.  Please note that this call may be recorded and I will be standing by if you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Leeny Oberg, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Business Operations. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to remember Laura Paugh, a trusted and valued friend and colleague to many of us on this call. As most of you know, Laura tragically passed away after a car accident a few weeks ago. Laura was smart, helpful, witty and unfailingly honest to all who knew her. We'll miss her incredible spirit and are committed to honor her legacy at Marriott. Laura's family was her greatest achievement and we're holding them in our thoughts and prayers. And now I'll turn the call over to Jackie. Jackie Burka McConagha : Thank you, Leeny. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Business Operations; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we've issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated our RevPAR occupancy and Average Daily Rate comments reflect system wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2022 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of March 31, 2022 even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 where they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to pre-pandemic or 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony. Anthony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie and thank you all for joining us this morning. Global demand rebounded strongly and swiftly during the first quarter after a brief Omicron related slowdown early in the year. In March, worldwide RevPAR was just 9% below 2019. Occupancy rose to 64% with ADR an impressive 5% above March of 2019. COVID-19 is still impacting our business to varying degrees around the world, but as global vaccination rates increase, case counts decline, and new COVID variants are tending to be less severe, many countries have started to cautiously adopt a live with COVID policy, leading to a rise in demand for all types of travel. Leisure demand, which had already fully recovered during 2021, has further strengthened this year, with first quarter global leisure transient room nights more than 10% above 2019. Recovery of business transient and group demand is still lagging leisure, but as greater numbers of employees returned to the office, demand has been rapidly improving. Additionally, day of the week trends continue to show that trips that blend leisure and business are on the rise. In March, in the U.S. and Canada, while Monday through Wednesday occupancy was down in the mid teens, occupancy during the shoulder days, Thursday and Sunday, was down in the single digits and occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was nearly in line with March of 2019. While still below pre-pandemic room nights, cross-border travel demand is growing slowly as more countries around the world reopen their borders and lift travel restrictions. Cross-border guests accounted for 14% of global room nights in the first quarter, a gain of around 100 basis points compared to a quarter ago, but well below the 2019 share of 19%. In the U.S. and Canada, March RevPAR was within 4% of 2019. Occupancy topped 68% during the month, and ADR accelerated to 6% over pre-pandemic levels. While the extent of RevPAR recovery still varies widely from city to city, overall progress during the quarter was widespread across all chain scales as well as market types that is primary, secondary and tertiary markets, RevPAR recovery saw meaningful improvement in March versus the fourth quarter. Luxury was the standout in the quarter with ADR a remarkable 27% above pre-pandemic rates. Group demand in the U.S. and Canada accelerated sharply during the first quarter. In March Group RevPAR was 16% below 2019 compared to down more than 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth in new bookings has contributed to a meaningful improvement in Group pace for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, Group revenue pace for the remainder of 2022 was down in the high single digit range compared to 2019. We also expect additional short-term bookings to further boost Group revenues. April was the eighth month in a row where in the year for the year group bookings exceeded 2019 levels. Importantly, our sales teams remain focused on driving ADR, which has continued to rise for new bookings. ADR for managed hotel bookings made in January was 3% above 2019 levels, while ADR for bookings made in March had risen to 12% above pre-pandemic levels. Business transient demand in the U.S. also gained momentum during the quarter. Recovery in March improved notably compared to the fourth quarter, with business transient room nights down 10% to 15%. Special corporate accounts which tend to be larger companies have recovered more slowly than smaller sized businesses, which have now fully recovered. Special corporate new bookings strengthened in March and further advanced in April. Internationally, all regions except for Greater China experienced additional RevPAR recovery in March compared to the fourth quarter recovery. In the Middle East and Africa, where borders have been opened since late last year, first quarter performance was stellar, with RevPAR surpassing 2019 for the second quarter in a row. This was led by strength in the UAE from the World Expo in Dubai that ran from October of 2021 through March of this year. At the other end of the spectrum, in Greater China, where restrictions have been the most severe, RevPAR dropped significantly with the lockdown of several major cities, including Shanghai late in the quarter. We are keeping a close eye on trends in Europe. But outside of Russia, the war in Ukraine has not yet impacted demand. Cancellations have been minimal and as all countries in the region have removed or reduced travel restrictions, bookings across the rest of Europe have accelerated for spring and the summer high season. In Russia, we've closed our corporate offices and paused all future hotel developments and new hotel openings. There are currently 23 properties open in the country, though occupancies are modest. We continue to evaluate our operations in Russia, which represented well under 1% of our global fees in 2019. We are watching the horrific humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighboring countries with deep concern, and we're doing what we can to help those impacted in the region. I'm very proud of our teams that have been mobilizing to help those in need in numerous ways, including working with relief partners, and housing refugees at Marriott properties in neighboring countries. The power of Marriott Bonvoy was again evident in the quarter, as we remained focused on strengthening our loyalty platform for our 164 million members. Of course, member engagement has risen as travel demand comes back, but there has also been a significant increase in members earning and using points outside of our hotels. Our Bonvoy members are interacting with us more through everyday spending, thanks to our collaborations with companies like Uber. We've also seen incredible global interest in and engagement with our Bonvoy co-branded cards with new card acquisitions and card spend both up meaningfully year-over-year. The first quarter also marked our best quarter ever for direct digital bookings, which helped drive owner and franchisee profitability. Digital bookings were up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019, partially driven by meaningfully higher downloads of our redesigned Bonvoy app, which were 70% above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to development, the number of deals presented at our monthly development committee meetings has continued to increase. We signed 124 deals globally through March of this year, a new first quarter record. Conversion activity remains a bright spot given the breadth of our roster of conversion friendly brands across chain scales, and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our system. Conversions accounted for 22% of room additions in the quarter. Despite construction timelines having lengthened a bit so far this year, due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we expect openings to ramp up each quarter in 2022. Average construction timelines are currently just over two years for limited service properties and remain longer for full service properties. Looking ahead, we still expect full year growth rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S. With financing starting to ease a bit, the industry has seen a notable ramp up in new construction starts in the first quarter, but they are still well below 2019 levels. However, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate, given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our momentum around conversions, and the largest pipeline in the industry. In closing, I feel extremely optimistic about our future. With our unparalleled portfolio of 30 global brands and over 8000 properties worldwide, our invaluable Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, our numerous growth opportunities, and the best associates in the business, I believe Marriott is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continued recovery ahead. I will now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results came in ahead of our expectations with global RevPAR down 19% compared to 2019. Gross fee revenues totaled $815 million in the quarter, almost doubling from a year ago, driven overwhelmingly by higher RevPAR. Our non-RevPAR related franchise fees once again showed meaningful growth totaling $170 million in the first quarter up 21% year-over-year, primarily due to significantly higher year-over-year credit card fees. Incentive Management Fees or IMF are rebounding nicely and reached $102 million in the quarter. They comprise 13% of total gross fees, an acceleration from 7% in the year ago quarter, driven in part by strong performance at our U.S. and Canada hotels. Over 55% of our IMFs were earned at our industry-leading luxury properties. IMF from our comp luxury hotels were 10% above the first quarter of 2019, while IMF from our comp luxury resorts were up more than 60% over the same timeframe. Roughly 60% of IMFs were earned at our international properties during the quarter. Our owned and leased portfolio again generated positive profits totaling $44 million in the quarter due to international government subsidies and improved results at hotels in the U.S., the Caribbean, and Latin America and Europe. G&A and other expense totaled $208 million in the first quarter due to timing and lower travel cost as a result of the Omicron variant. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $759 million, down only 8% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We remain focused on working closely with our owners and franchisees to deliver superior customer service, while also containing operating costs. Our U.S. managed hotels profit margins were nearly back to 2019 levels in the first quarter, despite RevPAR down 16% compared to 2019. While industry staffing challenges persist, primarily in certain U.S. markets, we've made great progress since last summer in successfully hiring for open positions. As always, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation, but we're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years. As we look ahead to the rest of 2022, we're very pleased with the positive momentum in demand we're seeing across customer segments in the vast majority of markets around the world. With the recent widespread easing of travel restrictions in many regions, employees returning to the office in greater numbers, increasingly positive travel sentiment, and our team's focus on ADR, we're even more optimistic than we were a quarter ago that we'll see meaningful additional global RevPAR recovery this year, assuming no major change in the global economic environment or the behavior of the virus. There's still too much volatility given uncertainty around travel restrictions in countries like China, and a high reliance on cross-border guests across our international markets to give global RevPAR or specific earnings guidance. But we do have more visibility in our largest markets, the U.S. and Canada, which is almost entirely dependent on domestic travelers. In the U.S. and Canada, occupancy and ADR continued to improve in April, and we estimate that RevPAR fully recovered to 2019 levels for the month. We're extremely pleased to reach this milestone roughly two years after the pandemic began. While demand still varies considerably across hotel types and markets, given current booking and ADR trends, we expect RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada to be roughly flat to 2019 in the remaining quarters of 2022. Internationally, we expect continued RevPAR recovery across markets that have not yet fully recovered, though the levels of progress will vary widely across regions. To further help with your modeling let me share some additional color, At current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2022 RevPAR versus full year 2021 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. For the full year, interest expense net is still anticipated to be roughly $350 million and our core tax rate is now expected to be around 24%. And G&A and other expenses are still anticipated to be $860 million to $880 million well below 2019. We still anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. We could now see loyalty be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring and the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. With the meaningful pickup in demand we've seen an increase in redemption activity and expect this trend to persist. We've made meaningful progress in driving cash flow, managing expenses, and improving our credit profile. Given this progress, as well as the strength of our business and our confidence in our outlook improving further, we're very pleased to be resuming capital returns to shareholders sooner than we had anticipated. With leverage close to our target ratio of between 3 and 3.5 times adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, we are resuming our dividend at $0.30 a share in the second quarter, the first dividend in two years. We remain committed to our investment grade ratings, investing in growth that increases shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend, and share repurchases. Assuming the global demand environment continues to improve and that we are within our target leverage ratio range, we expect to resume share repurchases this year. Our business model has demonstrated terrific resilience and I want to thank our teams all over the world for helping us navigate the challenges over the past two years. It's thrilling to see so many hotels full of guests again, and we're very optimistic about the future of travel and the future of Marriott International. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you.  Thank you. Our first question will come from Steven Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Steven Grambling : Hey, good morning. I just want to extend my condolences to everyone on the line as well as echo your thoughts Leeny on Laura. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, . Steven Grambling : Absolutely. To start things off, I guess, on the development environment particularly in China, amidst lockdowns, how might we be thinking through any impact there as you think about net unit growth or net room growth? How might conversions or other properties not explicitly in the pipeline impact additions for the year? Anthony Capuano : Great question. I'll answer it a few ways. As you know, many of the development projects that we entertain in Greater China come to us when they are well under construction. And so one of the metrics we use to evaluate growth pace is intake of MOUs or LOIs and we've seen pretty steady pace of MOU intake, even during the impact of the zero COVID policy across China. We have seen some construction interruption as we've seen here in the U.S. But for the first time, we're starting to see some real traction on the conversion side, which has not historically been particularly active source of rooms growth across Greater China. Steven Grambling : That's helpful. And then maybe one follow up on just the guidance and some of the comments that you made Leeny. What are the guardrails that we should be thinking about as it relates to credit card fees and the trajectory there, as well as any concrete impacts to working capital, given the complements of earning and burning points versus the point pull forward? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So I think generally as we've talked about the credit cards, it's been a tremendously resilient and steady force in our fees over the past few years. And as you've probably heard us say, we actually saw credit card fees in Q1 2020 up 26%, compared to 2019. So they are really and obviously up a whole lot over last year as well. So it's a combination of two things, given one is that we continue to see overall credit card spend increase, and then our new card acquisition growth has also been impressive. So I think as you continue to see that moving forward, that's a strength. The other thing is, obviously we are a card that tends to be loved by people who love to travel. And so there again, as you see people returning to travel, I think that's also a great incentive with all the Bonvoy points that they earn. So I think you'll continue to see that be a strong force in the growth in our fees this year. And as you think about the cash flow, there are two points that I'd make on working capital. One is that generally speaking, as you remember, we are a negative working capital business overall, and as the company recovery continues, I think that trend will continue to show itself from the standpoint that our fees get paid so quickly, while it's not always the case that our payables have to be paid quite as quickly. So that will continue to help us on the working capital side. And as you pointed out, on loyalty we have moved from where we thought it was a slight source of cash to a slight use of cash as a result of higher redemptions. You know, I think you should expect as the year moves on that that will continue. But that is our current forecast for the year that ties in to these RevPAR numbers that we've talked about in the U.S. Steven Grambling : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning, everyone. And I'd also like to extend my thoughts and prayers for Laura. Anthony Capuano : Thank you, Shaun. Leeny Oberg : Thank you. Shaun Kelley : So, Tony or Leeny, just as we look at the outlook provided and appreciate, we're still, there's still enough volatility out there that you didn't want to extend yourselves too far yet. But if we think about some of your comments around the U.S. could you maybe just help us think through your puts and takes around sort of that outlook for flat for the, you know, relative to 2019 levels for the remainder of the year? Why not? What would be holding you back from maybe seeing a bit more improvement as the year goes on and we see Group and business travel fill in? Is there some give back over the summer as it might relate to luxury and mix or is there just some conservatism in that outlook? Leeny Oberg : Yes, I think\u2026 Anthony Capuano : There's a bit of conservatism in that outlook, but that conservatism is driven by what we've seen in terms of the booking windows. So we have much less visibility into Q3 and Q4, because the booking windows have been shortening generally and then the trend towards shorter group bookings is even more acute. And so we've shared with you the continued strength in leisure. We've talked to you a bit about the fact that we saw really strong group numbers at the end of the first quarter. We're feeling good about the last three quarters. But again, we're dealing with quite short booking windows. And the same is true with business transient. I think it's that murkiness of visibility in the back half of the year that's causing us not to be more bullish in terms of forecasting. Leeny Oberg : Yes, Shaun, just to add one point to that, Q2, obviously there's a meaningful improvement in RevPAR obviously to get to this roughly flat kind of guidance that we've given. And to Tony's point, it's really when you start looking further out, that while we have seen tremendous in the quarter for the quarter, in the year for the year Group bookings, we have really given you what we see today. So from that standpoint, the variability that we've seen, we would agree that hopefully that adds some positivity as we move through the year, but we're really talking about what we see today. Anthony Capuano : And maybe just to illustrate that even a little further Shaun, we look at the Group activity in the U.S. and Canada in April. April was the eighth straight month where in the year for the year bookings were ahead of where we were in 2019. So great news for our business, but creates a bit more challenges into looking into Q3 and Q4. Shaun Kelley : Understood, and then as just my follow up, could you just give a little bit more color on the large corporate activity? You did give some in the prepared remarks and I think you said it improved in April, as well. But you know, I think that's an important driver, particularly for Marriott, particularly some of the larger format and urban hotels. So maybe talk about how much you think that could reach by the balance or the end of the year, just kind of give us a sense of magnitude of improvement in that channel would be super helpful. Thank you. Anthony Capuano : Of course. So in the U.S. and Canada, business transient room nights were down as we said in the prepared remarks between 10% and 15% in March. That's obviously a very meaningful improvement over what we saw in the fourth quarter, where business transient room nights were down about 30%. As you might expect, the volume coming out of small and medium sized companies has effectively fully recovered while the demand from larger companies still has a bit of the hill to climb to get back to where we were pre-pandemic. But we continue to see that improvement just more slowly than what we've seen from the small and medium sized companies. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Anthony Capuano : Of course. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : Good morning, guys. I too, would like to extend my condolences. Laura was a very special person, she'll be missed. Anthony Capuano : Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Greff : Tony, how much or if any of new developments signing is related to developers, maybe it's not the right word to describe it, but pulling forward projects in front of and its stating higher development and financing costs for new projects? Anthony Capuano : I'm not sure I understand exactly your question, but let me give it a shot. The -- as we've talked about in the past, our developer and owner and franchisee community, they tend to be long-term investors in the sector. They don't as a general rule try to time construction starts or opening in a given month or a given quarter based on what they're seeing. I do think as we talked about last quarter, the availability of debt financing has likely been the single biggest impediment to an acceleration of new construction, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. And as that flow of debt capital starts to free up a little bit, that's why I think we're seeing a parallel increase in construction starts. It could actually be some pent up demand, but they're starting to believe, based on the statistics, that the recovery really has momentum and it's inspiring a bit more confidence in that development community to start putting shovels in the ground. Joseph Greff : Right, yes, that's a helpful way of answering that question. And then Leeny, I mean, I know you're not going to talk about the non-RevPAR fees within that franchising and other fee line. When you look at the composition of that line, I mean 34% of this quarter's franchise and other fees relates to the non-RevPAR fees is a similar percentage in the fourth quarter, when you think about it when you're coming out of this year, going into next year, how do you look at that percentage or how do you kind of look at the trajectory of credit card fees, and then on franchise fees there? Leeny Oberg : So yes, obviously, it's too soon to be talking about how we're really looking at credit cards then for 2023. But I think one thing to remember is that the residential is lumpy. So just as a reminder, last year, for example, we had $67 million in fees in 2021 for residential and the year before that, it was well under half of that. So just remember that that's a terrifically strong business for us and we love what we see in terms of signings and performance. But it is based on the pace of those sales of those residences and so it does vary up and down. But on the credit card part, which is, as you know, you know, well over half of the total number of, for example, 170 in the first quarter, I think steady as she goes, not willing to give a particular growth percentage, but I think it is really both a combination of strength of the consumer, so we're assuming that there's not a big change in the macroeconomic picture, and then number two is the connection to Bonvoy and to our overall system. And I think that that has definitely been part of what you're seeing in the growth. Just to remind you where we were pre-COVID is that the credit card growth within the high single digits pre-COVID, now obviously, we've seen better numbers than that as we're coming out of it. Joseph Greff : Thank you both. Anthony Capuano : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : Hi good morning. I'm also reiterate, I'm also very sorry to hear about Laura, very tragic and certainly she will be very much missed. Anthony Capuano : Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Thank you. Patrick Scholes : I have two questions. The first one is, when you talk about your forecast for development growth, 3.5% to 4%, can you tell us what those percentages are by global region, and specifically China, Europe et cetera and North America? Anthony Capuano : Yes, I'll have Jackie or Betsy give you the specific statistics. What I can tell you is, several quarters ago the composition of the pipeline pivoted towards a higher percentage of international. We're in the low 60% of the total pipeline is outside the U.S. And in terms of the relative pace of growth international versus domestic, we see international growing roughly twice as rapidly as our domestic rooms growth. Leeny Oberg : The other thing, just when you look at the pipeline, which is one of the kind of the interesting ways to look at it, Asia Pacific is basically roughly double the existing penetration of 17% split fairly evenly between China and APAC. And then I would say, for  and Europe, the pipeline is fairly similar relative to current proportions of the existing portfolio, though I will remind you, we had a very large conversion deal in  last year where they, you know, the conversions entered the pipeline quickly, and then actually opened, so it can vary. The other kind of disproportionate pipeline area is Middle East, Africa, where it's currently about 4% of our rooms, but it's about 9% of our pipeline. And then obviously, in the U.S., as we've talked about before, it's a bit lower relative to our existing makeup because of the strength in international. Anthony Capuano : And that's a great point on Middle East Leeny. In fact, if you look back pre-pandemic, Middle East rooms grew at about 6.5%. Last year, they grew closer to 8% and this year, they could grow in the mid teens. Patrick Scholes : Okay, very good, color, thank you. And then my follow up question, you had talked earlier in the prepared remarks, I believe, about upticks in royalty redemption in 1Q in perhaps April. Now, how should we think about what you know, as a quantify it as a sort of a percentage of fees, what is loyalty redemption as a percentage of fees? Leeny Oberg : So the best way to think about it, I think, is in terms of nights and redemption nights are in the ballpark of 5% to 6% of our total overall nights. So just when you think about that, that obviously can be someone going to see somebody where it's at a hotel that is not very full, and so then the redemption rate that is paid to that hotel is actually lower than RevPAR, or it can be at a high redemption hotel, where it is obviously more like typical average daily rate. But I think overall, the best way to think about it is roughly 5% of total rooms. Patrick Scholes : Okay. I appreciate the detail, thank you. Anthony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. Like everyone else on the call, I just wanted to say how sorry I was to hear about Laura. You know, . Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Smedes. Smedes Rose : I really wanted to just ask you a little bit more about what you're seeing and hearing from owners around wage pressure and from where that stands if people are seeing any sort of let up in that? And then just turning in general, I mean, I'm not sure you have the risk or their fears around recession have been heightened significantly, it's affecting this tightening phase. I'm just wondering if you have any kind of feedback from the corporates or whomever that you're speaking with, around heightened concerns on that front? Leeny Oberg : So I'll start on the wage pressures, and then we'll kind of tag team as we go through this Smedes. You know, there's no doubt if you remember, in the U.S. for us that the average hourly salary from January 21 to December of 21 was about a 10% increase. So, I mean, there's no doubt that in certain markets and certain hotels, places that that to get the hiring done, really did require some meaningful work. And what we are finding now that as, frankly, the world returns to a bit more normal pace of everything from availability of childcare, to the government subsidies winding down to, frankly, people feeling more comfortable about being in the workplace, that we have had an easier time getting positions filled, and we're basically back to a position of being relatively consistent with pre-pandemic levels of open positions. I'm really talking about the U.S. here. Now, I think certainly as you've described, we do expect to continue to have strong pressures on the wage and benefits front, we've worked incredibly hard on scheduling and productivity measures to make sure that we're managing the hotels the best way we can with also providing great service to the guests. And so right now, we've been thrilled to see that even with RevPAR our managed hotels, that RevPAR is meaningfully down compared to 2019, that our managed margins are similar. And we do expect to continue to see gains in occupancy as we move forward, which will be helpful. So we will keep some of this productivity gains, maybe 200 basis points ish around the world to help us offset inflation. But we're really glad that we reprice our rooms every night in terms of ADR, because there's no doubt that that's been a big help in managing these margins. And on the recession front, I guess I would point out two things. Number one, even though we saw a pretty tough GDP number come out recently, I think the factors behind it really point to actually a pretty strong economy. You've got really strong job additions in the U.S., you've got generally two jobs available for every person that's looking for a job, you've seen greater participation rates in chunks of the population. You've also seen that consumer spending continues to be really strong. And while the export markets for us were tough, I think in many respects, because of COVID in other parts of the world, they're really, I think there's good reason to think that the U.S. economy will continue to march along. Now, as we see what the Fed could do, that obviously could have a slowing impact. But we think there is still pent up demand and we believe that we'll continue to see strong demand for our hotels. Anthony Capuano : I think you said the second part of your question was really around big multinationals and attitudinally how they are thinking about travel going forward. I'll speak both anecdotally and then statistically, whether it's meeting with big multinationals here domestically. I was in Europe last week and met with about 30 travel managers for multinationals across Europe. There's a bit of a tug of war right now, I think between managing travel costs and being mindful of carbon footprint, and that's being pulled by the absolute desire to collaborate with colleagues, meet with customers, immerse new employees into corporate cultures. And the statistics, particularly that improvement to down 10% to 15% in business transient, which suggests that that appetite for the benefits of in-person interaction or are starting to win that tug of war a bit. Leeny Oberg : Just one other data point that I think you'd find interesting is that, in Q1 the average group size for all new loop bookings is actually up relative to Q1 2019 and one of the main factors is the length of stay. The length of stay is up 26% compared to 2019. So to Tony's point, I think there is a strong, compelling view that people being together to collaborate and to kind of have these meetings and be traveling, seeing your customers is still an important component of their business. Smedes Rose : Thank you, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Good morning. I would like to share my condolences to yourselves and also to Laura's family as well as for the events, very sad to hear about that. In terms of first question, just want to answer the, ask the sort of U.S. North America guidance question in a slightly different way, is there anything particular in April that pushed April performance sort of disproportionately higher like the timing of Easter or Passover or anything that pushed that higher? And how would you think about the rest of the shape of Q2 where you say you've got a reasonable amount of visibility coming out of April? Anthony Capuano : Yes, nothing particularly -- particular in terms of the calendar, not yet. We didn't see any particular impact from the timing of Easter. I think our view is generally it's just continued pace of demand recovery acceleration. Richard Clarke : Okay, that's helpful. And then just mentioned in the release, you mentioned the $33 million of government support that you received in the quarter. Just any color on where is that written support still being received and can we expect more of that to come through the rest of the year? Leeny Oberg : Thank you very much. No, I think this is kind of the tail end of some of the government subsidies. These were specifically in Europe. And similar to some other places that we've seen during COVID it required immense amounts of data submissions, and applications put in that then needed some time to be processed by the various governments. So these are all related to 2020 and 2021 sorts of expenses on the part of the hotels, because much of this relates to our owned leased portfolio, support of the associates there that then the government supported. So we -- you may remember that we had about $18 million of these subsidies in 2021. Then we have $33 million that we've talked about here today, and I would not expect additional subsidies going forward. Richard Clarke : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Anthony Capuano : Good morning. David Katz : And I'd like to share my condolences for literally everyone's loss. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, David. Anthony Capuano : Thank you, David. David Katz : Leeny, I wanted to just start with a capital returns perspective. You know, I think when we sat down to model for the last quarter, I guess it was early March. You know, we weren't really, you weren't really having us put much in this year and now we are. How could we sort of think about that the dividend enrolling for this year and potentially its ability to grow? And, more importantly, the stock buybacks, what you're kind of looking for or what data points, et cetera? Because we obviously, can't wait for you to tell us we have to sort of assert on our own? Leeny Oberg : Yes, no, absolutely. I -- couple things as reminder, this is a fairly similar pattern to how we did it coming out of the great recession, which is to give ourselves a time to see how the recovery is moving forward. So assuming that we continue to see the strength that we are seeing and that our bookings are showing, I would expect that we will obviously continue the dividend and fairly, in fairly short order, get it back to the kind of payout levels that we had prior to the pandemic. Share repurchase is obviously the much more flexible part of our capital return strategy. And so there, we've got some gatekeepers. We really want to absolutely feel comfortable about the positioning in our 3 to 3.5 times adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA range, that's an important part. And as I talked about in my comments, we're very close to that. And we will, with the kind of cash generation that our business model has, we'll get there very quickly. But we do want to be squarely in that range and feel comfortable that with possible volatility, that we're in good shape to stay there. So I think you will see as we've talked about, that assuming things continue as they are, I would expect that you will see both, the dividend continue, as well as the share repurchase. The timing of when we may have a dividend increase David, is really all around the pace of acceleration, whether this pace of acceleration continues or whether it's different. I just think we need a little bit more time to feel comfortable, because the one thing you know, once we raise that dividend, we want to make sure that we're comfortable to keep it there. We're very comfortable with the $0.30, and we'll be looking at it literally every single month as we move forward. David Katz : Understood, I appreciate it. If I can follow up just quickly on another direction, we're clearly seeing an acceleration and business travel and group and one that's expected to keep accelerating. Can you share some data points on what you're seeing in terms of midweek and where it is relative to weekend? I assume that, BT and group are more of a midweek question, rather than sort of weekend. Some of that would be helpful as well. Leeny Oberg : Sure, absolutely. So, interestingly, Fridays, and Saturdays we definitely were seeing in March that they were right around pre-pandemic levels. The shoulder days of Thursday and Sunday, were down a bit mid-single-digit compared to 2019. Monday through Wednesday, they were down more in the mid teens. So that's where you classically can see. What Tony talked about earlier is that some of the special corporate negotiated business you would classically think are the Monday through Wednesday nights, they are probably the last to come back in terms of comparison to 2019, but again, improving nicely as we moved from January to February to March. Anthony Capuano : And then I think, given that pattern David, you also see it manifest itself a little bit in terms of rate. ADR on the weekends was about 4% higher than it was on weekdays in the quarter. David Katz : Perfect. Thanks a lot. Anthony Capuano : Of course. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Chad Beynon with Macquaire Group. Chad Beynon : Hi good morning. Anthony Capuano : Good morning. Chad Beynon : Thoughts and prayers from myself for Laura's friends and family as well. I wanted to maybe ask kind of a pretty pointed question on IMF. Leeny, I know you've given us some sensitivity just around the model. But as we think about the recovery for IMFs particularly domestically, is there a level of growth of RevPAR growth we need to see versus pre-pandemic levels to get that domestic IMF level kind of back to where it was kind of factoring in for real expenses that we've seen for the past couple of years and any CapEx investments from your partners? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Yes, sure. So two things that I would say, a couple facts for you, just to give you perspective. I think again, we were really pleased with the IMFs in Q1. They were again, roughly 40% coming from the U.S. and Canada and frankly, that's only down so call that $40 million, that's only down from the high $50s millions in 2019, while RevPAR is obviously still down in the mid teens for those hotels in the U.S. So it's really impressive performance. In Q1 of 2019 56% of the U.S. hotels paid an IMF while in Q1 this year, we're at 12%. So to your point, there is a way to go and it obviously is they're much stronger in the luxury and resort hotels. It's a bit of a step function, where so many hotels have this jump from an owners priority in the U.S. to then where they actually earn that, there's not, I can't point to one particular kind of demarcation point that will tell you that we can jump. In the international it is much more aligned with what happens with base fees, because as you know, there with every dollar of profit we get a percentage with, without an owner's priority in many of the hotels. So in the U.S., obviously the big weakness right now is still on the occupancy side and that will help us particularly in the large cities as we continue to see gains in the premium hotels in the big cities. But there's unfortunately not one particular place that says if we get to ADR of whatever it is or RevPAR that that's going to clinch it. But again, one of the points that that I made during my comments, we're really pleased to see the margins being similar to 2019 levels and we're hopeful that that will continue for the rest of the year that we're able to hold on to this kind of margin performance for the full year for these manageable service hotels in the U.S. and that will obviously get us more IMF. If you remember, you can only recognize IMF as you look at your four year forecast. So that's one of the other things as we continue to move through the year, we'll have more visibility about the full year forecast for these hotels, which will also be helpful. Chad Beynon : Okay, great, thanks. And then just a high level on the strength of the growing consumer demand in premium and luxury properties and resort areas, in the past couple of years you've made inroads, I guess from the same-store bases with elegant, with homes and villas, do you think you kind of have the right offerings or are there more opportunities for you organically or inorganically to expand in these markets? Anthony Capuano : Yes, yes and yes is the short answer. I think, Chad, the even pre-pandemic, whether it be because of what we were hearing from our customers, what we thought would act as an accelerant to the appeal of the Bonvoy platform, we have been very focused on continuing to accelerate the growth of our resort portfolio. Similarly, we saw both from a development perspective and a guest perspective, tremendous appetite for all inclusive experiences in certain markets, and whole home rentals for certain trip types. I think you will continue to see us look at organic growth in all of those areas. And as has always been the case, continue to look at portfolio deals like what we did with Sunwing last year in the all inclusive space. Chad Beynon : Thanks, Anthony, I appreciate it. Anthony Capuano : My pleasure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thank you. Let me add my condolences on the terrible loss of Laura. Anthony Capuano : Thank you, Robin. Leeny Oberg : Thank you. Robin Farley : My two questions, one is, I know you gave a great color on group accelerating in the year for the year. I don't know if I -- if you said where 2023 is booked relative to pre-pandemic, just kind of wondering if the kind of further group demand is coming back, you know, maybe with a little more certainty than the closer in? And then also Leeny, I just want to make sure I understood your comment about how is the loyalty program impacting your RevPAR guidance? I just wanted to make sure I understood that, thanks. Anthony Capuano : Great, I'll take the first one, Robin. So as we talked about 2022, we talked about the first quarter being down about 30. The remaining three quarters being down high single digits, which give us confidence that we will end up down 15-ish for 2022, although that could improve meaningfully given the short-term booking window that we've seen. As we look into 2023, looking at what's on the books today, we're down about 15% relative to 2019. But take my comment about booking window we think there is massive opportunity to close that gap between now and the beginning of 2023. Leeny Oberg : And Robin, it's worth noting that the rate for 2023 has improved relative to a quarter ago, when we look at the rate on the group pace for 2023. And as Tony said, we would continue to expect to see in the year for the year bookings. Anthony Capuano : When we talked to you last quarter Robin, about group, 2023 ADR was pacing up about 4%. As we sit here today, we're up about 6.5%. Leeny Oberg : And on your question about loyalty, no meaningful impact. So, loyalty redemptions have been about 5% of our room nights pre-pandemic and are now. So they kind of fit in with the overall scheme of how those hotels are doing, depending on what market and what tier they are. So no particular impact that's any different from when we normally look at our RevPAR performance. Robin Farley : Okay, all right. That's great. Thank you. Anthony Capuano : Thanks, Robin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Great, thanks. I also want to express my condolences for Laura. A question on profitability, you mentioned managed hotels being back. I know in the past, you have discussed finding a balance between owner profitability and guest expectations, and I'm curious how do you think you're doing the year-to-date specifically around where you're at with housekeeping and food and beverage, and reintroducing those in a manner that's meeting guest expectations? Anthony Capuano : So I'll try to answer that qualitatively and Leeny may provide a little color in terms of margins. I would say, we are making good progress trying to strike that right balance. We will be landing on our housekeeping solution and announcing that probably towards the end of the second quarter. I think in the markets where demand has recovered most quickly, I think we're doing a particularly strong job of striking that right balance. In some of the urban markets, where demand has been a bit more slow to recover, I think we are on the right path, but we still have some work to do in front of us. Vince Ciepiel : Great. And then second unrelated, came up earlier on the home sharing business, travel peer in that space, just printed 1Q results that were almost double that of 2019 levels. So I'm curious how your homes and villas by Marriott business has been performing, and how you think about the level of investment that you've made in that space, and kind of where you go from here? Anthony Capuano : Sure. So I think we talked last quarter, the growth of the platform itself in terms of listings has been pretty remarkable. Pre-pandemic, we had 2000 to 3000 listings. We find ourselves today with about 57,000 listings at the end of the first quarter, still tiny relative to some of the peers in that space. But again, I think distinguished a bit because the composition of our portfolio is 100% multi-bedroom full homes. These are not spare rooms or couches or anything else. These are full, multi-bedroom homes. As you would expect with that sort of exponential growth in the sheer volume of listings, we've seen a very meaningful uptick in the revenue coming through that platform. Leeny Oberg : And I'll turn it on the financial side is just a reminder that this is extremely small relative to kind of the overall size of Marriott from a financial standpoint, really across the spectrum of both investment as well as profitability. And from that perspective, I would expect to see it the same way moving forward. This has been a really important part of our overall ecosystem, and when we think about it, 90% of the bookings in HBMI  or from Bonvoy member, and that is just great recognition of the extra strength that it gives our overall system. But from an overall perspective to Marriott, I would not expect for you to see it be a meaningful part of our earnings stream in the near-term. Jackie Burka McConagha : Operator? Operator : Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Tony Capuano for any additional or closing remarks. Anthony Capuano : Thank you, operator. First, let me thank you all for your heartfelt condolences. I know how special Laura was to you both as a friend and a colleague, so thank you for those kind words. Thanks for your interest and participation today and we look forward to seeing you on the road in the coming weeks and months. Have a great day, thanks. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2022 and 2019 reflects properties that are defined as comparable as of June 30, 2022 even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to pre-pandemic or 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Thank you, Jackie and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were driven by robust demand for our brands around the world. By the last month of the quarter, RevPAR in all regions outside of Asia-Pacific had more than fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, leading to June global RevPAR 1% above 2019. Worldwide occupancy for the month rose to 71%, just 5 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels, with global ADR an impressive 8% over the same month in 2019. Demand across all customer segments improved during the quarter. Record leisure demand strengthened further with second quarter global leisure transient room nights 14% above the 2019 second quarter. Group demand experienced the greatest acceleration. In the U.S. and Canada, group RevPAR had nearly fully recovered in June, down just 1% to 2019 compared to down 17% in March. Group revenue pace for the back half of the year has also continued to improve. June in the year, for the year, new bookings were up 50% compared to those bookings in June of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group RevPAR for the remainder of 2022 was pacing just a few percentage points down to 2019. We expect additional short-term bookings will further bolster group revenues, which could lead to second half group RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada being even to even up slightly compared to 2019. Our sales team remains focused on driving group average rate, which has been steadily rising for new bookings. At our hotels in the U.S. and Canada, ADR for in the year, for the year group bookings made in January, was just above 2019 levels. But by June, the rate had risen to up 16%. Business transient demand also strengthened, albeit at a more moderate pace as workers returned to the office in greater numbers. In the U.S. June business transient room nights were 9% below the same month in 2019 versus down about 20% in the first quarter. Day of the week trends in the U.S. and Canada suggest that travelers are continuing to combine leisure and business trips. While occupancy midweek has continued to recover, in June, Monday through Wednesday occupancy was still around 10 percentage points below 2019. Occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was fully recovered and occupancy on Thursdays and Sundays, typically known as shoulder nights, was close to 2019 levels. With nearly all major countries around the world having opened their borders, rising cross-border travel was another key driver of the solid recovery during the quarter. However, cross-border travel is still not fully back to pre-pandemic levels. So, there is still additional upside, especially from Greater China, where stringent travel restrictions remain in place. While we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. On the contrary, the pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending towards experiences versus goods, sustained high levels of employment and the lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders in most markets around the world are fueling travel. And as Leeny will discuss, we expect to see continued RevPAR recovery through the end of the year. As travelers get back on the road in increasing numbers, our 169 million Bonvoy members are more actively engaging with our powerful loyalty platform. Monthly active users of our app, digital visits and direct digital bookings, which help drive the owner and franchisee profitability, all reached new highs in June. Additionally, more members are earning and using points outside of a hotel stay as a result of our focus on enhancing the platform through numerous collaborations. The number of Bonvoy co-brand credit card holders is climbing globally, with card acquisitions and total card spend both hitting record levels in the second quarter. Remarkably, the number of global card accounts rose 16% from the end of 2019 through the end of the second quarter this year. In July, we introduced a new credit card in China and the initial response has been tremendous. Turning to the development front. The pace of deal activity continues to pick up. In the second quarter, we signed another 135 deals, a second quarter record following a record first quarter. Additionally, despite supply chain issues, labor shortages, cost inflation and rising interest rates, the number of deals falling out of the pipeline remains below historical levels. Interest in conversions remains particularly strong given the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales as owners continue to seek out the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott portfolio. Conversions represented 30% of room signings in the quarter. One win to highlight is a recent landmark agreement for 8 hotels in Vietnam with Vinpearl, a new owner to our system. The deal includes 6 conversion hotels that are expected to add 1,700 rooms to the system. Conversions also represented 25% of the roughly 17,000 rooms added to our system in the quarter. While construction timelines have lengthened a bit this year in most markets due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we still expect the number of room additions to ramp in the second half of the year. For the full year, gross additions are still anticipated to approach 5%. Given our announcement several weeks ago that we are suspending all operations in Russia, we now expect a 1.5% to 2% deletion rate for 2022. While our expectation for deletions outside of Russia remains at 1% to 1.5%, the deletion of 6,500 rooms in the country represents almost 0.5 percentage point. Now as a reminder, fees from Russia represented well under 0.5% of global fees in 2019. We have not been recognizing fees from Russia for many months now and the financial impact of these rooms leaving is de minimis. So, our net rooms growth for 2022 could now be 3% to 3.5% or 3.5% to 4% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. We remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid single-digit net rooms growth rate. The timing will largely depend on when new construction starts, which have trailed well below 2019 levels for the last 2 years really begin to accelerate, particularly here in the U.S. Construction timelines in the U.S. are currently just over 2 years for a limited service hotel and longer for full-service properties. Looking ahead with the largest footprint in the industry, strong builder affinity for our brands and the improving global travel environment, I am bullish about the company\u2019s future growth prospects for development and for the company overall. I want to take a moment and thank all of our associates around the world. Their commitment to taking care of our guests has helped produce our outstanding results and I am so very proud of their dedication and resilience. And now, I will turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Global RevPAR continued to rebound sharply and Marriott reported outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Record quarterly global fees and adjusted EBITDA were both 7% above the same quarter in 2019. Second quarter global RevPAR was down only 3% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Looking at the regions, in the U.S. and Canada, RevPAR came in ahead of our expectations largely due to stronger than anticipated growth in ADR and group demand. Compared to 2019, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada was up 1% in the quarter and up 3% in June. ADR has improved each month this year, reaching 9% above pre-pandemic levels in June. Occupancy further strengthened from the first to the second quarter on both an absolute basis and versus pre-pandemic levels. June occupancy of 76% was within 4 percentage points of the same month in 2019. In June, U.S. and Canada RevPAR more than fully recovered across all market types, primary, secondary and tertiary, for the first time since the pandemic began. It has been very encouraging to see demand come back so powerfully in major cities like New York, where RevPAR increased 7% versus June 2019. With orders opened in Europe, the room nights from international guests more than doubled in the region from the first quarter to the second. With this strong return of international travel, Europe has experienced the swiftest RevPAR recovery of all of our regions this year. RevPAR in Europe topped 2019 levels in June a remarkable 57 percentage point increase from January. Cross-border travel also helped drive strong second quarter results in the Middle East and Africa and in the Caribbean and Latin America area. Second quarter RevPAR rose 16% in EMEA and 13% in CALA compared to 2019. Asia-Pacific, excluding China, saw rapid RevPAR improvement during the second quarter as the region is now mostly open with India and Australia more than fully recovered. Second quarter RevPAR was down 22% compared to 2019 given the lack of travelers from Greater China and the fact that rigorous travel restrictions remain in place in Japan, one of our largest markets in the region. Greater China continues to lag the recovery of other regions due to its strict zero COVID policy. RevPAR during the quarter declined more than 50% compared to 2019 as a result of the lockdowns in many cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. Total company gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter driven by higher RevPAR rooms growth and another quarter of significant growth in our non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Those fees totaled $204 million in the second quarter driven largely by growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose a remarkable 38% year-over-year. Incentive management fees, or IMF, increased meaningfully in the quarter, reaching $135 million. Over half of our IMFs came from U.S. and Canada, where we earned more IMFs than we did in the second quarter of 2019. At the hotel level working closely with our owners and franchisees to contain operating costs while delivering superior customer service remains a key area of focus. Profit margins at our U.S. managed hotels were 3 percentage points higher than 2019 levels in the second quarter despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. We are keeping an eye on wages and benefits as industry staffing challenges persist in certain markets. Yet we remain optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years. G&A and other expenses totaled $231 million in the second quarter primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals as well as increased travel expense. With COVID now essentially endemic, global borders overwhelmingly open and business somewhat more predictable, we are providing guidance for the third quarter and the full year. The full details are in our press release. There is still a higher than usual degree of uncertainty in our outlook, especially as it relates to Greater China, but we are encouraged by the positive momentum in demand across customer segments and robust ADRs in the vast majority of markets around the world. We expect the global RevPAR recovery to continue each quarter through the end of the year driven by improving occupancy and ADR compared to 2019 in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. On a worldwide basis compared to 2019, we could see RevPAR flat to up 3% in the third quarter and down 6% to down 3% for the full year. Compared to 2021, global RevPAR in the third quarter could be up in the mid-30% range, and for the full year, it could be up around 50%. For the full year, we are now anticipating G&A expenses of $890 million to $900 million due to higher compensation accruals as well as travel expenses, but still well below [Technical Difficulty]. And we expect adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, above our prior full year peak in 2019. We now expect full year investment spending of $600 million to $650 million. Our guidance now includes roughly $200 million for maintenance capital in our new headquarters. Loyalty is still expected to be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was in the low-end of our targeted range of 3x to 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDAR. We resumed share repurchases during the quarter and have already bought 448 million of stock as of July 29 in addition to paying our dividend in the second quarter at $0.30 per share. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We will make investments that enhance our growth and increase shareholder value, while returning any excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to our investment grade rating. Given our outlook for further global recovery and our powerful business model that is generating significant cash beyond our investment needs, we expect to return more than $2.2 billion to shareholders this year. This level of capital returns is included in the guidance we have provided today. Looking ahead, I am very optimistic about our future. Marriott is incredibly well positioned given the breadth and depth of our unparalleled global portfolio, our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, and the best team in the business. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning everyone. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Shaun Kelley : I wanted to start off pretty much where you left off, Leeny, on the capital return program. I feel like once every 10 years or so, we get this quarter where everything kind of comes together on that. And obviously, it\u2019s a major increase from where we found ourselves at just a quarter ago. Could you talk about the levers there? And then sort of where does this take you as it would relate to your longer term goals around your leverage range? Does this keep you solidly in the middle of that? Do you \u2013 or where would it put you relative to that kind of at the end of the year and maybe give us a little teaser for what this could mean for 2023 as well? Leeny Oberg : Sean, I think you said it best in your question that it really is back to where we were in terms of the way the model fundamentally works. As I said in my statement, we are at the low-end of the 3x to 3.5x adjusted debt to EBITDAR at the end of Q2 and we have given you a model that keeps us squarely and comfortably in that range. And we obviously want to keep our flexibility both in terms of investment opportunities as well as taking advantage of excess available cash. So, I think you will continue to see us move forward with the exact same approach that we have taken for some time. Shaun Kelley : Great. And maybe just as a very quick follow-up, Tony, you have a lot of great color just kind of walking us through group, leisure and a little bit on the business transient side, particularly the day of the week\u2019s commentary. Could you just talk specifically around leisure, there is a lot of fear out there around the ability to lap some of the incredible rate gains that have occurred? So just what are you seeing maybe across some of the resort properties or areas where you know that the recovery happened a little faster and consumer demand patterns have changed? Any signs of weakness or softness that would concern you at all at this stage? Tony Capuano : Thanks, Sean. The short answer is not really. The already robust leisure demand that we have seen in the last couple of quarters, continue to improve. Leisure room nights were up 14% to 2019 in the quarter and they were only up 11% in the first quarter. So, we continue to see acceleration and we continue to see more and more of this blended trip purpose. In my remarks, I talked a little bit about day-of-the-week patterns. And so I think that\u2019s quite encouraging to us as well. And then, finally, we have not talked a lot about international cross-border travel. While we are seeing improvement, we are not back to where we were pre-pandemic and we think that represents some upside on the leisure segment as well. And then the last thing I would say is all of those are comments about demand levels. We continue to see really encouraging pricing power on the leisure side as well. It\u2019s a little early to talk about the winter holidays. But as we look at Labor Day, for instance, we continue to see double-digit increases in ADR relative to where we were pre-pandemic. Shaun Kelley : Very helpful. Thank you, both. Tony Capuano : Thank you, Shaun. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Hi, good morning, everybody. Tony Capuano : Hi, Joe. Leeny Oberg : Hi, Joe. Joe Greff : Tony, I was hoping maybe you could give us a sense of corporate rate negotiations for 2023 corporate rates. I know the last couple of years, they have been sort of non-events because corporate demand has been relatively low. How are you thinking of corporate pricing? And maybe how are those negotiations different now versus what they have been in the past? Tony Capuano : Of course. So as you know, for business transient, we rolled over special corporate rates since the beginning of the pandemic. We\u2019re just now starting the negotiation process for 2023. And so again, it\u2019s early, but we can certainly imagine those rates being up high single digits year-over-year in 2023. Joe Greff : Great. And then, Tony, just switching topics, you mentioned about net rooms growth accelerating, and this is before the impact of Russia, which I\u2019m looking at it as sort of a one-time thing. But when you look at 2023, 2024, 2025 net rooms growth and during some periods seeing it accelerate from where you are now, does that require more meaningful financial assistance for Marriott to third-party hotel owners or is that just a function of kind of getting through sort of a longer construction time table? Tony Capuano : I think, much more the latter. Now I was quite thrilled with our conversion volume both on signings and openings in the second quarter. It is a competitive market for conversions. I\u2019m quite pleased that we had more conversion openings than any of our peers in the quarter, and we will continue to try to do smart conversions, which means we will use the same capital discipline you\u2019ve come to know us for even pre pandemic. I think to really see acceleration, and this is an industry comment as much as a Marriott comment, particularly in the U.S., you have seen a slowing in construction starts. Just over the last quarter, we have seen that start to tick up, although not to levels we saw in 2019. But I think we will do our best to continue to drive conversion volume and do everything we can to get shovels in the ground. You may know that I had the privilege to spend a little time with the administration last week, and one of the things that we spoke to the administration about was seeking assistance to resolve some of the supply chain issues that continue to slow some of the construction starts. Leeny Oberg : And Joe, just one follow-on, we talked about two record quarters of signings so far this year. And to your specific question, they did not involve a greater-than-usual element of capital from Marriott for those signings? Tony Capuano : And then maybe just to put a fine point on your question, Joe, our confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-single-digit net unit growth, there is a couple of things in the release. The fact that we had quarter-over-quarter growth in the pipeline, the fact that we continue to have more than 200,000 rooms globally under construction and that we continue to see accelerated volume in both signings and openings on the conversion front combined to strengthen that confidence. Joe Greff : Excellent color. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning, everyone. Question for you on the back half guidance or implied back half guidance. Would you say that is higher, same \u2013 higher or the same than your internal assumptions as of last May, last earnings? Leeny Oberg : Yes, it is. There is no doubt that the recovery has accelerated faster than we had originally anticipated. And I think it\u2019s both in rate and occ in varying parts of the world. I think the cross-border has been obviously incredibly encouraging to see that topped Europe as an example, meaningfully faster than expected. But yes, I think it is stronger than our expectations both a quarter ago. And then frankly, a quarter ago was better than we expected a quarter before that. Patrick Scholes : Okay, great. Then a follow-up question, this goes back to the lingering one about what percentage of business travel may be permanently gone. And in my data research, for the higher-end customer, it looks like down 20% to 25%. But my question with that is how much do you think that higher-end customer has shifted to Thursday and Sunday nights. And how much has the smaller and medium-sized businesses offset that perhaps loss from the higher corporate customer? Tony Capuano : Well, there is no question that the rapid improvement in occupancies in the shoulder days has been maybe a bit of a surprising but encouraging development. When we think about business transient demand, the small and medium-sized businesses, they are back. They are back above 2019 levels of volume. As you point out, the bigger corporate customers, they are not quite back yet. But even there, we continue to see steady improvement, albeit not necessarily as rapid as we might like. Patrick Scholes : Okay, thank you very much. Tony Capuano : Thank you, Patrick. Operator : Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. Two questions. One is on group for 2023. Are you starting to see that? I think a quarter ago it may have been down 10% or 15% below group in 2019 at the time for 2020. Just wondering if you\u2019re starting to see the group sort of stepping up a little bit more because it seems intuitive at some point that, that could actually be higher than \u201819. But wondering how that is shaping up right now? Tony Capuano : Sure. So maybe I can give you a couple of statistics, and Leeny may provide some color as well. When we look at bookings for \u201823 during 2022, we are down about 2% in revenue versus where we would have been for the bookings in 2019. But interestingly, ADR is up 16%. So we continue to see that strong pricing power. And we\u2019re even more optimistic, Robin, as you heard in our prepared remarks, because of the shorter booking window in group, even through the back half of this year and most certainly into \u201823, we expect those numbers to continue to improve as we see more and more short-term bookings. Leeny Oberg : So Robin, I\u2019ll add a couple of comments. I think the major theme we\u2019ve got is in the quarter, for the quarter, in the year, for the year. In June, the benefit of that really got us to where group RevPAR was only down 1% in the month. So when we look at the rest of this year, from what\u2019s on the books currently, we are seeing low single digits for the rest of the year in terms of group revenue, while next year, we\u2019re still kind of in the 15% down, but I think you need to continue to think about this booking pattern, which is much closer to the actual event that has been filling in really nicely. So it\u2019s not that different for \u201823 versus a quarter ago except from what we\u2019re seeing in the quarter for the quarter, and even in the back half of \u201822, we\u2019re seeing some really great fill-in business that has got us pretty close to \u201819 levels where we could end up actually exceeding \u201819 levels in the back half of this year. Robin Farley : And that\u2019s exceeding in terms of rate, not necessarily group room nights but just in terms of total group revenues? Leeny Oberg : Yes, that\u2019s total \u2013 that is definitely total group revenue. Again, it\u2019s obviously where we are seeing it fill in. It\u2019s not just rate. It\u2019s also occ as we fill in the business. But you\u2019re right, the rate on group has been performing incredibly well. Robin Farley : Okay. Great, thank you. And then just the other question was in terms of conversions, which seems to be doing really nicely, is this \u2013 I guess, how long do you think will the sort of the tail of conversions that are a result of the pandemic and the downturn? From what you\u2019ve seen historically, when there are downturns, kind of how much after? In other words, is it sort of a year of higher conversions, a year out or 2 years of higher? I guess, how should we think about what trajectory the conversion demand may follow. Thanks. Tony Capuano : I continue to be quite bullish, Robin, on the trajectory of conversions for a few reasons. Number one, unlike some conventional downturns we\u2019ve experienced in the past, where early in the downturn, you saw a lot of distress, the impact to our business was so severe that you saw the lenders being much more creative than accommodating with owners. So you didn\u2019t necessarily see a flood of distressed assets changing hands in the market. As demand and performance have recovered, there is the potential that there may be more assets in play, number one. Number two, the portfolio of conversion-friendly brands we have, particularly our soft brands, Tribute, Autograph and Luxury Collection is more robust than we\u2019ve ever armed our transactors in any other recessionary environment. And I combine those two factors, and it drives my bullishness about that trajectory. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Of course. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you sort of conceptually, as the recovery kind of continues, which so far has been driven by such strong rate, which we\u2019ve seen have great kind of flow-through to owners with lower occupancies, but as the world sort of continues to normalize, hopefully, next year, would you expect to see occupancies get back to pre-pandemic levels and potentially maybe a significant slowdown in rate in order to get there? Or do you think it\u2019s just sort of a structural change where owners are like we\u2019re going to charge higher rate, even if it means sacrificing occupancy to kind of simplify it? Tony Capuano : Well, as Leeny mentioned in response to an earlier question, we do believe the recovery will continue to be driven by both occupancy and rate. You also heard her refer a bit to some of the murkiness beyond the end of the year. But we do expect both occupancy and rate continue to improve through the end of \u201822. And we continue to be pleased with the pace of rate recovery through the first half of this year. Leeny Oberg : So one other comment, Smedes and that is that \u2013 to remember that we\u2019re comparing to \u201819. So that on inflation adjusted numbers, rate has not kept up with kind of real rates. So in that regard, I think while it\u2019s fabulous and we\u2019re thrilled to see the consumers love travel and don\u2019t want to put it off, the reality is that there is inflation and that we are pricing these rooms on a very frequent basis and that, on a real rate basis, they are not back to 2019 levels. Smedes Rose : Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to\u2026 Tony Capuano : Good morning. David Katz : Good morning. I just wanted to drill down a little deeper on for corporate travel. If you could color us in just a little bit, there is so much data and useful out there about certain cities versus others, urban versus non-urban corporate. Is there anything that you can share that you are picking up in your flow with respect to urban versus not in those various segments? Tony Capuano : Well, what I can tell you, some of this may be a little more anecdotal, but the early days of the recovery were clearly dominated by leisure destinations, trailed significantly by what we saw in the urban core. In many of the major urban markets across the country and across the world, we continue to see a reasonably steady and encouraging improvement in terms of both occupancy and rate. And we hear anecdotally from our corporate clients. We\u2019re seeing more and more return to the office, which is driving business demand. And when we look at some of the big major markets that I think are decent indicators for us, you look at New York, for instance, that had an 86% occupancy in the quarter. You look at San Francisco, 78%; Washington, D.C., 76%; Los Angeles, 80%. You are seeing steady volumes of demand recovering in many of those markets that were trailing the leisure destinations. David Katz : Understood. And just as a quick follow-up. Leeny, in your comments you made, I think, kind of a passing comment about labor. And if you could go just a little bit farther as to whether you are still seeing wages continue to increase, whether they are flat or taking some other direction and, within that, the international element within the United States and the degree to which that labor force is starting to return or whether it hasn\u2019t yet and what those outcomes might be would be helpful. Leeny Oberg : Sure. Yes. We are seeing \u2013 continuing to see hourly wages go up. And when I look at it compared to \u201819, the reality is, overall, and this comment is actually regarding U.S. and Canada, that it has kept up with inflation, if not just a teeny bit higher than that. It has slowed. The pace of increase has slowed. And one of the things that I think is interesting is to look at the positions that we\u2019re trying to fill if, for example, normal staffing levels were that we were trying to fill the final 95% to 100% of the positions we needed at the hotel level. Right now, we\u2019re at 93%. So it\u2019s definitely improved. It is not back to where we were in \u201819 in terms of the labor shortage, but we\u2019re definitely seeing steady improvement, and the wage increases have slowed. Outside the U.S., it\u2019s much more varied. It really depends on the particular market. And I would say Europe probably has seen some more similarities to the U.S., while in Asia Pacific, for example, there is really been far less of the kind of pressures that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. David Katz : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt Montour : Hello. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Curious if you could unpack leisure demand a little bit more, and maybe let us know if you are seeing greater dispersion and pricing elasticities between your luxury end and your more middle brands. Leeny Oberg : So a couple of things. One of the easiest ways to think about luxury is that rate has continued to stay very strong. But what we\u2019ve also seen is that the markets that were previously weaker, like a New York or San Francisco, the luxury hotels in those markets are now filling in. They, on average, are not necessarily quite as high as in some of the resort markets. So it actually makes it look, on a blended basis, like the gains in ADR and luxury are not as strong, while the reality is just the opposite, that they continue to be quite strong. I think one of the most encouraging things to see is that the overall luxury portfolio is continuing to gain in both occ and rate. And then as Tony was talking about earlier, I think it\u2019s also particularly encouraging to see the premium market, the Marriotts, the Sheratons, the Renaissances in kind of all markets really recovering now more in the second quarter meaningfully than they were in the first quarter. So we really don\u2019t expect that we are depending on continued additional ADR gains in luxury through the rest of this year, but we do continue to see really strong demand. So I think it is tide-floats-all-boats view of what we\u2019re seeing, which is demand across all segments continuing to strengthen. Tony Capuano : And I think just to give some context to that, we still saw in the second quarter in the U.S. and Canada, luxury rate up 23% in the quarter versus \u201819. So lots of questions around how much runway we have for luxury but another really solid quarter in terms of the luxury pricing. Brandt Montour : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up on business travel, when you think about your large portfolio of corporate accounts, I was just curious if you could give us a sense of how much of your demand mix is earlier stage companies within technology, biotechnology and other slices of the corporate world that could potentially be reining in expenses faster than average? Tony Capuano : Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll try. SMEs represent now about 60% to 65% of our business transient demand, which is a bit higher than what we experienced pre pandemic. The bigger corporate clients continue to steadily improve. And over time, we expect to get maybe not all the way back but closer to where we were in terms of the mix of SMEs versus large corporate clients. But right now, it\u2019s in the 60% to 65% range that is the category I think you\u2019re talking about. Brandt Montour : Okay. Thanks so much Tony. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario from Baird. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning everyone. First, just a quick modeling question, I think you have given the sensitivity of $25 million to $30 million of fee revenue for 1 point change in RevPAR. What is that updated range? And then how might that ratio change looking out to 2023 in a more normalized growth environment? Leeny Oberg : Yes. Sure. Comparing to \u201821, it\u2019s $25 million to $30 million per point of RevPAR in \u201822 versus \u201821. We are not in a position yet to talk about \u201823, all of that budgeting work. But I would expect it to continue to be somewhat similar. It varies, as you know, depending on what part of the world the improvements happen. It\u2019s obviously more per point of RevPAR compared to \u201819. You get into the weeds on differences in comp sets, etcetera. But it is probably closer to $40 million per point if you are comparing a point of RevPAR in \u201822 to a point of RevPAR in \u201819. Michael Bellisario : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one follow-up on group, can you maybe provide some details on what group planners are asking for differently today and then maybe how booking patterns are either the same or different today versus pre-pandemic? Tony Capuano : Sure. Again, this will maybe be a bit anecdotal. We just held an event called The Exchange, which was where we hosted about 500 corporate and association meeting planners. In general sessions and in some smaller executive forums, we had a chance to talk to them and essentially ask the question you just asked. And I would say the two themes I heard most notably. Number one, they gave us high marks for our flexibility on issues like attrition during the pandemic. And I think they are hopeful we would continue to show that level of flexibility into perpetuity, which, as demand improves, we are tightening up a bit. And they understand that intellectually. They are just wishing for the good old days where they had maximum flexibility. The other theme we heard loud and clear is an increasing focus on the company\u2019s efforts around all things ESG and an increasing number of our \u2013 both corporate and association booking contracts. They are asking for not only our publicly stated goals, but for reports on our progress against those goals. Leeny Oberg : And just one other interesting stat that I think is helpful is that length of stay for \u2013 up almost 25% compared to 2019, as is the average size for new bookings. So, again, I think this all continues to emphasize that associations, companies, organizations are wanting to get their people together. Tony Capuano : And then one fine point that I forgot about from some of the conversations at The Exchange, they asked us from a technology perspective to do everything we can to make it easier for them to tack on a couple of leisure days to their reservation pre or post meeting, which was just another confirmation that this idea of blended trip purpose will likely endure well beyond the end of the pandemic. Michael Bellisario : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just the first one on China. To what extent is China a normal environment now for signings, but not a normal environment for construction? So, how much of that is the bridge back to your mid-single digit unit growth you are expecting to get back to? Tony Capuano : So, there is a couple of questions embedded there. I think our deal volume and our openings are off peak, but they are steadily recovering. The vast majority of our operating hotels and the vast majority of the projects in our pipeline are domestically owned. And so those domestic entities continue to benefit from the Central Government encouraging domestic travel across China. And many of those hotels are benefiting from increased volumes of domestic travel, albeit some pauses when certain markets go into lockdown. And so our expectation is a steady improvement, but we have not embedded in our guidance any sort of wholesale lifting of zero COVID policy that we have seen over the last couple of quarters. Richard Clarke : Excellent guys. Thanks so much. Maybe just a quick follow-up, if I may. I noticed your kind of capital returns guidance says that depends on whether you do any disposals this year. I mean is that likely, are you looking at the owned portfolio again? Are there any potential disposals to come? Leeny Oberg : We are always looking, but the numbers that I gave do not assume any additional asset sales this year. Richard Clarke : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research. Vince Ciepiel : Great. Thanks. Really encouraging to see margins ahead, IMFs ahead. It sounds like cost reduction efforts are certainly helping to offset the labor wage pressure. But as you dig into that, I would be curious how you are thinking about the customer experience from the average Bonvoy guest. I know there has been some surveys out which can be lagging, talking about how the consumer feels about scaled-back breakfast offerings, changes in housekeeping. So, as you look at things more recently, how do you think the guest is feeling today versus summer of 2019? Tony Capuano : I would say it\u2019s very much a work in progress, but we are really encouraged by the metrics that we monitor through guest satisfaction surveys and particularly the intent-to-return numbers. We are not quite back to where we were pre-pandemic, but we have made meaningful and steady progress on those metrics. As you may recall from some prior earnings calls, in the depths of the pandemic, we suspended some of those quality metrics. Those are all back in place now, brand, standard, audits, guest surveys. And the teams \u2013 we just went through our quarterly business reviews. All of our teams around the world are keenly focused on driving intent to return. And we are pretty encouraged. And I think it\u2019s reflected in the manner in which our most loyal Bonvoy customers continue to engage. Our top tier within Bonvoy, the ambassador tier, has remained very active. 96% of our ambassadors had at least one stay or points transaction in \u201821, they averaged about 100 nights, and we see those metrics improving as well. We have rolled out our new housekeeping protocols, and the early returns from our guests is they like the certainty that, that offers. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks for all that color. And then, separately, on distribution, encouraging to see loyalty contribution exceed \u201819 levels, digital bookings hitting all-time high. Curious how you are thinking about kind of the next 12 months, that ideal distribution mix between corporate, group and leisure as some of those buckets are starting to recover more fully. I mean consider ADR differentials between those three and then maybe day of week occupancy needs, how are you planning the business over the next 12 months? And maybe within that, how are you thinking about OTA as a percentage of the mix going forward? Tony Capuano : So, maybe I will go in reverse order, pre-pandemic, looking at a year like \u201819, we have seen steady reduction in the percentage of total room nights that came out of the OTAs. During the first 2 years with pandemic, as you might expect, we saw OTA volume rise, but direct bookings rose more rapidly. And I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect in the coming quarters that we would start to get back to the trend line we saw pre-pandemic of the total volume of OTA contribution moderating. I think your first question was really more around mix by segment. Back in \u201819 in round numbers, about 40% of our business was leisure. 37% was business transient. 20% was group and 4% was contract. In the second quarter, business transient had risen to about 32%. Leisure transient was 43%. Group was 21%, and contract was pretty steady at 4%. But remember, the Leisure segment was already our most rapidly growing segment even in 2019 before the pandemic did. And we continue to see \u2013 expect to see leisure to grow rapidly. And as I have said in some previous calls, this blending of trip purpose may make it that much tougher for us to tell you with absolute precision what that mix looks like. Leeny Oberg : And I think to your question about revenue management strategy, as we think about going forward, it has been very encouraging to see the strength of group and the strength of group rate. So, as we think about all the possible outcomes for the economy over the next couple of years, that strength in group is quite encouraging. And then obviously, on the transient side, the booking window there is about three weeks. So, that tends to \u2013 which is, frankly, back to about where it was in \u201819, and that will vary with customers\u2019 needs and wants as we see things unfold. Vince Ciepiel : Thanks for all that detail. All make sense. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Crow \u2013 sorry, Dori Kesten from Wells Fargo. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Tony Capuano : Good morning Dori. Leeny Oberg : Good morning Dori. Dori Kesten : Okay. Can you provide more details on cross-border travel regionally, who is leading and lagging outside of Asia Pacific as compared to \u201819? And then just any changes you have noted in spend? Leeny Oberg : Sure. So, let\u2019s talk super high level at first, which is that if pre-pandemic, we were in the, call it, 18% to 19% sort of cross-border travel around the world that, that number fell and was down in the \u2013 a little bit north of 10% and then has clearly moved back up several hundred basis points, particularly as we got into Q2. But we are not back to the same level of cross-border travel. Obviously, particularly with Asia Pacific and Greater China still being very much domestic travel based. The thing I did find interesting in Q2 in the U.S. was that we were pretty close to being back to the number of international \u2013 the percentage of international nights. We were pre-pandemic at 5%. And in Q2, we were at 4% coming from cross-border travel. I think the biggest shift that you saw was obviously partly a function of opening kind of more comfort travel and then the strong dollar. And that had a massive impact on Europe in the summer, and you saw a very large influx of U.S. travelers coming into Europe, which helped their RevPAR tremendously. Tony Capuano : And I might just add on that, Dori, it was just towards the tail end of the quarter where you saw the U.S. government rolled back the inbound international testing requirement, and we think that\u2019s going to be another accelerant for cross-border travel. In fact, right after that policy change was announced, the USTA came out and estimated that they thought that would drive 5.4 million incremental visitors to the U.S. in the back half of the year with about $9 billion of spend. Dori Kesten : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Bill Crow : Hi. Good morning everybody. You talked about the murkiness beyond the end of the year, but I am just curious, how much visibility do you actually have on the Labor Day? Leeny Oberg : Well, again, as we talked about before, you have got the short booking window on transient, but you have also got holiday bookings when you look at December, when you look at Thanksgiving, Columbus Day as well as Labor Day. And I think across all of those, we continue to be reminded that people are not willing to give up travel and that you are seeing it in the strong rate and strong early bookings for those periods. And they are obviously overwhelmingly leisure bookings and group also continuing to fill in very nicely. So, I think we \u2013 when we look at what\u2019s on the books, as we move into either even September and October, while you are right that the percentage that is on the books is still relatively low on the transient side. The pace of those bookings is very encouraging. Bill Crow : Maybe if I could follow-up on that, on the holiday bookings, it\u2019s interesting, Wyndham talked about Florida RevPAR being down double digit compared to 2021 in July. And I am curious if we were to look at it on a 1-year basis instead of going back to 2019, what your thoughts are at holiday bookings? Leeny Oberg : I would have to \u2013 I can get Jackie and Betsy to get back to you on the specifics for December \u201822 versus December \u201821. I think again, the overall comment that I will make is that we continue to see really strong bookings for the end of the year. One of the things that I talked about in luxury is the reality that as you see some of the other luxury markets start to fill in that aren\u2019t necessarily as high ADR as some of the resorts that starts to muddy the waters a little bit, but that\u2019s a good issue. Remember that right now, the percentage that is on our books for that period is probably under 5%. So, it\u2019s really quite small and making big sweeping statements with that small amount on the books probably doesn\u2019t make sense. But when we think about the pace for the holiday periods, we continue to be really encouraged. Bill Crow : That\u2019s perfect. If I could just ask one quick question on the development signings, any change in the composition of the signings, say, from full service to select service given construction costs and financing environment? Tony Capuano : On the signings side, we have seen a bit of a slowing in select service here in the U.S., but some of that may be because of the high volume of conversions are disproportionately full service. What I can tell you is in terms of monthly approval volumes coming out of our development committees, we are seeing exactly what we would have expected, which is our large multi-unit long-term developers and owners of select-service hotels gearing their development organizations back up, and that\u2019s driving the sort of approval volume we have seen through the first half of the year. Bill Crow : Perfect. Thank you for your time. Operator : And our last question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. And most have been asked. But just on group recovery, can you contrast the type of group events that happened in a month like June with group events that happened in a month like September? In a sense, business was competing with leisure this summer. And I think you threw out the June down two on group relative to \u201819. Would you expect that down two to kind of maintain, or would you expect that gap to hold or narrow as we get to a more business-dependent period like September? Thanks for taking my question. Leeny Oberg : So, I will just give you one comment. I think the shift won\u2019t be a massive shift. I think there is still going to be a lot of social group events going into the fall as well. When we look at what\u2019s on the books, it was only down 1% right now from Q3. And here we are barely into Q3. So, I think we \u2013 as we said before, we have got the possibility that actually group ends up higher than 2019 relative to Q2 when it was still down a little bit. So, we are seeing great demand on the part of corporate customers for getting their people together. And I think you are going to continue to see the social events as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily a huge swing based on your comment that it is more a business-oriented quarter. The only other thing I will point out is that August is typically a seasonally cleaver [ph] months for us in group just because of the realities of family vacations and people not being in school. So, I think August, you should expect what we have always seen, which is a relatively seasonally more light period on the group side. Duane Pfennigwerth : Thanks very much. Operator : And that is all the questions we have. I will now turn the conference back over to our speakers. Tony Capuano : Well, thank you all for joining us. It\u2019s a compelling and exciting story about the resiliency of travel and the resilience of Marriott\u2019s business model. We look forward to seeing you all on the road soon, and thanks again for your interest. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time. Have a great day.",

It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jackie Burka, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jackie McConagha : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer; and Executive Vice President, Business Operations; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporary closed due to COVID-19.  RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2022 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of September 30, 2022, even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to prepandemic for 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony. Anthony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had an outstanding third quarter. Quarter rose above 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began, up nearly 2%. RevPAR compared to 2019 improved sequentially from the second quarter in every region around the world. Global occupancy rose to 69% while ADR outpaced by 2019, excuse me, by a remarkable 10%. Compared to prepandemic levels, worldwide RevPAR in September reached a new monthly high watermark, increasing more than 4% or nearly 7%, excluding Greater China.  During the quarter, leisure demand remained strong, well above 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, Full-Service group revenue for the quarter showed continued growth, ending up 3% over the same quarter in 2019. Fourth quarter Full-Service group revenue is currently pacing up 4%, but is likely to improve further given the strong last-minute group bookings that we've seen all year. The trend towards last-minute bookings has led to meaningful compression in pricing power, helping group ADR for new bookings rise each quarter this year.  At our managed hotels in the U.S., ADR for in-the-year, for-the-year group bookings made in the third quarter rose 17% compared to same year bookings made in the 2019, 3rd quarter. A significant jump from the 6% increase we saw in the first quarter. ADR for group bookings made in the third quarter for 2023 outpaced 2019, 3rd quarter bookings for events in 2000 by 24%. Business transient demand also continued to improve during the quarter, although it still lags 2019 levels. Third quarter business transient room nights in the U.S. and Canada were 11% below 2019. We are currently in the midst of our special corporate negotiations for 2023 and are very pleased with how they're progressing. After 2 years of holding rates steady, the early results look positive for at least high single-digit year-over-year rate growth. Third quarter day-of-the-week trends continue to suggest that travelers are combining leisure and business trips. In fact, the average length of a transient business trip has increased meaningfully, and year-to-date is up more than 15% compared to 2019. With borders reopened in most countries around the world, rising cross-border travel helped spur demand during the quarter, especially in Europe and in the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA region. Cross-border guests accounted for 15% of our global room nights in the third quarter, an uptick from 12% in the first quarter of this year. In 2019, 18% of travel to our properties was from cross-border guests. So we anticipate additional upside from international travel especially from Greater China once stringent travel restrictions are relaxed.  Given rapidly rising interest rates and growing concerns about a possible global recession, we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends. There is no doubt that the hospitality industry is impacted by economic cycles. And with transient booking windows averaging only about 3 weeks, trends could change relatively quickly. However, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. In fact, we've seen just the opposite. Booking trends remain very healthy. Given sustained high levels of employment, consumer trends prioritizing experiences versus goods, pent-up travel demand and a high level of consumer savings, travel spending has been incredibly resilient.  In October, demand remained strong across our regions, with the exception of Greater China, where trends are still low. Our powerful Marriott Bonvoy program grew to 173 million members at the end of the third quarter. The program achieved record penetration levels in the quarter reaching 60% in the U.S. and Canada and 53% globally. Members also continued to engage with our co-brand credit cards, which had another solid quarter. After recently making significant enhancements by adding new benefits to many of our U.S. cards, sign-ups have well exceeded expectations. This led to record new cardholder acquisitions as well as record spending for the first 9 months of this year. We also introduced 2 mid-tier cards at the end of September, which should help drive strong growth going forward. While much smaller fee contributors that are U.S. co-brand cards, we have similarly seen record growth internationally this year in new card members and total card spend. This has been particularly driven by China, where we've had great traction after launching our first cards there in July. Our Bonvoy members have been increasingly interacting with the platform through our direct digital channels, which helps boost owner and franchisee profitability. Since 2019, our share of room nights booked through direct digital channels has increased more than 5 percentage points to 38% while our distribution through OTAs has risen by less than 1 percentage point to 12%.  The power of Bonvoy in our direct channels has also been evident in our latest offering, the Ritz-Carlton Yacht which made its inaugural voyage from Barcelona last month. Remarkably, around 2/3 of all bookings for this incredible brand extension have been through direct channels, which is many times above the rates most cruise companies experience. Additionally, Bonvoy members account for more than half of the Yacht bookings. We look forward to more ships joining the portfolio in the future.  Shifting to the development front, our pipeline grew for the fourth quarter in a row, totaling more than 502,000 rooms by the end of the third quarter. Signing activity in the quarter remained healthy in most regions of the world. Our development team continues to be laser focused on conversions, a particularly bright spot in the development story. Conversions represented 21% of room signings and 27% of room openings in the quarter. We are very enthusiastic about the level of conversations on conversions, including for multiunit conversion opportunities.  Outside the Greater China, we were pleased to see new construction starts pick up nicely in the third quarter. While not yet back to 2019 levels, new construction starts in the U.S. reached the highest quarterly level since the pandemic began. For full year 2022, we now expect gross rooms growth of approximately 4.5% compared to our prior expectation of closer to 5%. The change is primarily a result of fewer expected openings in Greater China as the lockdowns there have extended construction time lines. The good news is that we have not seen deals in Greater China or in any of our regions falling out of the pipeline at a higher than usual rate. With just 2 months left in the year, we now expect deletions at the bottom end of our prior guidance. Deletions could be about 1.5% for 2022 or 1%, excluding the 50 basis point impact from our exit from Russia.  So our net rooms growth for 2022 is likely to be around 3% or 3.5% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. We're always looking at opportunities that help broaden the offering for our guests as well as our owners and franchisees. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire the City Express brand portfolio. which is currently comprised of 152 hotels with over 17,000 rooms in the CALA region. We are quite bullish on the moderately priced mid-scale space, which has meaningful growth potential. Upon closing this transaction, we will immediately gain a significant foothold in this high-growth segment in CALA, while also becoming the largest hotel company in the region. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to expand in this segment in CALA as well as other locations around the world. If the transaction closes before year-end, our 2022 gross rooms growth could be around 5.5%, and our net rooms growth could be approximately 4%. We really look forward to working with the City Express team. We expect solid rooms growth going forward, given the attractiveness of our portfolio of global brands, our powerful loyalty program, our momentum around conversions and our industry-leading pipeline. While the exact timing will depend on how new construction starts trend from here, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth. Now before I turn it over to Leeny, I just want to recognize and thank our associates around the world for their continued commitment, passion and resilience. Leeny? Kathleen Oberg : Thank you, Tony. We had excellent financial performance again this quarter, driven by continued momentum in global RevPAR growth. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR was 3.5%, above pre-pandemic levels with ADR surpassing 2019 by more than 10%. RevPAR for all market types; primary, secondary and tertiary and all brand types from luxury through extended stay was more fully recovered for the first time. With the exception of Asia Pacific, our international regions posted incredibly strong RevPAR growth as restrictions across most countries fully lifted. Europe, in particular, benefited from a large increase in U.S. leisure demand, thanks to the strong dollar.  Compared to 2019, third quarter RevPAR rose 6% in Europe, nearly 19% in the Middle East and Africa and nearly 18% in CALA. RevPAR is still lagging behind 2019 levels in Greater China and in our Asia Pacific, excluding China or APAC region. Greater China improved the most in the quarter with RevPAR 23% below 2019, 30 percentage points better than a quarter ago. However, the recovery there remains uneven given China's renewed commitment to its strict 0 COVID policy. The good news is that we continue to see that when a market reopens for domestic travel after a lockdown, lodging demand rebounds very quickly.  In APAC, South Korea joined India and Australia in crossing the full recovery mark, but this was offset by Japan's borders remaining closed until the end of the quarter. Third quarter RevPAR in APAC was 14% below pre-pandemic levels, an 8 percentage point improvement from a quarter ago. As we move through the fourth quarter, APAC is benefiting from a recovery in airlift in Japan's now open orders. Three quarter -- third quarter total gross fees of $1.1 billion rose 11% compared to 2019, exceeding the top end of our guidance.  Growth was driven by RevPAR improvement and room additions as well as another quarter of strong non-RevPAR related fees. Those fees totaled $192 million in the third quarter, largely aided by ongoing growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose 22% year-over-year. The strength of our industry-leading luxury portfolio also contributed significantly to fee growth in the quarter. Gross fees from our luxury properties were up 13% versus the same quarter in 2019, even with Greater China's weaker performance. While our luxury properties account for 21% of our managed rooms, they contributed 34% of our total incentive management fees in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA also exceeded the high end of our guidance, outpacing the same quarter in 2019 by 9%. With the strong U.S. dollar, foreign exchange net of hedging, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $22 million in the quarter, some of which was included in our guidance a quarter ago. This negative currency translation was more than made up for by the positive impact from increased U.S. leisure travel abroad. We estimate net of our hedges, a 100 basis point change in the U.S. dollar could affect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA by less than $10 million. G&A and other expenses totaled $216 million in the third quarter, better than our guidance, largely reflecting lower-than-expected administrative costs and bad debt. At the hotel level, we remain focused on containing operating costs for our owners and franchisees while also delivering superior service to our guests. With ADR of 15% above 2019 and our significant productivity enhancements, third quarter profit margins at our U.S. and Canada managed hotels were 2 full percentage points above 2019 levels despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. Wage and benefit growth while still high, continued to moderate in the third quarter. Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance, the details of which are in our press release. As we headed into the end of the year, we're very pleased with the strong continued momentum in our business. Group's transient bookings are showing further gains against 2019. In both the U.S. and Canada and internationally, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR compared to pre-pandemic levels to accelerate from the third quarter, even with anticipated weaker demand in Greater China. Compared to 2019, fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 4% to 6% in the U.S. and Canada, be down 2% to flat internationally and increase 2% to 4% globally.  Worldwide fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 27% to 29% over fourth quarter 2021. We're still working through our 2023 budgets and recognize that there is heightened macro uncertainty. That said, we currently think 2023 global RevPAR could increase nicely year-over-year, driven by gains in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. Each quarter could see growth compared to this year and particularly strong growth in the first quarter due to the easier comparison given the impact of the Omicron variant in early 2022. For full year 2022, we're now anticipating G&A expenses of $880 million to $890 million, slightly better than our prior guidance, primarily due to lower bad debt expense. We're also raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and now expect adjusted EBITDA of around $3.79 billion at the midpoint of the range, which is 6% higher than our prior full peak year in 2019. Due to the timing of some capital expenditures for owned, leased hotels and corporate systems as well as key money payments, we now expect full year investment spending of closer to $500 million, assuming the City Express transaction does not close in 2022. Strong spending on our credit cards is expected to result in loyalty being a slight source of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. Year-to-date, our net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion, a significant increase of nearly $1.2 billion compared to the first 3 quarters of last year, a strong reminder of the power of our asset-light business model. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was excellent at the low end of investment grade targets. With our solid financial results and cash flow generations, we have already returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends through October 31, and we now expect to return more than $2.7 billion to shareholders this year. In closing, we're incredibly proud of how well our business is performing and how resilient our business has proven to be. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Tony, probably wanted to start with you, if we could. One thing that's been a bit of a theme, and you hit on it as well through your commentary was just how strong the development environment has held up and I'm wondering if you could unpack that for us a little bit, just given we continue to hear about rising financing costs, a little bit more stress in some of the commercial real estate markets, and that contrasts pretty greatly with what you kind of implied in your comments about just how well your signings are going and your activities going, so can you help us square that up a little bit and just talk about what you're seeing on the ground? Anthony Capuano : Of course. So on the signing side, we continue to see strong development committee volume. We continue to see strong franchise application volume in most markets around the world. The construction we're seeing in the debt markets for new construction, particularly here in the U.S. is lengthening the cycle even a bit longer in terms of getting shovels in the ground but we're quite encouraged about the consistency we've seen in the volume of under-construction projects in our pipeline. In fact, we were looking at it over the last few days. As you saw in our release, we continue to have a little over 200,000 rooms under construction.  It's actually the 20th straight quarter where we had more than 200,000 rooms under construction globally. The market in China is most certainly -- where we're seeing the most challenges. The disproportionate share of our projects in the pipeline in China, in fact, about 60% are in the luxury and upper -- upscale tier, principally in primary markets, which are -- well, the combination of those quality tiers in those markets caused those projects to be the most significant fee generators, but they are more complex development projects, and it takes a little longer for them to get open in a market like China. But broadly, we continue to see really powerful interest in our portfolio of brands. And we're maybe most encouraged by the volume both on signings and openings in the conversion tier. Shaun Kelley : That's great. And then maybe as my follow-up, Leeny, you mentioned, I believe, as you're looking out to 2023 RevPAR that it could increase nicely and you said each quarter, positive versus this year. Could you just talk a little bit about again very high-level assumptions behind that. I know no one's got a crystal ball here, but just how did you kind of -- how do you consider the macro when you think about that outlook and maybe some of the pluses or minuses that could factor into that? Kathleen Oberg : Yes, sure. Thanks, Shaun. As you say, there obviously continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty about the possible recession given the Fed's continued rise in rates and economic headwinds that do continue to grow. But I think we've got some things in our business that really do lead us to confidence about 2023, although we are not predicting per se a recession. We clearly believe there does continue to be pent-up travel demand, particularly in parts of the world where the borders are just opening. We're also seeing just generally a desire for travel and services as compared to goods, which we do see strongly in leisure. Also see, as we think about kind of the overall macro environment that there is pent-up savings for the consumer.  So we'll have to see. But again, from where we sit right now and as we look into the booking trends moving into 2023, we continue to see strength across all the business segments, Shaun. And then the last thing I would say is the reality is our booking window is still short. So at roughly 3 weeks for transient bookings, things could change relatively quickly. But for the signs that we see right now, we feel good about 2023. Obviously, Q1 is a particularly hopeful item given we had Omicron in the first quarter of 2022. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : I was hoping you could talk about 2023 group business on the books for next year? And maybe talk about it maybe a little bit differently than maybe how you've talked about it in the past. I was just wondering how much of group for 2023 is on the books for sure as a percentage of what you anticipate the total to be? And then maybe you can just talk about in segments in terms of when that was booked, so to get a sense of pricing, how much of '23 group was booked in '22? How much of it was booked in '21? How much it was booked prior to '21? And obviously, how much would you anticipate in the year, for the year, just given the relative strength of group of late? Anthony Capuano : Yes, of course. So let me start macro and then I'll try to get a little more precise in reference to your specific question. 2023 group revenue on the book is currently pacing down about 11% relative to '19, although candidly, you heard Leeny's comments about the short booking window on transient, a similarly short booking window on group. And so I don't know that looking at that down 11% is particularly relevant. Even for Q4 this year, we're up 4%, and we think that will likely improve through the quarter, given the strength of short-term bookings and the trade that many of our customers are making for flexibility and they're willing to pay a higher rate.  When I look deeper into what's on the books for 2023, room nights are down in the high teens. ADR is actually up close to about 10%. And then I think your second question was really about when that business is being booked? I guess I'll try to give you some 2022 data that is hopefully indicative of the trends we're seeing. About 50% of the group business we've seen year-to-date in 2022 was booked in the year, for the year. That's about double what we saw pre-pandemic, where typically, we'd see about 25% of our total group volume being booked in the year, for the year. Joseph Greff : Great. And then, Leeny, we heard your comments, obviously, about broad expectations for 2023 RevPAR growth. How do you think non-RevPAR-related fees performed relative to that RevPAR growth expectation? Would you expect it to be similar? Would you expect it to be plus or minus? How do you think about that? Kathleen Oberg : So we're in the middle of our budget process, Joe. So we obviously aren't getting to where we're talking about specifics on RevPAR growth of '23 over '22. I think what we've seen this year is credit card fees frankly being up over 20% year-to-date this year. And I think for the full year, obviously, our guidance implies the same. So I think you'll continue to see growth in the cardholders and then growth in spend. But whether it matches exactly RevPAR, we're not in a position to say specifically.  Obviously, when you look at compared to '19, those credit card fees have grown meaningfully more than hotel-related fees because of COVID and the steady growth in cardholders and credit card spend each and every year as we've moved through 2019. But I -- again, broadly speaking, we are looking at growth of non-RevPAR fees in 2023, both from credit cardholders as well as spend. But the relative array of growth compared to RevPAR, we will get closer to as we move through the budget process, but we're looking for healthy growth in both. Operator : And our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : I was curious about the acquisition that you made in October and you talked about expanding in the mid-scale segment in the CALA region with that brand. Do you have thoughts about the mid-scale segment in the U.S., not necessarily with that brand, but in some other brands that maybe we don't know about yet. Anthony Capuano : Yes. Of course. So as we mentioned in the release on the acquisition, and I think, I at least touched on this in my prepared remarks, the acquisition initially is focused on the CALA region. We are equally excited about the growth prospects for mid-scale across CALA and what this transaction does for us in terms of further strengthening our footprint across this really important region. As with many acquisitions that we've done over the years, once we close, once we start rolling in CALA, we will, of course, evaluate the applicability of this platform as to whether it makes sense to roll out some or all of the sub-brands under the City Express banner into other markets around the world. But right now, we're focused on getting the transaction closed. Robin Farley : But in general, is the mid-scale segment in the U.S., something whether it's that brand or not, that you kind of have your sight set on? Anthony Capuano : Well, as you know, we are not in the mid-scale segment in the U.S. Certainly, this acquisition gives us the opportunity to evaluate whether it makes sense to enter mid-scale in any other market inclusive of the U.S. Robin Farley : And then just 1 follow-up on the -- your comments about the pipeline growth in rooms under construction. And you mentioned that it's been a very steady sort of rooms under construction in the last few quarters, you're steadily above that 200,000 unit rate. Is there -- can you give us a little bit of insight into sort of new construction starts in the U.S. only because sort of the broader U.S. market seems to be a slowing number of new construction starts in the hotel space. So just wondering how that -- the sort of incremental hotel starts looks? Anthony Capuano : Of course. So again, outside of Greater China, which is quite a volatile environment, we're pretty encouraged about what we're seeing around the world in terms of new construction starts. We are certainly not back to the peak of 2019, but as I mentioned earlier, new construction starts in the U.S. and Canada reached the highest quarterly level we've seen since the start of the pandemic. Operator : And our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask a little bit about net unit growth as well going forward, just probably remains difficult for developers to kind of access capital. And I'm just wondering, do you see Marriott providing more of a backstop to developers either through loan guarantees or just direct financing? Anthony Capuano : Sure, of course. So as both Leeny and I referenced, the availability of debt, particularly for new construction here in our biggest market is a bit challenging. The good news is the pipeline continues to be strong. We continue to see fallout from the pipeline below our historical averages. As has always been the case in constricted debt markets, brand affiliation, track record of the developer, strength of the sponsorship are what -- are the factors that capture the construction debt that is, in fact, available. And so we see signs that the strength of our brands continue to capture a disproportionate share of what's out there.  A quarter or so ago, we announced closing on the financing for a $1.2 billion Gaylord Pacific Hotel in Chula Vista, California. This quarter, we announced the closing on financing for a new Ritz-Carlton Reserve in Papagayo, in Costa Rica. So we do feel like we are grabbing meaningful share of the dollars that are out there. And I'm sorry, Smedes, what was the second part of your question? Oh, on key money? Kathleen Oberg : Well, yes. Anthony Capuano : Yes. Maybe I'll take a high-level shot at this, and Leeny can jump in with some more color. I don't see our tried-and-true philosophical approach to investment in projects changing even in this environment. Certainly, the competitive environment gets more competitive by the day, but we will use the say -- or apply the same disciplined lens that we've applied in the past. And among the long list of reasons, we'll continue to take that approach over the years when you look at the projects where we've leveraged the company's balance sheet to get to accelerate growth, those are projects that tend to generate outsized fee volumes. Kathleen Oberg : The only thing I'd add is that we are not seeing that we are increasing our financing support or investment support in a meaningful way for deals. I think at the end of the day, the first mortgage loans that projects are looking for do not typically come from Marriott and that has not changed. In terms of debt service guarantees, operating profit guarantees and key money, I would say we continue to see them in the same kind of frequency and proportion as we've seen in the past. Operator : And our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Charles Scholes : I know you sort of touched on this and made some implications for next year. When we think about the right net unit growth to model for next year, a number of considerations. Number one, you did see your pipeline tick up a bit from 2Q, but then again, the trajectory of year-over-year quarterly growth has been going down. Is it a fair assumption when we think about the organic number to use that similar to this year's 3% for next year at this point? Anthony Capuano : Thank you, Patrick. Again, the -- some of the murkiness that's out there causes us to be reluctant to give you a hard number. What I will tell you is we are encouraged by deal volume. We are encouraged by the volume of under-construction projects. And maybe most notably in a debt constricted environment, we are particularly enthusiastic about the volume of conversion deals we're approving and signing, the volume of conversion deals that we're opening, and the volume of conversion discussions we're having, both on individual projects and multiunit opportunities. Operator : And our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : I wanted to ask about IMFs, the release says 2/3 of them were international. Can you just add a little color on what percentage of North American hotels are earning them today? And any qualitative commentary about how that curve might roll out into the future would be helpful. Kathleen Oberg : Yes, sure. So let's talk about a couple of things. First of all, just from the dollar size, David, we were at $35 million of IMFs or about 1/3 from the U.S. and Canada, and that is pretty similar to what it was in Q3 '19. It was 39%. Now it was 26% of overall hotels in the U.S. and Canada earning incentive fees in Q3 and 56% in '19. But it's important to break out full service from limited service because the reality is that we had a large portfolio back in '19 of managed limited service hotels, which, as you know, left our system over a year ago. So if you actually look at full service, we're actually at a slightly higher percentage of hotels earning IMFs in full service than we were in '19. And again, as we talked about before, in my comments that you saw house profit margins at our full-service hotels, up 200 basis points compared to '19 with our strong RevPAR performance and really strong efforts on the cost containment side. So I -- we feel good about what's going on. We've talked about -- hoped for expected growth in RevPAR in 2023, both U.S. and internationally, which should bode well for continued progress on incentive fees. Obviously, wage and benefit growth is something we're keeping an eye on, which has moderated a bit, although it still reflects the fact that we're in an inflationary environment. And then the last thing I'll say is we've continued to see improvement in the large urban markets where we've got a number of managed Full-Service hotels in the U.S. And we've seen nice progress as we moved into Q3 in some of those urban markets, and we expect them to continue on as we move into 2023 with that recovery. David Katz : Understood. And as my follow-up, the discussions happened during COVID, early on about the fee structures and the interactions between owners and yourselves, around contracts and service delivery, et cetera. And interestingly, it came up with -- in a couple of places from investors recently about what's changed. Now that at least for most of us, COVID is kind of in the rearview mirror. Can you just talk about how that's different and how that's manifesting itself in the numbers? Kathleen Oberg : So fundamentally, the fee structures have not changed. So I would say, while we did things that on a temporary basis like helped on the reducing reimbursable costs and helping with extensions on accounts receivable, they were all really overwhelmingly temporary things. And then also, if you remember, 85% of the things that we charge are based on top line revenues of the hotel. So they flex as the revenues go up and down, which is helpful to the hotel owners.  I think you see things like what we've talked about on our direct digital bookings, things like that, which do help the hotel margins by coming through that channel rather than coming through the OTAs as an example, all the productivity efforts that we've done to help improve our productivity per room. We've obviously worked very hard to make sure that we can make the most out of every revenue dollar that comes through the hotels. But as far as structural changes in the contracts, there's nothing really to look for there. Anthony Capuano : And maybe the only thing I would add, we obviously have brought back all of our quality metrics, so our QA audits, our RAN standards, you might think that the owners would baulk at that, I think, quite the contrary. They care deeply about their neighbors within the portfolio and continue to encourage us to bring back and enforce those standards. And then similarly, we obviously gave our owners and franchisees a measure of relief on renovation cycle at the very bottom of the trough of the pandemic.  We're bringing those requirements back but with some pragmatic perspective on hotels that are doing a terrific job on service as evidenced by those quality metrics and giving them the ability to selectively extend some of those renovation cycles. Operator : Our next question will come from Bill Crow with Raymond James. William Crow : Tony, we view hotel demand as kind of a lagging economic indicator, maybe 3 or 6 months. I'm curious whether you agree with that? And if so, what is the best, whether it's a consumer view or other economic data points to try and judge the macro change that, that may be a\u2026? Anthony Capuano : Yes, it's a good question. I would revert -- maybe refer back to some comments that both Leeny and I have made this morning about this extraordinarily short booking window, so probably not as much of a lagging indicator as we might have experienced pre-pandemic. While we are encouraged and optimistic by the forward booking data we see, I think Leeny said it best. We also recognize that we work in an industry that is cyclical and subject to economic cycles.  And because of that short booking window, trends can change quickly. However, even if, in fact, we are in a recession or we fall into a recession, I think the company and travel more broadly are positioned a bit differently. Leeny, maybe you want to talk about that? Kathleen Oberg : Yes. I think we definitely see that we could perform relatively better than we had in prior recessions. You've definitely got unemployment rates right now that are truly at historic lows. And while certainly what is happening with interest rates would be expected over time to influence that. We are a far cry from the 9.5% that we were in the great recession.  And similarly, when you think about pent-up savings and the desire for people to take and do travel to not assume that they can put it off that they really don't want to postpone it and that there is still both business and leisure trips that families and consumers want to make. And while consumer health is something that we will be watching extremely closely, for the moment, there does look to be some extra room there that could help as we go into a potential recession. William Crow : That's helpful. If I could just ask my follow-up question. We understand that owners' meetings recently, the topic of consistency of brand has kind of come up. Is there some complaints about not removing enough rooms from the system, you talked about net unit growth, a low number of removals. Should we expect that to go up over the next couple of years as you get back to kind of enforcing capital spending? Anthony Capuano : So maybe I'll take the first part, and Leeny can take the second. As I mentioned earlier, the vast majority of our owners are quite pleased that we've brought back our quality metrics and quality requirements they care, as you point out, meaningfully about the quality of the overall portfolio.  While there may be some pockets of frustration, I think there's also a broad understanding that it was appropriate to suspend those processes during the depths of the pandemic and that it will take us a bit now that they are reinstated to get back to having enough empirical data to be a little firmer on enforcement. Kathleen Oberg : The only part that I would add is that for the owners who did do some renovations during COVID, I think the results that they're seeing are powerful. And I think our good incentive for other owners to do the same. We did -- as Tony mentioned, we did give owners a bit of a pass in the heart of COVID to help everybody manage through the pandemic. But I think as we are coming out of it, I think the entire industry recognizes the importance of having both product and service up to where our consumers, our guests expect them to be given the prices that people are paying.  So we do expect there to be additional renovations and frankly, probably a pickup in renovations now that we're largely through that impact and believe that the returns on those renovations will be strong. For the time being, we certainly continue to see that our -- we expect our deletion rate to stay in this 1% to 1.5% rate that we've talked about for several years. We will, as we get into the new year, refine that a bit as we go through the entire budget process. But I think that sort of range should be your expectation. Operator : And our next question will come from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : So maybe -- so when you think about corporate transient recovery and specifically focusing on your largest accounts, the larger corporates in the U.S., what is the tone that you kind of get back from them when you talk to them about how they're planning for the future. Obviously, we know that near term, you're seeing good trends, but we hear and see headlines regarding -- especially in tech some larger companies pulling back on expenses and things like that. I'm just curious how you feel about some of those things? Anthony Capuano : Sure. So at a macro level, we are, again, encouraged by the sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement in business transient. You'll recall that in the U.S. and Canada, BT was down almost 25% in the first quarter. That dropped to 13% in Q2 and just down 11% in Q3. As we've discussed in the past, small- and medium-sized companies, which are about 60% of those BT room nights are fully recovered. And in fact, in Q3, their room nights were up about 10%.  When you pivot to the larger companies, your comments are right. Special corporate, which tends to be a lot of those big companies, their room nights were down about 17% in the quarter. And when you start to look at the specific tiers within special corporate, you brought up tech as an example. They were down about 23% in the quarter. Trying to respond more qualitatively in terms of what we're hearing from them. I think it's really embedded in the short booking window. They absolutely talk about the value of face-to-face interaction with each other, with their customers, with their clients. But they are also, again, much like our group customers willing to trade a bit of pricing for flexibility. And then the last thing I would say to try to address your question, we are relatively early in the special corporate rate negotiations. But what we're seeing in terms of the pricing and our growing confidence that we're going to end up at least with high single-digit year-over-year rates is pretty encouraging as well. Brandt Montour : Great. I appreciate it. And then on conversion activity, which you guys did talk about and hoping to ask it in a slightly different way. But just given the sort of counter cyclicality of that activity in past cycles, and sort of one would think maybe that we're sort of at the tail end of conversion activity that was elevated because of COVID, but maybe that there's some -- a pickup -- there could be a pickup of conversion activity if we went into another -- if we went into a recession. Is that how you think about it at this point? Anthony Capuano : It's not. It's not. I think the reality is a couple of factors are in play here that give us even more confidence about the runway we have for conversions. I think number 1 for Marriott, we've never had a better stack of conversion-friendly brands and across multiple quality tiers, which is really encouraging for us. Number two, we talked a bit about the constriction in the debt markets. There is meaningfully, not meaningfully -- relatively more debt available for existing assets than there is new construction but the same lenses from the lender's perspective apply, brand affiliation, track record.  And so in order to source the debt that is available for existing assets, I think you see existing owners and buyers of assets thinking longer and harder about brand affiliation. And then I think third, I mentioned this in response to 1 of the earlier questions, the uptick we've seen in multiunit conversion discussions is a little different than what we've seen at the tail end of other cycles. Operator : And our final question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Nice to speak with you. On the business transient commentary, which I think you said down 11%, I wondered if you could provide some regional color. Where would you mark that recovery across the geographies that you touch? And then just as we think about the shape of that recovery curve, we've seen some nice sequential improvement here, but should we be thinking about a plateau through early next year when we have new sort of budget cycles? Or are there regions where you still think sort of sequential improvement into 4Q on BT is on the table? Kathleen Oberg : Sure. So let's talk -- I'm going to reference back to Tony's comments about where roughly 60% of our BT in Q3 was from small- and medium-sized companies. And that, frankly, is sprinkled all over the country. So that's going to be everywhere from New York to Tulsa to smaller markets that are -- at limited-service hotels rather than -- the larger special corporate accounts obviously are more headquartered in the urban large cities.  The thing I will say is we've continued to see progress as we move too along. When you think of, for example, you think of New York City, which has moved quite nicely during the year, with the improvement in BT, where they were down 29% in Q1. Today New York City was actually 3% higher in Q3 than 2019. So I think you will continue to see the progress, the trends in BT are similar, both internationally as well as in the U.S. I do think as we move into 2023, a lot of this world depend on the state of the economy. So kind of having a prediction about exactly where BT will go, it is tough to pinpoint.  We do look for continued improvement and think it will ultimately get back to where it was, but the exact timing of that hard to say. And then the last thing I'll point out is just the reality that we have seen it moderate in terms of its rate of improvement as we've moved into Q3, and I would expect to see that moderation continue. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the program back to Tony Capuano for any closing remarks. Anthony Capuano : Great. Well, thank you all again for joining us this morning. Thanks for your continued interest in Marriott. Get back on the road, we look forward to seeing you in our hotels in the coming weeks and months. Have a great day. Kathleen Oberg : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to today\u2019s Q4 2022 Earnings. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Ms. Jackie Burka. Jackie Burka : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Marriott\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Business Operations; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that, unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2022 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of December 31, 2022, even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to pre-pandemic for 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for Marriott. After achieving global RevPAR recovery in June, we finished the year on a real high note, with RevPAR versus 2019, up 7% in December and up 5% in the fourth quarter. Each quarter saw sequential improvement in global occupancy and ADR compared to 2019. We ended the year with fourth quarter occupancy down just 5 percentage points and ADR up 13%. With Asia-Pacific, excluding China, or APAC surpassing pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, all regions, except Greater China, have now more than fully recovered. It is abundantly clear that people love to travel. Globally, leisure demand has remained robust. In the fourth quarter, leisure transient room nights increased 7% versus 2019. And we continued driving leisure ADR, which rose 22%. Our group business experienced the most meaningful improvement in 2022. In the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter group revenues increased 10% above the same quarter in 2019. Group revenue for 2023 is already pacing up 20% year-over-year, with room night and rate gains each quarter. Given strong lead generation and increased rate quotes, especially for in-the-year, for-the-year bookings, we expect group revenues this year to strengthen further. In 2022, around half of group room nights were booked in the year compared to just one-third in 2019. U.S. and Canada business transient demand remained steady from the third to the fourth quarter at around 90% recovery. For 2023, we are pleased to have negotiated special corporate rate growth in the high single-digits after holding these rates steady the last 2 years. Our day-of-the-week trends in the U.S. and Canada continue to point to the blending of business and leisure trips. In the fourth quarter, midweek occupancy was still down mid single-digit percentage points versus 2019, while occupancy on shoulder and weekend nights was down the low single-digits. Additionally, the average length of a business transient trip in the U.S. has risen by more than 20% versus 2019. Rising cross-border travel also helped spur overall demand growth during the quarter, though we believe there is still further upside in 2023, especially now that China\u2019s borders have reopened. Guests traveling outside their home country accounted for 16% of transient room nights globally in the 2022 fourth quarter, 1 percentage point higher than the prior quarter, yet still 3 percentage points lower than 2019. With more than 177 million members, our powerful Marriott Bonvoy program has also been a key driver of demand for our hotels and other lodging offerings and for adjacent products like our Bonvoy co-branded credit cards. Our growing portfolio of credit cards, now in 9 countries following our November card launch in Saudi Arabia, had record global card member acquisitions and card spend last year. Product innovation and engagement with our members remain key focus areas, especially through investments in our Marriott Bonvoy app and other digital products. We have made great gains in contributions from our digital platforms, which are highly profitable channels for our owners and anticipate many additional enhancements over the next couple of years. In 2022, our mobile app users were up 32% year-over-year, digital room nights rose 27%, and digital revenues climbed 41%. The financing environment for new projects and hotel sales remains challenging, especially here in the U.S. given higher interest rates and uncertainties surrounding a potential economic downturn. However, other industry headwinds like supply chain disruptions, construction costs and availability of labor have improved. Given strong local operating trends, overall developer sentiment improved in 2022 and we had another year of strong signing activity. Our global development team signed franchise and management agreements for nearly 108,000 rooms last year. In addition, upon the anticipated closing of the transaction, the City Express portfolio should add around 17,000 rooms in the moderately priced mid-scale space. We are excited about the opportunity to expand in this segment in the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA region as well as in other locations around the world. We also recently announced Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy, a new 1 to 3-bedroom serviced apartment brand that we plan to launch in the upper-upscale and luxury segments. We have already received a great deal of initial interests from owners and developers. Momentum in conversions continues, including in multi-property opportunities, thanks to the breadth of our roster of convergent-friendly brands across the chain scales. The meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our portfolio make these brands very attractive to owners. Conversions represented nearly 20% of room signings and 27% of room additions in 2022. We added a total of 394 properties last year, representing more than 65,000 rooms and grew our industry leading system 4.4% on a gross basis or 3.1% net year-over-year. Excluding the impact from our exit of Russia, our net rooms growth was 3.6%. For 2023, we are forecasting gross rooms growth of around 5.5%, including around 1 percentage point from the anticipated addition of the City Express rooms to our franchise system. Assuming deletions of 1% to 1.5%, net rooms could grow 4% to 4.5%. I\u2019d like to pivot now and share a few highlights of our recent ESG efforts. ESG is an integral part of our company\u2019s culture and strategy, and our company is dedicated to making a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business. In June, we committed $50 million to support historically underrepresented groups in the journey to hotel ownership through our new program here in North America called Marriott\u2019s Bridging The Gap. This program should help us reach our goal of having at least 3,000 diverse and women-owned hotels in our system by 2025. In December, we announced that over 1 million Marriott associates have taken our human trafficking training, which we have also donated to the wider hospitality industries. In terms of workforce diversity and inclusion, our aim is to achieve global gender parity in the company\u2019s leadership by 2023 and have people of color hold 25% of U.S. executive positions by 2025. We also continue our work to set science-based emissions reduction targets, with more details expected to come later this year. I am proud of these accomplishments and all that we have achieved in 2022. As we look ahead to full year 2023, there is meaningful uncertainty about global economic growth. Lodging is a cyclical business and it\u2019s not immune to downturns in the macroeconomic environment. To-date, however, we have not seen signs of demand softening. Certainly, trends could change relatively quickly given our average transient booking window is around 3 weeks. But 1.5 months into 2023, booking demand and pricing remains strong. As Leeny will discuss in her remarks, we are optimistic that global RevPAR will grow year-over-year even if the global economy softens in the back half of this year. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I\u2019d like to thank our associates around the world for their hard work and commitment in navigating the last few challenging years and in helping the company achieve these record financial results. I also want to make a couple of statements regarding two of my senior team members. I am sure you saw the news in December that Stephanie Linnartz has been appointed Under Armour\u2019s new President and CEO, a role that she will assume at the end of this month. Also, after a 35-year career with Marriott that has spanned the globe, Craig Smith, our Group President, International, has informed me of his decision to retire from the company later this month. Craig has developed and mentored hundreds of hotel general managers and above property leaders around the world and has helped us meaningfully accelerate the growth of our international business. I want to thank both Stephanie and Craig for their decades of dedication and countless contributions to Marriott. While I will personally miss these two excellent senior executives, I am proud that we have such an incredibly deep management bench. I look forward to sharing more details about new leadership appointments soon. Now, let me turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. With sustained momentum in global RevPAR growth, we reported an outstanding quarter. Gross fees rose 16% and adjusted EBITDA climbed 21% over the 2019 fourth quarter. For the full year, we posted record fees, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, despite the Omicron variant causing a slow start to the year. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR versus 2019 accelerated nicely from the third quarter in every region, except Greater China. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, fourth quarter U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased 5%, aided by 11% growth in ADR. RevPAR in the region versus 2019 improved sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter across all market types, from primary to tertiary and all brand tiers, from luxury to select service. International RevPAR rose 3% above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, driven by improvements in the comparison to 2019 for both rate and occupancy. In the Middle East and Africa, or MEA, RevPAR grew 44%, boosted by the World Cup in Qatar. RevPAR increased 28% in CALA, 7% in Europe and 6% in Asia-Pacific, except for China. While results in Greater China were, again, impacted by lockdowns in the fourth quarter, the region reached a major milestone with the new open border policy and the lifting of quarantine requirements in January. It could take time to increase airline capacity and work-through passport and visa requests, but we are optimistic about meaningful RevPAR recovery in the region as these issues abate. We saw a huge demand surge in January during the Chinese New Year holiday, with RevPAR for the holiday period nearly in line with 2019. Other regions are also anticipated to benefit from an increase in outbound China travel, especially APAC, where over 40% of room nights in 2019 came from Chinese travelers. In the fourth quarter, total gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion, reflecting higher RevPAR, room additions and another quarter of significant growth in our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. Those fees rose 16% year-over-year to $215 million, driven largely by our co-brand credit card fees. Incentive management fees, or IMFs, rose impressively in the quarter, reaching $186 million. IMF surpassed the fourth quarter of 2019 with IMF in the U.S. and Canada, up nearly 30%. At the hotel level, we remain focused on working closely with our owners and franchisees to deliver superior customer service, while containing operating costs. Profit margins at our U.S. managed hotels in the quarter were again higher for the same period of \u201819 despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. Importantly, our guest surveys indicate that customer satisfaction continues to rise. In December, our intent to recommend scores in the U.S. improved for the tenth consecutive month and are now generally in line with 2019 scores. Hiring challenges have moderated and the number of open positions in the U.S. is now below 2019 levels. Our asset-light business model once again generated significant cash during 2022, with net cash provided by operating activities totaling $2.4 billion, double the amount in 2021. Our loyalty program, with a modest source of cash before factoring in the reduced payments, received from the credit card companies. In 2023, we expect the loyalty to again be modestly cash positive before the impact of the final year of reduced payments. Now, let\u2019s talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our press release. Note that all RevPAR comparisons will be to 2022. More than 1 in 4 hotels that are currently comparable in both \u201822 and \u201823 or opened for the full year were not open in 2019, making comparisons to that year not really meaningful. I will start with the first quarter, which we anticipate will benefit from continued strong underlying trends. There is also a meaningfully easier comparison to the year ago quarter when the Omicron variant depressed lodging demand. Halfway through the quarter, bookings across customer segments and geographies are excellent. Momentum is being driven by rising cross-border travel and strong group revenues due to demand and ADR gains. Additionally, business transient revenues are benefiting from higher volumes and our successful special corporate rate negotiations. January global RevPAR rose 52%, with the U.S. and Canada up 43%. We anticipate that first quarter RevPAR could increase 25% to 27% in the U.S. and Canada, 47% to 49% in international markets and 30% to 32% worldwide. Given short-term booking windows and a significant level of macroeconomic uncertainty, there is less visibility in forecasting the company\u2019s financial performance for full year 2023. As a result, we are providing a broad range for full year RevPAR and other key metrics. The high end of the range reflects a relatively steady global economic picture throughout 2023. With continued resilience of travel demand across customer segments and markets, the low end of the range reflects a meaningful softening of the global economy, beginning in the second quarter with worldwide RevPAR roughly flat compared to 22% in the second half of the year. So for the full year, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada could increase 5% to 9% and international RevPAR could rise 12% to 18%, leading to a global RevPAR gain of 6% to 11%. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2023 RevPAR versus 2022 could be around $40 million to $45 million of RevPAR-related fees. Total fees for the full year could rise between 6% and 12%, with the non-RevPAR-related component anticipated to rise 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR fee growth is expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We expect 2023 G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 levels. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 5% and 12% and adjusted EPS could rise 8% to 18% above 2022. After 3 years of meaningfully reduced investment spending, we anticipate 2023 investment spending of $850 million to $1 billion. This includes $100 million for the expected acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio and around $160 million of renovation spending on our own W Union Square Hotel in New York and the elegant hotel portfolio in Barbados. These hotels will be terrific representations of our W and all-inclusive brands when completed. We expect to recycle our capital investment in these hotels by selling them with long-term agreements. Spending in 2023 also incorporates higher than typical investment in our customer-facing technology, which is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. In 2022, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders. At the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage was at the low end of investment grade targets. For 2023, capital returns to shareholders could be between $2.7 billion and $3.6 billion. Before we open the line, I too would like to express my gratitude to our incredible team of global associates around the world for their resilience and dedication. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Stephen Grambling : I wanted to start off on capital allocation actually. I guess given the moving parts within the rate environment, how are you thinking about the right leverage ratio? And how rate may actually dictate the outcome in terms of that capital allocation that you were referencing or returning cash to shareholders? Leeny Oberg : Sure. So overall, Stephen, as I stated in my comments, we are committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating. And we ended the year in terrific shape. I think you can tell from the range that we gave on RevPAR that we see ourselves being in really good shape this year from a cash flow perspective and earnings perspective that does give us great flexibility in how we think about our investing and our capital return. But from an interest rate environment, I think it\u2019s more about the overall macroeconomic activity and global growth picture than it is about a specific interest rate. Obviously, we need to see how it plays out. But being at the very low end of our credit ratio metrics, I think, gives us plenty of flexibility to deal with whatever may come. Stephen Grambling : Great. And then maybe a little bit of a different follow-up. We've been seeing some volatility in the corporate booking data on our end. And I guess I'm wondering if you could discuss what you're seeing across large corporate demand versus small and medium-sized business, perhaps tie this into how it might influence the strong IMF that we\u2019ve been seeing? Tony Capuano : Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the recovery for business transient broadly is still at about 90%. Interestingly for small and medium-sized companies, which represent about 60% ish of our total business transient, they were actually up 6% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. So that continues to be strong. We\u2019ve seen slower albeit steady recovery from larger companies, but they have got a bit of a ways to go to get back to pre-pandemic levels. Leeny Oberg : Stephen, the other thing I\u2019ll add is I hesitate to call that a trend yet, but it\u2019s just worth mentioning that in January, we saw our top special corporate accounts improve another 9 points relative to \u201819. So in the classic areas of accounting and consulting or defense or healthcare, we are continuing to see good progress there. but we are only a month into \u201823 so far. Tony Capuano : And maybe the last point I would make, Stephen, is just reiterating what I said earlier in the call, and that is, for the last couple of years, we\u2019ve rolled over our special corporate rates. And so as we went into the negotiating season this year, we felt like we were in a pretty good place. And that really materialized as we saw negotiated special corporate rates in the high single digits. Stephen Grambling : Makes sense. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning, everyone. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Shaun Kelley : Tony, when you \u2013 good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more about sort of the demand side. So obviously, we know the visibility is a little short in the industry from time to time. But obviously, it looks like everything you\u2019re seeing coincidentally is pretty strong. So could you help us just unpack a little bit? Your January trends look well above STR averages, even in North America. And then \u2013 so what\u2019s kind of powering that? And then specifically, as we kind of work our way through the year, could you just talk about \u2013 a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing on maybe the lead generation side group and how you\u2019re underwriting China, just to help us kind of bridge the full year outlook? Tony Capuano : Yes. Of course, Shaun, maybe I\u2019ll start with the group just because that\u2019s such a terrific story. You heard the numbers about where we were in the quarter with group revenue for group in the U.S. and Canada, about 10% ahead of where we were pre-pandemic. When we look into 2023, there is two things I would point to that are really compelling. Number one, we\u2019re currently pacing up about 20% year-over-year. And interestingly, that\u2019s not just a quarter one phenomenon, given the favorable comparisons. We\u2019re seeing pretty steady pacing across all quarters in 2023. Secondly, I would remind you that the shorter booking window is not specific to transient. We\u2019re seeing a little more compressed booking window in group as well. And so we think there is still meaningful upside to group as we launch in the year for the year bookings materialize during the balance of 2023. Leeny Oberg : And I\u2019ll jump in on China, Shaun, and that is \u2013 well, two things. One, to your point about January being particularly strong, if you remember, Omicron was particularly pronounced, right, as we got into January. And obviously, there is a significantly water degree of comfort this year as we moved into Q1. So I think you saw the momentum that was building in Q4 and really all throughout \u201822 continue into January as we saw all parts of the business firing on all cylinders. And then when you think about China, we saw tremendous leisure demand associated with the Chinese New Year, but we are really pleased with the overall pace of demand that we\u2019re seeing there. And just to give you a rough sense, we could see \u2013 in Greater China, we could see that RevPAR for the year \u201823 over \u201822 is over 30% increase. And obviously, the biggest increase will be in the first quarter. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Shaun. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Good morning, everybody. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Joe Greff : Tony, can you talk about what\u2019s going on with pipeline signings in China presently? And how much of a, I guess, of a disruption, whether it be in the first quarter given what\u2019s been going on there? And then when you look back at the fourth quarter, and the development pipeline was down a little bit sequentially. There have been quarters in the last 4 years, where it\u2019s down sequentially. It doesn\u2019t mean anything necessarily. How much of the sequential pipeline in the fourth quarter was explained by disruption in China signings? Tony Capuano : Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll take the second question first. The pipeline tends, as you well know, to ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter. The statistic I look at related to pipeline that I think is a bit more telling is the 2% year-over-year increase in the pipeline. Obviously, deals come in and out of the pipeline in a year where nearly 30% of our openings were conversions. We\u2019ve talked in the past about the fact that some conversions never even make it into the pipeline. They get signed and opened quite quickly. On your first question about China signings, China signings last year were down about 15% from where we were in \u201821. And they were down a little more than third from where we were in \u201819. As the borders open, we expect to see meaningful positive impact certainly on demand patterns, but also on the health and the outlook of our development partners. And so we would expect an acceleration in deal volume. Leeny Oberg : And Joe, the only thing that I\u2019ll add is there was the obvious challenges for opening hotels in China tied to the shutdown in China that impacted permits and getting the teams trained and up and running. And so from that respect, we certainly saw a few drift from where we had expected them opened in Q4 to open in Q1. And I think that was clearly to be expected as they saw the shutdown continue. But again, as things open up, we look forward to them increasing. Joe Greff : Thank you. Tony Capuano : Thanks. Joe. Operator : And we will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. My question is on the unit growth outlook, and there is some acceleration embedded in there. You mentioned China, obviously, is one of the drivers of that. And I guess the City Express acquisition. So just wondering if you have any other acquisitions in that unit growth guidance, just to clarify that? Tony Capuano : We do not. Robin Farley : And then \u2013 okay. Great. Perfect. Thank you. And then my other question was on City Express because you\u2019ve talked about using that to grow in other regions. And I\u2019m curious you haven\u2019t mentioned potentially using it in the U.S. There are others out there sort of looking to grow units in the more limited service segments in the mid-scale and economy segments, and that hasn\u2019t been a big focus for Marriott. I\u2019m just curious if you have any thoughts on those segments, and then also sort of why or why not use of this new brand that is more \u2013 is further down the chain scale and some of your other brands in the U.S. market as well? Thanks. Tony Capuano : Of course. So we are very excited to get over the finish line with City Express. As we outlined, when we announced our intent to acquire Citi, it represents our entry into the mid-scale segment, which is very exciting. It increases our portfolio significantly in the important and growing CALA region. We expect to grow that brand aggressively across CALA, and we are \u2013 as we move towards closing that transaction, evaluating the applicability of that brand in other markets around the world. We\u2019ve not made definitive decisions about when and if we will roll out City Express in other places, but you can rest assured those evaluations and discussions are going on as we speak. I do think if you look at our historical track record of acquisitions, many of those acquisitions initially either strengthened our leadership position or gave us a meaningful foothold in a region where we weren\u2019t growing as quickly as we\u2019d like organically. And then over the passage of time, we look for opportunities to grow that platform more broadly. And I think the same strategy will apply to City Express. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up, if I could. Just \u2013 is there anything you would call out with termination fees? Is it a big part of the growth in that line item? How is that compared to termination fees for pre-pandemic? Or just anything going on there that you would call out? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Sure. Nothing in particular. They do vary. They can be something related to one hotel or a particular transaction, but they vary. We\u2019ve talked about them before, Robin. It\u2019s kind of varying anywhere from $20 million to $40 million in a particular year. And as you saw from our deletions number, apart from Russia, we\u2019re really absolutely quite where we typically are. So there is nothing particular in that number. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you very much. Tony Capuano : Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Richard Clarke : The first one is on the incentive fees. The incentive management fees seem to have recovered about 10% quicker than the base management fees. And in the past, you\u2019ve talked about whether that\u2019s a small number of hotels paying a lot of incentive fees or whether that\u2019s becoming a sort of more broad-based increase in profitability. So just wondering maybe you could comment on what\u2019s sort of supporting the outperformance of the incentive fee? Leeny Oberg : Yes, sure, absolutely. So just \u2013 while Q4 was spectacular, and we really had a wonderful performance in our incentive fees. The reality is they are still meaningfully lower than they were in 2019, while the rest of our fees have grown quite nicely, our basin franchise fees as rooms have grown, RevPAR has recovered as well as the non-RevPAR fee growth has increased. So when you look at IMF as a percentage of total fees compared to \u201819, they have actually gone down. And we would expect them to continue to be a little bit lower than they have historically been. And they do, obviously, reflect a little bit riskier fee stream for us than comparing to the classic base in franchise fees. But when you look at kind of where we are in terms of hotel\u2019s earning incentive fees, I think there are a couple of interesting statistics. And that is that in \u201822, 61% of our managed hotels earned an incentive fee that compares to 72% in 2019. And in the U.S., 39% of our full-service hotels earned an incentive fee versus 45% in 2019. And I break \u2013 I don\u2019t include MSB because there is a very big difference in the managed limited service hotel portfolio between \u201822 and \u201819, so it\u2019s not as relevant a number. And as you know, many of our Asia Pacific incentive fees are not back to \u201819 levels as a result of their RevPAR recovering a bit later than the U.S. So I think we\u2019re thrilled with the performance of our operating team, very proud of the work that they have done, especially given wage increases. And I think to one point that you\u2019re raising; we\u2019re excited about what we see in \u201823 and the years ahead for the IMF potential for our hotels. Richard Clarke : Okay. That\u2019s great. Just a quick follow-up to someone\u2019s question earlier, they refer to acceleration in the net unit growth. If I did the math right, it looks like you did 3.6% ex-Russia exit in 2022, and that drops down to 3.5% ex-City Express in 2023. So is that correct? And if you\u2019ve got some China hotels moving into this year, where is that slowdown coming from? Leeny Oberg : Well, again, I want to make sure we certainly include City Express. When we think about our rooms growth, that\u2019s a very important component of how we think strategically about how we\u2019re growing around the world. So when I think about accelerating rooms growth that is a part of it. And then when I think of the timing, we\u2019ve clearly got the reality that construction starts over the past couple of years in the U.S. are having an impact in \u201823, in particular, in the U.S. for room openings. But again, otherwise, with the signings that you heard Tony talking about, we\u2019re very enthused about what we see going forward and then conversions have been a big component as well. Richard Clarke : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the capital spending in 2023. I know you broke out a couple of the line items. Are you thinking any differently about the way that you allocate, I guess, key money, either for conversions or for developers who are considering their brand options? Or anything different there than maybe you\u2019ve done in the past? Leeny Oberg : Yes. No, Smedes, I thought you might ask this question. So I definitely think it would be helpful to break it down. So if you use, kind of roughly speaking, a midpoint of what I talked about, about $900 million and you take out the renovation projects at the W Union Square and Barbados as well as the $100 million for City Express, you\u2019re down to $650 million. Then you\u2019ve got higher spend on tech systems that will overwhelmingly be reimbursed to us from the system of, call it, another $150 million in \u201823 that\u2019s higher than typical. That then gets you down to $500 million, which is quite similar to this year\u2019s $500 million. I think when you think about key money being, again, in the ballpark of perhaps $200 million, $225 million in \u201823, that actually lines up quite well with our historical kinds of numbers for the growth of the system. And as you know, many, many of the deals that we signed do not require any capital investment on the part of Marriott. Tony Capuano : And I might just build on that, Smedes, by reminding you of an obvious fact, which is \u2013 and we\u2019ve shared this in prior Analyst Days. The deals that we determine we may deploy some measure of Marriott capital, even in the form of key money, tend to drive premium valuations and premium fees. And they tend to be much more heavily weighted to our leading luxury portfolio and some of the upper upscale projects as well. Smedes Rose : Thanks. And can I just follow-up on Robin\u2019s question about City Express or just in general? With your largest, I guess U.S. competitor making a move on what\u2019s being termed, premium economy, do you feel that it\u2019s important for Marriott to also be in that segment in terms of sort of capturing, I guess, a wider range of customers? I mean traditionally, you haven\u2019t really dipped down below, I guess we call it like upper-mid scale. I mean I guess sort of thinking strategically, is that something that you need to be more attentive to or maybe not so much? Tony Capuano : Yes, I won\u2019t comment on our competitors. What I will tell you is our growth strategy broadly is driven by what we hear from the two constituents that are most directly impacted, obviously, our guests and our owners and franchisees. And what we hear from them loudly and clearly is at the right quality level, entry into mid-scale is of great appeal. An alternative lodging product like Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy is equally appealing to both of those constituents, and that\u2019s where our focus lies right now in terms of expanding the portfolio. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Tony Capuano : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Patrick Scholes : Hi. Good morning everyone. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : Good morning. First question, I apologize if I missed this. But on your international RevPAR guidance for the first quarter and full year, can you just give us a little more quantification of how you would expect the various international markets to perform regarding \u2013 or versus those RevPAR ranges you gave, such as Europe and Asia Pacific? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Yes. So, broadly, you heard us talk about 47% to 49% for international in the first quarter. And as you think about kind of around the world, I would expect Asia Pacific, both APAC, in particular, outside of China to be meaningfully above that, Greater China, probably somewhere in that ballpark. You clearly saw that EMEA will also be kind of in that very high sort of range. With particularly Europe being a real outlier, very high given where they were a year ago in the first quarter. So, I think the easiest way to think about it is where Omicron was having the greatest impact is where you will see these outsized performances, because for example, a year ago, EMEA, the Middle East was not as impacted by Omicron. So, their year-over-year increase will not be as strong. I think one of the messages that we want you to hear is that in this current environment, when you think about kind of moving from Q4 into Q1, we are still seeing good opportunities for continued strength and growth in occupancy and rate apart from any normal seasonal variation. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. And just a follow-up question, more of an operational issue. There is a bit of a debate out there whether housekeeping will be coming back. I was at Allison, I talked to some of the large managers, and they are at the belief that housekeeping will be coming back eventually on a daily type of service, I am curious what your thoughts are on that amenity? Thank you. Tony Capuano : Of course, I might repeat myself a little bit in the comment I made earlier about City Express. When we make these sort of operating protocol decisions, we are guided by both the evolving expectations of our guests and the economic realities of our owners and franchisees weighing both of those sets of expectations and needs. What we have said is we will have modified housekeeping protocols by quality tier. So, in our luxury portfolio, we are essentially back to pre-pandemic full daily housekeeping. In the upper upscale tier, we have daily tidy, so not a full cleaning, but making the bed, changing the tearing [ph], cleaning the trash, etcetera. And in our select service, or MSB portfolio, we have every other day tidy. What we hear from our guests, if you give us optionality, which we do both in the booking path and a check-in. And if you give us something we can count on consistently, you will meet our needs. And this blended approach captures a lot of the economics that we created during the pandemic for our owners and franchisees. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you for the color. Tony Capuano : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Dori Kesten : Thanks. Good morning Tony and Leeny. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Dori Kesten : You mentioned higher technology costs this year. We have heard that you have some pretty interesting plans on that front that owners are looking forward to. Can you just walk through what the changes are that we may see over the next several years? Leeny Oberg : I will start and give you the investment perspective, and then I am sure Tony will jump in. So, I guess first, I would say this is not what I would call one thing. This is really a recognition that we view that the digital experience and the experience for our customers and for our associates on the systems that they interact with the company as being of critical importance over the next few years or really forever. And so in that regard, we are very excited about the work that we are doing on our tech systems that really will transform the experience for the mobile app and for our guests as they plan and execute their stays with us. It will also transform the experience for our associates, which is critically important as well as we think about how they take care of our guests, most particularly, as they are able to interact with our Bonvoy guests to really address their specific needs. So, as we look at rolling it out, you have probably seen our announcements of working with several third-party service providers to really transform several of our systems. But I also think it\u2019s worth noting that we have already done incredible things on our app and the experience from the digital communications and platform with our customers and our ability to really address their specific wants and needs has already improved meaningfully, and we expect to build on that. Dori Kesten : Prefect. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to just look into the owned and leased profit within the guidance versus what you just reported. It looks like it is flattish or down a bit. And I just wondered was there something in \u201822 that lifted it up, or are there some \u2013 if you could help us unpack that a little bit. Leeny Oberg : Sure. Absolutely. So, a couple of things. David, I would say, first of all, we do have two really important innovation \u2013 renovation projects going on in \u201823. No surprise, Barbados was crushing it over the past year as you think about leisure demand. And as we really do a very full renovation of these properties, that will have an impact on un-leased profits. I would expect termination fees to be a bit lower as we look at \u201823 versus \u201822. We had a couple of other things that are close to offsetting. If you remember, in Q1, in particular, of \u201822, we had the German subsidies. So, they hit in Q1 of \u201822, and we, obviously, will not have them in Q1 of \u201823. We also had an agreement on a pack of leased U.S. hotels that involved a charge later in the year in \u201822. And obviously, we won\u2019t have that in \u201823. So, there will be a little bit between the quarters that moves thing around. Those two things largely offset each other. So, I really would look to both termination fees as well as the issue around renovation. David Katz : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And as my follow-up, I wanted to just touch on deletions quickly, because I \u2013 and I apologize if it sounds like a negative question. There has just been a lot of discussion about the NUG. But this 1 to 1.5 deletions going forward, is that what we should think about as kind of a normal course number? Tony Capuano : It\u2019s a good question. I would suggest to you that the 1 to 1.5 range is more reflective of some of the uncertainty that Leeny described in her remarks, and it resulted ultimately in us providing forward guidance on RevPAR in a wider range than we might historically have offered. David Katz : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Tony Capuano : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill Crow : Hey. Good morning. I might as well follow-up on the NUG question. Assuming no large acquisition repeats in 2023, should we assume that 2024 is back in that kind of 3.5% range? Tony Capuano : Well, Bill, we were excited to be able to give you some visibility into \u201823. \u201824 is probably a little ambitious. What I will tell you though is, notwithstanding some of the constriction in the debt markets, we are encouraged that we are seeing incremental acceleration of construction starts, albeit not back to where we were in 2019. We are encouraged by what we experienced both on the signings and openings front in 2022 with conversions and expect that momentum to continue to build both on an individual asset basis and a portfolio basis. Bill Crow : Okay. And then my follow-up question would be on just the operating expense environment in the U.S. If you could just kind of give us a little bit of details on what you are seeing on the labor front, kind of year-over-year increase and then maybe all other expenses or the total expense growth expectation for this year? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Sure. As you have seen in our numbers, we have given you the expectation of 3% to 5% on the year. And that really, as you think about it, reflects just continuing to be more and more back-end business. So, whether it is higher travel expenses or a little bit more annualization of positions that we added in \u201821 and \u201822. But really, other than that, I would say, really quite normal. The wage pressures have moderated, Bill. And we are seeing a more normalized environment, both at the property level as well as above property. Bill Crow : Great. Thanks Leeny. Operator : We will take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : Hey. Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you so much. So, maybe starting with you, Lenny, if you could. You mentioned non-RevPAR fees growing \u2013 could grow 4% to 7%. I was wondering if you would be willing to break that out a little bit and talk about the credit card fee portion, at least in relation to RevPAR growth? And then what that would imply for residential fees and other? Leeny Oberg : Sure. So, as you know, residential branding fees are bumpy. They really do vary depending on the timing of the opening of when a building is complete and people can actually move in and close their sales. So, they tend to vary. They have gone anywhere from $40 million to $70 million within the space of 2 years. As you have heard us say, we have a really robust pipeline of residential projects. And so while I would expect the residential branding fees to be more flattish compared to \u201822, that\u2019s really just a reflection of timing. When I think about credit card fees, we expect them to increase both as a combination of a higher number of cardholders, and that\u2019s partly in the U.S. and partly from the fact that we have added a bunch of other countries as well as increased spend. I do think the average spend for an existing cardholder, that growth will moderate in \u201823 as compared to \u201822. Those are tied into how, I think generally we are seeing the economic view. So, for example, that might look more like inflation, while the wonderful terrific increase comes from more and more cardholders. Brandt Montour : That\u2019s hugely helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up on the development outlook and discussion from earlier. Obviously, signings sound like they are really strong, Tony had talked about. I am curious if you could talk a little bit about the segment of the pipeline that\u2019s in the planning phases, not just signed, but maybe had been there for a little bit? And not necessarily stale, but just curious if there is a dynamic in that pipeline that you are seeing that\u2019s any different than history? Tony Capuano : No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean maybe the best empirical metric to answer your question is fall-out from the pipeline, which would be canceled projects, and that\u2019s running interestingly kind of on pace with what we have experienced historically over a long period of time and with what we were experiencing prior to the pandemic. As Leeny pointed out in response to an earlier question, the move from sign to getting a shovel on the ground has not accelerated as much as we would like. But again, we are seeing the number of construction starts, particularly in the U.S., moving meaningfully from the bottom of the trough, albeit not quite back to where we were prior to pandemic. Brandt Montour : Prefect. Thanks everyone. Operator : We will take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask about group pace. Tony, you talked about kind of the movement to \u2013 in the year, for the year. And kind of how that\u2019s changed over the past couple of years? So, as we look out to like \u201824, what percentage of rooms are on the books now versus what would normally be on the books this early? And does that kind of affect how you think about RevPAR outlooks? Thanks Tony Capuano : Sure. So, as I mentioned earlier, the group has been a real bright spot for us and not just looking backwards, but even forward. If you look at what we have on the books for \u201824 on January 1, \u201823, that\u2019s about 5% ahead in gross revenue from where we were a year prior, meaning comparing that to what was on the books for \u201823 on January 1, 2022. And so we are pacing ahead of where we were a year ago. And we are enthused at the prospect of those numbers continuing to expand because of the in the year, for the year phenomenon that you described. Chad Beynon : Okay. Great. And then something that we will probably talk a lot more about as we get through \u201823, Congress has talked about a reduction in what they call surprise fees. So, I guess these would \u2013 in your industry, they could potentially hit some of the resorts on the back-end. Can you talk about how your partners are thinking about what would happen if these below-the-line fees kind of move to above-the-line? If those would just be included in the rate or if there could be a difficult transition period if they are banned? Thanks. Tony Capuano : Well, as you would expect, we listened with great interest to the President\u2019s comments during the State of the Union. It appeared, if you listen to what he actually said, his concern was \u201chidden fees.\u201d And the manner in which we disclose resort fees or destination fees, combined with the rigorous process we have to approve the implementation of one of those fees and the requirements for a meaningful value proposition before those fees are approved, give us comfort that we have the right strategy. The other thing I would remind you across our 8,300 hotel portfolio, I think we have got less than 300 hotels that have those sorts of fees. So, in terms of materiality, it\u2019s quite impactful for those individual owners, but less impactful on a portfolio-wide basis. Chad Beynon : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : We have reached the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Tony Capuano : Well, I want to thank you again. These calls are a lot more fun to engage with you as we continue to see empirical evidence of the resilience of travel. We appreciate your thoughtful questions and look forward to seeing you on the road. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Thank you. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Jackie Burka. Jackie Burka : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Marriott's first quarter 2023 earnings call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Development; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels. Statements in our comments in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Thank you, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We announced excellent first quarter results, reflecting continued momentum in our business around the world. While the timing of demand recovery has varied across regions, depending on COVID policies, it is clear that post-pandemic people have a deep appreciation for travel. As the largest global lodging company, with properties in 138 countries and territories, a diverse portfolio of amazing brands and our award-winning Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, we are proud to connect people through the power of travel. First quarter global RevPAR rose 34% versus 2022, driven by significant recovery in Asia Pacific and strong growth across the rest of our regions. Worldwide occupancy reached 65%, up 11 percentage points higher than the year ago quarter. Global ADR grew 11%, demonstrating our continued focus on driving rate. While macroeconomic uncertainty persists, it has not weighed on travel demand to date. In fact, demand continued to rise across all customer segments in the quarter. Forward bookings are solid. Though our transient booking window is still short term at around three weeks, so trends could change relatively quickly. Global leisure demand and ADR are still incredibly robust. Following a year with leisure demand already well above pre-pandemic levels, first quarter transient room nights for the segment increased 12% with ADR rising 8% year-over-year. Group demand was also very strong in the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, group revenue for full year 2023 was pacing up 26% to 2022 at the end of the quarter, a significant improvement from group pace at the end of last year. For the second through fourth quarter of this year, group room nights were pacing up 9% with rate up 7%, leading to revenues pacing up 16% year-over-year. U.S. and Canada business transient demand saw a modest additional recovery in the quarter. ADR rose meaningfully primarily due to solid special corporate rate increases. First quarter U.S. and Canada business transient revenues surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. And [for] cross-border travel has continued to rise globally. However, it is still a few 100 basis points below 2019 when guests traveling abroad accounted for nearly 20% of total room nights. Additional upside is expected to come primarily from Asia Pacific given international airlift to and from China is still well below pre-pandemic levels. We are focused on strengthening our Marriott Bonvoy loyalty platform by continuing to grow our membership base, which reached 182 million members at the end of March and enhancing engagement with these valuable customers. Our co-branded credit cards with offerings in nine countries performed well again this quarter. Global Card acquisitions sorted 35% year-over-year while global card spend increased 16%. To engage with our customers, we are increasingly leveraging our digital platforms which are highly profitable channels for our owners. Those digital channels had a record first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, mobile app users grew 31%, digital room nights rose 17% and digital revenues climbed 26%. Turning to development. We still expect gross rooms growth of around 5.5% this year and net rooms growth of 4% to 4.5%. While we are keeping a close eye on the financing environment, as Leeny will discuss in her remarks, we do anticipate returning to a mid-single-digit net rooms growth in the next few years. We were pleased to close the City Express transaction just yesterday, welcoming roughly 17,000 rooms in the Caribbean and Latin American region, or CALA, into our portfolio. City Express is an incredible launchpad to jumpstart our entry into the high-growth moderately priced mid-scales. We see meaningful opportunity to expand the brand in CALA as well as in other locations around the world. Our industry-leading pipeline stood at approximately 502,000 rooms at quarter end, with 57% of those rooms in international markets and about 200,000 rooms under construction. Strong interest in conversions continues, including multiunit opportunities. Conversions represented nearly 30% of signings in the quarter and 25% of openings. I'll now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results reflected robust demand growth around the world with all regions and all hotel tiers posting solid performance. U.S. and Canada RevPAR grew 26% year-over-year; occupancy reached 66%, up 8 percentage points, while ADR rose 10% versus the year ago quarter. International RevPAR rose a remarkable 63% over the '22 first quarter with ADR rising 16%. Occupancy reached 64%, an 18 percentage point improvement versus the prior year quarter. Demand was strong in all international markets with particularly impressive improvement in Asia Pacific after travel restrictions were lifted. RevPAR in Greater China was 95% recovered to pre-pandemic levels in the quarter and Mainland China was more than fully recovered. This is all the more notable given that demand in the quarter was overwhelmingly driven by domestic travelers as international airlift was still less than 20% of 2019 capacity at the end of March. As you will recall, around one quarter of room nights in Greater China were from international guests pre-pandemic. International flights to and from China are slowly being adding, although airlift is only expected to be around 40% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. Total gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion, nearly 40% above the prior year quarter with a meaningful rise in incentive management fees, or IMF. IMF nearly doubled compared to 2022 to $201 million. They also topped the first quarter of 2019 by 23%, with every region except for Greater China, earning more incentive fees than in the 2019 first quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees also grew meaningfully once again totaling $197 million, up 16% year-over-year, primarily due to co-branded credit card fees rising 18%. Containing cost remains a focus at both the corporate and the hotel level. In the U.S. and Canada, margins at our managed hotels rose two percentage points versus the 2022 first quarter, and they remain above 2019 margin levels. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.1 billion, a new quarterly record despite the first quarter being the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. Now let's talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings press release. With the better-than-expected first quarter results and robust global booking trends, we're raising our full year guidance. Macroeconomic uncertainty is not impacting our short-term demand and trends across all customer segments remain strong. The second quarter is expected to benefit from particularly strong year-over-year growth in international markets, especially in Asia Pacific. However, there is less visibility in forecasting the company's financial performance for the second half of the year. The high end of the range reflects relatively steady global economic conditions throughout the remainder of 2023 with continued resilience of travel demand across all customer segments and markets. The low end of the range reflects a meaningful softening of the global economy in the second half of the year with worldwide RevPAR in the last two quarters, roughly flat compared to 2022. For the full year, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada could grow 6% to 9% and international RevPAR could grow 22% to 25%, leading to global RevPAR rising 10% to 13%. Total fees for the full year could rise between 13% and 16% with a non-RevPAR-related component increasing 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR fee growth is expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We still expect G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 levels. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 13% and 18%, and adjusted EPS could rise 19% to 26% above 2022. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a great deal of cash. In the first quarter, our net cash provided by operating activities was around $890 million, and we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through the end of March. Our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. For the full year, we still expect 2023 investment spending of $850 million to $1 billion. This includes $100 million through the just completed acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio as well as higher-than-typical investment in our customer-facing technology, which is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. With the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast, we now expect to return between $3.6 billion and $4.1 billion to shareholders in 2023. On the development front, we are sure many of you have questions about the banking environment in the U.S. and in Europe, in particular. Given rapidly rising interest rates, the financing environment in these regions has been challenging for some time. Another element of uncertainty has now been added as some banks wait for more clarity around capital requirements and perhaps additional regulations. However, while there are challenges with lending, especially for new construction projects, deals that have committed financing continue to move forward. Additionally, the number of deals leading the pipeline is not increasing. Fallout in the quarter was around 1.5% below our historical average of just over 2%. We're closely monitoring the situation and the regulatory response but we do expect the tightening in hotel financing to be short term. As we have seen over time, hotel financing has proven to be quite resilient over the long term. Hotel loans have been among the better-performing sectors of commercial real estate lending of late as hotels continue to post excellent operating results. I'll now turn the call back over to Tony, who has a few more comments before we go to Q&A. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Leeny. Before we open up for questions, I just want to pause for a moment and thank our team of associates around the world who continue to do such outstanding work and are a key reason that our year is off to such a strong start. They are remarkable. I'm also excited to let you all know that we plan to hold our first Analyst Day since early 2019 at the W South Beach in Miami on Wednesday, September 27. We will open registration for that event in June. And we look forward to seeing you in South Florida and sharing a deeper dive on our business with you this fall. So now Lenny and I are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good morning, guys. What's that to us was obviously the -- I mean it was a good quarter overall. What's that to us was the incentive management fee performance in 1Q. And the comment you made that it was driven or IMF outside of China or above 2019 levels, China just below. Can you talk about China IMF expectations for the balance of this year and how you think about IMF growth relative to these and franchise and other fees growth? Leeny Oberg : Thanks. Sure. So let me just kind of set the stage a little bit, and that is that you -- we talked about the fact that IMF's essentially doubled Q1 over Q1. And certainly, a huge part of that was driven by Asia Pacific in their great RevPAR recovery. So again, broadly speaking, if you call it, $100 million increase in IMF, about $30 million to $40 million of that came from Asia Pacific. So definitely with a disproportionate increase in RevPAR relative to the rest of the world, they were a big provider. As you know, Joe, generally, our incentive fees in Asia Pacific do not include an owner's priority. So they tend to be not quite as lumpy in terms of the way that they return. So we would expect, as you see incentive fees for the remainder of this year, to continue to show that characteristic. And I guess the best way to put it is that if we hit the high end of our guidance, you could expect to see incentive fees globally actually surpass the peak levels that we had in 2019. And then the only other thing that I'll point out is that, obviously, our managed rooms, which make up about 550,000 rooms out of 1.5 million, over 75% of them are full-service rooms. So as you see the strength in both group and returning business transient and continued leisure demand, I think that bodes well for IMF. Tony Capuano : And then, Leeny, the only thing I might add for Joe's benefits since his question was specific to China, we did see in the quarter, Joe, that Mainland China RevPAR was fully recovered to 2019 levels. But remember, the vast majority of that recovery was domestic demand. At the end of the quarter, only about 20% of the international airlift in China has recovered. I think by April, it was recovered about 40%. And so we do expect a stronger and stronger return of international demand in China through the balance of the year. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question -- Leeny, thank you for prepared remarks on the development front with potential financing challenges. Are you guys getting increased requests? Or do you anticipate increased requests from developers for financial support? Leeny Oberg : No, I think we always get requests for financial support, and we're happy to consider them. I do think, Joe, at the end of the day, the largest area of the capital stack, particularly in the U.S. that needs to be filled, is the senior loan. And so from that perspective, that is not a place where we typically get requests. And so around the edges, I would say there's a bit more request for whether they're debt service guarantees or operating profit guarantees, and that obviously is for managed properties. But I would say that, broadly speaking, the level of capital that we're putting into deals has not changed meaningfully. That this really is more about a temporary slowdown in the bank's willingness to get some of these financings over the finish line. Joe Greff : Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hi, good morning. Wanted to touch base on the digital or technology investment that you talked about last quarter. Just want to know a little bit more about how you think that could impact the consumer experience and our employee experience as we think about longer-term revenue and/or margin implications from that investment? Tony Capuano : Sure. So as we think about not only the re-platforming of our major systems but also ongoing investment in our technology infrastructure, we always think about it through the lens of the impact on our associates, our guests and our owners and franchisees. I think from an associate perspective, particularly our future workforce is a workforce that has grown up opening an iPhone box with the understanding that there are no instructions and that, that technology will be intuitive and the design of our future technology will be similarly intuitive. So we think it will both be advantageous as we compete for talent, but it will also create capacity for them to more deeply engage with our guests. For our guests, we envision both at the property level and our customer engagement centers, making the breadth of information that we have about our guests available to our agents so that they can quickly and seamlessly address whatever questions or concerns or needs that those guests have. And then I think from the owner's perspective, there are both inherent operating efficiencies from new technologies that should be margin enhancing. And I also think from a revenue generation perspective, today, when you go to m.com you have the ability to book rooms. When our new systems roll out, the full breadth of products and services that we have to sell our customers, food beverage, spa, golf will be available at a single click. And we think that represents a very meaningful revenue upside. Leeny Oberg : And Stephen, the only thing that I'll add is just a reminder that this is really a multiyear process that -- we talked about it a quarter ago, we talked about it again today, and that is that, I mean, we're thrilled with what we see for the potential with this and that, that will impact this year's investment spending, but we expect this will take several years. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And perhaps a quick follow-up on Joe's question about development and really focused on the pipeline. Given the strong growth in international markets in China, in particular, in the pipeline, how does that change the visibility as we think about translating to net unit growth from that particular part of the pipeline? Leeny Oberg : Well, I'll make a couple of comments. First of all, the continued strength in conversions is obviously great for our visibility into the pipeline. They tend to be shorter to actually open, they tend to be clearer and exactly what needs to be done to be able to put our flag on them. And you've seen that we continue to put out really strong numbers on both signings and openings. The other trend that we've noticed over the past couple of years is increasing comfort internationally with conversions. And as you think about our soft brands, that really started, frankly, in the U.S. with Autograph and then have now really expanded as you think about Autograph Luxury collection tribute and to some extent, Delta, you really see those spreading more around the world. And that obviously gives us better visibility both for the rooms that are going to open and frankly, really helps support the net rooms growth thesis that we have. Tony Capuano : And I might just build on that, Stephen, the -- we talked a little bit about this last quarter. Of course, the teams around the world continue to pursue individual asset conversions, but we are just as aggressively looking for portfolio conversions. You might remember that in the middle of last year we were delighted to announce an 8-hotel portfolio conversion in Vietnam that we referred to as Vinpearl. Just last month, we did Vinpearl Round 2, which was seven additional hotels, about 2,500 rooms, three of which are conversions that will open in calendar 2023. So I think that multi-unit portfolio conversion strategy is something you should reasonably expect to continue to be a focus area for our teams. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful context. Thanks so much. Operator : We will take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get just a little more color on how we think about the arc or trajectory of non-RevPAR fees relative to the core fees that you've obviously provided a ton of color on and arguably, we have a bit more experience modeling over the long term. Leeny Oberg : Sure. I think you heard me talk about the 4% to 7% expectation for 2023, which is obviously a bit different as it relates to fees from RevPAR given what we're seeing in the lodging operations for the year. So I think overwhelmingly, as you know, the non-RevPAR fees are co-brand credit card fees. Those are the largest chunk. And they are going to tie to both the number of cardholders and the level of average spend. I think it won't surprise you that as you've seen people start to amount of COVID that we are seeing the average spend on credit card increases year-over-year moderate. But I will also say that the number of cardholders is growing very nicely. So I would say that it is relatively speaking, more growth coming from the increased base of cardholders than it is on the actual spend, but it is a great combination of the two of them. The other thing is on our resi fees, on our resi branding fees, they over a kind of three to five year time horizon, they've just been growing beautifully as there's great demand for that product of ours, but they are a bit lumpier in terms of when the actual residences open. And that, I think you should expect to see that it will continue to grow over time, but that it can vary quarter-to-quarter quite meaningfully given the onetime nature of those fees. David Katz : Understood. Very helpful. And if I can ask my follow-up, just touch on City Express a bit more, admitting that I have not stated one. Can you just help us sort of place that within kind of the RevPAR hierarchy of what you have? And give us a sense, as to sort of when and how and what way we might see that grow into other markets notably more in the U. S.? Tony Capuano : Yes, of course. So as I mentioned in the opening remarks, on the long list of attributes that excite us about this transaction, it is a great way for the company to enter the midscale segment, which is not a segment where we have competed previously. When we have talked in the past about the breadth of our portfolio, we've often responded to questions by saying we love the breadth of that portfolio for the way in which, it satisfies the wants and needs of both our guests and our owners and franchisees. And mid-scale is a tier where we hear demands from both of those constituents. Mid-scale obviously is - as from a RevPAR perspective and a rate positioning perspective, positioned below brands like Fairfield that are in our current architecture. We think there is an immediate opportunity to accelerate the growth of City Express across the Caribbean and Latin American region. As we have done with many brands that we've either developed organically or acquired. We are indeed been exploring the applicability of the City Express platform, and its growth potential in other markets around the world. And in fact here in the U. S., we're just a few weeks away from announcing a simple, modern, streamlined, new build, extended state product that has very basic services and amenities for those looking for longer stays at our mid-scale price point, and you should expect to hear more about that in the coming weeks. David Katz : Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Tony Capuano : Of course. Operator : We will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. Just circling back in your introductory remarks, you talked about business transient revenue being above 2019 levels. I wonder if you could tell us, because rate clearly seems to be the driver. What business transient nights are as kind of the percent change the delta to 2019 level? Leeny Oberg : So business transient room nights are down about 1% versus 2019. Obviously, the rate has been terrific, particularly with the most recent renegotiation at the special corporate rate. Robin Farley : Great, thank you. And I guess my other - the follow-up question would be I know you've talked about the strength you're raising RevPAR, so clearly you're seeing strong demand. But when we look at the broader market, the STR data, we see luxury and economy that the two sort of ends Both having kind of on a trailing at this point, I think it's seven weeks of trailing six to seven weeks of trailing showing down year-over-year for RevPAR for those two segments? And I realize you're much more focused than the upscale and upper upscale, but I wonder if you could just sort of like opine for a moment on whether that's something that you think will start to move into those other segments or how you view what's happening in those kind of upscale economy parts of the market? Thanks. Tony Capuano : Sure. So obviously, we're very focused on rate and I think that's revealed in the results with global ADR up about 11% in the quarter. If you look at the U.S. and Canada, Q1 luxury rates as you point out were down slightly year-over-year. But as we dig into that data, our sense is that modest decline is largely around mix shift. So the prior several quarters, the bulk of that luxury rate growth was in leisure destinations, resort destinations as we start to see pickup in demand in urban downtown core destinations. That's great for the business, but it's at lower rates and that's dragging down a bit. With that said, globally luxury ADR was up 4% in the quarter even as compared to the extraordinarily strong ADR we saw for luxury in the first quarter. And then, I think your second question was on? Leeny Oberg : On economy which largely as you might imagine, I think we don't play very much there really in any meaningful way. I think it's not a surprise when you see that just generally speaking in economy, there tends to be less variability both up and down over time than you see in the highest end rates. But I think again, I will point out on luxury, Robin that we're still very, very pleased with what we see in terms of luxury demand. And frankly, when you think, for example, people having more opportunities of where they want to travel. It's one of the benefits of being the size and scale of our system, because they're actually may not be going to some places domestically, that they were going before, but can now actually go abroad. Tony Capuano : And then just to put a little more context to your question, Robin. And I think this kind of tracks with the industry data that you referenced. This is system wide for the quarter, we then as compared to '22 luxury RevPAR was up 18% extended stay RevPAR was up 16% select brand RevPAR was up 23% and premium RevPAR was up 35%. Robin Farley : Yes on that for year-over-year yes. Okay. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thanks. Tony Capuano : Yes, thank you. You're welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So Leeny, maybe if we could talk about capital return a little bit. Obviously, you boosted up your expectations or outlook there. Could you just remind us sort of kind of maybe where this new outlook range kind of puts you relative to your medium-term leverage target and what that target is? Leeny Oberg : Sure. I think it's a great question to be able to reinforce where we are, which is that we have been for some time continue to be and expect for the rest of this year to continue to be at the low end of the investment grade leverage targets. So the biggest chunk of all, of the chunk relative to the increase in capital return is from the increase in expected EBITDA and cash flow for the company. So if you think about broadly speaking, the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA going up between $250 million and $300 million, it's pretty straight math to see that that can get you to this increase of call it roughly $700 million of midpoint of capital return. So, we feel really strong about the way the business is operating, from a cash flow performance as well as the visibility that we've got, certainly in the near-term. But even at the lower end of the guidance that we provided, I think, we still feel really good about being at the low end of our leverage targets with the kind of capital return range that, we've given. Shaun Kelley : Great. And as my follow-up to maybe switch gears a little bit, but following up on the comment around I think mid-scale extended stay and a little bit around M&A and City Express too. Tony, could just talk a little bit about sort of the balance of potential brand launches and where you see white space on that front relative to tuck-in M&A, which I know we saw for a number of years kind of back into the early 2010s and then obviously Starwood kind of took over for a few years in the late teens there? Maybe help us balance those two priorities or how you see opportunities in each? Tony Capuano : Of course, so then the fundamental strategy has not shifted. You are right to point out that prior to Starwood, there was a fairly consistent cadence of what we always refer to as bolt-on acquisitions. But the bulk of those acquisitions had some common D&A. They often helped us gain a foothold in a geography where we were dissatisfied with the pace of organic growth. And they often - we often have the view that they represented a growth platform either regionally or potentially globally. AC acquisition would be perhaps the best illustration of that. Our industry leading scale gives us maybe the luxury of not needing to do M&A to gain scale. We enjoy scale. But we will continue to look at opportunities, if we believe there is a gap in the geography where our guests seek to travel and we're dissatisfied with our footprint or if we see a gap in our brand architecture. That was what guided the City Express transaction, a transaction that solidified the strength and leadership of our footprint in the CALA region and also filled in a gap our brand architecture by giving us entry into mid-scale. But the final bit of common D&A in every one of those transactions is the discipline around the valuation, and you should expect to see that same discipline as we evaluate. What I think will be a fair number of opportunities that will be floating around out, there in the market. And then maybe the last comment I would make is, as I reflect on the last decade or more of expansion of our platform. I'm delighted that we've expanded our brand architecture through a thoughtful blend of both M&A and organically generated platforms. When I look at the success, we've had with organic launches like Autograph and Moxy and I blend that with powerhouses like Residence Inn and Ritz-Carlton and AC which were added to the system through M&A., I really like that approach. Shaun Kelley : Thanks very much. Tony Capuano : Of course. Operator : We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open. Smedes Rose : Hi thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit about, how you're thinking about occupancy as in you should hear. And I'm sort of asking in the context it looks like for you and for others, that we've seen reports from that occupancy just still sort of stubbornly below kind of pre-pandemic levels. I mean certainly, it's closed, but they're still below, obviously offset by rate? But I'm wondering do you have any just sort of updated thoughts on - is there some piece of business that's maybe kind of gone or people are being priced out or do you think occupancies can and will return to kind of pre-pandemic levels as we go through this year and into next year? Tony Capuano : Sure. So I'll give it a try, and Leeny feel free to jump in. As we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we continue to see robust demand recovery translating into strong occupancy growth. In fact, on a global basis, we saw 11 points of occupancy improvement in the quarter. When we think about our updated guidance, at the high end of that guidance, we expect our RevPAR growth to be fairly evenly split between ADR and occupancy gains. So, we do expect there to be continued occupancy gains at the high end of that guidance. The low end of the range would, reflect a meaningful softening in the global economy in the back half of the year. And that would have worldwide RevPAR relatively flat, compared to where we were in the back half of last year. Leeny Oberg : So the only thing, I'll add is it is interesting when you look at occupancy compared to 2019, and we do continue to make progress in that comparison. When I look at U.S. and Canada kind of moving through from January through March of this Q compared to '19, we're down to only two percentage points, difference by the time we're at March. And globally, actually, we're only two percentage points in March as well. I think there are a couple of things to note. Number one is the portfolios are pretty different. We've added 11% more rooms since 2019. So the comparison starts to be not completely apples-to-apples. And I think there's, also been some great learnings on the part of the industry about revenue management. And there, I think at the end of the day, we're trying to make sure that we're maximizing the returns on these real estate assets. And then as you've seen with group, for example, there's actually been some benefit over the reality that group is booking closer to the time of the actual event. So I think, we will eventually get back there. We are getting fairly close. But I think the best part is that you're seeing the fundamental business segments of business, transient leisure and group really all operating on full cylinders, not exactly the way they behaved in 2019, but still really in good shape. Smedes Rose : Okay thanks. And then maybe just on that - I'm sorry, if you said what percent of demand in the quarter came through Marriott ongoing members? And could you just talk a little bit about what kind of demand is coming through OTAs at this point? Leeny Oberg : Yes. On the penetration side - is that your question on Marriott? Smedes Rose : Yes, yes right. Leeny Oberg : Are you talking about digital channels or are you talking about Marriott? Smedes Rose : Well for occupancy, how much came through Marriott bonds right like that? Leeny Oberg : Yes. So for the first quarter, globally, the member penetration was 53% and in the U.S., it was 60%. Smedes Rose : Okay. And has the - the occupancy through OTAs changed meaningfully or? Leeny Oberg : No, that has stayed that's at about 11%, and that is quite similar to what was pre-COVID. I think the interesting part is that you look at either the digital channels which have grown 600 basis points since pre-COVID or if you look at all of Marriott's direct channels together. We've actually grown share about 100 basis points since pre-COVID, but the OTAs have remained roughly flat. Smedes Rose : Thank you. I appreciate the details. Operator : We'll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning everyone. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Patrick Scholes : Good morning Tony, I see there's some news in the last day or so that you folks will begin bundling your resort fees into your pricing displays later this month. It looks like you're the first major hotel company to be doing this. Do you see just putting yourself - does this create an unfair competitive disadvantage for you? And would you expect other hotel companies to also follow your lead with displaying these fees? Thank you. Tony Capuano : Yes. So the way I'd answer that, Patrick, we've already been showing it. The discussions we've been having with the various jurisdictions are, just about making sure that the transparency of those disclosures is enhanced and crystal clear for our guests. It is not as if those were hidden somehow, we're simply further clarifying and enhancing that transparency. I will leave it to the state AGs around the rest of the country for the rest of the industry. But I am pleased, that we will lead the industry in terms of the transparency of our disclosure for our guests. Patrick Scholes : Thank you. And I also - I agree, I think that's the right thing to do to give full transparency on these. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Of course. Operator : We will take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Richard Clarke : Hi there, thanks for taking my questions. Just the first one, your comment was that the projects that are under construction or finance are not being affected. About 60% of your pipeline is not under construction. How would you clarify that? How much of that is finance of the construction has it started? And how much risk associated is there without 60% not under construction? Leeny Oberg : Sure. So yes, you've got the basic parameters roughly right, which is those that have started construction, you would expect those to be already be financed. There's not a specific number on firm financing for that other 60%. That's an ongoing process and always has been between the developers as they consider their various capital sources. One thing to remember in that is, that our pipeline is over 50% international, which does tend to be less dependent on senior loan financing. And then for the remainder, in the U.S., it is overwhelmingly limited service of franchised properties. And those from a relative speaking basis, we do believe that there is some slowdown in the pace of financing for those, but we are, at the same time, continuing to see that banks are willing to consider loans for strong brands and strong proven markets. And we are still seeing that lenders are looking at those projects. So, I don't think that there is a fundamental change in how we see those projects materializing and to actually build hotels. I'd also remind you that there's, quite a few conversion hotels in that as well. So I think, as you've probably seen in past times where lending has had a slowdown that there can be a bit of a slowdown and the construction starts. But that we do expect with the performance of the hotel business and frankly, the relative performance of hotel loans, particularly in limited service loans, we would expect that to get going again more quickly. We aren't seeing fall out of those deals from our pipeline in anything more than a typical fashion. Richard Clarke : Okay, thanks for that color. And just as a follow-up. You mentioned your credit cards now in nine countries, just how meaningfully are those eight non-U.S. countries so far. And what is the opportunity? Can we have a credit card in 200 countries eventually or is there some natural limit to how many countries you can launch it? Leeny Oberg : Well, we're certainly going to have as many as we can, you can be sure of that. I think I'd make two comments. First of all, certainly with the use of revolving credit in the U.S., that is by far, the lion's share of, the fees that we received are related to the U.S. But I would say the rate of growth that we're seeing in terms of both the, spend and the cardholder numbers in international is really quite tremendous. Both in terms of the numbers of cards - numbers of countries, that we're adding cards as well as the number of cardholders in those countries. So, we've been really pleased with the increases for example, in Japan, in South Korea, in terms of the growth in cardholders. And I think that bodes really well for future growth, but also for our hotel growth and for our hotel business, because these are all Bonvoy members who want to be earning points and staying at our properties. So it's a great part of the ecosystem of our business. Richard Clarke : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dori Kesten : Thanks, good morning. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Dori Kesten : What percentage of your 200,000 rooms under construction are slated to open over the next three years? Leeny Oberg : Well, I think the best way - we don't have a particular percentage. As you know, we don't control exactly when they open. We do keep a very careful eye on how they are doing, and again, feel comfortable with the numbers that we've talked - that Tony talked about in terms of the gross room openings, which has both a share of those coming out from under construction as well as conversions. Dori Kesten : Okay. And I guess on to conversions, do you know - do you have a typical percentage that come as a result of sales versus just an owner choosing to switch? Tony Capuano : Yes, I don't think there's necessarily a typical percentage. If I had to guess over the last decade or so, it's probably relatively evenly split, between an owner that simply has an opportunity to change brands or to flag an independent hotel versus an opportunity that is, created as a result of a transaction. But I think that ebbs and flows a bit depending on where we find ourselves in an economic cycle. Leeny Oberg : And I'll just add one other point that may be as you try to come up with your own math, is just a reminder that for hotel construction and a limited service hotel is roughly speaking, two years under construction and a full-service hotel can be anywhere from three to four. Dori Kesten : Okay, thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is open. Brandt Montour : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Brandt Montour : Just quickly back to China Tony or anyone could you talk about maybe the starts momentum there on the ground. I know it sort of beats a little bit to its own drum or different drum than what we're talking about in the U.S., but are you seeing any building momentum in new construction starts in China? And do you think that, that could potentially offset sort of the growing headwinds on the financing side in the U.S. Lenny that you just talked about? Tony Capuano : Yes. So I think the borders are just opening, the economy is just starting to really gear up. So it's a bit soon for new construction starts. What I can tell you is some of the in-flight construction projects that have been paused have restarted. Our approval volumes are accelerating, the volume of memorandums of understanding that we're negotiating and executing are accelerating. So all of the leading indicators that should drive construction starts are really encouraging, but probably a bit premature to have any really strong data for you. Leeny Oberg : The other thing I'll point out is that roughly speaking, about 15% of our Chinese pipeline deals have some state-owned enterprise participation. And I think that does help as you think about the capital sourcing for those projects that is helpful as we get those ongoing again. Tony Capuano : And maybe the last point I would add, because we're so heavily weighted to the most valuable quality tiers of our upscale and luxury, oftentimes when we engage with the owner, the project is well under construction. So unlike the U.S., where our conversations start with a greenfield site, they may come to us with a tower of 25 stories out of the ground. So it's a bit of an apples to orange comparison. Brandt Montour : That's really helpful. And then, Leeny, following up on the IMF discussion, you talked about Asia-Pac and international. Could you maybe touch on the outlook for IMF in the U.S. kind of squaring that with the fact that you guys aren't implying a ton of growth in the U.S. in the back half? But as you mentioned, your mix skews to full service, which has the group component in there. Can you try and sort of square those factors away for us, please? Leeny Oberg : Yes, sure. Absolutely. So I do -- if you look at year-over-year Q1, you are right in pointing out that the U.S. IMF, which came close to doubling in Q1 from 42 to 85, actually did double, that growth was overwhelmingly driven by the premium hotels was the return of group and business transient to our premium hotels. We did continue to see growth in IMF from our luxury hotels, but the biggest chunk of growth came from those premium hotels. So I think with the strength of group that Tony pointed out, in his comments for the rest of the year that you should continue to see the strong growth in both U.S. and Canada IMFs as well as international. Brandt Montour : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hi, thank you. Good morning. Just with respect to China, I understand that the recovery has been primarily domestic so far, and we obviously have a good feel for airlift recovery. But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about segmentation. Is it like other geographies in that it's primarily leisure at this stage? And could you just comment on BT and group recovery within China or if there's any differences versus other geographies? And then just for my follow-up for the sake of time, do you share the view that it will be a fairly booming summer to Europe looking forward? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So I'll start with the second question first, and then Tony will fill in also. And that is, yes, on the second question. While we actually have seen the dollar soften a little bit more than where we were relative to when we gave guidance earlier in February, the reality is that we are still seeing great demand for Europe hotels for the summer and very pleased with the booking patterns we see there. On Greater China, let me talk about a couple of things. First of all, cross-border, just a reminder of our comments earlier that roughly three quarters of the business typically is domestic. Well, right now, it's over 90% is domestic. So I think there is the reality that there's going to be more travel both in and out of Greater China as demand -- as the airlift improve. So we would expect to see that help both other parts of the world, but also that there's more travel into China. In terms of the segment, it's seeing the recovery in segments very similar to the way that we saw it in other parts of the world. The one difference being that on special corporate and business transient in China that is recovering much more quickly than it did in the U.S. For example, overwhelmingly, people are back in their offices in Greater China, while in the U.S., there's obviously much more of a hybrid mix. So we are actually seeing all of the segments recover more in line with each other rather than necessarily one after another the way it was in the U.S. Tony Capuano : And the only other small note I would make, and I'm sure you're aware of this, with Chinese government just pivoted a bit and said that those foreign visas issued prior to March 28 of '20, that initially, they have said would need to be renewed, those are now available for use for entry into Mainland China, which should pave the way for greater inbound international because of the queue for new visa processing for international visitors had been quite lengthy. Duane Pfennigwerth : Really interesting. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open. Chad Beynon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, Tony, in terms of what your team has [coined blazer], which has presumably helped the length of stay, I'd assume, upper upscale in luxury. While it's hard to pinpoint, have you seen any reduction in these hybrid trips? I know it's always tough to analyze that, but just trying to figure out as people get back to fully in the office if that benefit has waned at all? Thanks. Tony Capuano : Yes. Not yet. I mean I think the best statistical data we have is the recovery by day of the week, and we continue to see strong recovery on Sundays and Thursdays, which is probably the most compelling empirical data we have that suggests that blended trip purpose continues to be strong. And then I would supplement that data with what we hear anecdotally when we're talking both with special corporate customers and with group customers who are talking to us as we re-platform our technology and encouraging us to make it easier for their business travelers or their group meeting attendees to book a single reservation that has both business and leisure purposes. So our sense is that, that trend shows no sign of slowing down. And as I've said in other forums, that's great news for our business. Chad Beynon : Thank you. And then lastly, and this is something you'll probably get into at the Analyst Day. But Leeny, in terms of the guidance you laid out, the difference between the high- and low-end, obviously, regarding variable scenarios and prior global recessions or in the analysis you guys are currently doing for the guidance, should we expect a more pronounced flattening or maybe decline in North America or outside of the U.S.? Obviously, a lot of variables in there, but just kind of wondering how you're thinking about maybe a soft landing or slightly worse than soft landing could affect each market. Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Yes. I would probably consider it about the timing of the recovery. So a couple of broad comments. Generally speaking, lodging demand does have a high correlation with GDP growth. So when you think of emerging economies like India, as an example, where you're seeing 6% GDP growth, that's going to be very different than what you see in the U.S. where more typical GDP growth might be more like 2%, and so the impact of a recession can be different in that regard. But I think when I think about the guidance that we've given this year, it is much more tied to the pace of recovery. The U.S., for example, meaningfully farther along in its recovery from COVID than Asia Pacific, for example. And I think we're clearly seeing that now all restrictions are lifted in Asia Pacific and that both pent-up demand and return of demand is coming quite nicely, which will mean that should we see an economic slowdown, I think they will be impacted a bit less than, for example, in the U.S., where obviously in the U.S., if we see it, it's starting from a different point. So again, as we talked about, we would imagine that Q3 and Q4 and that slowdown does mean that there is a meaningful economic slowdown. I'm not sure I would call it a super sharp deep V. But clearly, a real meaningful economic slowdown that would get us to that roughly flat RevPAR in Q3 and Q4 compared to '22. Chad Beynon : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Tony Capuano for closing remarks. Tony Capuano : Great.

Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. Now, I will turn the call over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our terrific second quarter results demonstrate the strength of global lodging demand and the success of our growth strategies. I've experienced a robust demand for lodging firsthand as I've been on the road a lot this year and have had the privilege of visiting every one of our regions. It has been wonderful to spend time with our team of hard-working and dedicated associates at properties around the world and to see how quickly global travel has rebounded. Second quarter worldwide RevPAR rose 13.5% versus the 2022 quarter, led by another quarter of meaningful recovery in Greater China. Less than two quarters after travel restrictions were lifted, RevPAR in Greater China has now surpassed 2019 levels, primarily due to the surge in domestic demand. Worldwide occupancy in the quarter reached 72%, five percentage points higher than the year ago quarter. With our unwavering focus on maximizing revenues, global ADR grew 6% year-over-year. Global leisure demand and ADR remained robust. Second quarter leisure transient room nights and ADR each increased 5% year-over-year, yielding 10% revenue growth. In the US and Canada, leisure revenues rose 1% above last year's sensational second quarter. Demand in this market has been stabilizing on a year-over-year basis with travelers from the region increasingly taking vacations overseas now that pandemic-related travel restrictions are behind us. Leisure room nights from the US and Canadian travelers jumped 90% in Asia Pacific and over 20% in Europe compared to the same period last year. The group segment had another great quarter with revenues in the US and Canada growing 10% year-over-year, driven by both rate and occupancy. Group revenues are expected to remain strong going forward. At the end of June, group revenue for the back half of 2023 was pacing up 11% to last year. Meeting planners are beginning to book further out, a trend we're also seeing with transient customers. Group revenue for full year 2024 was pacing up 14% year-over-year at the end of the quarter, an improvement from up 9% just three months prior. Recovery in business transient demand remained slow, but steady with demand from our top corporate accounts progressing modestly in the quarter. In the US and Canada, ADR again rose nicely compared to 2022, thanks to high single-digit special corporate rate increases. This led to business transient revenues rising 12% year-over-year. Overall, cross-border travel demand also rose again in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in international visitors to the Asia-Pacific region. The percent of total room nights from cross-border guests is now roughly one percentage point below 2019 levels of approximately 20%. Prior to the pandemic, international visitors accounted for nearly one quarter of room nights in Greater China. With the region's international airlift still only around 40% of 2019 capacity at the end of the second quarter, we believe there is still meaningful growth opportunity in and from Greater China. We remain keenly focused on strengthening our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, which has over 186 million members. To further build engagement, we continued to enrich the platform with an enhanced booking experience, more choices for customers, and complementary products that drive more value and capture share of wallet, such as our co-branded credit cards and travel insurance. Our international credit cards had a record quarter, driving global card acquisitions up 25% and global card spend up 10% versus the year ago quarter. We are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance the guest experience, to drive profitability for our owners and to simplify processes for our associates. As we've mentioned previously, we are in the process of a major global transformation of our digital and core technology. We will be launching new reservations, loyalty and property management platforms over the next several years and look forward to the numerous capabilities these new systems will offer our key constituents. As we focus on paths for growth, we are adding new offerings and experiences in segments where we believe there is strong consumer interest beyond our current brands. A great example is our recent announcement of an exclusive 20-year strategic license agreement with MGM Resorts International and the creation of MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy. The collection, which will launch beginning in October, encompasses 17 resorts with 40,000 rooms. This deal will provide us with significant presence in Las Vegas, one of the most popular destinations in the country with fantastic properties like Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and ARIA, as well as additional distribution in five other key US cities. Beyond just hotels, our strategic agreement with MGM will also give our members access to more sports, music, culinary and entertainment experiences. We also recently announced our plans of new affordable mid-scale extended stay offering in the U.S. and Canada. Our deep experience and leading position in extended-stay lodging, coupled with the recent trends toward increased work flexibility and longer stay travel, make us very optimistic about our growth potential. While it is still early days, initial interest from the development community has been extraordinary. We are working on several hundred deals and hope to have our first deal signed by the end of this year. In the Caribbean and Latin America, we're very excited about the recent addition of City Express to our brand lineup. These mid-scale properties have started to join our distribution channels, and we are thrilled with the noticeable uplift in conversion rates, ADR and bookings so far. Our development team remains focused on driving conversions, especially multiunit opportunities, and interest from owners remains robust. In the first half of this year, convergence accounted for 21% of our organic room additions, including MGM, and conversions represented 63% of our organic signings through June. The MGM rooms entering our system beginning this fall will boost our rooms distribution in 2023 by 2.4%. With more than half the year behind us, we have refined our full year net rooms growth expectations to 6.4% to 6.7%. Driving valuable global growth is a top company priority, and we are very pleased with the strong rate at which we expect our industry-leading system to grow this year. We look forward to sharing more about many key aspects of our business, including our broad global portfolio of over 30 brands, their exciting growth prospects all over the world, Marriott Bonvoy, the brand that brings it all together, our technology transformation and our multiyear financial model at our Investor Day on September 27. Now I'll hand the call over to Leeny to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail as well as our updated outlook for 2023. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Our strong second quarter results reflected solid demand in ADR growth around the world with Greater China RevPAR more than doubling, international RevPAR rose an impressive 39% over the 2022 second quarter. Occupancy for our international regions reached 68%, a 12 percentage point improvement versus the prior year quarter and ADR increased 14%. RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada grew 6% versus the year ago quarter. Occupancy reached 74%, up 1 percentage point, while ADR increased 4%. While demand from both business and leisure guests remained strong, growth rates are stabilizing as we return to more normalized year-over-year comparisons. Total company's gross fee revenues totaled $1.25 billion, rising 16%, led by meaningful growth in incentive management fees or IMF. IMF totaled $193 million in the quarter, with fees in Greater China up significantly, given the strong recovery in that region. Impressively, our IMF in the first half of 2023 were 19% higher than peak IMF in the first half of 2018. Our owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses grew 24% despite lower termination fees, largely due to improved performance at our owned and leased hotels. Our strong IMF and owned, leased performance demonstrate our operating team's terrific work at driving profitability. Corporate G&A rose to 4%, well-above the rate of top line growth with the strong operating leverage inherent in our business, adjusted EBITDA reached a record $1.2 billion, up an impressive 20% year-over-year. On the development front, we're closely monitoring the financing environment, which remains tight around the world. While the US and Europe are facing the most lending challenges, even in these markets, financing has not come to a standstill. Over the past few months, many owners in these regions have been able to secure financing and begin construction. In most of our other regions, there's much less dependence on debt financing for new deals, so hotel construction generally continues apace. Properties in our industry leading 547, 000 room pipeline that are already under construction continue to move forward. And we've not seen the number of deals leaving the pipeline increase. Global fallout in the quarter was 1.3%, below our historic quarterly average of just over 2%. Now let's talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings release. With the better than expected second quarter results and robust global booking trends, especially internationally, we're raising our full year guidance. While there is still a level of macroeconomic uncertainty, as we look into the third quarter, the consumer is generally holding up well and our forward bookings remain solid. In the US, it now seems more likely that the US economy could have a soft landing. Our updated guidance range assumes relatively steady global economic conditions throughout the remainder of 2023 with continued resilience of travel demand. Growth is expected to remain higher internationally than in the US and Canada, where we're seeing a return to more normal seasonal patterns and year-over-year RevPAR growth is stabilizing. For the full year, we now expect 7% to 9% RevPAR growth in the US and Canada. We're raising our expectation for international RevPAR growth to 28% to 30%, leading to an expected 12% to 14% increase in global RevPAR. Total fees for the full year could rise between 16% and 18% with the non-RevPAR related component increasing 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR related fees are expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We still expect 2023 G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 level. Compared to 2022, full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 18% and 21% and adjusted EPS could rise 25% to 29%. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a large amount of cash. In the first half of this year, our net cash provided by operating activities surpassed $1.5 billion, nearly 50% higher than the same period last year. We've returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through June. With the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast, we now expect to return between $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion to shareholders in 2023. This assumes full year investment spending of $900 million to $1 billion, which includes the $100 million spent on the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. With our major technology transformation, we will also have elevated technology spending this year and over the next few years, though this investment is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. Our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. Thank you for your interest in Marriott, and Tony and I are now happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start off, just on the non-RevPAR related fees. You gave some color on that in the quarter. But I guess what are your expectations for the remainder of the year? And can you just remind us on how those contracts were structured in terms of length of term, is there an opportunity to renegotiate those coming up? Leeny Oberg : Yes. No, we've got several years left on them, Stephen, and are really pleased with the continued growth in the credit card fees, and frankly, really particularly pleased with adding so many new countries. So I think when you look at credit card fees for the year, I think, broadly speaking, a double-digit growth rate is right. Now for total non-RevPAR fees, we've talked about a 4% to 7% growth in non-RevPAR fees because of the lumpiness of things like residential fees. And the reality, as you remember, our timeshare fees are overwhelmingly a flat payment that go up only slightly. So overall, I think we're looking at 4% to 7%. But again, on the credit card side, we continue to see really strong growth. Stephen Grambling : Great. And then as a follow-up, it's unrelated. Just on the technology investment. Obviously, a lot of talk about AI recently across all industries. How are you generally thinking about the tech investment with an eye on positioning yourself towards leveraging these types of new technologies? Tony Capuano : Sure, Stephen, I'll try and take that one. I think, obviously, AI has already incorporated into how we think about running our business. It has been for a while. We continue to look for opportunities to leverage evolving technologies like AI to remove friction for our guests, to create capacity for our associates. But we do it in a way that is mindful, mindful of how rapidly the technology is evolving and mindful of some of the real important considerations around facets of evolving technology like privacy. Stephen Grambling : Great. Thanks so much. Leeny Oberg : Stephen, the only thing I'll add -- Stephen, the only thing I'll add to that is the reality that at the end of the day, we do believe that it is the person-to-person and the experiential part of our business that makes it so unique. So being able to use generational AI in a way that enhances that service, we see as a real benefit, but never to take away from the fundamental people-to-people part of our business. Stephen Grambling : Right. Before during and after the stay. Leeny Oberg : Right. Stephen Grambling : Thank you. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Steve. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning, everyone. Good morning, Tony and Leeny. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Shaun Kelley : So we continue to get a lot of questions from investors on the net unit growth side of the equation, and I appreciate all the color that you gave. So maybe we could just dig in a little further. It looks like at the very high end of the range of what you provided previously, you trimmed that very modestly, excluding sort of the deal with MGM. So could you talk about just that change, and more broadly, what you're seeing in the environment? And then I think the second part of the follow-up would be as we look a little further out, and I don't want to steal too much thunder from the Analyst Day, but what are the preconditions necessary to think that maybe this year could actually be close to the trough. What would have to go right to see, let's call it, core growth ex City Express and ex MGM actually improve in 2024 or beyond? Tony Capuano : Sure. Shaun, let me start and then I'm sure Leeny will chime in. On your first question, you're right, there is a very modest kind of a 20 bps adjustment at the high end to the guidance. We are delighted with the impact of this terrific MGM deal to so meaningfully increase our guidance for net unit growth for 2023. That little tweak at the high end really is reflective of kind of normal ins and outs. On the plus side, we've seen a little lower deletions to the system than we had visibility into a quarter ago. And then we've seen a handful of projects that we still are confident will open, but we've seen the timing of a handful of those openings slip into early 2024. And it's those ins and outs that led to that modest tweak to the high end of the guidance. On your second question, I would suggest to you that last year was probably the bottom of the trough. The numbers we've seen, particularly on the conversion front, are leading strong growth towards that mid-single-digit unit growth that you've become accustomed to in your time covering Marriott. I think in terms of continued improvement. You'll hear a little more of this from Leeny. I think the biggest thing we're hoping for now is continued relief from the constriction we see in the debt markets in the US and Europe for new construction. We're seeing powerful interest on the conversion side. We're seeing no shortage of developer interest or availability of the equity. I think the one impediment we're seeing is it's not an absolute absence of debt, but we're not seeing the free-flowing debt we saw a few quarters ago. Leeny Oberg : So Shaun, the only other thing that I would add is the reality that you've heard us talk more and more about multiunit conversions, which does make things a little bit lumpier on the rooms growth. If you remember, when we added a big slug of all-inclusive rooms a couple of years ago, when you look at the MGM deal that we recently announced, I take your point that M&A would be looked at separately. But I do think on the conversion side, you should continue to see us chasing these lovely multi-unit conversion opportunities that can bounce the numbers around a little bit, but definitely give us confidence in our mid-single-digit net rooms growth number as we look forward. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you very much and congrats on the MGM deal. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Shaun. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jeff -- I'm sorry from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Joe Greff : Good morning, everybody. Leeny Oberg : Hey, Joe. Tony Capuano : Hi, Joe. Joe Greff : I have two questions. One, what's embedded in your full year fee guidance for incentive management fees? It looked like in the 2Q IMF per managed room was up nice 13% over 2019. How does what you have incorporated in full year guidance for IMF, how does that compare on a per-room management basis to 2019, both domestically and internationally? Leeny Oberg : So Joe, we can work through the per room. Obviously, we've got the reality that the system overall is about 11% bigger than it was in 2019. So those comparisons start to be a little bit less meaningful. But to your point about where IMF should be for the full year, I think what you've seen in what we reported today clearly points to the reality that we hope, assuming things continue the way our guidance predicts, is a number of IMF that exceeds our 2019 peak by a good amount. The amount of percentage of hotels earning incentive fees so far is 62% in Q2 versus 72% in 2019. So we're clearly getting much closer. And in Asia Pacific, it's in the mid-80s in both years. So I think it -- as you know, we've got a different structure of IMF in Asia Pacific. And as our growth has been outsized in that region, they have a very positive quality of behaving much more like base fees. So I think you should continue to see strong growth there. In Q2, we were looking at about 41% coming from the US and Canada and 30% coming from Asia Pacific. So we're getting much closer to our 2019 proportion of incentive fees. And again, as we talked about before, when we look for the rest of the year, we do see the reality that we expect IMF to be higher than our peak. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up relates to the -- the MGM deal that you recently announced. Can you talk about broadly the economics and how it works for you? And let's -- I know it kind of works in a couple of ways. What you put in MGM's portfolio and then what you get kind of one-third in the Marriott system as the newer people exporting out to your properties around the world. But let's say, the direct channel is such where you're putting in 5% to 10% of MGM's occupied room nights per year, how much of that indirect annual fees could something like that generate, or can you give us some sort of way of thinking about the fee magnitude? I know, it's probably different than the average franchise and licensing fee per room. But helping us understand the economics there, I think, would be helpful. Tony Capuano : Yes. So it may not surprise you, Joe. We're not going to go into granular detail on the economics of a specific deal. What I can tell you is the structure of the transaction is akin -- much more akin to a traditional franchise deal. We are getting paid on room revenue across their US portfolio of 17 resorts. It's not just some sort of loyalty lockup. It's structured to look a lot more like a franchise agreement. The reason is we talk about it as a strategic licensing agreement. It's more broad than what we had with the Cosmopolitan, which was, in fact, a straight franchise agreement. Here, we've got a much broader ability with the creation of the MGM Collection portfolio to make this a much bigger play for our 186 million Bonvoy members in terms of the ability to give them access to the wealth of content that MGM makes available, to link the 186 million Bonvoy members and the 40 million MGM Rewards members, and as a corollary, to be a loyalty partner with that MGM. So, we've called it a strategic licensing agreement because of some of those complexities. But in terms of the way we've structured the financial arrangements, you should think about it more through the lens of a more traditional franchise agreement structure. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you. Tony Capuano : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Richard Clarke : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just got a question on the remaining occupancy slice you've got to get back. Your occupancy today is still sitting about 4% lower than it was in 2019. How much confidence you can get the rest of that back? And is there any need to cut prices to get that back in? Is there any price elasticity you need to drive to get the remaining bit of occupancy back in the system? Leeny Oberg : So, I'll-- Tony Capuano : Go ahead. Leeny Oberg : No, you go, Tony. Tony Capuano : No, I was just going to say, yes, you're right, Richard. We're still down about three points on a global basis. But we see some real opportunities for growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to see steady recovery on the business transient side, which gives us some optimism. And we continue to see continued recovery on cross-border travel, which gives us another layer of optimism. And then I would say, third, as I mentioned, in Greater China, which is our second largest market, you've still only got about a 40% recovery of cross-border airline capacity. And so in terms of inbound and outbound international travel related to China, we think there's some real opportunity for occupancy recovery there as well. And then, lastly, you've heard us talk about this the last couple of quarters, but we continue to see in the data real legs to this phenomenon of blended trip purpose and we think that's going to continue to drive occupancy, particularly in the days of the week that historically we considered shoulder days. Richard Clarke : Maybe just as a follow-up to that, your kind of composite US and Canada luxury RevPAR down year-on-year in the in the quarter. I mean, how much are you putting that down to the international travel moving overseas from the U.S. or is there some overall price moderation going on within luxury properties there? A \u2013 Leeny Oberg : So I'll jump -- I'll start, Tony, and feel free to jump in. So a couple of things. Certainly, we do attribute it to the reality that a year ago in Q2, there were meaningfully fewer choices for travel. They really were consistent restrictions for going overseas, last airlift, et cetera. And there's clear that when you look at the travel patterns this year that there is a big exodus of Americans going over to Europe and other places in the world. So that certainly had an impact. The other thing I would say is that on luxury in the U.S., we actually saw a strengthening in the metropolitan areas. And they, in general, have a little bit lower RevPAR than some of the resorts. So some of this is a bit of a mix shift. And as you saw, the rate hardly moved in U.S. and Canada in Q2, and that was off of a year last year in Q2 where luxury rates were extraordinary. So just as a reminder, luxury rates have -- in U.S. and Canada have actually outpaced inflation when you compare to '19 and that still is the case while the other segments are coming more and more in line with inflation-adjusted rates as they continue to gain, as you saw ADR up 4% in the second quarter. And as we also said in our prepared remarks, there is a normalization going on. There's definitely a more seasonal pattern to travel, and frankly, a nice sturdy mix of leisure, business transient and group that supports pricing going forward for the industry, we think. Richard Clarke : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just focus on the capital returns for a bit, which had a significant bump, and again, my sense is that this is something you'll discuss in analyst meeting. But can you help us just look out a little bit and assume that the business momentum continues? And maybe just help us calibrate how you think about the growth in that capital return if we can make our own assumptions about where the business would go. A \u2013 Leeny Oberg : Sure. Thanks for the question. You're right, the adjusted EBITDA and strong cash flow kind of move upward in our guidance has given us a view to increase our expected capital returns this year. And just in basic math, the midpoint of our EBITDA moved up approximately roughly $150 million, about half of it outperformance in Q2 and about half of it increased guidance in the back half of the year. And if you just kind of simply take that and lever it, it's pretty straightforward about how you see the increased capital returns. But I do want to go back to our first kind of the most important thing, which is that we first want to invest in our business to grow. And we want to do that in a way that provides returns that are attractive for our shareholders and do it in ways that kind of meet our strategic objectives. So that is always first on the list and then a consideration of how we see the business moving forward. We do have a more diversified earnings stream than we had before. We've got a more global earnings stream than we've had before. We've got strong operating leverage in the business. And so I would expect to continue to see this investing in the growth of our business, including our technology transformation. But then with the remaining cash, excess cash, being able to return it to our shareholders in this mix of a modest dividend and share repurchase. David Katz : Got it. And if I can, as my follow-up, just ask about really the top tier corporate business. I know there was some of this in your prepared remarks. But as we talk through the industry or industry related people, we get a sense that there is a Fortune 100 that's been slower to come back versus the SME that was much, much faster. An update there would be really helpful if there is some movement at the top as well? Tony Capuano : Sure. So your characterization is accurate. The SMEs, which represent about 60% of our business transient segment, they were first fully recovered a quarter ago and their demand continues to be quite robust. The large corporate room nights continue to be recovering a bit more slowly. In Q1, we saw slow and steady recovery, and that continues to be the pace. What we hear from them anecdotally on, from one perspective, they continue to meet a great deal as they hire new staff, as they immerse them in their culture and do training meetings. And we think that's one of the drivers of the strength we're seeing in the group segment. Their international travel has been probably the slowest component of their travel to recover. And so it's a segment that we're monitoring closely, but it is certainly recovering more slowly than the SMEs. Leeny Oberg : The only thing I'll add, David, is that on the special corporate rate, I think it is worth noting that you've heard us talk before that we got nearly double-digit increases in negotiated rate this year. And as we look out to next year, we do -- we're starting to have those conversations and we are looking for an additional meaningful increase next year as well. And while you're right that the classic big four and tech firms are still down in night meaningfully compared to 2019, overall business transient is up compared to 2019 and we are continuing to see some recovery. So we do eventually think that it will get back to levels that we saw in 2019 on the special corporate side eventually. And again, overall business transient is doing well from a revenue perspective. Tony Capuano : Yeah. And Dave, maybe just one clarification and additional comment. On the recovery of the SMEs, we saw them fully recover in Q1 of 2022, not 2023, just to make sure I'm precise. The other thing I will tell you is while the recovery of the large corporates has been not as rapid as what we've seen with the SMEs, we do see strong enough demand even with the large corporates that it is giving us pretty good pricing power. As we talked about a couple of quarters ago, and one of the underpinnings of the rate growth we saw in the quarter was our ability to negotiate high single-digit special corporate rates for 2023. And as we start in earnest to go into corporate rate negotiations for 2024, we have every expectation that we will be emerging from that rate negotiation season, having achieved high single-digit rate negotiated rates for the second straight year. David Katz : Got it. Thank you very much. Tony Capuano : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the loyalty program. And I'm sorry if you've shared this already, but what percent of occupancy came through loyalty members in the quarter. And could you just touch on maybe what you're seeing on direct bookings versus the percentage of bookings coming through OTAs? Leeny Oberg : Yes, sure. So just real quickly, overall, mid-50s for Bonvoy penetration, low 60s for U.S. and Canada. And when you look at -- we are still kind of mid-70s for direct contribution -- direct channel contribution for our bookings, and the OTA is 11% to 12%. So again, fairly stable. The main point is that our -- when you think about the digital channels, they have gained meaningfully more share over the past several years than the OTAs and grown very nicely. And when you look just kind of one last data point for you, when you think about redemptions as a percentage of our total room nights, it's 6%. And digital is mid-30s. Smedes Rose : Okay, okay. Thank you. And then as just last on e, can you talk a little bit more about how you guys are thinking about credit card fee growth. And you mentioned it was up double digit. Is it -- I mean I don't know if you can say it, but is it driven by incremental spending sort of on a same-store basis, or is it more driven by more cards going out there? And maybe how would you think about the sort of longer-term growth rate in that fee stream? Leeny Oberg : Sure. All of the above. You've got great news in terms of adding cardholders. That is obviously a critical component to this, is adding additional cardholders. And we're very pleased with adding additional cardholders. And then obviously, it's the average spend on those existing cardholders. So as you see growth in those two, you get the growth in credit card, but just as importantly, is adding new countries. So when we add South Korea, Japan or China, it really opens up a new market that goes from zero to thousands of cards with growth potential that goes off many years into the future. And we are continuing to add additional countries. So we'll talk more in September about kind of how to think about that in a three-year model. But as I said, for this year, I think you can be looking at them for overall total credit card branding fees to be in about the roughly 10% range. Smedes Rose : Well, I can attest that my kids are helping on the fee growth for you. Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Well, thanks. We appreciate the support. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dori Kesten : Thanks, good morning. Where do you feel that your gap by region or brand type exists today? Leeny Oberg : So I'll start -- I'll start, Tony, and then you jump in. I think you've heard us talk about our entry into the affordable mid-scale space since the acquisition of City Express in CALA and with our conversation about MidX Studios, which is a mid-scale extended stay product that we're very excited about in the US and are having great conversations with owners. And really, we look at that around the world as providing great opportunities for us in addition to growing all of our other brands. I mean I think it's important to note that we think there's lots of room for us to have growth across all segments around the world and our existing brands. But for example, we're excited about what we see as the possibility for a conversion mid-scale brand in EMEA and look forward to some announcements in the back half of the year regarding that. So we'll continue to look to try to meet our customers' needs and expand our distribution in a way that strengthens Bonvoy. Dori Kesten : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Bill Crow : Hey, good morning. Tony, you talked about normalization in the US. We talked about it as well. And the last, I don't know, six weeks or so, we've seen RevPAR in the US plus or minus 1%, maybe up to 2%. Just curious what it is that you can look at and say, the real normalized rate might return more to 3% to 4%? What are the drivers out there to get us off this sub-inflationary growth rate? Tony Capuano : Yes. Good question, Bill. I'd point to a few things and maybe I'll try to answer you going segment by segment. I talked in my prepared remarks about the leisure segment being up in the quarter 10%. One of the things that was really encouraging to me in the leisure segment was that, that 10% improvement was split almost perfectly evenly by both occupancy and rate improvement. We saw a 5% improvement in ADR, which I thought was quite encouraging. Similarly -- and that was a global number. Pivoting to the US, which I think was your question. In the US and Canada, we talked a little bit about group. Some of the pricing power we're seeing in group as evidenced by the revenue pace we're seeing, not only in the back half of 2023, where we're pacing up 11% in revenue, but also where we're seeing in 2024, where we're now pacing up 14%, which is already up 5 points just three months since the last time we talked to you about group pace. And then as you heard from Leeny, when she was asking one of the earlier questions about business transient, you have 6% ADR growth in business transient in the US and Canada, which I think is another data point. When you throw all that in the blender together, all of that gives us some comfort that there is some opportunity. The only thing, I would say to you, and you heard Leeny referenced this, we do expect year-over-year ADR to moderate a bit given some of the comparisons, particularly as we get into year three -- or excuse me, Q3 and Q4 but we do expect ADR to continue to grow through the back half of the year. Bill Crow : Yeah. That's was it for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, good morning and congrats on these results. If we just play back your guidance revisions since the start of the year on international, we know Europe is strong. But how would you rank other international regions in terms of the contribution to that guidance revision? And if you would, it might be early here, but any early thoughts on domestic versus international growth rates into 2024? Tony Capuano : Sure. So let me talk maybe a little bit about China, and then I'll let Leeny do the balance of the tour around the world. I talked in my prepared remarks about how encouraged we are about the recovery in China and the fact that Greater China as a market surpassed pre-pandemic RevPAR in the quarter. And it was able to achieve those results principally on the shoulders of domestic demand given some of the stats that I shared on the relatively modest recovery of international airline capacity. One of the stats that was really encouraging to me, if you look at Q2 RevPAR in Greater China, we were up almost 125% to last year. I think that speaks to the strength and pace of recovery in that market, but it also speaks to the quality of our distribution particularly in the major markets like Beijing and Shanghai. Leeny, you want to maybe talk a little about APAC and EMEA? Leeny Oberg : Sure. And I think a lot of this is just about acceleration of recovery. So if you think about it, it's a little bit hard to predict exactly how airlift is going to go and how cross-border travel and how a country is going to emerge from the pandemic. And so I think the reality is that the recovery in China has come faster than we expected. And cross-border, while it is still meaningfully lower in China than it was pre-COVID, we've got international airlift only at 40% of pre-COVID level. So there's clearly more room to go. There's no doubt that as that country has rebounded. And as the rest of Asia Pacific has also really opened its borders completely, we've seen that all of the travel there has picked up very fast. So when I kind of go back to where at the beginning of the year, where you might have imagined Greater China and Asia Pacific outside of China, they are both up the most. I think the only other comment I would make is that, obviously, Europe this summer has dramatically outperformed expectations. And we continue to see really strong demand in Caribbean and Latin America and Middle East Africa. So international really benefiting from all the cross-border travel. And frankly, from a global economy that has probably been a bit stronger than everyone anticipated at the beginning of the year. Duane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate the detailed response. And maybe just a quick follow-up on MGM, does that effectively franchise agreement cover all of their revenue, or just revenue generated through your channels, through marriott. com, through Bonvoy, et cetera? Thanks for taking the questions. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So... Tony Capuano : Go ahead, Leeny. Leeny Oberg : As you say, we're not going to get into the details of the calculation, but it is based on hotel revenues. So it is not an \u00e0 la carte sort of deal. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. Just circling back to the MGM deal, I guess, it was my understanding that even though it's a great partnership, that MGM would not be paying you franchise fees the way we would normally think about rooms in your pipeline paying 4% to 6% franchise fee. So I don't know if you can just clarify whether they would be paying franchisees the way we would normally think of your franchise fees being? And then my second question is the way the release is written, and I apologize if I'm interpreting this incorrectly, but it sounds like you're counting the MGM rooms in your rooms under construction. And I'm just wondering, is there some reason why you accounted them as new construction versus more of a conversion, if I'm interpreting that correctly? And then also, if I'm interpreting that correctly, your rooms under construction, excluding the MGM rooms, is like 30-something percent of your pipeline, whereas, historically have been in the high 40% range, closer to 50%? And just thinking about rooms like physically under construction as a percent of your pipeline being a bit lower, obviously, there's -- we know what's going on in the macro environment, but it seems like that would have implications for 2024 openings if the rooms under construction are, in fact, that low, if I'm interpreting it correctly from how you're counting MGM in the construction pipeline? Thanks. Tony Capuano : Sure. So I think there's three questions in there, I'll try to hit all three, Robin. On the first one, as Leeny mentioned, while we're not going to disclose the specific deal terms, this is structured very similar to a franchise agreement where we are receiving a royalty fee on rooms revenue. This is not as Leeny termed it, an \u00e0 la carte, where we're only getting paid on fees generated just through our proprietary channels. So I do think you should think about it through the lens of a more traditional franchise fee structure. On your second question, we typically do conversions, pending opening in our system are typically included as rooms under construction because they typically have some measure of property improvement plan, improvements and construction before they come into our system. Even in the case of MGM with extraordinary quality assets, there are, for instance, some life safety improvements and some other physical improvements that are required to those assets before they will be plugged into the system. And that's why they're characterized in that way. And on your third question, I'm doing the math just in my brain so we can do it more precisely for you. But if you take the quarter end pipeline and you back out those numbers or back out the MGM, we would have been a little over 500,000 rooms in the pipeline. And if you back the MGM numbers out of the under construction, we would have been a little over 200,000. So, it would have been 40%-ish under construction versus the 30% that you referenced. And so in terms of implications going forward, I'd reference a response I gave you maybe a quarter ago, which is for, I don't recall the precise number, but 20-some-odd quarters despite really strong openings we've continued consistently to have plus or minus 20,000 rooms under construction globally, which I don't think bodes quite well for our continued recovery to mid-single-digit net unit growth. Robin Farley : Okay. Thanks. And just one quick clarification then. I wasn't counting when you gave rooms in your pipeline at quarter end, just since the MGM deal was announced in July. Are you including MGM in that number? It sounds like you are from the math you just walked us through. I just wanted to clarify. Tony Capuano : In the pipeline, yes, we are in the 547,000, yes. So that would include -- to be more precise, that would include the roughly 37,000 incremental rooms that will come in, not the full 40,000 because the Cosmopolitan is already open and operating in the system as an Autograph as we sit here today. Robin Farley : It's included in your June 30 pipeline, even the-- Leeny Oberg : Yes. The deal was signed before June 30. So, it's appropriate that it was in -- it was not announced until a few weeks ago, but it was signed. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one for me, maybe for Tony. Maybe you could just give us a view into the development backdrop in China as it stands today, just sort of the latest lay of the land in terms of starts and construction progress and any sort of acceleration and sort of how things look on the ground, that would be helpful? Tony Capuano : Sure. Of course. So, maybe I'll sort of go in sequence. We are seeing a very encouraging uptick in the pace of development inquiries, a parallel uptick in the number of signed MOUs and then parallel committee submissions and approvals. As you'll recall from some of our previous conversations, oftentimes, unlike many other markets around the world, new construction hotels often come into our development process when those structures are well under construction as opposed to a US deal where it might come to us as a greenfield site. Many of those under construction buildings had been paused during the pandemic. We have seen parallel encouraging restart of many of those construction projects. So when we think about each of the milestones in the development of a hotel project or the life cycle of a hotel project, we're seeing encouraging uptick at every one of those milestones across Greater China. Brandt Montour : Perfect. Thanks so much. Tony Capuano : You're welcome Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ari Klein with BMO Markets. Please go ahead. Ari Klein : Thank you. Tony, you mentioned the strength of U.S. travel to overseas markets. Maybe can you update us on what you're seeing as far as international visitation into the U.S. and your outlook there and maybe what drives the resurgence? A \u2013 Tony Capuano : Sure. So I'm going to ask Leeny to remind me the exact percentage. But historically, the percentage of inbound international into the U.S. market has historically always been relatively modest, I think, sub-5%, if memory serves. And so as borders open, you're starting to see that recover, but it is not nearly as impactful as outbound U.S. into some of these international markets, as we've talked about in the past. Now the exception to that I will tell you is if you look at a couple of individual cities, Aryeh. And so just to give you a flavor, we were just looking at this the other day, use New York as an example and that may not surprise you a great deal. If you go back to 2019, the international traveler's share of transient room nights in New York in 2019. was 12%. In the second quarter, we actually exceeded that. In the second quarter of this year, 13% of transient room nights in the New York were international inbound. That city really stands out. There's only a handful of other U.S. -- major U.S. cities that are double digits. Washington -- or excuse me, Miami, is 12% in the quarter. It was about 15% back in 2019. San Francisco was 11% back in 2019. It was actually 10% in the second quarter. Hawaii, the state of Hawaii as a destination, was 12% in 2019 and it was actually 10% in the second quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a flavor. Ari Klein : Yes, I appreciate it. And then in the U.S. specifically, on the development pipeline, are you seeing any differences in the ability for owners to finance higher end or bigger project hotels versus the smaller ones that are maybe more selective? A \u2013 Leeny Oberg : So I'll start, and Tony, jump in. So the old saying continues to be true that proven markets, proven brands, proven developers, proven owners always wins out. And that is still the case. So it really depends on the project. I will say that we've seen such great impact from renovated hotels that I think there is the reality that an existing hotel that is not a new development project, that's not kind of not earning money for quite a while, that those are easier to do, especially when they're turning it into a fantastic representation of a particular brand. And I think those are getting done. But I think the reality is that both with the level of interest rates and the loan-to-values that are being required is that it's tougher to make these deals penciled. So they are happening. They're getting done. They're just not getting done at the same pace that they were before. Ari Klein : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Bellisario : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on the MGM deal but focus on group. A couple of parts there. Maybe what's your view on the upside in Vegas for group business at these hotels. Maybe more broadly, how are your sales teams incentivized to put groups into certain hotels? And then presumably, Vegas is going to gain share. Maybe what's your view on the markets that lose share as group rotates into Vegas. Thanks. Tony Capuano : Sure. So maybe I'll try at a high level, and then, Leeny, you might want to be a little more granular. Obviously, we think it's a huge win for our group customers. As you know, Michael, the way we sell group as we look at their multiyear rotational needs and for many of these particularly large groups, Las Vegas is always in their multiyear plan. While we had the ability to offer them the Cosmopolitan, the breadth of offerings we can now make available to them, particularly the largest of those groups that need very significant meeting space, we think we've got a terrific opportunity to keep them within the Marriott Group ecosystem much more effectively. Our sales teams will be collaborating closely, the Marriott and the MGM sales teams, to ensure we capture as much of that demand as possible. In terms of markets that might be impacted by that, most of those groups are rotating through Las Vegas as a destination anyway. And so I don't think we're deeply concerned that groups going there will be at the expense of those destinations. We just think we have a better probability of capturing that Las Vegas rotation within the Marriott ecosystem. Operator : And at this time, this will conclude our Q&A as we are at alloted time. I will turn the call back over to Tony Capuano for closing remarks. Tony Capuano : Great. Well, thank you all for your interest this morning. I wish you safe travels, and we look forward to seeing all of you in Miami this September. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Tony. Tony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie. Thank you all for joining us today. We recorded terrific third quarter results this morning. Global demand for travel has remained strong and worldwide RevPAR of the quarter rose 9% versus 2022. RevPAR increased over 4% in the US and Canada and 22% internationally, driven by significant gains across Asia Pacific. Robust RevPAR growth, combined with nearly 5% year-over-year rooms growth, resulted in adjusted EPS of $2.11, up 25% from 2022. The third quarter tends to see a seasonally higher level of leisure transient travel, which accounted for 45% of global room nights during the quarter, about 4 percentage points above the first half. Globally, demand in this segment was, again, quite strong, with room nights up 7% over the 2022 third quarter, leading to 9% leisure transient revenue growth. In the US and Canada, leisure revenues rose 4% from the year ago quarter, even as many domestic guests traveled to international locations, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific. In the third quarter, leisure room nights from US and Canadian guests traveling outside the region were up nearly 25% over the last year when cross-border travel was still constrained by COVID-related restrictions. Business transient demand accounted for 32% of global room nights in the quarter, while certain industries like technology and finance saw nice sequential improvement in demand during the quarter. The overall growth per segment remained slow and steady, with business transient revenues rising 4% versus 2022 in the US and Canada. Global group room night-share stood at 23% in third quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, group revenues rose 9% globally and 5% in the US and Canada. The performance of group coming out of the pandemic has been remarkable, and the segment is expected to continue to be a meaningful driver of revenue growth going forward. In the US and Canada, fourth quarter 2023 group revenues were pacing up 12% year-over-year at the end of September, leading to full year group revenue pacing up 19%. Of course, we have the most visibility in the group, given the longer booking windows. We're very pleased that as of the end of the third quarter, US and Canada group revenue on the books for 2024 were pacing up 14% versus 2023, driven by a 9% rise in room nights and a 5% increase in average rates. Cross-border travel continued to strengthen, helping drive RevPAR growth in the third quarter. Asia Pacific, again, saw the most meaningful quarterly increase in international visitors, aided by global events like the Women's World Cup and improved airlift. The percent of global room nights from cross-border guests was about 1 percentage point below 2019 levels of approximately 20%. The most upside is still expected to come in Asia Pacific as international airlift to China improves. International airlift in Greater China was roughly 50% of 2019 capacity at the end of the third quarter and is expected to improve to around 60% by the end of the year. Turning to our powerful Bonvoy loyalty program. We remain focused on driving membership and fostering engagement with our 192 million members. Through our multi-year company-wide digital and technology transformation, we are increasingly leveraging the power of our more modern platform to create more seamless, engaging digital experiences for our members. Adoption of our Marriott Bonvoy mobile app, which has become the channel of choice for the majority of our lead members, continues to grow, with third-quarter app downloads increasing 19% versus the same quarter last year. We also continue to drive engagements for our Bonvoy collaborations, including Uber, Eat Around Town and our co-branded credit cards, which are currently in 11 countries. We're very excited about the opportunities our Bonvoy customers will receive from our MGM strategic licensing arrangement, which is now expected to launch in early 2024. As we think about our net rooms growth, full year 2023 growth is now expected to be 4.2% to 4.5%, higher than our previous expectation, excluding the additional 37,000 MGMs. The MGM timing shift does not impact the three-year net rooms growth CAGR of 5% to 5.5% through 2025, that we lay down in our financial model at our September Analyst Day. We are pleased that over the next few years, our net rooms growth is anticipated to be squarely in the mid-single digit range. During the quarter our pipeline reached a new record high of nearly 557,000 rooms, a record even excluding the MGM rooms. Strong interest in conversions continues, including multi-unit opportunities. Conversions represented 20% of signings and nearly 30% of openings in the quarter. As we outlined in our Analyst Day, we are very excited about the global opportunity for mid-scale. We have real momentum with the Citi Express brand in CALA, Four Points Express in Europe, and StudioRes in the US, with terrific interest across the development community. We already have 10 signed letters of intent for City Express in CALA, nine of which are in new countries for the brand, four signed deals for Four Points Express in Turkey and in London. And we're in numerous additional discussions for both brands. And while we just recently issued the franchise disclosure documents for StudioRes, we are already in talks for deals in over 300 markets across the US. We expect there will be shovels in the ground for StudioRes projects in the next few months. As a global company, we are keenly aware that we are living in a time of highly geopolitical tension. We are heartbroken by the devastating loss of so many innocent lives in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by this tragic war, as well as the ongoing war in Ukraine, and we remain hopeful for peace. I will now turn the call over to Lee to discuss our financial results in more detail. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid momentum in our business around the world and came in ahead of our expectations. As Tony noted, worldwide RevPAR grew 9% above the top end of our guidance, led by meaningful gains in Asia Pacific. Global occupancy in the quarter reached 72%, 3 percentage points higher than a year ago, and global ADR continued to rise, growing 4%. Total company gross fee revenues totaled $1.2 billion, in line with our guidance and 13% above the prior year quarter. Fees would have been higher given our RevPAR performance, but for the negative impact of the wildfires in Maui, which primarily affected our IMFs. Total IMFs still grew meaningfully, rising 35% to $143 million in the quarter. International IMFs rose nearly 60% benefiting from another quarter of significant RevPAR increases in Asia Pacific. Our non-RevPAR related franchise fees grew 8% to $208 million, boosted by another strong quarter for our co-brand credit cards, partially offset by lower residential branding fees. Co-brand credit fees rose 11% in the quarter, driven by another quarter of robust global card spend and new card acquisition. Our owned lease and other revenue, net of direct expenses reached $70 million in the quarter, given continued improved performance at our owned and leased hotel. With the operating leverage inherent in our business, adjusted EBITDA rose 16% to $1.14 billion. After another quarter of meaningful share buybacks, diluted adjusted EPS grew 25% year-over-year to $2.11. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a large amount of cash. And our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. In the first nine months of this year, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Over the last seven years, which included two years of no share repurchases as a result of COVID, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 23%, while at the same time investing meaningfully in innovation and growth. Now, let's talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings press release. While there is heightened geopolitical risk and continued macroeconomic uncertainty, the consumer is still generally holding up well and our forward bookings through the end of the year in most regions around the world remain solid. We're raising our full-year RevPAR guidance to incorporate the better than anticipated third quarter results, as well as higher expectations for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher internationally than in the US and Canada, where we've seen a return to more normal seasonal patterns and year-over-year RevPAR growth is stabilizing. We now anticipate fourth quarter RevPAR growth of 3% to 4% in the US and Canada, and 14% to 16% internationally. This would lead to global RevPAR growth of 6% to 7.5% in the fourth quarter and 14% to 15% for the full year. We now expect full year total gross fee revenues could rise 17% to 18% with fourth quarter gross fees benefiting a bit from the higher RevPAR expectation. This is expected to be partially offset by lower expected residential branding fees due to anticipated completion of certain projects slipping into next year, as well as a bit softer results in Israel and surrounding countries. We've started to see some cancellations and softer demand for our five hotels in Israel, as well as for the 27 hotels in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. Fees for these four countries made up less than 1% of total company gross fees in full year 2022. We've not seen a meaningful impact on demand in the rest of the Middle East. We're keeping a close eye on the situation and working closely with our teams from the ground as events unfold. Total non- RevPAR related fees are expected to increase around 5% for the full year, benefiting from credit card fees rising roughly 10%, thanks to robust growth and average spend in the number of cardholders, partially offset by meaningfully lower residential branding fees this year versus our peak levels in 2022. Residential fees are tied to the sales of new units and tend to be lumpy as projects enter sales and closing spaces. Owned, leased and other net is now expected to be around $330 million for the full year, at the low end of our previous guidance range, primarily due to the restructuring of an existing lease on a hotel in New York that recently flipped to franchise. We expect 2023 G&A expenses to be around $935 million at the high end of our prior range, primarily due to higher compensation and legal expenses and to a lesser extent MGM integration costs. Compared to 2022, full-year adjusted EBITDA could increase 19% to 20% and adjusted EPS could rise 27% to 28%. We expect to return between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion to shareholders for the full year 2023. This now assumes full year investment spending of $900 million to $950 million, which includes the $100 million spent on the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. As we've discussed, with our major technology transformation, technology spending will be elevated this year and over the next few years, though this investment is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. As we look into 2024, we continue to be enthusiastic about healthy global lodging demand for our brands and our strong pipeline growth. While we are still in the middle of putting together our property budgets for 2024, we believe the modeled global RevPAR range for 2024 of 3% to 6% we discussed at September Security Analyst Meeting is appropriate. Thank you for your interest in Marriott. Tony and I are now happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Tony or Leeny, just wanted to maybe start with the development side. Obviously, the pipeline number was very strong. It did look like the in-construction number, I think, slipped very modestly quarter-on-quarter. So could you maybe help, first of all, just comment, big picture, Tony, on what you're seeing on the development side, particularly in the US. And then secondarily, just any comments on how we should expect maybe that in-construction portion to evolve just as, again, the development environment kind of levels off here a little bit. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Sure, Sean, I'll try to talk maybe macro and then I might ask Leeny to chime in with some perspective on the financing climate, particularly here in the US and maybe some perspective on Europe, because those tend to be the two markets where our development partners rely most heavily on, conventional debt financing and the markets where we're seeing the most constriction in the availability of financing for new construction. With that said, the ebb and flow of under-construction is both good and bad, right? As hotels open and we had a good quarter of openings. You see under-construction hotels leave the pipeline, because they enter the system that\u2019s opening hotels, and that's good news for us. We have talked over the last couple of quarters about, albeit a steady increase in the number of construction starts, which is good news for us, but that constriction in the debt markets that I talked about, precluding us from getting back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of the pace of new construction starts, particularly here in the US. At the same time, we are encouraged by the continued increase in the pace of conversion activity, both on individual conversions and portfolio conversions. And I think it's that increased pace, coupled with a steady improvement in construction starts that gives us confidence in reaffirming the multi-year net unit growth numbers we shared with you last month during the Security Analyst Conference. And maybe with that, I'll ask Leeny to just give a little more color on the financing environment. Leeny Oberg : Yes, sure. So there is couple of comments overall, Shaun. One is, just a reminder that the under-construction component of our pipeline also very typically includes conversions that may be going through some element of renovation before they open. And so, it's not quite the same as pre-COVID, which had a lower percentage of conversions for the company overall. So, as we've talked about before, we would expect, for example, perhaps roughly 30% of the openings in 2024 to be from conversions, which means, they can be in the pipeline a bit differently than the classic new build timing for being in the pipeline. So I think that the nature of the under construction pipeline could be perhaps a little bit different than pre-COVID. But as Tony was describing, you've clearly got the reality that in Asia Pacific and a number of other markets, there is meaningfully less dependence on the debt markets. And those markets are seeing much more stereotypical signings and progress into rooms under construction. While in the US, what you see is that, there is clearly still an open financing market for strong brands, strong market locations, demonstrated developer success. And in those, we are absolutely continuing to see that the financing is happening and that the rooms are getting under construction. The main difference, I would say is, they're taking a bit longer to actually get under construction. But as we kind of look going forward, the ones that are getting under construction are moving forward and then opening right on time. So as Tony said, overall, we're pleased to see the net rooms growth, for example, that we actually raised a bit for 2023, reflecting continued strong demand for our brands and also rooms getting finished and open, as well as really strong signings going into the pipeline. So overall, we're actually quite pleased on the new rooms front. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. And Joe, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question. Jackie McConagha : Are you on mute, Joe? All right, let's go to the next question. Operator : Yes, we'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Grambling : Hey there, can you hear me? Tony Capuano : Yes, good morning, Stephen. Stephen Grambling : Good morning. I would love if you could put a little bit more meat on the bone for the 2024 RevPAR commentary, specifically if you can give any color on how you are thinking through North America versus other regions? And how these assumptions may impact incentive management fees or other fees in the next year? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Yes, sure. Thanks very much. As I mentioned in my comments, we continue to feel good about the 3% to 6% range that we discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting. It's worth noting, however, Stephen, that we are smack in the middle of the process of building the budgets at the hotel level and moving up. So we're not prepared to give kind of formal guidance at this point. But when we look, broadly speaking, at seeing continued demand for travel, and as we talk about in the US, we would expect that that will remain in this more normalized seasonal patterns that we've now come to see. You've seen our guidance for Q4 being 3% to 4%, which reflects that. But we've got some basic strong fundamentals. Low supply growth for several years, which looks to continue to be the way going into 2024, and that's reflected in our higher percentage of conversions. And we do expect to see another year of strong growth in our special corporate rate on top of very strong growth in that rate in 2023. As we talked about in seeing our group pace, which is up 14%, that's actually got strong both rooms growth, as well as strong rate growth in the US, which does also bode well for continued sustainability in ADR. And I'll probably throw in one extra, which is that, in luxury, you probably remember we talked about that having in Q2, RevPAR was down ever so slightly in our luxury US and Canada properties just down by 1% in Q2, but that actually moved positive again in Q3 and was actually up 2%. So, I put all those together and, of course, this does depend greatly on the overall macroeconomic conditions and we will need to see where that goes. But given what we look at right now, we continue to feel good about the fundamentals. Stephen Grambling : Helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. Given those comments you've made with sort of like a kind of a peak into 2024. I just wanted to ask you about maybe how we should think about capital return? Is it fair to assume that you would try to reach at least level seen in this year and maybe more, given cash flow and the average level still remain below longer-term targets? Leeny Oberg : I think at this stage of the game, since we're really working through all of the budget work and kind of looking at investment spending, et cetera, again, the broad guidelines that we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting remain consistent. You will remember that we talked about an expectation of having the Sheraton Grand Chicago put to Marriott in 2024, which will be a use of cash we would expect at the end of 2024, and that was on top of the investment spending levels that were more normalized. But I think the philosophy, Smedes, remains exactly the same, which is, to say we do like where we are in terms of our credit ratios being at the lower end of our adjusted debt to adjusted [EBITDAR] (ph) and would expect to remain in that territory given the various kind of uncertainties that are out there. But other than that, the basic equation that you have seen us use for quite a number of years, I would expect to be similar, which would then result in substantial amounts of capital being returned to our shareholders. Smedes Rose : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Katz : Good morning, and thank you for taking my question early. I appreciate it. I wanted to ask something a bit more strategic because there's been so much noise around the lower end chain scales and the competitive landscape there, and the competition for conversions, and the launch of new brands, etc, that we've all heard. I'd love to talk about your strategy and where you are focusing more of your resources competitively. And is that just based on the assets that you have, is that strategic thought? Where are you putting more of your attention into your growth? Tony Capuano : Yes, great question. Maybe the way I would answer that is, I like to describe those discussions as ever being binary. We don't look at it and say, let's pivot our focus away from our luxury leadership, for instance, towards focus on midscale. They are not mutually exclusive. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are very excited about the early returns of the focused resources we've put against our entry into mid-scale, the fact that we're already seeing letters of intent signed for Citi Express, even in almost 10 new countries. Then we've got signed deals very early in the launch of Four Points Express. Then we've got hundreds of identified markets for StudioRes, almost as the ink is drying on the FDD here in the US. And so that's extraordinarily exciting for us. But that does not require us to hit the pause button on extending our lead in the very valuable luxury segment. And so, that's a long-winded way of saying our strategy is to continue to strengthen our leadership position in luxury and upper upscale, while expanding our growth potential in a new segment for us, which is midscale. And so, as we roll out midscale, you've got products like City Express, which I think at least initially will be largely new build. I think the same is true for StudioRes. On the other hand you look at a platform like Four Points Express, we think there are extraordinary opportunities to roll out conversions under that platform. And as we mentioned during the analyst presentation, we will continue to look at every market we operate in and determine is there an opportunity for mid-scale? And if so, is it a new build opportunity, a virgin opportunity or both. David Katz : Thank you. Am I permitted to follow up? I would ask about the midscale stuff just to be clear that you're not finding -- you're not finding that you have to do more either in hard and soft cost in order to capture deals there and the competition level is not intensifying meaningfully or noticeably there at all, right? Tony Capuano : No. I mean, obviously it's early, but what I will tell you is, we have a pretty extraordinary group of franchise partners who are brimming with excitement about our entry into this tier. And we're engaged with them on every continent talking about opportunities for midscale. So we don't find ourselves from a deal term perspective or a capital participation perspective doing anything out of the ordinary. David Katz : Perfect. Thank you all so much. Tony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about unit growth next year, and I know you're not giving specific guidance yet. But if we used the CAGR when you thought MGM was going to be in 2023, it kind of implied that each of the next two years would be in the 4% to 5% range. So with MGM kind of shifting into 2024, is it -- would something then in that sort of 6% to 7.5% range, right, just kind of adding MGM into 4% to 5%. Is that the range we should think about for unit growth next year? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So thanks, Robin. As we talked about in our comments and at the Security Analyst Meeting, I think when you've got a deal like MGM or City Express, things can be a little lumpy in terms of the specific year-over-year rooms growth. And so, I do think it's much more important to be looking more broadly at the two to three year CAGR sort of numbers. And there clearly with the 2.4% higher room count as a result of MGM, that's obviously going to help 2024's number a lot. And you saw that our 2023 number came down, although it actually went up apart from MGM compared to a quarter ago. So I think the main thing I would focus on is that, we continue to feel really good about the 5% to 5.5% net rooms growth over the 2022 through 2025 time period. And we will obviously, as we get to full budget details, when we get to February, we'll be more specific. But I think, again, the basic earnings equation and growth model of the company is exactly as we described in September at the Security Analyst Meeting. Robin Farley : Okay. I guess so it sounds like you're saying your expectations for unit growth outside of MGM for next year have not changed, right? Is that the conclusion? Leeny Oberg : Again, as I described, we have talked about continuing to feel very confident about the three-year 5% to 5.5% and are pleased to see the 2023 number move up a quarter of a point compared to a quarter ago. But we are in the middle of that process as we speak and we'll be able to be more specific when we get to February. Robin Farley : Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Richard Clarke : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just firstly on the incentive management fees, it looks like in the North American market, down to just 23%, those look like those are down year-on-year. Is that all down to this [Hawaii] (ph) effect? Maybe you can just clarify exactly what that effect was or is there some other discretion in there about how much you've accrued for the quarter? And if I can add a little follow-up, I just want to know if the MGM delay has had any impact on anything other than the NUG guidance? Has that impact your EBITDA guidance for Q4 as well? Leeny Oberg : You're a little muddied on the actual call. So -- on some of your words. So, let me try to see what I can do with what you asked. On -- let's just talk, broadly speaking on IMFs, which is to say that, overall for the company we are up meaningfully in US And Canada year-to-date Q3, $194 million compared to $167 million -- sorry, to $221 million for the full year in 2022. So I would say we're going to end up higher and meaningfully higher than in 2019. And we were impacted as we talked about from the Maui fires in our IMFs by close to $10 million, which obviously are going to impact our IMF. So when I think about the percentage of hotels that are earning incentive fees in the US and Canada, we had, let's see, year-to-date, US and Canada is 31%, and that compares to year to date in 2022 of 26%. And so I think from that standpoint, we're really pleased with the margin work that's been done in the US and frankly around the world. The only other thing I'll point out is that, IMS for the year at $537 million year-to-date are higher than IMS for the full year in 2022 already, just through three quarters. So again, the margins there I think show really well. Was there a second question? Tony Capuano : Yes. And then Richard, I think on your second question, if I heard it right, the way you ought to think about the brief delay of the integration of MGM is the way you described it, if I can hear you clearly, which is, that's principally an impact on the timing of the NUG impact, the impact on fees, or EBITDA if that was your question, is de minimis. Richard Clarke : That was my question. Thanks very much for clarifying. Tony Capuano : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Chad Beynon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just in terms of the group booking trends, I believe you said 9% for 2024 in terms of the number of rooms. We're still trying to get a sense if some of the current and future bookings are deferred or catch up, or if this is becoming kind of the new norm, kind of the foundational level. So any color in terms of multi-year bookings, maybe into 2025, or if you've been able to kind of crack that code if this is the new base level of group? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : So I'll talk about a couple stats and then Tony may want to add anything kind of from a more broad perspective. Just one thing that's worth noting is that, group is back to being about the same percentage of our business that it was pre-COVID. So very squarely, almost a quarter of the business is related to groups. So I think you are seeing it normalizing there. And the numbers that we've talked about in US and Canada of 14%, that's obviously on a business that is really settled down into more normal seasonal pattern rather than still having lots of revenge travel. I think one of the interesting things is there, while some of the special corporate business has not returned in exactly the same form that it was pre-COVID, I think there is also the reality that companies are recognizing the value of getting together and are doing it in groups, maybe not in quite the same way they were doing some business transient. So, when you look at the overall proportion of the business, it is really leisure and business transient that was swapped a little bit, while group remains quite consistent to the way it was pre-COVID. Tony Capuano : And maybe the only other color I would add, while it doesn't speak to 2025. In my opening remarks I talked about group revenue growth in the quarter both globally and for the US and Canada, and as Leeny and I have been traveling around the world. I mean, one of the things that's really encouraging is this continued forward booking strength we're seeing in group is not simply a US and Canada phenomenon. We're seeing strong group pick up around the world. Chad Beynon : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Bellisario : Thank you. Good morning. I just want to dig into group a little bit more. Could you maybe pull out corporate group meetings and incentive travel? And are you seeing the same strengths there? Is there any change maybe in the booking window that reflects some more of the layoff announcements that we've seen recently more broadly? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : No particular trends of notice relative to kind of your point about more kind of some trends in companies. We do have longer group booking windows overall, which reflect the fact that people are finding that the hotels are full and that they need to get their groups on the books. So that part remains consistent. I would not say that we see any kind of notable difference between leisure group and business group, either kind of in the past several months or frankly over the last several years, there is a steady diet of both of those. Michael Bellisario : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Bill Crow : Good morning. Thanks. Tony, there's a difference between normalization in leisure demand and the consumer weakening? And I guess given your broad scope across price points and globally, where are you seeing the consumer weaken? Tony Capuano : Well, on a macro basis, the consumer continues -- we continue to see fairly consistent strength in the consumer. We've seen a little bit of trade down. We obviously compete across price points. But as Leeny pointed out in response to one of the earlier questions, in the third quarter we saw some strength in rate in the luxury tier, which suggests that maybe that's an ebb and flow as opposed to a multi-quarter trend. We do think there is a value-driven consumer that perhaps we were not capturing before, which is one of the reasons we're so enthusiastic about entering the mid-scale tier for the first time. We think that's a segment of the traveling public that perhaps we had been priced out of capturing fully in the past. But beyond that, we continue to see strength really across the consumer. The one thing that's going to be really interesting to watch, I think, I've mentioned in my opening remarks, there were within a percentage point of getting back to pre-pandemic levels of cross-border travel. And you'll recall, we had lots of good conversations back and forth in 2019 about emerging middle classes in markets around the world and their appetite for cross-border travel, much of the recovery we've seen in international markets has been on the shoulders of domestic demand. And as international airlift recovers, one of the things we're watching closely is how strong is that middle class consumer and how strong has their appetite for cross-border travel recovered. I realize that's a bit of a rambling answer, but I mean, we're watching the strengths of the consumer around the world. And most of what we're seeing is either encouraging or wait and see, and I think wait and see applies to that cross-border question, but the early returns are encouraging. Leeny Oberg : The only thing I would add is that, if this trend around experiences versus goods, which we continue to see a really positive element of demand. So whether it is for music concerts or professional sports games or for youth athletics or all of those pieces of people's lives, that continues to be a great driver of demand for travel and really is quite global. So again, kind of a realization on the part of people that travel is a fundamental part of life and one that is very much appreciated. Tony Capuano : And, Bill, just to build on that point, as we talk to our credit card partners, who obviously have rich consumer spending data, the trend that Leeny just described was much more prevalent in the younger generations pre-pandemic. When you look at current credit card spending data, it appears that that's a trend that really spans generations now, which is obviously great news for our business. Bill Crow : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you. I just wanted to talk a little bit about your expectation for a recovery in large managed corporate. You talked about solid gains in lagging industries in the third quarter. Just curious on how your long-term expectation has changed on large manage? I realize that small and medium has been quite strong, but is a full recovery in large manage still possible at this point? Thank you. Tony Capuano : Yes. So we've had a version of this conversation in the past. It often starts with a question, do you think business travel is permanently impaired? And I'll give you a version of the answer I've given in the past, which is, I absolutely don't think travel is permanently impaired. I just think it's going to look a little different. The small and medium, we've talked about [indiscernible] that has been recovered now for a number of quarters and continues to show strength. There are a number of factors that are impacting some of the big corporates, whether that be concerns they have about macroeconomic conditions, whether that be sustainability goals that they set for themselves. Whatever it might be, it is having some impact on the pace at which their travel volumes recover. But we're seeing offsets to that impact on the strengths that you heard Leeny describe in group. We're also seeing offsets in the amount of blended travel that's driving, for instance, the extraordinary recovery we saw on Sundays and Thursdays. And so, I think that the day of the week looks a little different, the segments look a little different, but the overall volumes are quite encouraging. Conor Cunningham : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Meredith Jensen with HSBC. Meredith Jensen : Good morning. I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit about partnerships like Rappi? And if that kind of collaboration might be a model for additional partnerships that we'll see going forward? And any color you could give to that and how that might compare to others? Thanks. Tony Capuano : Yes, great question. The short answer is I hope so. Bonvoy is such an extraordinarily powerful platform for us, it\u2019s a platform that strengthens the connectivity to our guests, ties together the breadth of our brand portfolio and partnerships like Rappi give us greater stickiness with the platform and allow us to connect more deeply in, in the case of Rappi, in markets like Latin America. They have to make sense for both sides to be obvious, but Bonvoy gives us a terrific opportunity to explore, create, and take advantage of those sorts of partnerships. And so, we will absolutely continue to look for those sorts of opportunities. Meredith Jensen : Great. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. At this time we have no further questions in queue. I'll now turn the call back over to Tony Capuano to close this out. Please go ahead. Tony Capuano : Great. Well, thank you again for all your interest and great questions this morning. We appreciate your continued interest in Marriott and look forward to seeing you on the road. Have a great afternoon. Operator : This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Please also note that our discussion of revenues across different customer segments refer to property level revenues and unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy, ADR, and property level revenue comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels.  Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony. Anthony Capuano : Thank you Jackie and good morning everyone. Our team produced fantastic results in 2023. We continued to experience strong momentum in our business around the world thanks to solid demand for travel and our diverse portfolio of 30 plus leading brands. Full year of global RevPAR rose nearly 15% and net rooms grew 4.7% leading to excellent earnings and cash flow growth.  In the fourth quarter global RevPAR increased over 7% year-over-year driven by roughly equal gains in the ADR and occupancy. Group which comprised of 23% room nights was again the standout customer set. Compared to the year ago quarter Group revenues rose 9% globally and 7% in the U.S. and Canada. And Group is shaping up to have another solid year in 2024. At the end of last year, full year 2024 Group revenues were pacing up nearly 13% globally and 11% in the U.S. and Canada on a year-over-year basis, driven by robust increases in both room nights and ADR. Leisure transient accounted for 44% of global rooms nights in the quarter. This segment has by far grown the fastest coming out of COVID. With global leisure transient revenues in the fourth quarter, nearly 50% above the same quarter in 2019.  Even with this strong growth, demand has remained resilient. Fourth quarter global room nights rose 5% over the year ago quarter, leading to a 6% leisure transient revenue growth worldwide. In the U.S. and Canada, leisure revenues were up 2%. Business transient contributed 33% of global room nights in the fourth quarter. Demand from small and medium-sized corporates remained robust, and while large corporates are still lagging, they continue to post volume increases. Solid gains in ADR drove business transient revenues of 7% globally and 3% in the U.S. and Canada.  Our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program grew to over 196 million members at the end of the year. Member penetration of global room nights reached new highs in the fourth quarter at 69% in the U.S. and Canada and 62% global. Our digital channels and mobile in particular remain key drivers of growth at a lower cost to our owners. Our Marriott Bonvoy app contributed 22% more room nights in 2023 than in the prior year. We are focused on improving the customer experience across all our digital and other booking channels through the multi-year technology transformation we have underway. Enhancing engagement with our members outside of hotel stays through our numerous successful Marriott Bonvoy collaborations, including our co-branded credit cards also remains a priority. Our growing portfolio of 31 credit cards across 11 countries had record global card member acquisitions last year, and card spend for the year grew 11%. On the development front, despite a challenging financing environment in the U.S. and Europe, we signed a record 891 organic management, franchise, and license agreements in 2023, representing approximately 164,000 rooms. Additionally, we ended the year with a new high of roughly 573,000 rooms in our pipeline. We expect another year of strong global signings in 2024 and are already off to an incredible start. We also saw a meaningful acceleration in net rooms growth last year to 4.7%, the highest growth since 2019. Conversions helped again in 2023, accounting for 25% of organic room additions and 40% of organic room signings. For 2024, we anticipate net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6%. This includes around 37,000 rooms from MGM. The first set of these rooms at New York, New York became available on our Marriott channels at the end of January, with the remaining properties expected to be available by the middle of March. While it is very early days, we are incredibly pleased with the initial booking pace. We're excited about adding these amazing properties to our portfolio and enhancing our distribution in Las Vegas and other cities across the U.S.  We remain confident in the three-year net rooms compound annual growth rate we discussed at our investor meeting in September of 5% to 5.5% from year-end 2022 to year-end 2025. As we focus on expanding our lodging offerings for owners, franchisees, and guests, we're making significant progress globally in the high-growth, mid-scale space. We are in numerous deal discussions for Citi Express in the Caribbean and Latin America, or CALA region, and for Four Points Express in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  Here in the U.S. we celebrated the first groundbreaking for StudioRes in Fort Myers, Florida in January and have over 300 additional potential deals under discussion in around 150 markets. As we strive to offer more options for our stakeholders, we're also working on a new U.S. transient mid-scale brand for both new build and conversions. At the other end of the chain scale, our luxury distribution is currently over 50% larger than our next closest competitor and that lead is expanded. In 2023, we have record luxury signings with 58 new deals and we added 29 new luxury hotels to our portfolio. In closing, 2023 was a banner year for Marriott, and I am optimistic about what lies ahead. The demand for all types of travel remains strong, even as the rebound impact from the pandemic has waned. The fundamentals for our industry are outstanding, and we are determined to grow our industry-leading position. We remain focused on offering the best brands and experiences to the most valuable and engaged guests while expanding the broadest and deepest portfolio of global properties and offerings so we can continue to connect people around the world through the power of travel. I want to thank our Marriott teams around the world for their remarkable dedication and excellent work. And now, let me turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. I'll walk you through our strong 2023 financial results. In the fourth quarter, U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased over 3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher ADR. International RevPAR rose 17%, driven by an 8 percentage point gain in occupancy and a 4% rise in ADR. Asia Pacific again experienced the largest year-over-year RevPAR increase. RevPAR rose 81% in Greater China helped by the last quarter of easy comparisons to COVID lockdowns in the year ago quarter and grew 13% in Asia Pacific, excluding China.  Fourth quarter total gross fee revenues grew 10% to 1.24 billion reflecting higher RevPAR, room additions, and strong growth in our co-brand credit card fees. Incentive management fees or IMF rose 17%, reaching 218 million driven by another quarter of significant increases in Asia Pacific. For the full year, gross fees rose 18% with record IMFs that were nearly 20% higher than our prior peak in 2019. Owned lease and other revenue net of direct expenses reached 151 million in the quarter and included substantially higher termination fees, primarily due to 63 million associated with the termination of a development project.  G&A of 330 million was impacted by a $27 million litigation reserve for an international hotel, as well as timing of performance-related compensation, an increase in bad debt expense, and higher professional fees, which included costs associated with our intellectual property restructuring transactions. Fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 10% to nearly 1.2 billion. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was 21% higher than in 2022. Thanks to our team's excellent tax planning efforts that reflect evolving global tax laws, we had a tax benefit of $267 million in the quarter. This was due to over $400 million of favorable discrete items related to international IP restructuring strategies and the release of a tax valuation allowance. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was slightly higher than last year's and above our previous expectations due to jurisdictional mixed shift. At the hotel level, despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation, we maintained profit margins in our U.S. managed hotels in the quarter and for the year compared to both 2022 and 2019, a strong performance. Importantly, our guest surveys indicate that customer satisfaction continues to rise. In December, our intent to recommend score achieved its highest monthly score in over five years. Our asset-light business model once again generated significant cash with almost $3.2 billion of cash provided by operating activities in 2023 of 34% year-over-year. Our loyalty program was a source of cash even after factoring in the final year of reduced payments from the credit card companies resulting from the amendments we entered into in 2020. In 2024, we expect loyalty cash flow to be roughly neutral. Now let's talk more about 2024. Our full year outlook assumes a steady, albeit slower growing, global economy. It also reflects normalized lodging demand in most regions around the world, with Asia Pacific expected to see higher growth in other regions as it continues to have some benefit from COVID recovery, as well as additional international airlift. In 2024, RevPAR growth is expected to be driven by another meaningful increase in group revenue, continued improvement in business transient demand, which will be helped by mid-single-digit special corporate rate increases, and slower but still growing leisure revenues. We're off to a strong start with January RevPAR up 7% globally, reflecting continued strong demand around the world, potentially in international markets. International RevPAR rose 14% and U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased 4% in the month. With year-over-year comparisons easiest in January and Easter shifting from April to March this year, global RevPAR for the first quarter could increase 4% to 5%. For the full year, we anticipate a 3% to 5% rise in global RevPAR. Growth is expected to remain higher in international markets than in the U.S. and Canada, with particular strength in Asia Pacific. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2024 RevPAR versus 2023 could be around 50 million to 60 million of RevPAR related fees. For the full year, gross fees could rise 6% to 8% to 5.1 billion to 5.2 billion with non-RevPAR related fees rising 9% to 10% driven by strong credit card and residential branding fee growth.  Owned, leased, and other revenues net of expenses are expected to total 320 million to 330 million, 17% to 20% lower than 2023 due to meaningfully lower termination fees given the large termination fee in the fourth quarter of 2023, a property we sold last summer, and CALA flipping from owned to managed, and renovations at several owned hotels. We expect 2024 G&A expense could be flat to up 2% year-over-year. There are a few discrete one-time items from 2023 that are expected to offset wage and benefit increases. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 5% and 8% to roughly 4.9 billion to 5 billion. Note that our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be around 25% while we expect our underlying core cash tax rate to remain in the low 20% range.  Guidance details for the full year and first quarter are in the press release. Please note that first quarter results are expected to be impacted by a few items. First, the timing of residential branding fees is expected to result in these non-RevPAR related fees being meaningfully lower in the first quarter but up nicely for the full year. Second, owned lease and other revenue net of expenses will be lower due to the renovations on several owned properties, as well as the CALA property that flipped from owned to managed. And finally, G&A in the year-ago quarter benefited from several one-time items, while this year's first quarter includes MGM integration costs.  Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. We're pleased with the significant value we return to shareholders in 2023 and expect strong capital returns again in 2024 [ph]. For 2024, factoring in the 500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand in Chicago, capital returns to shareholders could be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. Full year investment spending could total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. This includes another year of higher than historical investment in technology, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time.  The $500 million for the Sheraton Grand Chicago consists of $200 million of CAPEX and $300 million elimination of previously reported guarantee liability. Investment spending is also expected to incorporate roughly 200 million for our owned-leased portfolio and includes spending for the renovation and the elegant portfolios in Barbados, and the completion of the W Union Square renovations. We'll look to recycle these assets and sign long term management contracts after renovations are complete. As Tony mentioned, we're also thrilled about our development and growth prospects both inside and outside the U.S. We continue to gain market share with 7% open rooms, and 18% of rooms under construction globally, at the end of last year. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Now we'll take our first question from Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Joseph Greff : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Leeny, I was hoping you can review the MGM transaction and what's included in fee contributions for this year? And then if you can maybe clarify what the integration costs that you refer to in your prepared comments related to the MGM license deal? Leeny Oberg : Yeah, sure. So it's really a modest amount of G&A but it's just worth noting in the year-over-year comparison in Q1, that as we expect all of those hotels to transition on to Marriott systems that will all be done in Q1. When we think about the same contribution, as we've talked about before, Joe, they will be coming on in Q1 and we expect that business to ramp up over the year. And there's not a particular number that I would give you now, but just a reflection that it is related to a percentage of the hotel revenue that fits into our franchise fee model as a result of a license agreement over the year. Joseph Greff : Great. And then I know you gave us some detail in terms of investment spend this year and that Sheraton Chicago is a big chunk of that. Is the 500 million all cash out the door, I know there's the 200 million in CAPEX and 300 million to, I guess satisfy the getting out of that guarantee. Can you provide a little bit more clarity on that? And then [Multiple Speakers] of the billion is sort of aspirational and not spoken for at this point? Leeny Oberg : Yeah, no, no, it's a good clarification question, Joe. That 500 million is cash out the door and we would expect that to occur in Q4 of 2024. But to help you understand what we're really considering capital investment, we wanted to clarify to say that 200 million of the 500 million relates to the purchase of the underlying land on the Sheraton Grand Chicago. And so that is in CAPEX, while the rest reflects a liability that we established on the balance sheets, frankly, years ago as part of the overall transaction. So it does obviously impact our available cash for the year, but it is in there. And when you think about unidentified capital expenditures in that number of the 1 to 1.2, which really is quite modest. Joseph Greff : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good morning everyone. Tony and Leeny, just wondering -- if you could just start with maybe kind of current state of the development environment. Tony, obviously, global interest rates have cooperated a little bit for the hope of developers and just sort of what you're -- probably same thing on the construction cost landscape. So as we sit here today, I know it's only four months or so from your big update at the Analyst Day. But could you just give us latest sense of the land, how some of those conversations went, and what people should expect on the organic side for the first signings and more importantly, probably starting to move into construction? Anthony Capuano : Oh, of course. So, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks on the heels of a record signings year, it's more anecdotal than anything else. But in terms of deal volume through the first month of the year it's really encouraging. And we're seeing strong momentum both on submissions for new build projects around the world as well as continued really encouraging momentum on the conversion side. In terms of the environment coming out of the Alice, I'm going to ramble here a little bit, because I think there are both some positives and negatives that we heard from the owner and franchisee community about their expectations for 2024. On the positive side of the ledger, as you point out, there is a sense that there will be continued relief on the interest rate side as we get in particularly the back half of 2024. There is an expectation maybe in parallel, but the hotel transaction market will start to be a bit more active in the back half of the year as well. And while there is still admittedly some gap in the bid and the ask between sellers and buyers, it feels like that gap is continuing to narrow, which will likely lead we expect to a little more active transaction environment, which has always historically been good news for us on the conversion front.  When you pivot to the more challenging side of the ledger, you do still have lenders thinking about compliance with proposed regulatory environment that will perhaps impact their ability to really open the faucet in terms of the amount of debt to date and debt financing that they make available for new construction. But there again, it's one of the reasons we're so enthusiastic about our entry into midscale. When we talk to our franchise partners on the midscale front, they feel like the size of those commitments is something that they're going to have a decent measure of success in procuring debt.  And then the last thing I would remind you is the obvious debt, while we stayed very focused on the availability of debt and its impact on our growth trajectory, that is largely a U.S., Canada, and Western Europe attribute. When you look at the pace of growth we're seeing across Asia Pacific, across the Middle East, that growth does not seem to be particularly impacted by the ups and downs, the availability of debt.  I think you also had a question about construction costs and so maybe I'll expand my answer a little bit. When we think about potential impediments to growth, the availability of debt is the one that I think we're most focused on. Supply chain issues, which we were talking with you about a year ago, are not nearly as severe as we saw several quarters ago. Construction costs have come down a little bit and they're rising year-over-year at lower rates than we saw a year or two ago. So on that front, I think we're pretty encouraged. But it's really the ability to source debt for new construction is the area that Leeny and the team are most focused on. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open. Smedes Rose : I was just wondering, when we look at the sort of core metrics that you guys provide in terms of EBITDA for the year, unit growth and capital return, all of those at least relative to our forecast, are in line or better and look similar for consensus forecast. But your operating EPS outlook is quite a bit lower than consensus. And I was just wondering if there's any one or two things that you might point to that you think maybe there was a difference in sort of expectation versus what you expect to put up, because it doesn't sound like it's -- like a tax rate issue, maybe there's something else there? Leeny Oberg : Yes. No, thanks Smedes very much. No, I appreciate that. Yes, tax rate is probably the biggest item when you think about it. First of all, just remember that in 2023 there is the reality of this extra termination fee. So when you look at year-over-year growth, that then impacts how you look at 2024 over 2023. And so if you adjust out for the odd balls of both the litigation reserve and the performance, the termination fee, and you take into consideration that we've got probably about a one point higher book tax rate, and I do emphasize it's a book tax rate rather than cash. Our cash tax rate is essentially staying the same, thanks to the great work that the team has done in working through our global tax planning. But when you look at it from a book perspective, it's about a point higher overall. And you put those together and you can do your math there, and that is where you then get to something that looks from an adjusted EPS that looks on 2024 that looks close to double digits. Smedes Rose : Okay, that's helpful. And then I was just wondering, Tony, you just mentioned in your opening remarks that some of the large corporate group bookings continued to lag, which is something we've kind of heard for a while relative to smaller groups. So I was just wondering, could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what you're hearing and maybe expecting as we go forward, do you think that's just kind of impaired for the foreseeable future, or is it something that you think could improve over time, just maybe some more color there? Anthony Capuano : Yes, of course. So really, my comment was that, let me break it down into two buckets. When I talked about business transient, the small and medium sized corporates, the demand coming out of those groups continues to be quite robust. And my comment about large corporates lagging is really sort of in reference to a pre-pandemic environment. But with that said, we continue to see incremental growth even coming out of the large corporates quarter-over-quarter. Leeny Oberg : Just to be clear, that was on the transient side. On the group side, we're actually, as we talked about on the group pace, it's really still a very strong number. And I think to me, one of the interesting things is we're now getting back to some of the way it looked before where 75% of the group that is on -- that is -- that we're expecting in 2024, is already on the books, which if you look at that a year ago, that was only 65%. So it still really points out that, with this 11% pace that we're looking at for 2024 and 12% for 2025 in the U.S., that actually the corporate group as well as the other types of group is still quite strong. Smedes Rose : Great, thank you, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Your line is open. Richard Clarke : Thanks very much for taking my questions. Maybe just one on the SG&A cost. You gave some color on why it was a little bit higher. But just wondering whether you can just do the bridge from the 255 guidance you gave at Q3. What wasn't anticipated there, was it this IP restructuring, and why did that suddenly happen in Q4, and maybe some color on the bad debt, is there anything to read across from that as well? Leeny Oberg : Right. So this is really largely about timing. We've taken you through the litigation reserve. And then there's obviously the usual quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that reflect everything from closing deals and travel expense to, as you probably remember, when we go back to Q1 of 2023, we were still in the process of getting back to being fully staffed, which then ramps up during the year. And then as you know, the performance compensation -- performance-related compensation then takes into consideration how the company is doing against its targets. And you put all those together and the constant analysis of your positions of receivables from all of your hotels around the world and just really reflects some timing of when they fell in Q3 versus Q4. And there again, when you think about looking at next year, you do see that we're talking about flat to up 2%, which really reflects that there were a number of items this year. Richard Clarke : Okay, that makes sense. Maybe if I can just ask a follow-up. Just with the CMD you gave a RevPAR guidance for the two-year stack of 3 to 6, net unit growth guidance of 4 to 5. Obviously, both of those are going to have to accelerate into 2025 to kind of get to the midpoint. Is that what you're anticipating, that there are drivers to get RevPAR and acceleration in 2025? Anthony Capuano : Yes. So Richard, maybe I'll take the NAV question first. As we talked a little bit when we were together in Miami, we continue to think that, as you consider NAV it is less constructive to look at a single year and much more instructive to look at rooms growth over a multiyear period. In some ways, the MGM rooms coming into the system slipping from the back of 2023 into early 2024 is the best illustration of that. Notwithstanding MGM sliding into 2024, as you know, we ended up a little higher than anticipated in 2023 at 4.7% net unit growth. We expect to be at a meaningfully higher number this year because of the impact of the MGM openings. And when we look at the three-year CAGR that we discussed at the security analyst conference, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver that mid-single-digit range of about 5% to 5.5%. Then I think just on a more macro basis, we've not made any major changes in terms of our longer-term outlook. We obviously have a little more visibility and clarity into this year. Now that the teams around the world have gone through all their numbers, but we've really not revisited anything beyond 2024 and continue to be quite confident in what we talked about from a RevPAR perspective. Leeny Oberg : And just a reminder that when we go through the process, a lot of what we're trying to do at the security analyst meeting is to help you understand a range from a modeling perspective, and it's done before we go through the budgeting process. So actually, as you know, we ended up with a really strong year in 2023. And when we look at it overall from a growth in our hotel revenue system, we're right where we would have expected to be and very pleased about the demand that we're seeing both on the arc [ph] and rate side as we look into 2024. Richard Clarke : Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. Thank you very much. Anthony Capuano : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Stephen Grambling : Right, good morning. I know you touched on the introductory remarks, but could you help us bridge the gap from thinking about room growth and RevPAR growth versus the gross management franchise fee growth, I mean, essentially, is this a mismatch that should continue beyond 2025 due to what you see in the pipeline or is it more to do with the MGM contribution and how that may ramp? Leeny Oberg : Yes, definitely not from an MGM perspective. I think as we talked about the fundamental model still actually works very well. We had a couple of anomalies going on in 2023 but when you think about it broadly, the fundamental model of RevPAR plus fees continues to work fine. We've got the reality that, when you think about putting together the RevPAR scenario, you're getting benefit across the Board from the growth in the rooms as well as from IMF. And as you saw, we're talking about really strong continued IMF growth. And then, of course, the reflection that our non-RevPAR fees are expected to grow 9% to 10% in 2024. So I don't expect the fundamental kind of growth and fee algorithm to be different than we've talked about before. Stephen Grambling : Great. And maybe one other quick follow-up to the last question, which was around the Investor Day in September. I guess just very, very big picture, what's changed from then to now as we think about that multiyear algorithm? Leeny Oberg : I would say very little, in terms of the basic equation. I mean, frankly, 2023 ended up being very strong. And if you think about the guidance that we gave, we ended up higher than the high end of what we gave in the Security Analyst Meeting by $6 million. So you are starting off with a higher base. And then again, we're looking, a lot of the numbers that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting were over a three-year time frame, and now we're being able to give you more specificity about 2024. But the fundamental about RevPAR growth plus net rooms growth, some operating leverage, continues to work. One thing I do think is interesting, when you look back at G&A as a percentage of fees, which being a fee-driven business, that is I think, the best relationship given the fluctuations in owned/leased as we sell hotels, and that is you look at 2019, we are in G&A as a percentage of gross fees around close to 25%. And the numbers that we've given you today show that number having dropped down to under 20%, which I think does show you the continued operating leverage that we're getting out of --. Anthony Capuano : And I might just build on that a little bit. And as for those of you that have been covering us for a long time, you know there's a phrase that guides almost everything we do. That phrase being success is never final. And while we are very encouraged by the continued improvement in the G&A ratio, you can rest assured that as a principal focus area for the senior leadership team, with an eye towards continuing to improve that efficiency. Stephen Grambling : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open. Chad Beynon : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question related to the RevPAR guidance, I guess, kind of looking at the chain scales. So based on how you report, I guess, premium, which some of us would consider upper upscale continues to be the strongest in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and that's kind of what we're seeing year-to-date. As you think about, I guess, luxury and upper upscale versus some of the other segments, do you have a view in terms of what will kind of lead 2024 and is there still a lot of room for ADR increases in upper upscale given what you're seeing with group pacing? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So let me comment on a couple of things. First of all, when we think about special corporate rates, you've heard us talk about kind of continued building of that demand. And while it's not back to 2019 levels, it is continuing to at the margin grow a little bit faster. And we had high single-digit growth rate in that segment in 2023, and we're looking at strong mid-single-digit rate growth in that segment in 2024. So that is absolutely -- as you look at that, plus the group strength, which when I think about the group pace of that 11%, I would say, between rooms and ADR, that is probably two thirds, one third rooms and ADR. So you're still seeing some very nice growth there. So clearly, the premium segment is, I think, going to be the biggest beneficiary of that increase in demand. On the select service side, you saw that segment really come out of COVID the fastest and one that has moderated, as you've seen towards the end of this year. We would expect that to be Steady Eddy, but not really get the benefit of some of the things that I just mentioned. And then we continue to expect to see luxury continue to do really well. And so there is opportunity there, both on the rate and OCC side. But I think the two areas I mentioned before are probably the ones to highlight as you think about the tiers. Anthony Capuano : And I might build on that last luxury comment from Leeny. You heard in my opening remarks about the momentum we have in extending our lead and luxury from a footprint perspective. And fourth quarter 2023 versus fourth quarter 2022 on a global basis, we saw luxury RevPAR up 10%. And so we continue to see pretty compelling economics in the luxury segment and are excited about the growth we're seeing in terms of our industry-leading footprint. Chad Beynon : Thank you, appreciate it. And then just a housekeeping, IMF at the end of the year, North American properties, what percentage were payers during the year maybe versus peak? Leeny Oberg : Yes, sure. This work gets a little complicated, but let's do it. And that is in 2023, for the full year would you like quarter or year, which do you prefer? Chad Beynon : Yes, year unless the exit rate is massively different. Leeny Oberg : Yes. So 31% for the full year in U.S. and Canada versus 56%. However, there's really as you remember, there was a big change in our limited service portfolio as a result of the HPT Hotels leaving the system. So full-service hotels in 2023, 40% of our managed full service hotels were earning IMFs in the U.S., 45% at peak, really limited services, the big change of 19% in 2023 versus 66% in 2019. But many of those hotels are no longer in our system. Then when you look at international, it's really overwhelmingly quite similar as to when it was in 2019. So for the entire company, at 2023 68% are earning IMFs, versus 72%. And if you adjust for that limited service portfolio that I discussed, it was 70% in 2019. So we're really getting to quite similar levels. And as I said, international is really overwhelmingly the same as it was in 2019. Chad Beynon : Great, thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is now open. Brandt Montour : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So, maybe for Tony. Just curious in terms of the development momentum going on in the ground in China today, what's sort of baked into the guidance in terms of China openings or maybe you could answer it qualitatively, has that market opening momentum changed now versus three or six months ago? Anthony Capuano : Yes. So we continue to see the momentum on the development side in China that we talked about a quarter or two ago, both in terms of what I would call intake, meaning the volume of MOUs that we're signing, the volume of new deals that we're improving. But just as compelling in terms of driving opening volume, during the pandemic we saw a variety of projects across the pipeline pause construction. And we're seeing the vast majority of those paused projects back under construction moving towards opening. So I think on early pipeline, if you will, approved and signed deals and under construction deals, we see encouraging trends in all three of those categories. Brandt Montour : Okay. That's encouraging. Go ahead. Leeny Oberg : I'd just add one thing that I think kind of helps frame your question, and that is when we look at our overall growth in rooms in Asia Pacific, we're in the high single digits, that we're looking at both in 2023 and 2024, including China and Asia Pacific outside of China. Just really strong demand for our brands across the various scales. Brandt Montour : Okay, thank you for that. And then just as a follow-up also on development, just a longer-term question, sort of thinking about reflecting back on 2023 as a year where capital formation and debt financing was harder to come by and that sort of weighed on U.S. new hotel starts. Is this -- do you think we'll be looking back on 2023 when we get to sort of 2025 or 2026 and be talking about something of an air pocket in terms of new hotel openings because of 2023 or do you think it's not as meaningful and there's other things that will offset, how do you think about that when you do your longer-term planning? Leeny Oberg : Yes. No, I think you make a good point. As Tony talked about in his response to the question about the financing environment, there's no doubt that financing availability for new build construction of hotels is limited. And the strong brands get the most of it, but you've got some uncertainty around bank capital regulations, etcetera. So it is clearly down meaningfully from the kind of pace of new build that was in 2019. I think what you have seen on the goods side is that our conversions as a percentage of room signings has gone up meaningfully, and we look forward to that continuing. But yes, I hope that that is the case and that we're kind of seeing a bit of an air pocket in the U.S. as we talked about, outside the U.S., not as dependent. I will call out Europe, which also has a lot of the same characteristics as the U.S. on the new build construction side. But we are really pleased with what we're seeing on the StudioRes demand side and ability to start getting those shovels in the ground. And so there, we are hopeful that you'll start to see that pace pick up as the construction costs, the demand side continues to be very strong, as well as financing ability improves. Anthony Capuano : And I might just build on that comment about mid-scale. It's -- Leeny and I tend to climb over each other with enthusiasm to talk about mid-scale. We think there's a tremendous market opportunity from a demand perspective. There is a deep appetite from our franchise community. We think the cost of developing mid-scale will help our partners navigate what is still a challenging financing environment. And the other thing that is exciting to us, you'll recall the last number of quarters, in select service broadly, we talked about a lengthening of the construction cycle. Leeny and I were both down in Fort Myers putting a shovel in the ground for the first StudioRes. And our partners there talked about an expectation of opening that hotel in at most 13 months with an eye trying -- towards trying to get it open in 12 months. And so the ability to get mid-scale deals signed, shovels -- financed, shovels in the ground and open more quickly than what we've seen with a lot of other tiers in our portfolio, is another factor in our enthusiasm for our entry into midscale. Brandt Montour : Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Kevin Kopelman : Thank you so much. Given how well the MGM deal is starting off, as you think about your pipeline talks, what's the outlook for other large partnerships akin to the MGM deal going forward? Thanks. Anthony Capuano : Yes. So Leeny and I were both in Las Vegas this past weekend for Super Bowl, and so I'll make a couple of comments. Number one, when you look at the vibrancy of that market, you look at how effectively the city was able to accommodate an event like that. You likely heard the NFL Commissioner talking about how anxious the league is to get back to Las Vegas. I think both of us left the market really enthusiastic about what this partnership is going to offer our guests around the world and our Bonvoy members. In terms of your specific question, as we talked about when we announced the transaction, it is a creative opportunity for us where I think you will continue to see lots of activity for us is in traditional conversions, but in the category of multiunit conversions. You heard us a quarter ago talk about a terrific multiunit conversion in Vietnam with a partner called Vinpearl, and our teams around the world are actively working on a number of multiunit conversions. To the extent, a unique opportunity like MGM presents itself, I think we'll roll up our sleeves and see if we can make sense of it. We're really excited about what MGM does for Bonvoy and if those sorts of opportunities present themselves, we are certainly open to pursuing. Kevin Kopelman : Great, very helpful. Thanks Tony. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Your line is now open. Michael Bellisario : Thanks, good morning everyone. Just on the capital allocation front, been a handful of reports, there's just a few smaller brands for sale, particularly domestically. Are you seeing any more interesting tuck-in M&A opportunities and does the math pencil any better or worse, especially relative to where your stock is trading today? Leeny Oberg : Well, some great questions. And as we have said for a long time, we've been very consistent in our message about really always being willing to entertain the way that we grow. We have grown very successfully, both in terms of tuck-in brand acquisitions as well as growing organic new brands, and growing that way around the world. We will continue to do that. We also are going to stay very price disciplined in terms of looking at both the price that you would be paying for the existing distribution as well as for the growth opportunities. We are really aware of looking at where something could add something unique to our portfolio, whether it is in a certain part of the world, as we did with the City Express deal, that really was a tremendous way for us to enter the mid-scale space in a really attractive market like Mexico, at an absolutely reasonable price. So I think in that regard, you got to look at all the elements. And what's out there, as you know, depends very much all the sellers' expectations of what they're looking for. I would say that, over time, we hope to see that those opportunities continue to be there and that we're going to remain as disciplined as we have before in looking at them. Anthony Capuano : I'll just build on Leeny's comment. I think this historical blend of considering acquisitions where we think they fill an opportunity in our brand architecture or accelerate our growth in a geography where we're not happy with our pace of organic growth, but also looking at the launch of organic platforms, is a strategy that has served us well and a strategy that will continue to guide our thinking about adding new platforms. It's interesting, I was looking at some numbers last night. Autograph, which was a platform in the soft brand space that we launched from scratch, between the open and pipeline, we have more than 400 hotels. And AC by Marriott, which was a platform that we acquired in Spain, that at time of acquisition I think, had 80 or 90 hotels, today between open and pipeline has nearly 400 hotels. And so there are a variety of strategies to add compelling platforms to the portfolio, and we'll continue to look at both. Michael Bellisario : Got it, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on midscale. What's the owner profile there look like, thinking about the mix of existing Marriott franchisees versus new owners, and would you expect that mix to be similar for the new brand? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Yes, very similar. A great mix. Always welcoming new owners into our stable of owners and franchisees. But I would say, when I think about the StudioRes, some of the blend of what we're seeing in terms of the what I call the onesies and twosies where somebody is kind of in a particular market, been very successful and wants to build a hotel there, I would say many of them in the StudioRes space reflect multi-unit expectations on the part of partners of ours who we've been working with for a long time. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Katz : Hi, good morning everyone. Okay, I apologize. I wanted to just drill a little bit deeper into the conversion discussion, if I may. Just looking at the percentage of your pipeline versus what we've seen elsewhere, if you could talk more about where those are coming from, what the strategies are, whether there's any change in the landscape geographies, whether there's a change in pricing, what's new with it, it's been such an important discussion for the past year or so among everyone, including yourselves? Anthony Capuano : Sure. So conversions have always been an important part of our growth story, in a climate where the debt markets for new construction are somewhat constricted, the importance of conversions is elevated. As we talked about in the opening, really compelling numbers in 2023 with 25% of our openings and 40% of our signings in the conversion category. They are coming in terms of type of project, pretty typical of what we've seen over the last number of years. A good mixture of conversions from other brands and with such a compelling stack of soft brands with Luxury Collection, Autograph, and Tribute. Lots of conversions coming from the world of independents as well. From a geographical perspective, not necessarily a shift in strategy, but we are seeing in, for instance, some of the Asia Pacific markets, which historically had been disproportionately new build, we are seeing some uptick in conversion activity. Our pursuit of conversion opportunities is quite deliberate, and it's resulting in deals like the one I mentioned earlier in Vietnam. Operator : We will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Patrick Scholes : Hi, good morning everyone. I want to drill down a little bit on the credit card fees. It looks like you're expecting a big step-up in, if I understand it correctly, a step up in growth rate for 2024 which actually, I think you said 9% to 10%, which if I'm correct, is a little bit lower than the Investor Day of 12%. But specifically with that step up, are you expecting that from primarily new card sign-ups or more so from sort of same user spend? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So first of all, I want to kind of be clear. The difference between the growth rates between 2023 and 2024 I would not expect to be very different across the credit cards. They grew 9% to 10% in 2023, and we would expect them to do fairly similarly in 2024. That is overwhelmingly a function of increase in the number of cardholders. As you've heard us talk about, we've been really successful in adding credit cards in a number of countries. We really expanded that program quite a bit and in some of the markets, I'll point out Japan as an example, we've just seen really wonderful acceptance of the Bonvoy credit card. So in that respect, I'd say the growth that we would expect in those fees comes overwhelmingly from additional -- having additional cardholders. And then overall, a really very small amount related to a typical cardholder spend. Now when I look at overall non-RevPAR fees, I think that's where it gets a little bit interesting, because you were dealing with things like residential where you see residential branding fees tied to when those units open for occupancy. So they're quite lumpy. So as I explained in Q1, we expect them to be meaningfully lower in Q1 than Q1 in 2023, while for the full year, we actually are seeing that business do very well. And we expect year-over-year to see fantastic growth in branding fees overall for the year in 2024 over 2023. So when you look overall at the non-RevPAR fees, we're excited about to see them continue to grow at these roughly double-digit sorts of numbers for another year. Operator : And we will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is now open. Robin Farley : Great, thanks for taking the question. Circling back to the unit growth, and I know you've given a lot of great color around it. Just looking at the kind of two-year CAGR you've given at the Investor Day, excluding MGM when the timing of that wasn't quite known, so it's kind of implying that 2024 and 2025 would be up, excluding MGM, in the kind of 4% to 5% range. And I think the 2024 guide today, ex MGM, is up in the kind of 3% to 4% range. So maybe expecting an acceleration to 5% to 6% growth next year. And just wondering, I know you talked about the likelihood that conversions will be a higher percent of that. You also recently announced a franchise agreement in China that the timing wasn't entirely clear. It was kind of potentially over the next three years it could be adding, I don't know if it would be like 50 basis points a year. I guess I wonder if you could tell us whether that franchising agreement, how much of that you expect to be driving the acceleration next year, just kind of help put some color around the acceleration? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Sure. So let me -- I'm going to do the last question first, and then, at some point, Tony, feel free to jump in to add more color. But let's first talk about Delemex [ph], which we're really excited about our relationship there, where there is a terrific large hospitality company in China, and we're looking forward to having the opportunity to convert a number of hotels. And we actually didn't give a time frame. So it would just be as part of our normal growth in China and as we look at our overall rooms growth, so there's not a particular kind of specific sort of 10, 20, 30, 40 basis points associated with the conversion of a number of those hotels into tributes. We are again really excited about working with them on the opportunity, but it's just part of our overall rooms growth. As I said, the signings that we're seeing in Greater China are very encouraging both in 2023 and as we move into 2024. That's really in addition to what you're talking to about the Delemex [ph] deal and that is where I talked about the rooms growth in Asia in the high single digits, which again is just a great reflection of the desire for our brands. When you ask about the basic CAGR for rooms growth relative to the Security Analyst Meeting that we made in September, I think you really have to kind of go back to what Tony said in his earlier comment, is that these deals can be lumpy, whether it's City Express, whether it's MGM, whether it's a large conversion deal that we do. And so you really need to think about the numbers that we gave that were 5% to 5.5% for the three-year CAGR, which we continue to be really confident and excited about. We ended up a little bit higher on our net rooms growth in 2023 than the 4.2 to 4.5 range that we gave. And that's really a reflection of the steady strong demand for our brands. So that then when we look at the MGM and the continuation of turning these rooms from our pipeline into openings, we actually see it as being essentially the same as where we were back at the SAM [ph]. And then again, you have to kind of be looking at it not solely within the context of one year. Anthony Capuano : And Robin, I think the only other question embedded was about conversion volume. And we mentioned in the open that our openings in 2023 were about 25% conversions. Even if you look at 2024 expected openings ex MGM, we expect some acceleration to about 30% of those openings being conversions. And when you think about 40% of our signings last year being in the conversion category, that's logical. Operator : And we have reached our allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tony for any additional or closing remarks. Anthony Capuano : Well, as always, thank you again for your interest in Marriott. We are coming off a terrific year in 2023. Tremendously enthusiastic about 2024 or what 2024 holds. And we look forward to seeing all of you on the road. Safe travels. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

And now, I will turn the call over to Tony. Anthony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. 2024 is off to a solid start, as Marriott continues to deliver great experiences to travelers around the world. First quarter global RevPAR rose 4.2% with ADR increasing around 3% and occupancy reaching almost 66%, up nearly 100 basis points year-over-year. While overall industry RevPAR growth is normalizing post-COVID, we continue to gain RevPAR index across our portfolio and increase our market share of global hotels. Once again, we saw RevPAR growth across all 3 of our customer segments, Group, leisure transient and business transit. Group, which comprised 24% of global room nights in the first quarter was again the strongest customer segment. Compared to the year ago quarter, Group RevPAR rose 6% globally. Full year 2024 worldwide Group revenues were pacing up 9% year-over-year at the end of the first quarter, with a 5% increase in room nights and a 4% rise in average daily rate. Leisure transient accounted for 42% of worldwide room nights in the quarter. Globally, both leisure demand and ADR growth have remained remarkably resilient, driving leisure RevPAR up 4% year-over-year. Business transient, which contributed the remaining 34% of global room nights in the first quarter, had a 1% increase in RevPAR. We are making great progress on the multiyear digital and technology transformation of our 3 major systems, reservations, property management and loyalty. Through this transformation, we expect to unlock new revenue opportunities, further strengthen our efficient operating model, enhance Marriott Bonvoy and elevate the associate and customer digital experience. We still expect to begin rolling out our new cloud-based systems to properties next year. In the meantime, we're enhancing the digital experiences that matter most to customers, primarily how they shop and both through our channels. We also recently celebrated the 5-year anniversary of Marriott Bonvoy, which added nearly 7 million members during the quarter and had around 203 million members at the end of March. Member penetration of global room nights reached record highs in the first quarter at 70% in the U.S. and Canada and 64% globally. Since its introduction, Marriott Bonvoy has evolved to become a travel and loyalty platform, encompassing a portfolio of more than 30 brands across nearly 8,900 properties and other travel offerings such as Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy and the Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection. Marriott Bonvoy also spans numerous additional collaborations and member benefits, including co-brand credit cards in 11 markets and counting and access to a broad range of unique, curated experiences through Marriott Bonvoy modes, including select Taylor Swift Eras Tour concert performances. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on new ways to enhance the platform and connect with our members in their daily lives and across their traffic churns. We had a very busy first quarter on the development front. We added a record 46,000 net rooms, growing our distribution by 7.1% compared to the end of the first quarter last year. MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy has now launched with 16 properties in Las Vegas and other key U.S. cities now available on our system. While it's still early days, we've been extremely pleased with the initial booking pace and Marriott Bonvoy room contribution, which have both outpaced expectations. While the financing environment in the U.S. and Europe is still challenging, we have strong momentum in global signings after a record 2023 and have tremendous optimism for the full year. Both Greater China and APAC had notable deal production in the first quarter. Year-over-year, our open and pipeline rooms grew 6.7%, excluding the addition of our 17,000 City Express rooms. Conversions, including multiunit opportunities. Continue to be a meaningful driver of growth, representing 30% of global signings in the first quarter. Our new mid-scale brands, City Express by Marriott, Four Points Express and StudioRes are seeing significant developer interest. Earlier this year, we signed our first City Express deal in the region since acquiring the brand and we are in multiple deal discussions for other properties across the CALA region. We have also now opened our first Four Points Express in Turkey and have other properties in the pipeline. We also recently signed our first mid-scale deal in the APAC, a portfolio of more than a dozen hotels that are expected to be added to our system later this year. In the U.S. & Canada, we have commitments for around 140 StudioRes properties and are actively working on deals for over 100 more. Additionally in about a month, we look forward to unveiling details on our next exciting brand launch, a conversion-friendly mid-scale brand in the region. As always, I've spent much of my time this year traveling around the world. It's been a pleasure to visit many of our amazing hotels and speak with our incredible associates. I want to express my gratitude to all of our associates for their continued hard work and dedication. As Leeny will now discuss further as part of her financial review, we are raising our full year 2024 earnings and capital returns guidance on the back of the strength of our diverse global portfolio, the continued resilient and steady demand for travel, our strong international performance and our continued rooms growth. Leeny? Kathleen Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter global RevPAR rose 4.2%. RevPAR in the U.S. & Canada, where demand has normalized, rose 1.5%. Growth in the U.S. & Canada was led by strong Group and large corporate business with our top 100 accounts seeing the most sequential improvement in 8 quarters. Leisure RevPAR was flat in the U.S. & Canada, with more customers going abroad to find warmer weather. Our quarterly RevPAR results in the region was impacted by negative growth in March, due to the timing of Easter, given less business and Group travel that we booked before the holiday. The impact on the month's RevPAR was roughly negative 300 basis points. Of course, we expect a similar favorable impact in April's RevPAR. First quarter international RevPAR increased 11%. Growth was led by a remarkable 16.5% RevPAR gain in APAC, helped by strong macro trends, sustained leisure and business growth and an uptick in cross-border demand especially from Mainland China as international airlift improved. RevPAR and CALA rose nearly 12% in the quarter, with excellent leisure demand coming from the U.S. RevPAR grew 10% in EMEA with strong growth across most of our largest markets. Greater China experienced a 6% increase in RevPAR while growth was strong in January and February, rising 10% for those 2 months. Demand weakened a bit after the Chinese New Year with slower macroeconomic growth and more outbound travel especially from high-income travelers. First quarter total gross fee revenues were above our expectations, rising 7% year-over-year to $1.21 billion. The increase reflects higher RevPAR, rooms growth and 10% higher co-brand credit card fees. [ Global ] card acquisitions grew 18% and card spend rose 10%, driven by significant growth in our international card programs. Incentive management fees, or IMF, rose 4%, reaching $209 million in the first quarter. Significant increases in each of our international regions were offset by a decline in the U.S. & Canada, in part due to lower fees in Mali. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to nearly $1.14 billion. Now let's talk about our outlook for the full year. Our 2024 outlook still assumes continued sturdy travel demand and a continuation of current macroeconomic trends. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 4% to 5% in the second quarter and 3% to 5% for the full year. By customer segment, RevPAR growth is still anticipated to be driven by another year of strong growth in Group revenue, continued improvement in business transient revenues and slower but still growing leisure revenues. RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher in our international markets than in the U.S. & Canada. While our full year global RevPAR guidance is not changing compared to our prior expectations, we now expect higher year-over-year RevPAR growth in APAC, EMEA and CALA and lower RevPAR growth in the U.S. & Canada and Greater China. As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS expectations, primarily due to higher of [indiscernible] from our international regions. In the second quarter, RevPAR grow benefits from Easter timing. Fee growth is expected to be in the 7% to 8% range. Our owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, are anticipated to be lower than the prior year, largely as a result of a few favorable items in the year ago quarter. For the full year, gross fees could now rise 7% to 9% to $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion with non-RevPAR-related fees rising 9% to 10%, driven by strong credit card and residential branding fee growth. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2024 RevPAR versus 2023 could be around $50 million to $60 million of RevPAR related fees. Owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, could now total $335 million to $345 million. We now expect 2024 G&A expense could rise 1% to 3% year-over-year. Recall that there are a few discrete onetime items from 2023 that are expected to offset wage and benefit increases. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to rise between 7% and 9% to roughly $5 billion to $5.1 billion. Our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be just above 25%. 2024 adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $9.31 and $9.65. We still anticipate net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6% for the full year. Additionally, we remain confident in the 3-year net rooms compound annual growth rate we discussed at last year's investor meeting of 5% to 5.5% from year-end '22 to year-end 2025. For more details on second quarter and full year metrics, please see our press release. Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest but rising cash dividend and share repurchases. For 2024, factoring in the $500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago, given our higher adjusted EBITDA expectation, capital returns to shareholders could now be between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion. Full year investment spending is still expected to total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. This includes another year of higher than historical investment in technology, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. As a reminder, the $500 million for the Sheraton Grand Chicago consists of $200 million of CapEx and $300 million elimination of a previously recorded guarantee liability. Investment spending is also expected to incorporate roughly $200 million for our owned lease portfolio. It includes spending for the elegant portfolio in Barbados as well as the renovations for the fabulous W Union Square in Manhattan. We'll ultimately look to recycle these assets and sign long-term management contracts after renovations are complete. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Leeny or Tony, I'd love to dig in actually on China a little bit. I thought the comment in Leeny's prepared remarks about some of the slowdown you're seeing there was incremental. So my questions are two-fold. One, seeing that continue at all into April? If you could give us just kind of a little bit of a real-time feel. And Tony, I'm sure you've probably been over in that region. So maybe if you could help us break it down by, is this in Hong Kong, Macau? Or is this sort of more broadly across some of the cities? And then secondarily, probably as importantly, is any of this translating into what you're seeing on the development front? Kathleen Oberg : So let me answer the latter part first because that's very easy to point out, and that has absolutely no impact on the development front. Matter of fact, as Tony pointed out, we actually had a tremendous quarter of signings in Greater China in the first quarter as well as APAC for that matter. So really excellent continued demand for our brands and from owners there. From Q1 was a little interesting in Greater China, Shaun, a little bit of a tail of each month. And from that standpoint, you've had a really strong domestic demand coming in January and February and with the Chinese New Year, but also reflecting the fact that last year in Q1, for example, Hainan, we're seeing stunning increase in demand, all domestic as they were coming out of COVID. So when you think about it for the full quarter, Hainan actually had a decline in RevPAR year-over-year, although very strong demand. And in Hong Kong and then Macau with much more relaxed restrictions, we had almost 30% increase in RevPAR in Q1. So super strong. The Tier 1 cities were very strong. Classic Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, they did really well. It's really where we saw, interestingly in March, the new Tier 1 cities is where I think you were seeing the impact of the overall macroeconomic picture in China where it wasn't quite as strong as we might have expected. But again, overall, still really strong RevPAR for Greater China at 6%. And again, for the full year, we still expect nice strong RevPAR for Greater China. But yes, a bit of a view that the macroeconomic situation there may mean that RevPAR is a little bit lower than we expected a quarter ago. Anthony Capuano : And Shaun, the only maybe qualitative observation I would share with you, and I'll try to underpin it with one statistic. I was there recently. I was in Shenzhen, I was in Hong Kong, I was in Macau. And while it certainly does not feel as balanced and populated with international visitors as maybe we were accustomed to pre-pandemic world, it felt better than when I was there a year ago. And in fact, if you look at the first quarter, international guest represented about 15% of our room nights in Greater China. That compares to about 28% in the same quarter back in 2019. So it is improving steadily and the availability of airline seats is improving steadily. But I think over time, that represents some additional upside for us as more and more international visitors return to China. Operator : Our next question will come from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : Would love to just clarify a couple of things on the guidance. On the fee increase to the guidance. Is that all IMS? Or is there any change as we think about non-RevPAR-related contributions? And then I would love to just hear some of the moving parts for the increase on the owned and lease side, too. Kathleen Oberg : Yes, sure. Absolutely. So again, I'm going to do one of the last ones first, and that is this does not -- this increase in fees does not reflect an increase in the non-RevPAR-related fees. We still do expect really strong growth as we talked about the 9% to 10% year-over-year in those fees, but not an increase in those from our prior guidance. I would say, Stephen, it's about 75% of the increase is from IMF really overwhelmingly essentially entirely from our international markets. Just to give you a sense. A year ago in the first quarter, international was 58% of our IMFs and this year in the first quarter, it was 64%.  And again, just as an example, in APAC, 90% of our managed hotels paid IMF in the first quarter and in tallow, it was almost 80%. So they both saw some really nice increases. So we clearly outperformed particularly in the IMF space. The remainder of the growth is really a reflection of non RevPAR-related growth fees. For example, when you have in international and hotels, very strong food and beverage sales, et cetera, where we're also getting fees as well as the ramp-up of our fast-growing segments in Asia Pacific. When you think about a new hotel that's [ waking ] up, we're getting nice fee growth there as well. but 75% is really from the IMF and obviously, including the outperformance in Q1. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : Leeny, in your prepared remarks, you went through the 3 main customer segments going through your full year '24 outlook and you talked about leisure seeing slow but still positive RevPAR growth. I think that was on a worldwide global basis, what baked in for U.S. leisure RevPAR growth for the balance of the year? Kathleen Oberg : Well, so generally speaking, we do see leisure relatively speaking, at the lower end of the growth, but still being positive. But I would put it towards the lower end. Group is going to be the home run hitter. Again, for the full year, we do see BT being up as well and continuing to progress. As you know, Joe, in Q1, obviously, BT was weaker because of the month of March. But when we look at it overall for the year, we do expect BT to continue to gain ground. And if I can, I'm going to go back for 1 second and answer Shaun's question on owned lease, which the increase in guidance there is overwhelmingly from a stronger performance in our international owned, leased hotel portfolio. Sorry, Joe, I'm going to hijack your question there to make sure I answer what I was asked before. Anthony Capuano : And I think, Joe, the further answer to your question, the differences we're seeing in leisure in the U.S. & Canada relative to global leisure are broadly reflective of demand patterns we're seeing across segments. If you look at the guidance we're giving, we're not changing our RevPAR guidance, but it's shifting a little bit. We're seeing a little more normalization in the U.S. & Canada but continued increases in strength in the international markets. And I think that applies specifically to your question on the leisure. Joseph Greff : Great. And then, Tony, I think in your prepared comments talking about the MGM licensing deal. I think you used the words, \" We're extremely pleased and outpacing expectations.\" Can you talk a little bit what that specifically means? And maybe kind of throw -- I don't know, if it's adoption measures or share of occupancy? Any kind of details would be helpful. Anthony Capuano : Yes. Not yet, Joe. I mean I think it's so early. We just brought them on the platform. So it's more anecdotal than anything else. My guess is, Bill, and our friends at MGM will talk about it from their perspective as well. But having done these sorts of deals over the years, both parties have expectations about how quickly we'll start to get traction on booking volumes and Bonvoy penetration. And we make some assumptions as we do those deals. And I think it's safe to say from Marriott's perspective, those expectations have been exceeded in the early days. Operator : Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Charles Scholes : I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how 2025 and 2026 group revenue pace is looking. Maybe break that out both by occupancy and ADR. Certainly seeing a very good group business this year, but comps do get harder going forward. And I'm curious if you could give us some color on the future years with that segment? Anthony Capuano : Yes. So Patrick, it's early to start talking about 2026, but I'll try to give you some visibility into a Group pace in 2025. Right now, we're tracking up about 13%, and it is driven by both gains in demand and ADR. We're up about 7% in definite rooms and up about 5% in ADR. Operator : Our next question will come from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : I wanted to talk a little bit about construction activity. Your pipeline went up. It looks like nicely quarter-over-quarter. You back out MGM out of the construction pipeline. And so I guess, Tony, is there a sense that there's been any change in the developer mood with sort of latest notion that the Fed could be on hold for longer? And maybe you could talk through the lens of U.S. starts? Anthony Capuano : Sure. So maybe I'll go follow Leeny's trend of going in reverse order. I'll talk a little bit about the pipeline and then let Leeny provide some insights on both developer sentiment and construction starts. I agree with your observation. I think the trends on the pipeline are really encouraging. And the thing that was really encouraging to me, if you look at the pipeline and just compare Q1 '24 to Q1 '23, because it's a decent apples-to-apples comparison because neither of those would have had  MGM, were up 9% year-over-year on the pipeline. And I think that's reflective of some of the broad trends that Leeny described in her prepared remarks. Kathleen Oberg : And when you think about the kind of the overall environment, I think you've got a couple of things going on. You've still got a constrained lending environment, certainly in the U.S. and Europe. I think at the same time though, there is more confidence in a steadier economic picture, if you will, so that we are, for example, we've seen an increase in construction starts in the U.S. at about 25% compared to a year ago. So really seeing nice pickup as people start to move forward and look at a more positive environment with perhaps not quite as much volatility. And again, as Tony is always quick to remind everyone, this is a long-term business where folks are used to weathering the economic cycles and recognize that if there's a great place to put a hotel with strong demand fundamentals, it's good to get it going, especially with a beautiful new product. So from that perspective, we feel really good. We added 31,000 rooms to our pipeline in the first quarter and really had strong momentum around the world in terms of developer interest across all brands. Brandt Montour : Well, that's super helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe not so quick. Tony, you mentioned that you guys gained RevPAR index. Is there any brands or regions or segments you would highlight where you're taking the most share? Anthony Capuano : Yes. So certainly, I think that the strength of our luxury footprint is an area where we continue to lengthen our [ lead ]. We're pleased with RevPAR Index and the substantial premium that we enjoy really across the portfolio. I think the one maybe caveat I would give you is that as our scale continues to grow, I don't know that RPI is as informative as it might have been a decade or 2 ago. Particularly in a post-Starwood world. We've got many competitive sets now where the bulk of [ asset ] is our own distribution. And so I don't know that it's as relevant, but it's certainly a metric we track, and we're certainly pleased with the continued progress that we make. Kathleen Oberg : The only thing I'll add to it is that as we look over time, we are very pleased to see these RevPAR indices really globally and also generally in the -- within the continent at some of the strongest levels that we've seen over time. So I think it's a great sign of the power of Bonvoy and our brands to see that it's kind of consistently some of the strongest numbers that we've seen over time. Anthony Capuano : And when you look at the regions of the world that are outperforming, I'll use APAC as an example. One of the powerful drivers to the strength of our index in a market like that is our leading footprint. I mean when you look across some of the best-performing markets there, having the industry's largest footprint in markets like India, Japan, South Korea is helping us drive really strong RevPAR performance. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Richard Clarke : Maybe just to start off with, you made a couple of comments about strong outbound travel out of the U.S. and China. How well hedged do you see yourself for that? Do those consumers stay in Marriott hotels when they travel to other cities? Or if that normalizes, does that become in a tailwind for you, if domestic travel begins to pick back up again? Anthony Capuano : Yes, it's a great question. I think the way I would answer it is to point to the comments I made at the outset about the Bonvoy penetration. It is not a coincidence against the backdrop of the environment you described that we set all-time records for Bonvoy penetration, both in the U.S. and globally. And to me, the strength of the loyalty platform, combined with the breadth of our footprint in the international destinations where our guests want to travel, I think does create a tailwind for us. Kathleen Oberg : And the only thing I'll add is kind of the interesting fact that we're really essentially back to where we were in terms of cross-border penetration. And while it may vary a bit here and there, we clearly still got lower cross-border penetration in China. And we've got, in some other areas, a bit higher. I think CALA was particularly high in Q1. In the U.S., it's very steady as she goes, where we've got basically only 5% of the customers in the U.S. are coming from outside the U.S. And that broadly speaking, our global distribution is just tremendously helpful as folks find the places they want to go within our system. But that overall, a lot of the variations really don't drive that big of a change in RevPAR. Richard Clarke : Okay. Great. Maybe just as a follow-up on the loyalty comment there. One of your peers has been making I guess, a bit of noise out the fact that they think they will overtake you in terms of total loyalty members. Is that a relevant metric to you? And is any of that tech investment you're doing looking to engage a higher number of customers overall? Anthony Capuano : Well, without a question, on the long list of loyalty metrics we look at, I think we have enthusiasm about having the industry's largest platform. But from my perspective, it goes much deeper than that. Size is important, of course. Engagement to me is a much more important facet of the program and the work that we are doing to drive that engagement through our large, powerful and growing credit card portfolio through the breadth of experiences that we offer our members, those are the powerful drivers of engagement with our members. Kathleen Oberg : I think the penetration is, obviously, critically important as you look at making sure that you are helping your customers understand the value of the program and of all the options that they have, whether it be going to 141 countries or actually thinking about things like Ritz-Carlton Yacht and things like the Bonvoy moments that Tony talked about. So a number is a number but I think it's -- it can actually not be a true guide for the power of a program. Operator : Our next question comes from Smedes Rhodes with Citi. Bennett Rose : I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the trends you're seeing in the U.S. It sounds like you revised your U.S. expectations down a little bit, and it sounds like that's primarily due to the leisure component, maybe more people going abroad staying with your hotel there. And I get that your worldwide RevPAR outlook hasn't changed. But is there anything else you're seeing in the U.S. that you can share that maybe led you to expect a little bit lower coming out here nationwide for the year? Or is it all just because of what you're seeing on the leisure side? Kathleen Oberg : Yes. No, it's absolutely solely because of what we're seeing on the leisure side. And again, we still do expect to see that it roughly will be up a little for the year, but on the leisure side. But we do view that BT and group are absolutely as strong as we expected. And leisure is still fine. But when you look at the change, which I would say kind of broadly speaking, maybe a point lower in the U.S. than we expected a quarter ago, and maybe a little bit more than one point higher internationally kind of gets us to roughly the same place from a RevPAR picture globally. The other thing I'll point out is as we do expect that our [ tiers ] across the segments in the U.S., we do expect that they will all be up for the year in terms of RevPAR from select service all the way up through luxury. But again, to your point, yes, it was the leisure segment. It was a bit lower. Bennett Rose : Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned in your opening remarks a conversion-friendly brand. Could you just talk a little bit more about that, kind of what are you targeting there? And is that primarily, I guess, for the U.S. or? Anthony Capuano : Sure. No, it's global. And I think while we have a terrific track record of doing conversions across many of the brands in the portfolio, when we find ourselves in an environment like this where conversions are particularly important given some of the challenges in the debt markets. We feel like our transactors are very well armed with brands like the 3 soft brand platforms. So Luxury Collection, Autograph, Tribute. Great examples where they have a level of flexibility, not on quality, but on aesthetic that is particularly appealing to a broad cross-section of the owner and franchisee community. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : Leeny, I think you mentioned that within group, the Fortune 100, you've seen the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth in quite some time. Can you maybe give a little bit additional color in how that maybe compares with the small and medium-sized business customers? And maybe remind us, which typically leads the other within the cycle? Kathleen Oberg : So a couple of things. One reminder that small and medium-sized businesses, that is probably the hardest segment to actually pinpoint all the specifics on the travel. I think you did see in Q1, you did see relatively speaking, slightly lower percentage of small- and medium-sized BT business across the portfolio, showing up in the lower end. On the special corporate on the larger company side, we absolutely continue to see recovery of that business, as you saw, for example, finance. The finance segment is now 8% up relative to 2019. You saw a really strong continued momentum in manufacturing and communications. And actually, while accounting, consulting and technology are still down meaningfully compared to 2019, they also continue to see meaningful momentum into Q1. When you think about the typical trends in a cycle, I think one quarter does not a trend make. We know that the month of March had some real calendar issues. And you also know that January tends to be a little online in terms of being able to determine trends because of the timing of when Christmas and New Year's are. So I think it will take a little time. We aren't expecting a big difference. You may remember that we used to have pre-COVID kind of a 60-40 split between classic negotiated rate versus the small and medium, but it flipped coming out of COVID. And now, I would say we're kind of more towards the 55-45 with the small and medium still being the 55%. But yes, from a relative growth perspective, we did see that it was the special corporate end of things that really grew. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And just for my follow-up, I think non-RevPAR fees, they were up maybe 6% in the quarter. I think you had been talking about them being down and credit card fees in there, I think you also said were up. So within that residence and timeshare and other bucket, was there a shift around in terms of the fees there from 1Q to maybe 2Q? Or is there something else that we should be aware of? Kathleen Oberg : Yes. I think as you're probably familiar that our residential branding fees tend to be quite lumpy. Literally can go from $10 million, one quarter down to $3 million next quarter because as units are sold, we burn those fees. They are onetime fees on the residential sales, branding fees. So if a unit sells out, we get them all at once. So that is purely timing. For the full year perspective, we don't anticipate anything different from what we thought before. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. William Crow : I wanted to follow up on Smedes' question from earlier. And Tony, you talked about normalization in U.S. demand and certainly, we've written the same thing. But industry-wide demand has been flat to down over the past year, which really doesn't seem so much as a normalization as it does a slowdown, especially given the economic growth, which is surprise to the upside. I'm just curious at what point do we start to worry about the consumer and maybe a change in spending patterns. Anthony Capuano : Yes. That's a fair question. I might have a deeper concern if we were reporting to U.S. & Canada, negative RevPAR. The fact that we were up 1.5% in the quarter, even with the holiday timing impact that Leeny described gives me some comfort. And if you kind of tick through the segments, leisure was flat relative to last year's first quarter, but still meaningfully ahead of where we were back in 2019. In response to one of the earlier questions, I shared what I think are really encouraging statistics on the continued strength we're seeing in group. We were talking to the team yesterday that is selling -- doing advanced selling for the Gaylord Pacific project that's under construction, and they are hitting it out of the park. I mean they are seeing extraordinary volumes and demand on the Group side. And then even on business transient, I mean to me, when I think about 1 of Leeny's comments, the fact that the growth in the U.S. & Canada we saw a large corporate business with our top 100 accounts in the most sequential improvement we've seen in the last 8 quarters. I throw all of that in the blender and it does feel a little more like settling into a more normalized pattern versus a really systemic falling off the cliff. Kathleen Oberg : If I can, I'm going to throw in a little bit of a glass half full relative to what I think seems like a little bit of a glass half empty question. And that is when we look at the rest of the year, we are looking both U.S. and international, like gains in both OCC and rate for the full year. We also saw that in the first quarter, you saw through luxury, premium and select, you saw that you had generally rate and OCC gains overall with the exception that in the select, you saw a slight decline in OCC.. But for the full year, we are expecting that we will continue to see growth. So broadly speaking, we still feel like we really benefit from these different types of travel demand. There's no doubt that we appreciate when route strengthens, when leisure quiets down a little bit, and there is overall more normalization of travel types than a couple of years ago. But when we think about the overall demand levels, we feel really good about it. William Crow : That's really helpful. If I could just do a follow-up -- a quick follow-up here. I think there's been a lot of optimism that especially the summer, we'd see the inbound-outbound travel relationship in the United States kind of normalize and that would propel demand. And I'm just curious whether there's been a shift in that thinking at all since you moved on the margin, your RevPAR growth more in favor of international from domestic. Maybe a strong dollar is not helping things. Any thoughts you have there would be helpful. Kathleen Oberg : I honestly couldn't quite hear the question. Anthony Capuano : Yes. I think the question is really just around U.S. travel versus international. I think, Bill, your comment about the continued strength of the dollar is a pretty relevant data point to consider. I was at the -- as you may or may not know, 2024 is the year of U.S.-Japan tourism. There's a big collaboration between the United States and Japan. And I met with the Japanese Ambassador on Monday of this week, and he talked about the extraordinarily strong flow of U.S. visitors to Japan and maybe innocently I asked him, how we can drive strong Japanese visitation to the U.S. And his response was, well, you can weaken the dollar against the yen. So I do think it's a relevant data point. It bodes well for our international distribution. And I think that is reflected in -- while our overall RevPAR guidance hasn't modified, you're seeing meaningfully more strength in the international markets for exactly that reason. Kathleen Oberg : So the only other thing I'll add is that one of the interesting parts is that when you look at Asia Pacific's RevPAR, while some of that benefits from Tony's comment about U.S. traveler, a whole lot of that is the reality that now China is opening up more for cross-border. So you are seeing global travel preferences, not just U.S. travelers. Interestingly, our U.S. proportion of domestic travelers has been remarkably consistent over time, where -- it was, for many years, it was roughly only 5% are from outside the U.S. and that the domestic business is overwhelmingly 95% U.S. traveler, and that is still the case now. So we aren't seeing that the U.S. business is really suffering from everybody leaving the U.S. I think it is more the reality of global growth travel in general. Operator : Our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Tony, one of the last notes that you dropped in was about your forthcoming conversion brand and not to steal any thunder, but if we could borrow a couple of cracks of lightning. And just talk about sort of why, why now? What the sort of philosophical thought processes about sort of bringing that to market would be great. Anthony Capuano : Of course. I think, David, you and I have had the chance to talk in the past about our overarching growth strategy, and that strategy is really guided by this desire to make sure our portfolio offers the right product everywhere our guests want to travel for every trip purpose. And we learn with increasingly fluence -- increasingly frequency, excuse me, that more and more members and prospective members of Bonvoy for certain trip purposes, seek the price point and the value proposition of platforms in the mid-scale tier. The reality is, given the climate for new construction debt in the U.S. having a platform that can easily pivot between both new build and conversion opportunities, the timing seems ideal to launch something in that space. Leeny, I don't know if you want to add. Kathleen Oberg : And the only thing I would add is that a lot of this is both market research and conversations with our owners and franchisees. So when you think about the supply that's out there, where supply is growing and where it is not, we definitely believe that there is some great opportunity for us to add more new Bonvoy members, choices for them across the spectrum. And then frankly, also need owner and franchisee demand for Marriott product that allows for conversions in markets that over time may have moved and changed, et cetera. So we think it's a tremendous opportunity. As you know, StudioRes, which is also a new mid-scale brand for us is overwhelmingly new build, and it's extended stay. And we just think from our conversations that there'll be great demand for us in this space as well. Operator : Our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. When we think about -- I think when investors think about the algorithm for sort of top line growth, it's usually unit growth plus RevPAR growth kind of getting to your top line growth. And this quarter, that would have been the other [ 4 plus 7 ] getting to 11%, but the your top line is more up in the sort of 6% to 7% range. And is there -- anything that you would say how investors should think about that going forward? I know there's sort of different types of rooms unit, unit growth. So is that sort of RevPAR plus unit growth not the way to think about top line? Kathleen Oberg : So a couple of things. I think, first of all, the algorithm absolutely works over time. You've got to be careful about looking quarter-to-quarter or kind of really looking at specifics that are happening in a printed number versus what the trend is over time because absolutely, over time, we believe then it proves out well. And if you think about it this year, our rooms guidance, 5.5% to 5.9% at a midpoint of 4% on RevPAR, and we've talked about gross fee revenues having a high of roughly 9%. I mean these are -- even within the year, pretty close to that algorithm. So we do believe that the algorithm works and really just have to look at it not just one year in isolation. Robin Farley : Okay. And then just a follow-up question on conversions. I don't know what -- I don't know if you broke out the conversion percent outside of the MGM deal. Just sort of looking at the traditional conversions as a percent of total unit growth. I think that your guidance for next year assumes an acceleration in conversions as a percent of unit growth. And is this the brand that you haven't -- that you're going to launch in the mid-scale segment, you mentioned is conversion friendly. Is that, in your mind, what investors should think of as the driver for that acceleration? In conversions in '25 versus '24? Or -- and maybe there are other things that you haven't yet talked about that other brands to come or something. But just wondering if that -- if this upcoming one would be the main driver for that. Kathleen Oberg : So just as a reminder, conversions were roughly 30% of our signings this year in the first quarter, and we've got a very strong stream of conversions moving through the pipeline. So no, while we do see tremendous opportunity there, the kind of numbers that we've talked about and talked about last September did not include, assumed expectations, would be from this new brand on conversions. We said roughly 30% of the room adds ex-MGM would be from conversions, and we continue to believe that, but that's not really a change for us over the last couple of quarters. Operator : Our next question will come from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Two-parter for me on the -- or ahead of the domestic election. I recall last presidential election, there was a little bit of softness in D.C. as people were just kind of out hustling elsewhere. Does that factor into 4Q, should that be meaningful? Or is that meaningless? And then secondly, on that, -- is there anything kind of hinge on the election that you're looking at that could change the outlook in travel based on what you're seeing from the candidates? Anthony Capuano : Yes. Well, we better add another hour to the call to take the second part of your question, I think. Maybe the way I would answer the second part of your question, the -- on a global basis, travel and tourism thrives in relative stability. I think uncertainty around the election creates all sorts of question marks. We'll get through the election and then post results. We hope we'll settle into a little bit more stability. In terms of some of the policy issues that directly impact Marriott and travel more broadly, my sense is we will likely still end up with a bit of division in Congress. So you may not see strong moves one direction or the other. And I'm sorry, your first question was on impact of the election itself in D.C., I think. Kathleen Oberg : Right. And generally speaking, I would say we do see that there is a dip in government travel after Labor Day and that group and business transient, obviously, is going to not be traveling during election week. But our forecast incorporates the experiences that we've seen before in presidential elections. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario : Question on your owned assets. When might we see some of those hotels get sold, especially international? I think [ they come about ] an improved outlook would suggest maybe the market or at least the transaction backdrop is better there. And if not, could you expand on that? And then secondarily, any CapEx plans next year for the  Sheraton in Chicago? Or should we expect a big year-over-year step down in owned CapEx? Kathleen Oberg : Right. So I'm going to do the second one first, which is that the Sheraton Grand Chicago it actually has had a rooms redo over the past 3 years. And so with the exception of, of course, what you normally need to do, I would not expect to see big CapEx spend beyond the norm as you move into 2025 on that hotel. We will be working on a comprehensive view of that hotel or public space, for F&B, for the rooms, et cetera. And ideally, we'd be working with the partner so that you can really in essence, do it together so that it wouldn't be on Marriott's balance sheet, but that we would sell the hotel and then work towards what the hotel should look like with a partner. As you talk about the other owned leased assets, as is often the case with the ones that are still on our balance sheet, each one has a bit of a story. And so for the ones that are in Caribbean Latin America, for example, the elegant portfolio, which we are midway through a very comprehensive capital improvement program. We're thrilled with what is coming out of that and look forward to recycling that capital when it's done with a view of how we think about the AI, the all-inclusive product for those hotels. So continue to march along. The W Union Square, we're very close to being finished with that renovation. Again, absolutely thrilled with the product. I encourage all of you to go by and for sure, make sure you stop by the living room, which has a spectacular bar. The rooms are incredible, and we're very excited about how that represents the W brand in North America. And so yes, from that standpoint, before too long, we'll be beginning to work on the process of determining when and at what price is the right time for the sale of that asset. All of the rest are in that same ballpark. Clearly as there appears -- starts to appear to be a bit more of a stable view about where interest rates are going, I think we do expect that, that will help free up the transaction market a bit. I think it's a little too soon to predict the timing of it, but we are, of course, hopeful that as we get into the back half of the year, you see -- start to see a bit more clarity around exactly what the next couple of years are looking like clearly, and there's a view that interest rates are likely to stay a bit higher a bit longer. And from that perspective, stability of outlook is always very hopeful when you're looking at asset sales as well as the markets that those assets are in. Operator : Our last question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Saving the best for last. I like it. Just wanted to follow up on the SMB commentary at the lower-end chain scales. I know it's a much smaller percentage of your mix. But can we think about maybe the drivers or any industries that may stick out if we want to call it, drive to business travel? Maybe less goods transportation, maybe less disaster relief in some markets? I know it's harder to analyze these trends because in many cases, they book direct. But wonder if you had any industry commentary on the lower-end SMB trends. Anthony Capuano : Yes. I think it's a little hard to look at maybe individual industries. Probably the one demand source we're keeping a close eye on is government-related business, which in that tier, is quite relevant. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Tony Capuano for closing remarks. Anthony Capuano : Great. Well, thank you again for your participation and interest. We all hope to see you on the road soon. Safe travels. Operator : This does conclude the Marriott International Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your line, and have a wonderful day.",

We delivered another strong quarter as travel demand remained robust in most markets around the world. And our net rooms grew by 6% year-over-year. Second quarter global RevPAR rose nearly 5%. Average daily rate increased around 3% and occupancy reached 73%, up about 150 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. RevPAR rose nearly 4% in the US and Canada, benefiting from the shift of the Easter holiday. All chain scales in the US and Canada, from select service to luxury, posted positive second quarter year-over-year RevPAR. RevPAR increased over 7% internationally, led by a remarkable 13% RevPAR gain in Asia Pacific excluding China or APEC. APEC benefited from strong macro trends and increased cross-border travel, especially from Mainland China. Growth in APEC was broad-based but particularly robust in Japan where RevPAR rose 21%. RevPAR grew nearly 10% in the EMEA region with continued strong regional and cross-border demand and about 9% in the CALA region. To date in 2024, the City Express portfolio has meaningfully outperformed the overall Mexican market as well as our own internal RevPAR expectation, and Bonvoy penetration of the hotels continues to improve steadily. RevPAR in Greater China declined roughly 4% in the quarter, as macroeconomic pressures led to softer domestic demand. The region was also impacted by an increase in outbound high-end travelers. Positive RevPAR growth in Tier 1 cities, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan was more than offset by declines in all other markets, with Hainan seeing a meaningful RevPAR decline. Despite the adverse market conditions, we outperformed our peers and gained RevPAR index across the region in the second quarter. Our global RevPAR index, which is at a substantial premium, also rose again in the quarter. As we look ahead to the full year, we are narrowing our global RevPAR range to 3% to 4% growth, largely due to anticipated continued weakness in Greater China, as Leeny will discuss in more detail. On a global basis, in the second quarter, we saw RevPAR growth across all three of our customer segments, group, leisure transient, and business transient, with each segment experiencing increases in both room nights and average daily rate. Group, which comprised 24% of worldwide room nights in the quarter, remained the strongest customer segment. Compared to the year-ago quarter, group RevPAR rose 10% globally. Full-year 2024 worldwide group revenues were still pacing up 9% year-over-year at the end of the second quarter, with a 5% increase in room nights and a 4% rise in ADR. Business transient, which contributed 33% of global room nights in the quarter, saw a 4% increase in RevPAR. Leisure transient, which accounted for 43% of worldwide room nights in the quarter, posted a 2% rise in RevPAR. Within the business transient segment, demand from small and medium sized corporates, which now account for nearly 55% of business transient room nights, has grown significantly over the last few years. Earlier this month we announced Business Access by Marriott Bonvoy, a new comprehensive online booking travel program that we launched to ease and expand the booking experience and travel management process for these customers. While it is still early days, this new offering is already seeing great interest, and we're extremely pleased with the initial account signups and users of the platform, both of which have outpaced expectations. We continue to enhance our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, which had over 210 million members at the end of June. We continue to see real success driving enrollments and engagement internationally, in part due to our Bonvoy partnerships with Rakuten in Japan, Alibaba in China, and Rappi in CALA. Member penetration of global room nights rose again, reaching new record highs in the second quarter at 71% in the US and Canada, and 65% globally. Our new collaboration with Starbucks is the latest example of how we're connecting our members with people, places, and passions that they truly love. We also remain laser focused on providing our guests with excellent experiences in our hotels and are pleased with our intent to recommend sports which have continued to steadily rise. Our leading global portfolio continues to grow meaningfully faster than overall industry supply and we added approximately 15,500 net rooms to end the quarter with nearly 1.66 million rooms. Global signing activity has remained strong. Record signings in APEC and Greater China for the first half of the year helped grow our pipeline to over 559,000 rooms around the world. Conversions, including multi-unit opportunities, remain a significant driver of growth as owners continue to value the depth and breadth of our brand portfolio and our powerful revenue engines. In the second quarter, conversions represented 37% of openings and 32% of signings. This conversion activity has been broad based with hotels converting into 23 different Marriott brands over the last 12 months. While still below 2019 levels, we're also pleased with the continued upward trend in monthly construction starts. In the second quarter, construction starts in the US and Canada rose 40% year-over-year. In June, we signed three marquee luxury conversion deals in the US. The renowned, The Resort at Pelican Hill in Newport Beach, California, and The Luxury Collection Hotel Manhattan Midtown have already joined our system. The iconic Turtle Bay Resort in Hawaii is joining the Ritz-Carlton brand today. We are thrilled to welcome these incredible properties as we further extend our global leading position in the high value luxury segment. Our momentum in the mid-scale space is excellent. Developers are showing significant interest in our new brands in the tier. City Express by Marriott, Four Points Express by Sheraton, StudioRes, and our latest transient conversion friendly brand in the US. In CALA, we continue to sign deals for City Express and are engaged in numerous discussions across the region. Our first Four Points Express opened in Turkey and over a dozen hotels from our recent multi-unit conversion deal in APEC are expected to join our system later this year. We're also in talks for StudioRes hotels in over 300 markets and we continue to execute on and pursue numerous types of opportunities, from large development deals to one-off projects. Before I turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the hard work they do each and every day to advance our business and help connect people through the power of travel. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Second quarter gross fee revenues rose 7% year-over-year to $1.34 billion. The increase reflects stronger global RevPAR, rooms growth, and a higher non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Co-branded credit card fees rose 10%, and residential branding fees were significantly higher than in the same quarter last year, as we continue to benefit from our top position in branded residences globally. Incentive management fees, or IMFs, totaled $195 million in the second quarter. Growth in these fees was led by mid-teens percentage increases in APEC and EMEA, partially offset by an $8 million decline in Greater China. IMFs in the US and Canada were flat year-over-year, in part impacted by continued softness in Hawaii. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 9% to $1.32 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 11% to $2.50. Now, let's talk about our outlook for 2024. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 3% to 4% in the third quarter and for the full year. RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher in the vast majority of our international markets than in the US and Canada. The primary change in our four-year outlook is Greater China's updated expectation of negative RevPAR growth for the rest of the year. We expect a continuation of current weak demand and pricing trends in the region, with the third quarter anticipated to see the most meaningful RevPAR decline as outbound travel accelerates during summer holidays. Note that given Greater China's lower overall average RevPAR compared to the rest of our system, it typically makes up around 7% of RevPAR-related fees, although it accounts for 10% of open rooms. While we also expect marginally lower full-year RevPAR in the US and Canada than we had previously anticipated, in part due to less group business the first two weeks of November, given the intense focus on the US presidential election, overall RevPAR trends in the US and Canada in the back half of the year are expected to remain relatively steady with the first six months of the year. On customer segment, worldwide RevPAR growth is still anticipated to be driven by another year of strong growth in group revenue, continued improvement in business transient revenues, and slower but still growing leisure revenues. In the third quarter, gross fee growth is expected to be in the 6% to 8% range. Our owned lease and other revenues net of expenses are anticipated to be roughly $75 million. For the full year, gross fees could rise 6% to 7% to $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Compared to last quarter's expectations, roughly two-thirds of the reductions is from IMFs, largely from Greater China and select markets in the US and Canada like Hawaii and Washington, DC. There's also additional negative currency impact from a still strong dollar, as well as well as slightly lower than previously expected non-RevPAR related franchise fees, and the timing of hotel openings. Owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, could now total $345 million to $350 million. We now expect full year G&A expense could rise just 1% to 2% year-over-year. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to rise between 6% and 8% to roughly $4.95 billion to $5 billion. Our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be just above 25%. 2024 adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $9.23 and $9.40. As Tony mentioned, we're very pleased with the robust signings and openings activity across our global portfolio, demonstrating owners and franchisees continued confidence in our brand's performance. We're focused on driving strong growth and still expect full-year net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6%. Full-year investment spending is still expected to total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. As you'll recall, this spending includes higher than historical investment in technology associated with the multi-year transformation of our property management, reservations, and loyalty systems, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. We look forward to the many benefits expected to accrue from elevating our three major tech platforms. Our investment spending outlook also incorporates roughly $200 million for our owned lease portfolio, including renovation spending for the W Union Square in Manhattan and the Elegant portfolio in Barbados. When all renovations are complete, we'll ultimately look to recycle these assets and sign long-term management contracts for these properties. Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase and a modest dividend, which has risen meaningfully over time. We continue to generate strong levels of cash, including from our loyalty program, and our leverage ratio remains at the low end of our target range of 3 times to 3.5 times debt to EBITDA. We currently expect approximately $4.3 billion of capital returns to shareholders for the full year. This factors in the $500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago. In closing, we have a lot of momentum in our business and strong growth prospects across our over 30 brands around the world, thanks to our terrific team. As we look ahead, we're incredibly optimistic about Marriott's future. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess on the guidance in the second half, it looks like you kind of lowered overall RevPAR by about 50 basis points, the reduction in EBITDA about 2%. I realize that a lot of that looks like it's incentive management fee related, but is that the appropriate kind of operating leverage to consider going forward? And what levers do you have to pull if you were to see the backdrop deteriorate further and try to take additional action? Leeny Oberg : Sure. Thanks, Stephen. So a couple of things in that question. One is the reality that when we typically talk about 1 point of RevPAR being $50 million to $60 million in fees, that's assuming that that's equally across all markets around the world and doesn't have any FX impact. And so I think you are clearly seeing with the drop that we talked today that the impact of the change in our outlook for Greater China has a disproportionate impact. When I think about Greater China's mix between base fees and IMFs, it's obviously quite different than it is in the US where you have an owner's priority return. So for 1 point of RevPAR in Greater China, that is typically something more like $3 [million] (ph) in fees, which is going to be more heavily weighted towards IMFs than it would be in the US where it would have a dramatically smaller impact. So I think we really have to look at the geography rather than necessarily just thinking about it as being a half point overall because it is overwhelmingly related to Greater China with just a slight, truly a tad bit lower expectation in the US and Canada. Stephen Grambling : Got it. That's helpful. Maybe one kind of unrelated, could be related follow-up is just there was always in these questions around fees per room and how the NUG plus RevPAR translates to overall fees. There's a lot of puts and takes in the quarter, but has anything changed in your thought processes as we look at the longer term algorithm, as we think about that fees being related to net unit growth plus RevPAR? Leeny Oberg : Yeah, no, we think you're absolutely right. We believe the algorithm absolutely holds up over time. You do have, as you described, the impact of certain elements changing unevenly. So in this particular situation, it is one market having a potentially large change in expected RevPAR for the rest of the year. But we've talked before about our expectation of fees per key as actually rising over time, especially as we think about also having our rapidly growing non-RevPAR fees. So we're very pleased with those continuing trends and do not believe that the fundamental algorithm is any different. Stephen Grambling : Great, thank you. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Leeny Oberg : Hey, Shaun. Shaun Kelley : Hi, Leeny. Just wanted to start with the RevPAR guidance. So if we kind of take the pieces here, obviously we know where we came in the first half of the year and you've given us color on Q3. I believe in the prepared remarks you said Q3 would be the weakest point for China, but when we kind of do the pieces, I think Q4, the implied guidance is below Q3. So what's driving that sort of weaker Q4? Is it group timing? Is it some other shift?Leeny, you mentioned the election, but I think you also said US is pretty stable. So kind of what's driving? Check the math, but if the math is right, what's driving the weaker Q4? Is there anything in that Q4 run rate anybody needs to be concerned about or aware of? Leeny Oberg : Yeah, thank you, Shaun, and you're right. We can point out that kind of an interesting distinction there between Q3 and Q4. With China only being roughly 10% of our rooms, that impact of the lowest quarter in the back half of the year being Q3 doesn't have that much of an impact on Q4. What's going on on Q4 is as we described that we are seeing a bit lower group bookings specifically in Q4 around the election, which is having an impact on the expectations for US and Canada in Q4 versus Q3, though as we described when we look at the entire back half of the year, we do expect to see really a similar sort of RevPAR growth number as you see in the first half of the year. And then on top of that, you've got your other international markets just continuing to normalize. So when I look at the first half of APEC and EMEA and CALA, I would expect that their back half is a little bit lower. And so in that regard, as you move towards Q4, you continue to see additional normalization, although still quite strong RevPAR in those markets. And you put all that together and that's where you get the bit lower outlook for RevPAR in Q4 than Q3. Tony Capuano : And maybe just to add a little more context to that, Shaun, the -- obviously we knew there was an election this year and baked what we've seen as historical softness. But when you look back over prior election cycles, we tended to see a little bit of group softness the week of election. Given for the unique attributes of this election cycle, we're seeing that bleed into the week after the election as well. So it's from a group perspective, about half of November is feeling the impact on the group side. Shaun Kelley : Great, thanks. And just as my follow-up just to kind of hit on China specifically, obviously I think you gave us a little bit of the heads-up that this was softening last quarter. The real question, though, I expect we'll get some, is this bleeding it all into the development side, right? The signings and the development side was a highlight for the quarter broadly, but what do you think on the ground there, and is that softness at all starting to impact developer conversations or signing conversations in Greater China? Tony Capuano : It's a great question and it's sort of an interesting riddle. As you heard in my prepared remarks, we had record signings in the first half of the year in China. I think it's really about the long-term prospects in China. Our owner community, certainly the SOEs there, continue to believe in the long-term dynamics of travel, and continue to both sign and start constructing them. So we really have seen no slowdown at all on that front. In fact, it's interesting, we signed 63 select service deals in the first half of the year in China. Almost half of those are expected to open within 12 months. So as we look at the pace, we ask the same question as you. Are we stacking paper or are we signing deals that are going to materialize as openings? And the pace of construction is really encouraging. Leeny Oberg : And the only thing I'll add is that I think with our continued strength in RevPAR index in Greater China, especially as you see demand softening over the past six months or so, we have seen increased owner appetite for being with the really strong brands that we have and across the full range of brands. So we're really pleased to see kind of from the limited service segment all the way up through luxury, the really strong demand for the brands, including conversions in China, I think really demonstrating that it's frankly in the weaker times that sometimes the brands can prove the most powerful. Shaun Kelley : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you a little bit more on -- you mentioned some weakness in Hawaii and I just was wondering, are you seeing it across all regions or is it maybe more isolated in Maui with what's been going on there? And is it sort of leisure or is it sort of group consensus, meaning, what's sort of driving relative weakness in that region? Leeny Oberg : Yeah, sure, Smedes, and yes, I think, I think Maui is definitely still seeing the slowest recovery. You still have the reality that the dollar is very strong, and Hawaii has been always been a very popular place for Japanese travelers. And so we overall in Hawaii, we've still not seen the level of Japanese travelers back in the state. But obviously, the tragedy in Lahaina has clearly had a huge impact on the island. And while we were there with Tony, with the senior team, a couple of weeks ago, and there's been fabulous progress, and it is really coming along well. But clearly still that island in particular is having a slower recovery than the other parts of Hawaii. But Hawaii overall is still feeling the impact of the strong dollar. Smedes Rose : Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned that IMF fees were flat in North America. I think can you just remind us, what percentage of your system in North America is currently paying IMF? Leeny Oberg : Sure, absolutely. So interestingly, it's the same percentage as a year ago in the second quarter. 26% of the hotels in the US are paying incentive fees in the second quarter. And just as a reference point, in China, in Greater China, we went from 86% to 80%. So you see that really large delta given the structure of the management agreements. Overall for managed contracts for Marriott, we went from 62% paying incentive fees last year in the second quarter to 61% this year. So you can see that in the US it's fairly steady and more limited to certain pockets geographically that weren't quite as strong. Smedes Rose : Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Good morning, everybody. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Leeny Oberg : Good morning, Joe. Joe Greff : Good morning. Your gross fee guidance for the full year is lowered by about $50 million to $100 million versus what you gave in May. I was hoping you could break that out between the net impact from China, the election impact in the US, and FX. Leeny Oberg : Yeah, so let's do this. IMFs are definitely two-thirds of that. And I would say if you're looking at that, a solid half, if not a bit more, is from greater China. Now that you've got to get into how much is the RevPAR versus how much is FX, and there is a bit of both. Then you're also looking in IMF at some in the US, which let's call it, broadly speaking, roughly $10 million, from various markets not performing as well as we expected a quarter ago. Then you've got also FX overall is affecting both some base fees and IMFs. So to separate it out, you get into -- a bit into kind of which element are you describing. But I would say that China is the biggest impact on the change in IMFs, which is two-thirds of the overall $75 million in reduction. And then you've got a bit from the US and a bit from FX. Obviously, the lower RevPAR globally has a little bit of impact, and then ever so -- truly ever so slightly is related to non-RevPAR fees. Joe Greff : Great. I think, Tony, your prepared remarks talk about construction starts in the US and Canada of 40% year-over-year. And we're hearing that from others as well. Can you talk about construction starts outside the US, how that has been trending? Tony Capuano : Yeah, of course. So as I said, here in the US, up about 40%, which is really encouraging. In greater China, I might refer to the comment I made earlier. Again, in China, as you know, oftentimes projects that come to us are well under construction. So we tend to look more at what percentage of those deals might open within 12 months of signing and to see nearly half in greater China is really encouraging. In APEC, Asia Pacific excluding China, there is still some challenges getting projects financed, and there's a continued wait for a little easing in the interest rate environment. And in EMEA, you've got a similar circumstance. Financing is continuing to be a bit of an impediment. But despite everything I just described between all of the regions that we talked about, construction starts on a global basis are up that same number about 40%. And the other thing I would tell you is the combination of some improvement in construction start activity and continued really strong performance on the conversion side, we've now had 27 straight quarters with about 200,000 rooms or more under construction. So even with really strong openings, we continue to see those starts fuel the under-construction pipeline. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you very much. Tony Capuano : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. What I wanted to do was just get a little further insight on the NUG guidance broadly speaking, which is the same. And the makeup of that NUG where we're focused on, let's say, the MGM deal, which is a sort of different kind of fee structure than what you have. And should we be looking at that NUG in that pipeline through a more updated lens where there are going to be more of those kinds of deals in there and just thinking about how we model fees in response to that NUG over time, if my question is clear enough? Tony Capuano : Yeah, it is. And I think the short answer is, I don't think it should cause you to think materially differently about our NUG, about the value of our NUG, about our fee structures. MGM was an extraordinarily exciting and unique opportunity to bring two powerhouse sets of brands together and that caused us to be creative on the deal structure. But the vast majority, almost the entirety of the pipeline, fits squarely in our traditional approach to managed and franchise deals. Leeny Oberg : The only thing I would add, David, is that we are really pleased with the number of multi-unit deals that we're signing. But overwhelmingly, they're multi-unit franchise or managed deals that are typical, but they just represent an owner wanting to sign a number of properties up with Marriott rather than a onesie or a twosie. So in that regard, it's great for our growth, and we're really pleased with the continuation of those relationships, but they don't represent a fundamental change in the nature of the agreement. David Katz : That's really, really helpful. Can -- while we're on the subject, as my follow-up, could we just touch on the MGM deal and talk about how it's going, any data points or anything like that would be helpful? Thanks. Tony Capuano : Yeah. The short answer is, it's really going great. I talked to Bill not long ago, I think, from both companies' perspectives, we are elated at the volume of both transient and group leads that are coming through our systems. The number of folks that are considering linking their MGM rewards and Marriott Bonvoy accounts, the number of groups that are unique groups that are now available to the MGM portfolio. So I think on all fronts, we are thrilled. David Katz : Excellent. Thank you. Appreciate it. Tony Capuano : Welcome. Leeny Oberg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Leeny Oberg : Good morning. Brandt Montour : Good morning, Leeny. So I want to talk about group pace for '25. Have you guys seen that pace remain consistent? Has it strengthened or softened quarter-over-quarter? And have you seen any booking hesitation from large groups for '25 in relation to the election and the uncertainty around the election? Tony Capuano : Yeah. So good questions. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the forward bookings for the balance of '24 are consistent with last quarter with about 9% improvement. In 2025, as we look ahead, right now, 2025 is pacing at 9%, which is a little erosion from last quarter. But most of the change is due to pace in room nights. Some of that is around -- or the length of time that folks are booking now, but group continues to be a standout. Brandt Montour : That's great, Tony. Thanks for that. And then just a second question on owned and leased. It looks like the 2Q came in nicely ahead of plan and you raised the full year -- maybe just highlight which region stood out there and then the second half outlook for owned and how that squares with your broader sort of shifting in thoughts for that portfolio? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Sure. As you know, our owned lease portfolio is a bit disparate around the world, and so it can depend on certain markets. Obviously, in Europe and -- business has been good. And so those results are strong. But it also contains termination fees in that category. And I think the reality is the outlook for termination fees is a bit higher than it was a quarter ago. It's as you noted, a very modest change in the overall guidance. So we're pleased with how well the hotels are doing in that portfolio. We've got a little bit of renovation impact that goes on. But otherwise, overall, really consistent view of the results in that segment with a little bit more termination fees. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Dan Politzer : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Tony Capuano : Good morning. Dan Politzer : In terms of the unit growth, certainly pacing well, and you've given a lot of color in terms of both China as well as ex-China. As we think about kind of the exit pace for this year and the setup for next year, to what degree do you have confidence in achieving that 5% to 5.5% CAGR that you laid out at your Analyst Day last year? Leeny Oberg : So first of all, it won't surprise you. We're not ready to talk about specifics for next year, but we certainly continue to believe that the 5% to 5.5% guidance that we gave in September of '23 is appropriate. Whether it -- we've got a specific budget that looks at a number that is higher or not. We will get there as we move through the process. The thing I'd like to point out is conversions and also the adaptive reuse numbers that Tony talked about relative to Greater China. Given that we are looking at a roughly 30% of our room openings coming from conversions and then the adaptive reuse numbers that we've talked about, I think we do continue to see a great rise of near-term openings over the next 18 months around the world. Tony pointed out the three luxury conversions that opened this year in the US, and those were in the year for the year conversions for the company. So those deals were signed this year and opened this year. So from that perspective, we do continue to feel really good about the demand for the brands. And then we talked a little bit about the uptick in construction starts, and I think you put that together and that bodes well for the company's continued net rooms growth. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thank you. And then just, I think, Leeny, you mentioned that leisure is still growing, albeit slowly. Can you maybe unpack that a bit and talk a little bit about the underlying trends there, either by chain scale or booking window or any changes you've seen in that customer base? Leeny Oberg : Yeah, sure. You're right. We saw leisure grow 2% and while that's clearly nothing like group that was at 10%, it is still encouraging given they came out of COVID rapid fire and with huge increases in RevPAR. So very pleased. Global leisure nights were up 2%. ADR was up 1%, and even the US and Canada leisure RevPAR was up 1%. And when you look at the various segments, global luxury resorts were up 4.1% in terms of RevPAR and US luxury resorts were up almost 1%. So while I think there is at the margin a hair more caution from the US customer, we do see that there continues to be very strong demand on the leisure front. The other thing I'd point out is that we clearly are seeing a stronger performance in the upper chain scales than compared to the lower chain scale. And you're seeing that throughout the industry as well. So when you look at premium and luxury, that overall is stronger than it is in the lower chain scales. Tony Capuano : And, Dan, just to provide a little more context. I mean Leeny referenced the strength we've seen in leisure. Remind yourself, leisure was the fastest customer segment to recover. And over the last five years, RevPAR and the leisure segment is up 40%. And so to continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in leisure RevPAR on the shoulders of that sort of recovery for us is quite encouraging. Dan Politzer : Got it. Leeny Oberg : And the last thing I'll say is we do expect for the full year, while it will not be the -- it will be relatively the slower growing segment compared to group and BT, we still do expect it to be up for the full year as well. Dan Politzer : Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Bill Crow : Hey, good morning. If I could just start with a follow-up on that last question. Are you seeing the sluggishness at the low end creeping into higher income levels at this point? Leeny Oberg : No, not really. I think one thing that's just interesting is that ancillary spend around the world, US and Canada, and frankly, all of the other regions, ancillary spend was a hair softer than we anticipated. And I think it does show that the consumer in general is perhaps being a bit more judicious about the fancy dinner or going on that extra trip when they're on a vacation. And that is really the only thing. It's not trade down in any meaningful way. And as we pointed out, the resort RevPAR was sturdy. But that's really the only item that I can point to. Tony Capuano : Yeah, I think, Bill, the empirical data that supports Leeny's observation, when you looked in the corridor at occupancy improvement by quality tier, luxury was actually the tier that had the best improvement at almost 2.5 points of occupancy year-over-year. And so, again, that high-end consumer continues to show real resilience and real appetite for travel. I think the one thing we're watching is what Leeny pointed out, and that's the ancillary spend. Bill Crow : Yeah. Okay, thanks. If I could just follow up with a quick one about the balance of travel between inbound and outbound international. This was supposed to be the summer where it kind of equaled out and that's not happening. Can you just update us your thoughts on how you see that recovery playing out, especially inbound in the United States? Leeny Oberg : Yeah. So, interestingly, inbound is about the same as it was prior to COVID. 4% to 5% of the nights in the US are from cross-border, and it's the same as usual where big cities like New York and Miami continue to get outsized presence from cross-border travel. But they also continue to be from the markets like Canada and Mexico coming to the US. As we look at going to other markets, we are seeing that we've gone a hair higher than 19 levels. We\u2019re -- almost 20% of our business around the world is cross-border. Now, part of that, the reality is we've got more international rooms than we had in 2019. But you continue to see with the strong US dollar, you continue to see great travel from US travelers, for example, going to Japan, going to Europe, Middle Eastern travelers, traveling to many other countries. So I think the global nature of travel is only increasing, which from our perspective is fabulous. Bill Crow : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Ari Klein : Thank you. Good morning. Going back to China, historically that region has been a sizable outsource of travel demand globally. And based on the commentary, that piece still appears to be largely holding, Why do you think that's the case and is that something you anticipate changing? Leeny Oberg : Could you repeat it? You broke up some on the question. Do you mind repeating it, please? Ari Klein : Sorry about that. Yeah, so just China has been a sizable outsourcer of travel demand globally, and based on the commentary that still appears to be holding. Why do you think that that's the case? And is that something you expect to change given the broader weakness in China? Leeny Oberg : So I'll give you a couple of facts and also a reminder that a year ago you were just starting to see Chinese travelers leaving the country. So one of the big differences in Q2 is there was meaningfully better airlift out of China to other parts of the world. Now while the US airlift is still not back to where it was, overall there are about 75% back to where they were in terms of airlift to other countries and particularly to other countries in Asia Pacific. So, no doubt our Asia Pacific hotels outside of Greater China benefited from the higher income travelers in China wanting to go outside of China now that frankly it was a freer opportunity to do so on the heels of the recovery from COVID. So we are seeing that. I will say that the travel to and from the US is definitely not back to the levels that it was. And we do continue to expect to see really strong outbound demand from greater China. But I will point you again to the overall macroeconomic picture there in greater China, which is frankly meant that overall levels of travel spend have not recovered as fast as perhaps might have been expected. Tony Capuano : The only thing I would add are the other catalyst we've seen is the Chinese government has been more and more aggressive in striking visa deals with preferred destinations, removing one more layer of friction for outbound Chinese travelers, especially at the high end. And we're seeing that particularly in our results across APEC. Ari Klein : Thanks for that. And then just on the 40% increase in US construction starts, is there any notable difference between the starts on select service hotels versus full service hotels? Leeny Oberg : No. Overwhelmingly, our pipeline, as you might imagine, is overwhelmingly limited service in any event. And most of the full service deals that we're doing are conversions. So this is quite similar to 2019, where there are overwhelmingly select service new builds. Ari Klein : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Great. Thank you. Just going back to the topic of unit growth, you talked about the increase in construction starts. But if you look at sort of overall under-construction as a percent of pipeline, it's still, I want to say it's at 37%, still quite a bit lower than historic. So I'm just wondering, you mentioned it's not really -- China's not the issue there. Is it a lot of projects that are sitting that haven't gotten the financing or is it actually churn and like projects falling out, new projects coming in, so that percent of under-construction isn't necessarily ticking up. Just any color around that. Thanks. Tony Capuano : Yeah, it's definitely not churn. I mean we continue to see kind of historic low levels of dropout from the pipeline. I think here in the US, while we're encouraged by that pickup of 40%, you still -- and it's a bit ironic because when you talk to the lenders, often the hospitality component of their commercial real estate portfolios are the best subset of that portfolio. But the availability of construction debt is still relatively constricted to where we were in a pre-pandemic situation. And as a result, we're not back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of shovels in the ground. Trends are going the right direction, but we're just not all the way back yet. Robin Farley : Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow up, looking at 2025, and I know you haven't guided specifically, but you had that sort of two-year guidance that kind of implies for 2025, that conversions will kind of accelerate, I think, as a percent of new units next year. And I think conversions are already a greater contributor to your net unit growth than historic. Just looking at that 30% that you're at, maybe you can refresh this. Maybe that's, I'm not remembering that right. But if you're already at sort of that higher than historic percent, help us think about what dynamics you're expecting that will sort of drive incremental conversions of percent of total for 2025. And because there's acceleration overall in your unit growth expectation, it's not just acceleration in percent of total acceleration in absolute units as well. Thanks. Tony Capuano : Yeah. So again, as Leeny pointed out earlier, we're not quite ready to put a stake in the ground on specific guidance for \u201825, but we continue to see conversion volume at 30-plus-percent of both signings and openings. It feels like our momentum in conversions is accelerating, and it's really encouraging to see the way the owner and franchise community is gravitating towards the strength of our revenue engines. Robin Farley : Thank you. Tony Capuano : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Patrick Scholes : Great. Good morning, everyone. My first question, how would you describe your visibility as far as bookings in China as opposed to the US? Even more granular, what would you say the typical booking window looks like for China versus over here? Thank you. Tony Capuano : Yeah. So, I think our visibility is pretty good but the booking window is historically short right now. And so that's making it challenging for us to look much beyond the end of this year. Right now you are seeing very, very short-term booking window, kind of one to three days versus what we see around most of the rest of the world is closer to 20 days. Patrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. And then a different topic here. I'm wondering if you could give us an update on your recent trends for spending key money to make development happen. Thank you. Tony Capuano : Of course. It's a trend that we analyze quite a bit ourselves. And so I'm going to give you a couple statistics. We're only halfway through \u201824. So I'm going to compare 2019 to 2023 full year. It's interesting, the percentage of deals in full year 2023 that required key money is actually a bit lower than what we saw in 2019. And similarly, the amount of key money offered in deals that had key money in 2023 was almost 10% lower than what we saw in 2019. Now to be sure, there's a couple other trends below the surface of those encouraging statistics. To be sure that the environment is becoming more and more competitive and we continue to apply the same lens we've always applied, which is in deals that are strategic and have a significant fee upside, that's when we consider leveraging the company's balance sheet. And number two, back in 2019, I don't know the precise statistic, but the bulk of the key money we deployed would have been in the upper upscale and luxury. And I think now you are seeing selectively the opportunity or the need to deploy key money or other capital tools lower in the quality tier framework. Patrick Scholes : Okay, thank you for the color. Tony Capuano : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our final question from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tony Capuano : Good Morning. Michael Bellisario : First question, just to follow up on the ancillary spend. Is the lower non-RevPAR fee outlook, is that being driven by lower card spending? And then are you also seeing that softer ancillary spend within the group segment, or is that comment just specific to leisure transient? Leeny Oberg : Yeah, no. So good questions. I would say the lower ancillary spend is across the board. So a little bit, only a little bit, but a little bit everywhere, both leisure as well as group. And then on the non-RevPAR spend, overall we are still seeing credit card spend go up very nicely. We're still looking at credit card fees being up 10% in 2024. It is the average spent that has moderated a little bit in terms of a typical card holder in the US, but again, only a very, very small amount. And just as a reminder, the ancillary spend is related to credit card spend because obviously people use their credit cards to buy these things, but our ancillary revenues are going to come through the RevPAR line because those are earned at hotels. The non-RevPAR fees are entirely a function of what's going on, obviously, in residential and timeshare and in the credit cards. And that's where, to your point, we're seeing average spend moderate a bit. But again, overall, credit card spend will go out very nicely because we're really pleased with the adding of new card holders to our portfolio. Michael Bellisario : Got it. Understood. And then just one follow up just on your lower end chain scales. You've noted a lot of discussions and signings, but where are you at with shovels in the ground, say, for StudioRes, and then are you still focused on the multi-unit development deals, and then when do you switch to single asset deals? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Yeah. So as we spoke about before, we are really pleased with the large number of multi-unit conversion deals that we've had under discussion and in some cases closed around the world. So that is great. And then we've talked about specifically in the mid-scale as having over 300 hotels under discussion with multi-unit developers. And we are seeing more of them actually put the shovels in the ground. Jackie McConagha : Operator? Operator : Thank you. We have used up our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Tony for closing remarks. Tony Capuano : Great. Well, as always, thank you again for your interest in Marriott. I hope you enjoy the balance of the summer. Hope you're out on the road, and we'll look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thanks. Operator : This does conclude today's Marriott International Q2 2024 earnings. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jackie McConagha, Senior [Technical Difficulty] Jackie McConagha : Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Marriott's third quarter 2024 earnings call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Development ; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by our comments. Unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy, average daily rate and property level revenues reflect system wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and all changes refer to year-over-year changes for the comparable period. Statements in our comments in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony. Anthony Capuano : Thank you, Jackie. Thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect continued momentum in our business. Net rooms grew nearly 6% year-over-year and development activity remained strong. Global RevPAR increased 3% in the quarter, driven by another quarter of solid rate growth with ADR up 2.5%. Globally, group was once again the top performing customer segment. Group RevPAR rose 10% year-over-year for the second quarter in a row with robust increases in both room nights and ADR. At the end of September, global group revenues were pacing roughly flat for the fourth quarter, primarily due to negative impact from the election in the U.S. and up 8% for the full year 2024. Given our industry-leading distribution of convention hotels at nearly double the number of rooms of the next closest peer, we are pleased that group strength is continuing into next year. Group revenues for 2025 were pacing up 7% at the end of the quarter, on a 3% increase in room nights and a 4% increase in average daily rate. Globally, business transient experienced another quarter of growth with third quarter RevPAR rising 2%. Leisure transient RevPAR was flat to the year ago quarter, while still well above 2019 levels. If we look at trends by region, RevPAR rose over 2% in the U.S. and Canada, driven by growth in average rate. RevPAR growth at luxury and full service hotels outperformed select service properties and weekdays surpassed weekends, reflecting strength in group and business transient compared to leisure. RevPAR grew 5% internationally, driven by 9% RevPAR increases in Europe, Middle East and Africa and in Asia Pacific, excluding China. EMEA growth was helped by the Paris Olympics and other special events, as well as solid demand from U.S. travelers. APAC strength was broad-based across the region and benefited from international guests, especially from Greater China. Cross-border travel on a global basis is now above pre-pandemic levels at just over 20% of total rooms. Greater China RevPAR declined to 8% in the third quarter as macroeconomic pressures led to weak domestic leisure demand and restricted pricing power. Severe weather and higher end guests traveling to other regions also impacted the area. Despite the demand headwinds, our hotels continue to outperform our peers, gaining RevPAR index across Greater China in the quarter. We also grew RevPAR index on a global basis. Marriott Bonvoy, our industry-leading global travel and loyalty program had a record quarter of enrollments with our membership base growing to over 219 million members at the end of September. With co-branded credit cards in 11 countries in CALA as well as numerous collaborations and thousands of Marriott Bonvoy Moments experiences, including the Taylor Swift Eras Tour sweepstakes, we are focused on enhancing engagement with our members, both on and off property. Thanks to our recent tie-up with Starbucks, even members with only one hotel stay can now redeem points for a cup of coffee. We're thrilled with our development activity. In the third quarter, we added around 16,000 net rooms, reaching more than 1.67 million rooms at nearly 9,100 properties around the world. Global signing activity has remained strong with more than 95,000 organic rooms signed year-to-date in 2024. Compared to a quarter ago, our pipeline grew 5% to a record 585,000 rooms. Our momentum in conversions, including multiunit opportunities continues to reflect owner preference for our brands worldwide. In August, we announced a multiunit conversion deal with Sonder for 9,000 existing rooms and a few thousand more in the pipeline. This deal expands our portfolio of longer stay accommodations in key global markets, including New York and Dubai. In the third quarter, conversions represented over 30% of room additions and over 50% of signs. In October, we announced City Express by Marriott as the brand name of our new transient mid-scale product here in the U.S. and in Canada. With its highly effective operating model, an outstanding value proposition, we have already received extensive interest from owners. We expect to have signed agreements and even a few openings over the next few months. Our progress in the mid-scale space around the world has been outstanding, and we look forward to meaningfully enhancing our presence in this high growth segment of the market. Our strong 2024 net rooms growth and signings performance is exciting, and I'm proud of our associates for their work in driving preference for our brands among both guests and owners. Marriott Bonvoy has never been stronger, and we look forward to further expanding our presence around the world. Our business momentum is excellent and as a company that embraces change, we continue to evolve our business to support our global growth. To this end, we have undertaken an enterprise-wide process to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency across the company. We want to further empower our teams closest to our markets guests, owners and franchisees to operate even more nimbly. While this work is not yet complete, we believe these efforts will drive increased profitability and enhanced value. I will now turn the call over to Leeny, who will share more details and then walk through our financial results and updated guidance. Leeny? Leeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. At this point in the process, we expect these efforts to yield $80 million to $90 million of annual pre-tax general and administrative cost reductions beginning in 2025. In addition, we expect to deliver cost savings to our owners and franchisees. This initiative is anticipated to result in roughly $100 million of charges, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2024. The charges will be recorded in restructuring and merger related charges and in reimbursed expenses. With meaningful growth opportunities around the world across are more than 30 brands, we're confident these efforts will make us even more competitive. Now turning to our third quarter results. Gross fee revenues rose 7% in the quarter to $1.28 billion. The increase reflects higher global RevPAR, rooms growth and increase in residential branding fees helped by timing and higher co-brand credit card fees. IMF grew 11% to $159 million. Growth in IMF was led by higher fees in the U.S. and Canada as well as strong growth in APAC and CALA, partially offset by a $5 million decline in Greater China. G&A in the quarter rose 15%, primarily due to a $19 million operating profit guarantee reserve for a U.S. hotel, which was negotiated in connection with the company's acquisition of Starwood as well as an $11 million litigation reserve. Even with these $31 million of reserves, third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew faster than gross fees, rising 8% to $1.2 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $2.26. Now let's talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter, and we still assume 3% to 4% growth for the full year. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR growth is anticipated to be higher in most international markets than in the U.S. and Canada. Fourth quarter RevPAR growth in the U.S. and Canada is currently expected to be generally in line with the third quarter, with strong leisure and BP trends in October, offsetting weakness in November due to tomorrow's election. The election impact on U.S. and Canada RevPAR is forecasted to be around negative 300 basis points in November and negative 100 basis points for the quarter, double that of past election cycles as we have meaningfully lower transient and group room nights on the books for both this week and next. Greater China is still expected to post negative RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year as a result of current weak demand and pricing trends in the region. In the fourth quarter, gross fee growth is expected to be in the 4% to 5% range. Compared to our July guidance, fees are expected to be impacted by softer performance at certain hotels under renovation and lower than previously forecasted residential branding fees due to timing. Our owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, could total roughly $95 million. For the full year, gross fees are anticipated to grow 6% to 7% to $5.13 billion to $5.15 billion. Unleased and other revenues net of expenses could total around $346 million. We now expect full year G&A expense can rise 4% to 5% year-over-year. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to total $4.93 billion to $4.96 billion, a 6% to 7% increase over 2023. 2024 adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be between $9.19 and $9.27 with a 25% assumed tax rate. We're now forecasting full year investment spending of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. As a reminder, this year's spending includes higher than historical investment in technology associated with the multiyear transformation of our property management, reservations and loyalty systems the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. The rollout of these platforms is slated to begin later next year, and we look forward to the many benefits that should accrue from elevating from three major tech platforms. Our powerful asset light business model generates a great deal of cash and our philosophy on allocating that capital remains the same. We're committed to our investment grade ratings and investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through share repurchases and a modest dividend, which has risen meaningfully over time. We now expect to return approximately $4.4 billion to shareholders for the full year. This factors in the $500 million of required cash for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago expected to occur later this month. As Tony mentioned, we're very pleased with the robust development activity across our global portfolio. This summer, we raised our full year 2024 net room guidance to 6% to 6.5% growth after signing the Sonder deal. With increased visibility, we now anticipate 2024 routes growth at the top end of this range or around 6.5%. We still expect net rooms to grow at a solid three year CAGR of 5% to 5.5% from year end 2022 to year end 2025. Thank you for your continued interest in Marriott, and Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Stephen Grambling : Hey, good morning. Thank you. I guess a couple of related questions around the efficiencies. At a high level, what was the impetus for taking these actions now and where do you see the biggest areas of opportunity to streamline, and then also just how to think about the run rate of SG&A growth perhaps before factoring in these benefits? Anthony Capuano : Thanks, Stephen. Maybe I'll take the first part of your question, and then turn it over to Leeny. I think the impetus is -- maybe I'll start at 100,000 feet. One of the company's core values is this notion of always embracing change. And we think right now, we operate from a position of strength. The business has really strong momentum, as Leeny just described. Then the company is quite different than the last time we looked holistically at the organization. You think about the changes in the company over the last decade. We've more than doubled in size over the last decade. We've entered over 60 new countries now operating in 142 countries. And so it felt like the right time to really look across the enterprise and figure out what adjustments we can make to enhance and improve our efficiency. In terms of run rate, Leeny, you want to take that? Leeny Oberg : Yeah. So thanks, Stephen. I think, first of all, let me talk a little bit about the 80 to 90, and that is really thinking about savings off of our current cost base. So when we think about moving forward, we've talked to you over time about a kind of typical longer-term run rate of inflation plus perhaps a point or so to support above average growth. And from that perspective, I think it's too early for us to give any specifics about next year. We're really just beginning our full loan budget process, but really think about that 80 to 90 as being off of our current run rate. Stephen Grambling : Got it. And maybe as an unrelated follow-up, the pipeline improved sequentially, and it looks like it's in a good position for next year. I know you don't want to talk about 2025 too much, but is there any major puts and takes to think about rooms growth into next year and the fees per room contribution from that pipeline? Anthony Capuano : Yeah. So in terms of -- we're in the early stages of the 2025 budget process. I think that the visibility that we have so far underpins Leeny's comment about our confidence in the three year CAGR that we laid out during the Security Analyst Meeting. On the fees per room question, that's obviously something we're digging into. And if you look at fees per room for RevPAR related fees, pulling out the non-RevPAR as they tend to grow faster. Both in '24 and in '25, we see average fees per room growing, which might seem a little counterintuitive given our push into midscale, but I think there are two principal drivers there. Number one, we continue to see really strong momentum in the luxury tier, which drives outsized fees. And as Leeny talked about, we continue to see strong growth in incentive management fees. Stephen Grambling : Thank you. Anthony Capuano : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Shaun Kelley : Good morning, everyone. Leeny Oberg : Good morning, Shaun. Shaun Kelley : Good morning. Leeny, maybe I just want to start with kind of the fee algorithm here, if we just kind of do the couple of building blocks for everyone. Obviously, RevPAR up 3% to 4% net unit growth coming in on the high side of expectation over 6%. As we look at the kind of gross fee piece, obviously, it's a bit beneath A plus B. So just could you walk us through or remind us of what's the gap this year? Is that a little bit of dilution from MGM just given those rooms and the fee contribution there? Does that have to do with IMF, just what are a couple of the pieces there and how do you expect it to more importantly trend kind of longer term? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Shaun. Yeah. We've had this conversation a number of times, which is, I think when you look at it quarter-to-quarter, it's very hard to see the overall fee because there are just a typical loneliness that comes with IMF, for example, you heard about the lower year-over-year IMF and IMF rich territory like Greater China, you've obviously got things like renovation impact, which are very important overall to the health of portfolio, and we're really excited about what those renovations will produce. But when you put that all together, combined it with a little bit of FX, etc., quarter-over-quarter, it is absolutely going to be lumpy. We do believe that this algorithm works over time. But then you do have a bit of the ramp-up issue as well as variations in RevPAR that can make it tougher just in one quarter. But again, as we look forward, really pleased with what we see in terms of the rooms that are coming on to the system. As we've talked about before, room signings are very strong this year. When you look at kind of year-over-year where we are and the strength of the conversions coming in the system, we do see that, that equation going forward looks pretty good. Shaun Kelley : Great. And maybe just as my quick follow-up, and this is really just a clarification on the earlier question about G&A, just so we have the right base for next year, Leeny, the SG&A this year, obviously includes what the G&A this year, obviously includes the $30 million of kind of one-time reserve and guarantees. Should we back that out and then remove the incremental from that base or is this all working off the kind of stated number, the $10.50 to $10.60 starting point this year? Leeny Oberg : Right. So I think, generally, your philosophy is right, Shaun. I want to caveat that, though, we are way too early to be giving specifics about how you should come up with that number. We modestly got to look at all the elements of the different pieces that go into G&A. As you'll probably remember, we've also got normal increases in bad debt that come with the growth of the overall portfolio, etc., etc. So it's not quite as simple as you're describing. But philosophically, you are right that, that $31 million was not anticipated and not expected in normal run rate G&A. But right now, that 80 to 90 comes right out of this year's run rate. Shaun Kelley : Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes with Truist. Please go ahead. Patrick Scholes : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Tony, I have some questions for you on China. It's been about a month since the economic stimulus went into play there. Have you seen any uplift or changes from that yet? And then my related question, do you have any initial thoughts about RevPAR growth or decline for China for next year? Certainly, China is a real wild card. I mean, it could be negative 10%. It could be positive 10% this year. I'm curious, if you have given your three days of visibility there. Any initial thoughts on expectations for China next year? Thank you. Anthony Capuano : Sure. So let me try and remind me, if I've missed your few questions embedded in there. On the first one, stimulus. We're watching so closely, most the stimulus so far, really has not been to the direct benefit of the consumer. So we're not seeing any sort of immediate and material impact on performance metrics. The thing that is more interesting to me, not a great deal of stimulus or support for the property sector, which is obviously under quite a bit of duress, but despite that lack of stimulus to support the property sector, we talked about this last quarter as well. We continue to see really strong both signings and openings volume across Greater China. I think some of that is because we're seeing a real acceleration in our select service brands, which are marginally easier to get done from a capital staff perspective. But the short answer to your question is really not much yet in terms of the impact of stimulus. You're absolutely right when we think about visibility expectations about performance in China are really all over the board. And as Leeny mentioned in her prepared remarks, we're early in the process. What I would say to you is right now, as we start to peak into 2025. Absent any more significant stimulus it could be as good as flat going into '25. But again, that's a very early peak into the performance. Leeny Oberg : The only thing that I would add to that is that we get into the weeds of looking at Q3 and Q4 is that the margin, Greater China RevPAR has been slightly better than we expected a quarter ago as we move through Q3 and as we looked into October, and one of the things that is interesting is, we are starting to see a slight pickup in cross-border travel into the Tier 1 cities, kind of classic BT. Now again, it\u2019s only quite marginal because as you saw, RevPAR was down meaningfully in Q3, and we do expect that to continue. But at the margin, slightly better than we thought. Patrick Scholes : All right. Thank you for the color. I\u2019m all set. Anthony Capuano : Thanks, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Richard Clarke : Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to start on the IMF, up 11% without sort of meaningful inflection on RevPAR. So just to make sure color there, and particularly on the U.S., how we can square a good IMF quarter with having to put in an operating reserve. Is that just on one hotel? And maybe any color on why you're needing to do that on that one hotel? Leeny Oberg : Yeah. The operating profit guarantee has nothing to do with IMF. When you look at IMF in Q3, it was the U.S. and Canada that was the outperformer, kind of a couple of different reasons. There was one element that was related to some insurance payments made from prior hurricanes, but also very good strong performance on the part of our large city managed hotels, which helped a bit. And then obviously, you see in APAC as well. We have good growth in our Asia Pacific outside of China IMF. Just to give you kind of a little bit of a sense overall, 22% of our hotels in the U.S. and Canada that are managed, paid an incentive fee in Q3, that's the same percentage as a quarter ago. So think of that as fairly consistent. And then outside the U.S., also still quite strong. I think Greater China was the one change where a little bit lower as a result of their continued weakness in RevPAR. As we look at Q4, that's where I think you see, when you look at the fee guidance that we gave, you actually see a little bit of this reverse from a standpoint that several of the hotels undergoing renovation will mean that we expect IMF to be a little bit weaker than a quarter ago as a result of that even though RevPAR is largely the same in U.S. and Canada. Richard Clarke : Okay. Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up. When you talked about cost savings to franchisees and owners, are you talking about them delivering them some operating cost savings or are you talking about dropping any of your fees do you charge to your franchisees and owners? Anthony Capuano : Yeah. So we're looking at efficiencies and savings that we think will have clear benefits to the owners. We're looking at every facet of our engagement with them, and we expect to have some tangible saving opportunities identified for them in the very near future. Richard Clarke : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead. Robin Farley : Great. Thanks. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about kind of key money trends in terms of your new unit growth? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Yeah. Sure, Robin. Good morning. Yes. I would say more of the same. We've talked about this for several quarters from a standpoint that perhaps over a number of years. We've seen a bit more key money across more tiers. But I think more importantly, when you look about the percentage of fuels using key money that still is about the same at about a third of deals and when we think about the amount of key money per deal, also quite similar. So we are seeing trends that would mean you need to think about kind of meaningful increases in that element of our investment profile. Anthony Capuano : Maybe the only thing I would add, Rob, and we talked about this last quarter, as Leeny points out, the overall percentage of deals where we're using key money hasn't changed really at all. We are seeing selectively key money being used in a broader section of quality tiers than maybe we have in the past. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then if I could fit in a follow-up. I guess maybe sort of just two housekeeping things. One is, you mentioned that IMF included some hurricane payments that were kind of due to hurricanes in prior periods. I don't know if you could just quantify that so we can think about next year comping that, what would be not recurring? And then I don't know if there are any other that Starwood guarantee, you mentioned it seems like it was pretty long dated if it goes back to prior to the acquisition. Is there anything else like that, that sort of outstanding still left from other Starwood guarantees like that, that we might see in future periods? Thanks. Leeny Oberg : Sure. No, the business interruption immaterial, they\u2019re way too small to mention, it's in the laundry list of things that provide an outperformance in the U.S. and Canada. So really nothing that you would need to adjust out. We -- again, as you always know, quarter-to-quarter, you can have kind of variations on exactly what you're expecting to earn from a hotels. So really no numbers that would be meaningful at all. Yes, you're absolutely right. This was an unusual operating profit guarantee that was part of the settlement that we did in the acquisition of Starwood with an owner and meaningfully longer than a typical operating profit guarantee is for us. It was actually a total of a $70 million operating profit guarantee. This now takes us up to the MAX exposure that we have on that guarantee. And really, to your point, reflected the fact that we had a number of years and COVID to work through to have a view as to whether we would need to actually fund under that guarantee. So once we came out of COVID and could look forward over a number of years, we made the determination that we needed to take that reserve, but that is it. And to your point, no, we do not have a remaining operating profit guarantees with that kind of length and size of exposure. Robin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Joe Greff : Good morning, everyone. Anthony Capuano : Good morning. Joe Greff : My first question goes back to your initiatives to improve efficiencies and take out some G&A costs. I know the $80 million to $90 million begins to yield the beginning of 2025. And I know it's early in the process. What would be a good outcome in terms of what you would expect to achieve next year? And then as you head into 2026, would you still be expecting to be run rating $80 million to $90 million or would you, at that point, expect to achieve all of it. Leeny Oberg : Yeah. The $80 million to $90 million, just to be clear, we do believe that is in '25. So that, that is beginning in '25 off of this year's cost base. Now we obviously have all the normal other parts that you have to look in your budget for G&A, and that's the part that we're in the process of Joe. So I think at this point, we're really pointing to a sustainable $80 million to $90 million in annual G&A cost savings. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you for clarifying that. And again, maybe it falls under the bucket of it's still kind of early here. But when you think about 2025 all in investment spending. Do you look at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion as a reasonable expectation or does it come down because there seems to be some -- at least some one-time items this year that you wouldn't expect to recur next year? Leeny Oberg : Yeah. No, and last, of course, as always, something comes up that, that we're not currently planning for, I totally agree with you that you would expect both $200 million that is included in that number related to the purchase of Chicago. Grand Sheridan as well as a $50 million land purchase that we made in Q3 for the Westin Peachtree, which really was to help us remove the lack of clarity around a ground lease that made it difficult for any owner to know with the long-term kind of cash stream from that asset could be. So that -- with that cleared up, that's terrific and that really is $250 million that, to your point, is not expected to be ongoing. Joe Greff : Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brandt Montour : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Apologies, if this was covered and I missed it. But Tony, could you talk about the special corporate negotiated rate talks that are going on and how that's sort of coming together for next year? Anthony Capuano : Of course, yeah, we haven't talked about that yet. And again, we're relatively early in the process. But our takeaway from that early set of discussions, we are targeting a mid-single digit increase for 2025. And I think the teams are feeling pretty good about that target. Brandt Montour : Okay. That\u2019s great. Leeny Oberg : Just to add to that is that was definitely something we noticed was helpful this quarter with the continued strengthening of [indiscernible] that, that ADR continues to be useful. Brandt Montour : Yeah. Okay. Thanks for that. And then a follow-up, more of a bigger picture question for anyone. But I know developers are long-term planners and thinkers, but this said and the sort of uncertainty around interest rate movements here. Just curious, if it's weighing at all on developers' mindset in terms of how they're forming their capital planning for next year? Anthony Capuano : Yeah, Brandt. And the bulk would be, of course. I mean they look at every variable in the equation that impacts their returns. I think they are encouraged that the Fed did a 50 bp drop. They are obviously on pins and needles waiting to see what action the Fed takes through the balance of this year. But I would say to you, availability of debt and an elevated construction cost environment are bigger impediments to driving the sort of construction start volume, and we saw pre-pandemic than the current level of interest rates. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks for that. A \u2013 Anthony Capuano : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. David Katz : Hi. good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. A \u2013 Anthony Capuano : Good morning. David Katz : Good morning. So I wanted to ask about leisure, broadly speaking. And just taking in all the information so far through earnings season, can you talk about sort of areas of strength versus weakness and what the range of levels is that you're seeing, right? And just how broadly that is or is it -- should we call it flattish just straight across the board which seems unlike it? Leeny Oberg : Sure. So as you heard us say earlier that Q3 leisure transact was roughly flat to last year, although, well for 2019 levels. I think from a chain scale perspective, basically flat or slightly growing with luxury and premium, while really select service is where you saw a slight decline. David Katz : Understood. And my second question or my follow-up is really around net unit growth much longer term. I think it's fair to say the past few years or post-COVID, anyway, we've seen kind of a broader range of the kinds of base, Sonder being case in point or Bonvoy with MGM that have been added to the NUG process. Tony, how do you see NUG evolving if we look out two, three years? Does that kind of broadening of what NUG is defined as does that continue to grow over time? Anthony Capuano : Yeah. So as we said a quarter ago, you should reasonably expect the vast majority of our new units to be the sort of traditional management agreements and franchise agreements that you've seen when you hear Leeny talk about our three year CAGR 5% to 5.5% growth in NUG. That is really predicated on that traditional model of management agreements and franchise agrees. What I will say is, and maybe I'll pull MGM and Sonder apart because they're a bit unique. Everybody seems to lump those together, Sonder is really structured like a very traditional franchise agreement. MGM is different in that we brought together two powerhouse families of brands and to pull those two brands together, necessitated some real creativity in terms of structuring from both sides. But I will say, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the really extraordinary momentum that Bonvoy has and so certainly, we\u2019ll continue to get inquiries from prospective partners that want to take advantage of that momentum and we\u2019ll apply the same rigor and the same lens that we always have in evaluating those opportunities. David Katz : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Dan Politzer : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just double back on the leisure commentary. I mean, obviously, it's been pretty choppy right now and certainly for the fourth quarter. But as you think about 2025 and comparing to this kind of environment we've been in. Is there any expectation or line of sight to may be growing next year as things may be cool down a bit? Leeny Oberg : No. I'll say a couple of things. I think the reality is, we're in the middle of our budget process, which I'm happy to say is very granular and gets down to the property level and exactly what's going on in every environment. I think the broadest comment I would make is we see 2025 barring some major economic change to be more of the same. So if you think about kind of our back half of our RevPAR this year and how we're looking at 2025, I think you probably see some quite similar trends. where when you think BT continues on, group still very strong. We've talked about these upper-single digits group pace for next year. And that would then mean that leisure we'd be up slightly, but also probably not taking a big jump up. And again, we will be getting much more into that in February when we've gone through the budget. But I would say, '25 looks a whole lot like the back half of '24 from where we sit today. Dan Politzer : Great. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, it's more of a housekeeping. The non-RevPAR fees, you mentioned something along the lines of timing in the quarter. Is there -- I don't know if I missed it, but maybe if you can give us that actual non-RevPAR fees for the third quarter. And are we still on pace for that 9% to 10% growth in that line item for this year? Leeny Oberg : Yeah. So we are -- the three biggest items there are obviously the credit cards, residential and timeshare. And I think the one that really jumps out is what was going on with the residential branding fees, which, as you know, can be quite lumpy because if a whole development sells out. So as an example, in Q3 '24, that was $18 million, while a year ago in Q3, it was $7 million. So it more than doubled in one quarter. Credit card fees was the more stereotypical growth and timeshare tends to be fairly flattish given the structure of that contract. So you put it all together, but yes, for the full year, we continue to see the top end of single digits, 9% to 10% is the right growth range. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Bellisario : Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to one more on cost savings and then zoom out on net unit growth. But I mean, any impact to franchise sales or maybe even a reallocation to this team to support a faster organic net unit growth outlook? And then more broadly, zooming out on net unit growth, maybe just an update just on the competitive landscape of where you're winning or not winning deals today? Thanks. Anthony Capuano : Yeah. So I think what I would say, Michael, the growing our market share is obviously a top priority for us, and it will continue to be. The growth potential we see across our family of brands, including the more recent entrants in mid-scale is really strong, and we think we have a really competitive offering to the franchise community. We continue to be optimistic about those growth prospects as you heard Leeny described, and we certainly think this initiative will add incremental support to that growth. And then I'm sorry, the second question, Michael? Michael Bellisario : Just an update on the broader landscape for conversions and signings where you're winning or not winning deals today? Anthony Capuano : Yeah. I mean, I think in Leeny's prepared remarks, she talked a little bit about that. The momentum that we continue to see in conversions is really encouraging, both single asset and multi-unit. And maybe I think I said this a quarter or two ago, but I'll reiterate it. I think it's a combination of factors. I think we have, as strong portfolio of conversion friendly brands as we\u2019ve had in my 30 years with the company. I think the teams are much more focused on removing friction from the conversion process. And we've got Leeny has dedicated resources in each of the continents that are singularly focused on driving conversion volume. And so we expect that conversion activity to continue at pace. Michael Bellisario : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks and good morning. You answered parts of this in previous questions, but I just wanted to hit you with a high level macro question. If you look at demand growth in the U.S. this year, room night growth compared to headline GDP growth. Has there been anything surprising about the way that has played out. And as you think about 2025, which segments do you think could be better in sync with headline GDP growth, whatever that ends up being? Leeny Oberg : So I\u2019ll start and then I'll have Tony jump in. I do think part of what we saw in '24 is the continued normalization in the U.S. and Canada. So for example, in leisure, you've definitely got in Q3. Year-to-date, actually, the leisure guidance are flat to a year ago in the U.S. and Canada. Overall RevPAR is also year-to-date roughly flat in the U.S. in leisure. And that, I really ascribed to quite a bit of normalization. As you think about people kind of coming out of COVID and frankly, wanting to go anywhere, anytime, kind of no matter what to make sure that they were able to get their trial done. And I think that is normalizing a bit. While what you also saw was a business transient group kind of filling in to make up for where that slowdown was happening. So you actually look overall, and overall, in Q3, you saw room nights for year-to-date in the U.S. and Canada, up 1% and ADR up 2%. So in that regard, I think you continue to see a healthy series of demand. We believe that going forward, you're going to continue to see travel be a priority for our customers, whether it is group, BT or leisure. And of course, it has a relationship to the macroeconomic environment that's been proven in our industry cycle-in and cycle-out. But we would expect to continue to see with a strong economy, strong demand for our business. Anthony Capuano : And Duane, part of your question was around anything that's been a surprise. I don't know that I would characterize it as a surprise. But the continued strength quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year of group is a really encouraging sign. I mean we spent \u2013 all of us spend a lot of time with both corporate and association meeting planners and the appetite they have for group meeting just continues to be at the high end of our expectations, and it\u2019s really encouraging. And as I mentioned in my open particularly given the composition of our portfolio and our significant lead in our group hotel portfolio, that\u2019s a really terrific trend for our business. Duane Pfennigwerth : Okay. Appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thanks. You mentioned 2025, maybe the sort of looking RevPAR wise kind of similar to the back half of '24, I think, which is kind of generally what we're hearing kind of from other companies and industry prognosticators. And I'm just wondering in that kind of scenario, is there just anything we should keep in mind relative to capital return expectations we should just think about? I know you had some property purchases this year you mentioned, which I guess won't repeat next year, but anything we should just bear in mind when you think about forecasting that? Leeny Oberg : Yeah. No, I think our -- as I was saying in my comments, our philosophy is exactly the same, which is, we are a growth company. We are all about investing in valuable growth for the enterprise and continuing to take market share around the world. We are blessed with a business model that produces more cash than we need to provide that growth. And so from that perspective, we would expect to continue to stay very solidly in the investment-grade leverage range and return excess capital to our shareholders. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you, again, you mentioned sort of the ground lease purchases. I mean, and I think there's sort of a view that next year we could see sort of some pickup in hotel transaction activity. Would you hope to bring some of your owned assets to market next year? I mean, is that coming back and just sort of maybe more focus now? I know it's a smaller portfolio, but just kind of wondering your updated thoughts there? Leeny Oberg : So certainly, all the time, the reality is, we're looking at that all the time and evaluating what makes the most sense. As you've heard us talk about the W Union Square as well as the elegant portfolio in Barbados. We are nearing the end of the renovation of those properties and obviously, would look to take advantage of what we expect to be very strong performance on the part of those -- that portfolio in that hotel. And so as we move forward, depending on the financing environment and the appetite between as always, buyers and sellers, we will take advantage of that. So we're always searching for that. Smedes Rose : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Lizzie Dove with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Lizzie Dove : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit of a pulse check on the consumer. I know Tony you mentioned last quarter and then it skipped intra-quarter, just a little bit of pullback on ancillary spend, food and beverage space, things like that. I'm curious how that has evolved and ever since that period of time and what your kind of expectation is going forward? Anthony Capuano : Yeah. Thank you, Lizzie. Of course, we spend an enormous amount of time in looking at the consumer from every possible angle. But I'll go to the ancillary spend since that was a topic we talked about a quarter ago. When you look globally, you almost have to bifurcate it and look at food beverage for meetings and events versus food and beverage and outlets and lounges. Food beverage for meetings and events continues to be quite strong. We are seeing a little bit of pullback on outlets and lounges, still growing and growing materially, but maybe not quite as strong as we saw. The one thing I would tell you, though, is we're not seeing that weakness in spending from customers of luxury hotels. When you look at outlets and lounge revenue for the third quarter at our luxury hotels. Now this excludes Greater China for some of the reasons we discussed earlier. But if you look at our global luxury portfolio ex-China, we actually saw spending in outlets and balances in the luxury portfolio, up 2%, which was the same increase we saw a quarter ago. So we'll continue to watch it, but that's pretty encouraging for us. Lizzie Dove : Got it. That's helpful. And then going back to the fee side of things, you mentioned the renovation headwind and the timing of the residential branding fees. As you move into 2025, is that expected to kind of normalize? Will those renovations be kind of broadly complete? Just curious how we should think about the kind of cadence there? Leeny Oberg : Well, you have to know. Yes, on the ones that are finishing up, but we've always got hotels going under renovation. But -- and we obviously will be carefully looking at that as we go through the budgeting process and looking at our fee guidance for next year. I don't expect Lizzie that it would impact things meaningfully. Lizzie Dove : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Chad Beynon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Tony, you mentioned that the convention business or the pacing for '25 looks pretty good in terms of room nights and ADR. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more. Are you seeing the same companies just kind of renew or add another convention or are you actually seeing growth in some of the businesses or industries that hadn't come back fully from a group standpoint? Thanks. Anthony Capuano : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chad. I would say both. We are seeing companies who have been traveling and meeting, building out their calendar of meetings. And we are seeing some of our partners who perhaps were on pause starting to schedule. And I think some of that is driven by -- I mean this is a wonderful problem to have, but the availability of dates and space. Particularly if you're a larger group, you're having to peer further and further into the future to find dates and space to accommodate those meetings. Chad Beynon : Great. Thank you. And then secondly, just on City Express. I know that you began offering the product in North America, and we heard from one of your competitors that they were seeing some deletions in those areas. So it's certainly a good area for conversion or new build. But could you talk about any initial demand for this product here in the U.S. Thank you. Anthony Capuano : Yeah. The demand is quite strong. We had people banging on the door saying, would you please announce the name so we can start signing deals. And we're already seeing franchise applications come in. We're seeing deals get approved, We think, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening remarks, we hope to open the first couple in the next couple of months. So exactly what we would have expected. We're seeing strong interest from both our strong portfolio of existing franchise partners. And I think our entry into the mid-scale gives us an opportunity to tap into a group of franchisees who perhaps we've not grown with in the past. Chad Beynon : Appreciate it. Thank you. Anthony Capuano : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Conor Cunningham : Hi, everyone. Thank you. There's a lot of noise, obviously, with the corporate travel from the election, and I think there was some calendar noise in October. But if you could just strip back a lot of those onetime items like what's your general sense of overall corporate travel spend? It seems like it's simply positive and continue to kind of grind up. But just any thoughts there would be helpful. Anthony Capuano : Yes. I mean grind is not a bad work, but it's slow and steady in the last number of quarters, as we've talked about in each of the calls, we are encouraged by virtue of the fact that we continue to see RevPAR growth quarter-over-quarter in the business transient segment. And to me, one of the most encouraging facets of that recovery is on the big corporates. It's been several years since we already got back to above pandemic levels of travel from the small- and medium-sized companies, but the continued growth and the continued return to the road by the big corporates is an encouraging facet of the recovery. Conor Cunningham : Okay. And then maybe the 219 million members, I think you mentioned on Bonvoy, what\u2019s the direct contribution now or what's OTA and just any thoughts there? Thank you. Leeny Oberg : Yeah. So OTA is quite steady. So direct bookings are still in the low 70%, and that\u2019s really quite consistent. And I would say, kind of, you can say, close to 40% overall are digital. So that part, consistent, the OTA days 12% to 13% has also been quite consistent. The place that has had at the margin slightly higher, has been the GDS, which is really more of a reflection of continued return of the larger corporations doing their bookings. But could I say otherwise, great continued movement from the phone and in person to digital, but also overall, a very steady sort of low 70%s for direct bookings. Conor Cunningham : Appreciate. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Tony Capuano for closing remarks. Anthony Capuano : Great. Well, again, thank you for your interest in Marriott. Thanks for your questions today. For a whole host of reasons, it\u2019s going to be a busy week for all of us, but we appreciate your interest, and we\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : This does conclude the Marriott International third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Jackie McConagha, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Jackie McConagha : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott's  Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Development; and Pilar Fernandez, our new Senior Director of Investor Relations. . Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts that are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy, average daily rate and property level revenue comments reflect system-wide constant currency result or comparable hotels and all changes refer to year-over-year changes for the comparable period. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony. Anthony Capuano : Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Marriott  had excellent results in 2024, reflecting continued robust demand for customers, owners and franchisees for our more than 30 brands. For the full year, we achieved net rooms growth of 6.8% and global RevPAR rose over 4%. We ended the year on a high note with fourth quarter worldwide RevPAR increasing 5%. ADR rose 3%, and occupancy increased over 1 percentage point. All of our regions produced better RevPAR growth than we had previously expected, with strength across all of our customer segments. The U.S. and Canada saw its best quarterly RevPAR growth for the year with fourth quarter RevPAR rising over 4%, primarily driven by a higher ADR. The drop in occupancy around November's U.S. selection was not as severe as we had anticipated with demand rebounding quickly after the election. International RevPAR rose over 7% in the quarter, driven by a 4% rise in ADR and a 2 percentage point gain in occupancy. APAP RevPAR increased 12.5%, led by strong growth in Japan, India and Thailand and aided by strong cross-border demand, especially from Greater China. RevPAR in the EMEA region rose 8%, with broad-based growth across the region led by strong leisure demand. RevPAR in Greater China declined 2% better than prior expectations as the region benefited from the recent expanded visa-free transit policy and better-than-anticipated demand across multiple holidays and citywide events. By region, RevPAR growth was positive in Tier 1 cities, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, while Hainan Island again saw the largest RevPAR decline. Hainan was again impacted by weak domestic leisure demand as wealthier travelers continue to vacation across other parts of the region. However, Hainan did see nice sequential improvement with RevPAR down 16% in the quarter compared to down 24% in Q3. Turning to trends by customer segment, leisure, which comprises the largest portion of global room nights at 44% had its strongest RevPAR growth quarter of the year and was the fastest growing of our customer segments. Fourth quarter leisure RevPAR was 6% globally and 4% in the U.S. and Canada, driven by gains in both room nights and ADR with strength across all tiers from luxury to select service. Business transient contributed 33% of global room nights in the fourth quarter. Solid gains in ADR drove business transient RevPAR up 3% globally and up 4% in the U.S. and Canada. Group RevPAR, which comprised 23% of room nights rose 3% in the quarter. As expected, this was group's lowest growth quarter of the year due to fewer group events in the U.S. around November's election and a decline in group RevPAR in Greater China. Looking at full year 2024, all customer segments experienced solid RevPAR growth on a global basis. Group increased an impressive 8% and leisure and business transient rising 3%, respectively. As Leeny will discuss during her remarks, we are pleased with the solid momentum we have in our business as we start off 2025. At the end of 2024, global group revenues were pacing up 6% for 2025 and 10% for 2026 on increases in both room nights and average daily rate. Shifting to development, 2024 was another terrific year. Net rooms grew 6.8%, helped by the addition of around 38,000 rooms from our agreement with MGM and approximately 9,000 rooms from Sander. Conversions were again a large driver of growth in 2024, contributing about 1/3 of our signings and over half of our openings. Our industry-leading global lodging portfolio now goes over 1.7 million rooms across 144 countries and territories.  With a record of over 1,200 deals signed last year, we ended the year with over 577,000 rooms in our pipeline. In the U.S. and Canada, our largest market, we led the industry in growth room additions with around 1/3 of all rooms opened during the year flying one of Marriott's flags. While financing in the U.S. remains particularly challenging for new construction, we also had the leading share of new build construction starts in 2024 as banks have shown preference for deals associated with our strong brands and an experienced player like Marriott. During the year, we also meaningfully expanded the breadth and depth of our portfolio across customer tiers, from luxury to mid-scale and across both traditional and alternative lodging product offerings. We continue to have strong owner interest in all of our mid-scale brands, given their [ compelling ] brand design, the power of our revenue engines and their simple bundled affiliation costs, which we believe were the lowest in the industry. At the end of the year, we had over 300 open and pipeline Four Points Flex, Studio Res and City Express by Marriott properties, just 1.5 years after entering the mid-scale tier. We also continue to expand our incredible luxury portfolio with the opening of several notable hotels, including the St. Regis on the Bund in Shanghai and Ws in Prague and Sao Paulo. In the nontraditional lodging space, in December, we announced our plan to launch an outdoor-focused collection, which will be anchored by founding deals with postcard cabins and trail 2 innovative outdoor hospitality brands. Ellman, the second luxury super yacht in the Ritz-Carlton Yacht collection had its maiden voyage in the Mediterranean last September, our third super yacht Luminare is expected to set sale this summer. with itineraries in the Mediterranean, Asia, Alaska and Canada. Our focus on offering fantastic travel experiences for every trip purpose is key to ensuring that Marriott Bonvoy remains the industry's leading travel platform. We added over 31 million new members to our loyalty program last year, growing to nearly 228 million members at year-end.  Bonvoy member penetration of room nights achieved historic size in the fourth quarter at 73% in the U.S. and 66% globally. As we grow that member base and our global portfolio and add travel adjacent products and collaborations like our 33 co-brand credit cards and tie-ups with partners like Uber and Starbucks, we are deepening engagement with our members and capturing more of our customers' share of wallet. Driven by a strong increase in global card spend, our co-brand credit card fees rose nearly 10% last year. Our digital channels and mobile in particular, remain key drivers of direct clocking at a lower cost to our owners. In 2024, Marriott Bonvoy app downloads rose nearly 30% year-over-year. We're excited about enhancing the customer experience across all our digital channels through the multiyear digital transformation we have underway that we expect to begin rolling out a little later this year. Before I turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail, I want to thank our teams around the world for their hard work and dedication and for making Marriott a place where innovation and excellence [indiscernible]. Leeny? Kathleen Oberg : Thank you, Tony. I'll start by reviewing our solid financial performance. Fourth quarter total gross fee revenues grew 7% to $1.3 billion, primarily due to higher RevPAR, room additions, 13% increase in credit card fees and a near doubling of residential branding fees. Incentive management fees are IMF decreased year-over-year as strength in APAC was offset by declines in Greater China and in the U.S. and Canada. The decline in the U.S. and Canada was primarily driven by lower fees in [ Maui ] given the timing of fee recognition in the prior year. G&A declined 12% year-over-year to $289 million, primarily due to lower administrative bad debt and litigation expenses. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 7% to $1.29 billion. At the hotel level, profit margins at our worldwide managed hotels rose 110 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points for the year helped by continued productivity improvements. We are also pleased that our guest surveys indicated that customer satisfaction continued to rise with our 2024 intent to recommend scores increasing in every one of our regions. For the full year, gross fees and adjusted EBITDA both increased 7%. We were pleased that with the power of our strong cash-generating asset-light business model and our disciplined investment, we returned over $4.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. I'll now talk about our 2025 expectations, starting with net rooms growth. With our industry-leading pipeline and strong momentum in conversions, we expect net rooms growth of 4% to 5%. Conversions, of course, can enter the system quickly. Conversions that were added to our system in 2024 have been in the pipeline for 14 months on average and nearly 20% of conversions opened so quickly, they were not in any quarter end pipeline number. Over the 3-year period from year-end '22 to year-end '25, we continue to expect net rooms to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 5.5% we discussed at our 2023 Investor Meeting. For full year '25, we expect global RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%.  With the exception of Greater China, RevPAR growth in international regions, though continuing to normalize is again expected to be higher than in the U.S. and Canada. We currently anticipate RevPAR in Greater China to be roughly flat year-over-year. As Tony discussed, we're off to a great start with January RevPAR rising 6% globally. The sensitivity of 1 percentage point change in full year 2025 RevPAR versus 2024 could be around $50 million to $60 million of RevPAR-related fees and $5 billion in owned leased profits. For the full year, gross fees could rise 4% to 6% to around $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. Co-brand credit card fee growth could be a couple of hundred basis points lower than the nearly 10% growth in '24, primarily due to the normalization of international card fee growth. Residential branding fees could decline nearly 50%, solely due to the timing of unit sales. While timeshare fees as usual are expected to be relatively in line with the prior year at around $110 million. FX is expected to negatively impact gross fees by roughly $25 million. Owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, is expected to total $345 million to $355 million, relatively in line with 2024's results. somewhat impacted by a larger number of renovations at our owned and leased hotels. 2025 G&A expense is anticipated to decline 8% to 10% to $965 million to $985 million. This decline is the result of the expected $80 million to $90 million of above property savings from our enterprise-wide initiative to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency across the company. As we previously noted, this process should also yield cost savings to our owners and franchisees. In December, we announced that we would reduce our loyalty charge-out rates by roughly 5%. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 6% and 9% to roughly $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion. Full year adjusted diluted EPS could total $9.82 to $10.19. EPS growth will be impacted by an expected effective tax rate of around 26%, compared to under 25% in 2024, reflecting certain international tax rate changes. Our underlying core cash tax rate is anticipated to remain in the low 20s percent range. For the first quarter, global RevPAR could increase 3% to 4%, benefiting from Easter shifting from March to April this year as well as January's inauguration and the Super Bowl in New Orleans benefiting the U.S. and Canada. First quarter gross fees could increase 2% to 3.5%. Solid growth in management and franchise fees are expected to be partially offset by a decline in IMS partly due to a decline in Greater China, given their strong first quarter a year ago as well as certain properties in the U.S. and Canada undergoing renovations. First quarter owned, leased and other revenue net of expenses of around $55 million is expected to decline year-over-year, primarily due to the elegant portfolio undergoing renovations as well as the timing of termination fees. We expect $1 billion to $1.1 billion of investment spending in 2025. There are 3 major areas of expected spending that are each around 1/3 of this total. The first bucket is another year of higher than historical investment in technology. Over half of this investment is associated with the multiyear transformation of our property management, reservations and loyalty systems, the overwhelming portion of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. The second bucket is spending for our owned lease portfolio. This spending is expected to be above historical levels in '25 with about half of the expected investment driven by the completion of renovations on the elegant portfolio in Barbados as well as renovations on a handful of other hotels. We expect to sell the elegant portfolio after renovations are complete, subject to long-term contract to remain in our system. The last bucket is expected investment in our contracts, largely for new units as we continue to expand our global portfolio. Our capital allocation philosophy has not changed.  We're committed to our investment-grade rating and investing in growth that's accretive to shareholder value. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and a modest cash dividend, which has risen meaningfully over time. In 2025, we expect another year of strong capital returns of approximately $4 billion. Full guidance assumptions and details for the first quarter and the full year are in the press release. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Tony, Leeny, I was hoping you could just update us on your cost kind of transformation and efficiency program, if you could. Obviously, this is sort of a unique initiative to Marriott. What did you learn out of that? What areas have been a focus on? We've heard a little bit about select service management. And sort of what's been some of the response from the ownership community and internally? Anthony Capuano : Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Shaun. It's obviously a little early the resultant impact to our org structure and model are really just -- have just been put in place. So I think most of my responses are going to be a little more qualitative where I will tell you internally, I think there is energy across the enterprise, about how streamlined our decision-making will be as a result of this, particularly in the field. And I have heard parallel enthusiasm from the owner and franchisee community.  Their ability to engage with the continent teams who they deal with each and every day. They can already feel the empowerment in the continents. And I think they have high hopes for how that will improve the relationship we have with the owner and franchisee community. Shaun Kelley : And then maybe, Leeny, just as a quick follow-up, the investment spending buckets are a bit higher than what was outlined kind of back at the Analyst Day a couple of years -- 18 months ago or so. Could you just expand on that a little bit, sort of what's kind of a little different than maybe your expectations a little while ago? And then kind of back to the capital recycling point, when do you expect to get some of that, especially that technology spending back? Or when should we see that level off or start to decline? Kathleen Oberg : Yes. Yes. Sure, Shaun. When I outlined those 3, as I pointed out, in the 1/3 that is largely around investing in our owned leased properties. That is higher than normal because, as I pointed out, our investment in the Barbados properties, which will be largely this year and should be completed at the end of this year, and then that is towards $100 million of that overall amount. And then you've also got a handful of a bit larger than normal renovations in leased properties. And I would say those are also not ones that you should continue to expect on a normal run rate basis. So that's part of it, getting you down to the $800 million to $900 million that we do believe is the appropriate kind of post '25 and post the transformational tech investing that we're doing levels. As we've talked about, both in '24 and '25, we got higher than typical tech investments in the system that we do expect to start rolling out later in '25. When you think about how those will be paid back by the owners, I think one of the things you probably noticed in our reimbursed depreciation calculation for adjusted EBITDA in '25 is this level that is a bit higher. And that again reflects exactly your question about the normal charges going to the owners reflecting kind of the repayment of some of these CapEx expenditures. So I think you'll see it over the next several years, as we move into implementing this throughout the system. So again, the normal levels that we talked about, I think, are still the right ones for your longer-term model. Operator : We'll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Charles Scholes : Great. What do you feel is your appetite for additional tuck-in acquisitions this coming year? Or would you see this year more as a Europe, should we say, digestion of previous acquisitions? And then I have a follow-up question. Anthony Capuano : Sure. So just as Leeny talked about our capital allocation philosophy remaining intact. I would say the same thing in response to your question. We obviously, if you look at our history over the last decade or so, when we have identified a gap either in our brand portfolio or in our geographic footprint that we thought could be more effectively filled through tuck-in acquisition. We've done that. In some instances, we filled those gaps through the development of organic platforms. And we'll continue to look at both the breadth of the brand portfolio and our expanding global footprint. And if we think there's an opportunity to fill those gaps, we will certainly consider a tuck-in acquisition, but that will apply the same sort of rigor in terms of evaluating the economics. But you should certainly assume going forward, the vast, vast majority of our range growth will be organic growth. Charles Scholes : Okay. And then my follow-up question. I've been reading some news articles very recently regarding Canadian and Mexican travelers canceling reservations or pulling back their travel plans, and this is related to recent political tensions related to tariffs, et cetera. Is that something that you are seeing as well in your reservations and bookings from these customers from these 2 regions? Kathleen Oberg : Yes. Sure. Yes, it would be too soon to say that we're seeing anything of note. Just as a reminder,  when you look overall, the U.S. and Canada is overwhelmingly driven by domestic travelers. The 2 largest international markets of travelers coming to the U.S. are from Canada and Mexico, but they make up really a very small part overall, call it, 1% to 2% of our nights in the U.S. So we'll see over time, but certainly too early to say and overwhelmingly a very small part of our business in the U.S. Operator : We'll take our next question from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Conor Cunningham : So there's been -- just going back to the whole -- the tech migration. Can you just -- it seems like you're going to be down with that at year end. Can you just talk about how that's going to be implemented. And then what that actually means for your business going forward? I assume it's going to be a benefit to the 2026. So if you could just talk about that a little bit more, that would be helpful. Anthony Capuano : Sure. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, elements of that tech transformation will start to roll out later this year. We've talked about this a bit in the past. We think there are far-reaching impacts to this transformation to all the constituents we serve.  Starting with Marriott Associates, the simplicity and the streamlined training, we think will be a big advantage as we go out there and try to attract best-in-class talent, especially from a next-generation workforce. For our guests, we think the transformation will create tremendous capacity at the hotel level so that our associates can better engage the guests in person. It will also meaningfully help our call agents and their ability to help with broader travel planning questions. And then we think for the owners really advantages or opportunities both on the revenue and expense side. Certainly, on the expense side, we expect there to be enhanced efficiency. But one of the things that our older community is most excited about, there are a wide range of products and services that we offer our guests every day beyond guest rooms, food and beverage, spa, golf, et cetera. the ease with which a guest can shop across all of those categories on our new reservations platform, we believe represents meaningful revenue upside for our owners. Kathleen Oberg : And given the only thing I would add is -- just one more thing to add is that given the size scale of this transformation, which is, as you heard, involves our reservations, our property management systems and our loyalty program. This is going to be something that will take a number of quarters to roll out around the world. So you should expect this over the next couple of years or so. . Conor Cunningham : Okay. And then on the composition of RevPAR, can you just talk about ADRs versus occupancy. Obviously, you saw a nice cadence in the fourth quarter. But just curious on how you're thinking about it for 2025 in general and just to be a level set around that thought that would be great. Kathleen Oberg : Yes. So the way I think about it is, as you've heard, we've had in the full year this year, kind of grow with the was the big winner, up 8% for the full year with BT and leisure, both also very strong. When I think about '25,  I would say, [indiscernible] group with the pace that's up right now of 6% for 2025, that, that will likely be the leader in the clubhouse for RevPAR with BT continuing to be sturdy in this macroeconomic environment in the low single digits and probably leisure in the flat to slightly up. And I would say overwhelmingly like ADR driven, we do expect a little bit of occupancy gains as well. But when I compare it to this year, I would say it's going to be more -- we would expect it to be more heavily weighted towards ADR in '25. Operator : We'll take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Richard Clarke : I appreciate you gave some of this color for the first quarter. But just on the full year basis, RevPAR plus net unit growth is 7.5%. It sounds like you're going to grow the non-RevPAR fees a bit above that, but you're getting to gross fee growth of only around 5%. So what's the bridge we should think about to get down to that 5% there? Kathleen Oberg : Sure. As you probably heard in my comments, there are a couple elements impacting fees that are not necessarily repeated every year. I'd say the first one is FX, which is a headwind for us of about $25 million then the other is lower residential brand fees, and that could be as much as almost 15% reduction next year. Part of that is because they were so particularly strong in closings this year. We do expect, for example, by the time you get to '26, we'd expect them to pop back up. This is all around when these buildings are built and the units are closed so that the sales can occur and the fees recognized. So those fees tend to be fairly lumpy. . And then the last thing I'll point out is that you do have IMS really only changing slightly next year, and that is a function of 2 things. One is obviously greater China continues to have headwinds on the RevPAR front and their Q1 is particularly challenging because in Q1 of '24, they had a 6% our RevPAR growth quarter.  So for the full year in '25, I would expect to see their IMF decline. And then the U.S. and Canada, we've got some renovations going on that are going to also impact their IMFs in '25. And you put that together, and that's where you'll see the overall fee growth perhaps slightly lower than you might have expected given our strong rooms growth and RevPAR. Richard Clarke : Maybe just a follow-up on that then. I guess at your CMD, you guided to non-RevPAR fees growing 12% across 2024 and 2025. Where do you actually expect that to come out across those 2 years? Maybe I think I interpret it as credit card growth, but all in, what do the non-RevPAR fees grow at across '24 and '25... Kathleen Oberg : Yes. It's really -- I think there are lots of moving parts in there. I think the biggest drivers are the ones that I mentioned, which credit card fees being a couple of hundred basis points lower growth than this year. And then obviously, residential branding fees dropping from the $80 million this year to likely roughly half and then timeshare fees being essentially flat. Those are the 3 big drivers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Farley : Just circling back to your unit growth guide for the year. Roughly what percent of that are you expecting to come from conversions versus new construction? Kathleen Oberg : So I think as you've seen this year, particularly high this year, Rob, and as we were able to fold in the MGM Sonder rooms. So it was over half. I think  this year's signs at 34% reflects how I think you could think about it going forward, which that clearly could be 30% to 40% coming from conversions in our openings in '25. Robin Farley : Okay. And maybe just one final question. On the 1/3 of the capital spend that's for contract investments for new units. Are those -- is that a mix of that key money, some loans, some equity slivers sort of how should we think about if it's showing up in capital spend that's probably not a loan that you get back from a hotel owner? Or how should we think about the return on that? Anthony Capuano : Sure. So Robin, as you point out, we've got lots of financial tools in our toolbox for those deals that we think will provide outsized volumes of fees. Here in the U.S. and Canada, the competitive landscape has really shifted towards key money being the tool of preference in a lot of ways. As we look at trends in key money, we are seeing a bit more key money required across more tiers, meaning occasionally, we're seeing it used in lower chain scales, which is a bit of a new development. Given our rapidly growing scale, we saw slightly less key money used per deal, which I think is interesting if you compare 2019 to 2024. The absolute volume of dollars kind of grows as our system grows dramatically, but key money investment per deal is [Audio Gap] gallon compared to where we were back prepandemic. Kathleen Oberg : And Robin, when you think about the makeup, I would think about investments in growth to be overwhelmingly key money. We do have obviously debt service guarantees, operating profit guarantees. But when you think about the broad brush of it, that's going to be a relatively smaller amount. We do, from time to time, we'll do a [indiscernible] loan into a deal which is recyclable, and you've actually seen some of that recycling going on this year as we get that money back. But I think the biggest component of that investment is in the form of key money. . Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : There's been a number of kind of puts and takes that people have been asking about regarding the September Analyst Day back in 2023. And I guess if you could zoom out to compare kind of the 2025 outlook versus then what perhaps surprised to the upside? What's been a bit more of a challenge? And what do you think all these puts and takes mean for the trajectory of EBITDA and free cash flow as we think about the longer-term growth potential? Kathleen Oberg : Yes, I think -- thanks for the question. I think when you get the classic question that I know we are often asked is around this equation, around rooms growth and RevPAR. And as you can tell, this year, with the midpoint of the guidance that we've given in '25 being around 7.5% to 8% that kind of fits pretty squarely in this view of RevPAR and rooms growth. I think we see a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow and think about the pace of that with the work that we've been doing over the past year, as Tony described about being as efficient and effective as we can be for opportunities to improve on that. I think the basic equation that we laid out in September of '23 has held up very, very well. You have had a few puts and takes relative to things like FX and kind of what's going on with RevPAR in certain parts of the world. But I think overwhelmingly, the equation has worked really well. And when you think about the capital return and the growth in EBITDA that we see for many years to come, it's very robust. Anthony Capuano : And the only thing I would add, Stephen, you'll recall at that Investor Day was the first time we maybe zoomed in a little on thinking about net unit growth on a CAGR basis rather than a specific point in time. And since the time of that Investor Day, there have been some instances that underscore the importance from our perspective of looking at it over a multiyear basis, the shift in timing of MGM maybe being most relevant illustration. But we continue to feel really confident in our ability to deliver the 5% to 5.5% CAGR that we laid out on the Investor Day. Kathleen Oberg : The last thing I'll mention is just a reflection that on that day when we talked about a tax rate, we gave one that was over the entire 3-year period. And as you heard me describe in '25, we had seen with some jurisdictional tax rate changes in certain parts of the world that when we look at '25. And frankly, from what we can tell, probably a view of how you should think about it going forward is that  26% -- roughly 26% effective tax rate is the updated one as compared to what we talked about in September of '23. And then obviously, RevPAR has been excellent. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : A lot of talk about key money. Can you just sort of walk us around the rest of the terms as you're seeing them in the market, right? If key money, and I heard correctly, is starting to become more of a bigger button to do the return shrink? Does the length of the contracts get longer? How does that all sort of fit together compared to where it would have, say, 5 years ago? Anthony Capuano : Yes. I mean I think, David, it's a good question. And I'm going to probably repeat myself a bit. The fundamental [indiscernible] we have around dealmaking remains consistent. We believe the best model for Marriott is to do long-term stable contracts. We consider using the company's balance sheet in deals where we believe the use of those capital tools will drive outsized fees. And so it's not a circumstance where we're getting -- the castle is getting attacked on all 4 walls, meaning we're not seeing deals where we're making a key money contribution being forced to do shorter terms, being forced to deviate materially from the sorts of base and incentive fees or franchise fees that we've established. David Katz : Right. So at the end of the day, it feels like it's become just a bit more competitive, but you feel like you're steadfast in the structure of what those management contracts are? Kathleen Oberg : So I'll just add a couple of numbers to help on this, David. When I think about the amount of money that we're going to put out the door in cash for key money in '25. It's not materially different than '24. And we have talked before about getting a premium in net present value on contracts where we use key money and there continues to be a good premium for the deals that involve key money compared to deals that don't involve key money. So I think it's -- the best way to think about it is the way Tony described, which is that it's a tool in the toolbox and owners and franchisees use these various tools in a variety of ways. Sometimes it's a fee ramp. Sometimes, it's how we're thinking about how we participate in renovation, et cetera. But I think overall, it is -- we continue to see the contracts coming in with very, very strong returns on invested capital. Anthony Capuano : And David, the last point I would make on key money, while I mentioned in the first part of my response that we are seeing it leak into some of the lower quality tiers. Occasionally, it is much more prevalent in the highest value tiers, upper upscale and luxury. And that represents 40% of our pipeline. And so our shareholders should want us to be holding those tools largely for those most valuable opportunities. And I think our focus on leading in those tiers is reflected in nearly or over 40% of the pipeline being in those 2 quality tiers. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : I want to drill in on the leisure commentary, Tony, which sounded like it was the big surprise for you in the fourth quarter. And yet, the commentary about the full year guide was sort of flat to up leaning. And so just kind of curious, I wouldn't have thought that the first through third quarter comps were any tougher than the fourth quarter '23, but maybe is it just sort of conservatism because there's not a ton of visibility on that business? Or what are you kind of seeing in that segment? Anthony Capuano : Yes. I mean I think there's a little bit of everything you identified. The booking windows are still relatively short kind of sub 3 weeks. And so the ability to predict there, maybe we don't have as much visibility as we might like or we've had historically. But we looked at those fourth quarter numbers as really encouraging. I mean there have been many predictions of the end of the run on leisure and understandably so. I mean, since '19, you've seen a [ 40% ] improvement in leisure RevPAR. And so to me, I think the fourth quarter numbers are reflective that there are still some legs in leisure and the guidance that Leeny walked you through is reflective of an expectation that while we'll continue to see growth, it's kind of normalizing a bit. Kathleen Oberg : I'll just add, to your point. It was encouraging to see that our RevPAR at our luxury and resort hotels, RevPAR in Q4 grew at 6%. And obviously, that's helped by both room and BT and also this leisure that we saw. I think as Tony talked about it being a little bit harder to predict, I would point to just the overall macroeconomic picture that will always be a huge element to how leisure business developed at our hotels, and we'll all be watching that very closely. Brandt Montour : Okay. And then, Tony, I have a question about the other side of the key money coin. Just sort of the availability of capital is something you've talked a lot about at panels and conferences and things. I mean rates are high, but they've been high for a while. It's the availability of capital, which is the problem, and that's sort of a separate issue. Do you think there's anything in the horizon that could sort of unlock that? I mean do you have to see deregulation from the sort of -- within capital markets? Or is it just sort of a getting past the hangover of the post-COVID office loan issues that are still a problem for some regional banks. What do you think is sort of the factors that could or should alleviate over time? Are you optimistic about that for '25? Anthony Capuano : Yes, there is certainly a regulatory element here. The irony is when we talk to lenders, often, the hospitality loans in their commercial real estate portfolios are the best-performing sector. And so there -- if they have reluctance to lend on new construction,  it has little to do with the fundamentals of hospitality projects and much more to do with unknown about what Basel III or other regulatory requirements might be imposed upon them. . I think Lenny talked about this earlier. We are seeing an uptick in construction starts not back to pre-pandemic levels to be sure, but that's encouraging. And the other thing I felt really encouraging, and I mentioned this in my opening remarks. Largely, this is a U.S. and Canada issue, although there's a bit of it in Europe as well. But in the U.S. and Canada, we had a leading share of the new build construction starts out there, which would suggest that the lenders that are active in lending for new build, they are using the same criteria they've always used. They're looking at the track record of the developer and they're looking at the affiliation with the right brand family. And I think that speaks really well to our ability to over-index in terms of capturing the new construction originations that are out there. But our sense is barring some significant regulatory change, slow and steady improvement in the lending [indiscernible]. Operator : We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth : Can you just remind us your view regarding how recovered business transient is both from a volume and a revenue basis. And then as you're thinking about the year, any deeper insights you can offer on how you see that recovering either from a geographic or industry vertical perspective? Kathleen Oberg : Yes. So I'll start and Tony can follow up with anything he's got. First of all, business transient has recovered to 2019 levels. just in a little bit different form -- the small- and medium-sized businesses came back faster than the largest corporates when you think about the large companies that have had more load work since COVID, et cetera. You still see their nights meaningfully behind 2019 levels, although I will say that some other of those large corporates like in the financing sector of the economy, they are actually back to more than recovered. So overall, the business has recovered. You have seen more growth in leisure as compared to the BT sector. One thing I thought was interesting when I looked at overall nights of the week, for example, you are seeing overall occupancy of our global system as being higher than 2019 levels. But Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are still the nights whose occupancy has not recovered while the other nights of the week are actually higher occupancy than we had pre-COVID. So we continue to see bid by bit additional recovery in those large corporates during the year, and we expect that to continue into '25, but they are still not back to the level of 2019, while BT overall is. Duane Pfennigwerth : And then maybe just for a follow-up, maybe you could speak to it at a high level. Can you just remind us the structure of your co-brand relationships. Are those global in nature? Are they country specific? And when would we see an opportunity for a significant renewal or extension? Anthony Capuano : Yes. So the -- our 2 biggest relationships are with JPMorgan Chase and American Express, which is largely a domestic set of relationships around the world. We tend to partner with local banks. We've got 11 of those relationships and continue to evaluate other countries where it might make sense to establish a local relationship. We're in great shape as evidenced by the numbers on growth that Leeny shared, and we're not ready to really talk about when we might enter into a renewal. Kathleen Oberg : They're multiyear agreements. So there is not a particular pressure on them, but always in discussions. . Operator : We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Bennett Rose : I wanted to ask you, you mentioned investing in the elegant portfolio in Barbados and then looking to sell that. Are you actively seeking investors now or potential buyers? And I was just wondering if are there challenges to selling an all-inclusive portfolio that might be unique to that sector or that region of the world. I was just wondering if you could maybe just talk about your sort of time line there a little bit. Kathleen Oberg : Yes, sure. I wouldn't have any particular expectations. I think given COVID and what would not be surprising to you and some supply chain challenges related to that following COVID. We've got all the plans in place. We're executing. Some of it was done in '24, and we're really going to get the vast majority completed in '25. So that would be kind of the normal pathway for us to complete that and then execute the sale where you're not in a position where somebody is having to kind of do a 1/4 or a 1/3 of the renovation themselves. It makes it for a nice clean sale of the hotels. Nothing in particular at this point to talk about the marketing process for that. Obviously, as you've seen us do, Smedes, over time, we're constantly evaluating market opportunities, buyer opportunities and thinking about when is the appropriate time to sell it. Anthony Capuano : And the only thing I would add, Smedes, the part of your question was any particular concerns. I think as we watch the competitive landscape as we watch the transaction market, you are seeing more and more institutional investment dollars going into the all-inclusive space. And I think that bodes well when we're ready to recycle this cap. Kathleen Oberg : And we have -- frankly, since we have acquired it, the performance has been excellent of those hotels. It is a wonderful addition for us for our global Bonvoy traveler. We have not had a presence in Barbados before. So it's been a really wonderful set of hotels to add to the portfolio. It's done quite well. Bennett Rose : Great. And then just one small one, but did you complete the purchase of the Chicago Sheraton in the quarter? And is that would be included in your owned and leased outlook, I guess, going forward? Anthony Capuano : Yes, we did. So we are the proud owners of the Sheraton Chicago and our value is performing well. We think it will be a good cash flow generator in the owned leased line. and we will embark on an evaluation of the assets capital needs. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets. Unknown Analyst : Maybe just going back to key money. I was curious to say from a little bit of a different perspective, if there was an opportunity to actually be more aggressive on that front given that it's accretive to growth, and you have such a strong cost of capital. Maybe what are some of the puts and takes on that front from your point of view? Anthony Capuano : Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to our Head of Development here in a minute. Again, at the risk of repeating myself, key-money is a valuable tool in the right circumstances from our perspective. we are not anxious to go buy growth at any cost. We use the same discipline and the same evaluation of the value creation of each individual transaction. Marriott investment, whether it's key money or one of the other tools we have available is obviously incorporated into that calculation. And to the extent we see opportunities for deals that will generate higher than typical fees. We are certainly not shy about using that tool, but it's got to be through that disciplined lens. . Operator : We'll take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Tony, at the outset, you talked about continued strength in '24 with the Bonvoy members. Can you just kind of touch on where you're seeing the growth? Or maybe a particular age or region and if this saw a nice benefit from the MGM deal? Anthony Capuano : Yes, of course, Chad. The good news is we're seeing it everywhere. The continent teams around the world, the property teams around the world have really embraced our efforts to continue to add high-value members to the program. I think we talked in my prepared remarks about the rapid progress we've made in our entry into the mid-scale tier. My view is that creates a great opportunity to open the aperture and bring in younger Bonvoy members, maybe less frequent [ those ] that are just starting their -- the evolution of their travel journey. So I think that's a big opportunity for us. But it's really around the globe where we're seeing those opportunities. We'll continue to push at the property level in '25. And I think you'll see a renewed focus on leveraging some of the amazing partners we have like Starbucks and MGM to try to continue to grow the platform. Chad Beynon : And then lastly, just in terms of the China recovery curve. Can you talk about anything that you saw maybe outside of the Tier 1 cities in China with respect to maybe Chinese New Year, some of the near-term data points, if you're starting to see a recovery from those lower tier provinces or regions in China and maybe if stimulus would be the big catalyst to get that going? Anthony Capuano : Yes, I think we all hope that, but it's really too soon to say. As you heard in Leeny's remarks, while we're quite encouraged by the January performance. We've also got to temper that enthusiasm a little bit because some of that is a byproduct of the timing of Chinese New Year. So we'll continue to watch. We are seeing some very small encouraging signs. The fact that the Tier 1 cities were positive is a good sign.  The fact that sequentially, the weakness in [ INAV ] is improving, albeit not anywhere close where we'd like it to be is encouraging. We've seen some stimulus programs coming out of the central government. None of which to date, at least, we believe will have a material impact on demand patterns or for that matter on the property sector. But long term, we continue to be really bullish on Greater China. It's quite interesting to us that even in the face of some short-term operating weakness, we had record level of deal volume performance in 2024. And I think that's indicative of the development community's confidence long term about China growth trends. Operator : We'll take our next question from Lizzie Dove with Goldman Sachs. Elizabeth Dove : I'm wondering if you can just expand on your comments around international RevPAR being higher than the U.S. You mentioned China would be flat, but anything you can share there, whether that's Middle East or Europe? I know you're lapping the Olympics, but you have Jubilee in Italy. So just any kind of color you can give around that? Kathleen Oberg : Well, obviously, first of all, basics on RevPAR are very much tied to GDP. And you've got -- in some markets around the world, I'll point out India as an example, you've got meaningfully faster growth in GDP, and those are areas where our rooms are growing at double-digit rates. So there's obviously benefits like that. You've also seen when we talk about cross-border travel, the strong dollar has been very encouraging for travelers to be going overseas. I think in particular, when you think about Europe and Japan, for example, we've seen really outstanding demand. We had stronger percentage of cross-border guests at our hotels than pre-COVID this year. And I think trends like that continue to emphasize the fact that they could be on the higher end of the RevPAR growth as compared to the U.S., a little bit lower. Operator : And that does conclude our allotted time for questions. I'll now turn the program back to Tony for any additional or closing remarks. Anthony Capuano : Great. Well, thank you again for your interest and your questions. As we mentioned at the outset, our teams are energized by fantastic performance in '24 and excited to welcome you in 144 countries around the world. So safe travels, and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
